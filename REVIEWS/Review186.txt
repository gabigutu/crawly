		<shortDescription>A misunderstood classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CALIGULA is a terribly misunderstood film. I believe too many people think of it as a cheap porno, and bash it due to that. "All porn is bad," right?CALIGULA was a daring film experiment incorporating big-name, established talent, and the raw energy of under ground film techniques. What results is nothing short of a fascinating product.All of the acting is very good. Malcolm McDowell plays psychotic villains so well, one can't help but think he's like that in real life. His portrayal of Gaius Caligula just drips with maniacal megalomania. The little-known Teresa Ann Savoy is convincing as Drusilla, Caligula's sister. And Peter O'Toole's Tiberius Caesar, whose diseased face is rotting away, is truly an oddity to behold...put he pulls it off well. The acting in general is all very good.The use of music is also to be noted. There are original, evocative pieces written for the film by Paul Clemente, no doubt a talented composer.While some of the photography is stilted in this film, for the most part it's gorgeous. A lot of people say the colors are "dark" and "washed out", but I think that lends to the grittiness of the film.Danilo Donati's sets are big and well designed, it kind of shocks you to see someone getting a blow job in them. They look like they belong in a run-of-the-mill Hollywood produced film. Aren't all pornos supposed to be filmed in the director's back yard?And that right there is the point of the film. To shock you; you can't believe you're seeing what you're seeing. Beyond the violence and the sex is a well written, acted, and photographed film.I have spoken!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE CLASH OF AN ARTIST AND A PERVERT: The Results Could Only Mean A Huge Disaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started out as a massive, haunting and disturbing look at the corruption of bureaucracy ended up as a mere flesh flick, consisting mainly of outtakes and only two types of opinions from the viewers; "this movie is crap" and the infamous "I love the sex in that movie! It gives an erection every time I see it." All of these travesties, and more, are a major insult to the many talents involved in this production of "Caligula." From what one can tell, it would have been an excellent film. Malcolm McDowell gives a performance of a lifetime, portraying an Emperor whose dedication to exposing the senate for what they are, a corrupt bunch of spineless bastards, ultimately leads to his descend into madness. Helen Mirren gives an interesting performance as Caligula's seductive wife, Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy is great as the cute and sweet Drusilla, the only voice of reason in the time of madness. The supporting cast is also top notch. Sire John Gielgud gives an awesome portrayal a stoic Roman aristocrat Nerva and Peter O'Toole is a true jaw dropper as Tiberius, the old emperor, a completely mad sex addict, plagued with syphilitic lesions. The rest of the supporting cast are unknown Italian actors, except for the B-movie god John Steiner, who plays the two faced Longinus, Caligula's treasurer.The much talked about sex in the film was never meant to be in any way arousing. If one looks closely, he can see that most of the nudity and sex is handled in a very clinical, unappealing fashion. Tinto Brass did an awesome job showing how the Ancient Rome was so used to perversity, that a few people romping in a corner was just not a big deal in those days. Same can be said about the gore and violence in the film. From the small hints remaining in the film, "Caligula" was well on its way to become a moody piece of paranoia, corruption and deep character study. There are some truly chilling and atmospheric moments. For example, when Caligula puts on the royal ring, you can actually see him losing soul, thanks to Malcolm McDowell's awesome facial expressions. Also, there is a haunting scene of Caligula asking the dying Nerva, who lies in a bath tub filled with blood, about the afterlife. And the humorous scenes of Caligula "judging" a land dispute between two whiny senators and one where a Senator says he would give up his life to cure Caligula's to fever, only to realize that Caligula has excepted his proposition.But sadly, none of the points I made can be seen to a naked eye. When Tinto Brass got fired, the film's producer, Bob Guccione (yes, *that* Bob Guccione), tried to splice the film together himself, although he had no idea what he was doing. What ended up was a pathetic mishmash of truncated and misplaced scenes, out takes, rehearsal footage and some dull extra sex inserts with the Penthouse Pets, shot by Bob himself after the filming has wrapped, designed simply to promote the magazine. All the important subplots and story lines were deleted, making the film lose most of its plot and meaning, the pace is ruined due to endless pauses and there are maddening zooms that are obviously just raw footage of camera operators adjusting the lens. The movie is simply unwatchable because it is mostly cut together from the blurry, shaky outtakes. In other words, Bob Guccione stole a masterpiece and turned it into his own little wet dream.Everyone who dealt with this film disowned it after seeing the finished result and rightfully so.So, next time you watch the film and notice how bad it is, don't blame the actors, Tinto Brass or Gore Vidal. Blame Bob Guccione and the botched editing.For what it could have been, I give the film a 10/10. For what it ended up, it receives a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ben-Hur of Porn: Gratuitous Sex, Violence, &amp; Weirdness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some describe CALIGULIA as "the" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.For a while it looked like it might. CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited "R" and original "Unrated" versions. And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day. In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.In a documentary that accompanies the DVD release, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best. That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.On the plus side, those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.The movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content. Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism. If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taste is relative, but pornography is REALLY relative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is funny.As pornography, this film leaves a lot to be desired. To call it such is naive and absurd, and you obviously haven't seen any REAL pornography.As a film, it leaves a lot to be desired. It lacks a number of things (dialogue, plot movement, etc) that make even a mediocre movie mediocre.As far as a complete effort, it is fantastic. The attempt to even try something like this is outrageous and to have pulled it off (pardon the pun) as much as Guccioni and the gang did is amazing.It seems as if the fact that some actual money was poured into this epic makes it bad, while something like 'Pink Flamingos' by John Waters is thought of as 'great' when it is just as likely to make a person squirm with its bad taste (again, pardon the pun and God rest Divine).I really like this movie. It is like NOTHING that has ever been made nor will there ever be anything made like it. It is all at once historical (at least as much as say, Saving Private Ryan); it is thought provoking, it is strangely erotic, it is disturbing, and lastly, it is a movie that (love it or hate it) you will NOT forget if you do decide to see it.I say see it.Rating = 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond the controversy lies a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, as with all, has good points and bad points.In general, I feel that the good ones far outweigh the bad.The film simply gives the story of the rise and death of Emperor Caligula in a very straight-forward manner. Indeed, it can be seen as shocking, but I think that this is a side-effect of it's desire to be realistic, rather than a deliberate act on the part of the film-makers.The cinematography and camera work is awful. The huge sets seem at times almost claustrophobic which is an absolute crime considering the magnificence of them. There is also too much emphasis on Caligula himself, to the detriment of revealing some important traits in other characters, making them seem somewhat shallow at times.The sex scenes are very well placed within the context of the film. I thought that only two scenes stood out as being unnecessarily overt, but for the most part, the explicitness is on the fringe of the focus of each scene, while also playing a major part in the atmosphere.Never once did I feel that any dialogue was out of place, nor did the acting strike me as being bad.By far the biggest problem with this film is the fact that the sexual content is widely advertised and therefore anticipated before viewing. This may cause people to focus dominantly on those scenes without really looking at the film as a whole. For me, it enhanced the film. Not in a particularly titillating way, but in the fact that there was no compromise during scenes of sexual acts. Roman orgies are regarded to have been extremely opulent and promiscuous - I found it refreshing to see one as it may have actually been rather than lots of fully-clothed laughing fat men pouring red wine over their faces and eating grapes while draped with female automatons.In summary, Caligula definitely has it's place in film history due to it's controversy, but if you look beyond that controversy, you should find a rather good film which neatly tells the story of how power can turn someone into a madman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it helps to be familiar with the history, Art, and literature of the Ancient Rome because "Caligula" is surprisingly truthful adaptation of the chapter about Caligula in "The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars by C. Suetonius Tranquillus, the Roman Historian. If you read the chapter dedicated to Nero, you'll be even more shocked because Nero was always fascinated by his uncle Caligula (he was a son of Caligula's sister Agrippina who later became a wife of Claudius who adopted Nero and made him the heir for the title and the power of Roman Emperor). Anyway, Nero made Caligula his role model and managed to surpass his uncle's' notorious fame.The movie is notoriously famous for the plentiful scenes of real sex, including incest, necrophilia, rape, and orgies. The movie also includes quite nasty and gruesome scenes of torture, executions, murders, and humiliations but all of the events have been documented in the historical documents that still exist.I don't think of the movie as a masterpiece or even a good movie for all of its 2.5 hours. It actually reminds the life of real Caligula. In his childhood and youth, he was adored by Roman people and especially by the army and he was a promising young man. When he grew up as a heir to the cruel and suspicious Tiberius, he had to hide his feelings and go through many humiliations in order to survive. Shrewd Tiberius said about his adopted grandson that "never humankind knew the better slave and the worse ruler than Caligula" and that he was rearing "a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world." When the young man finally received an access to the absolute power it had absolutely corrupted him. It is also known that soon after becoming head of Roman Empire, Caligula suffered an illness and as the result of it, he became incredibly nasty, cruel, and suspicious man who had indulged in the worst acts of debauchery, cruelty, and sadism. The movie follows this pattern. I still think that it is an interesting movie with very good actors. Not every day you can see porn with Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud, and of course, Mr. Clockwork Orange himself, Malcolm McDowell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excuse the title of this review however the bottom line is, it has to be seen to be believed. The purely supreme cast is more than likely the only thing keeping the film from being well and truly buried in a basement. Historical revelations indicate that the content of this film probably does in fact (to a degree) reflect the lunacy rampant at the time and yes that means....meaningless executions, wild paranoia, incest and of course the gratuitous sex which could probably leave some soft porn movies looking very average (provided you get the right version). No its not a true classic but it dabbles with taboo, and dares go where other films draw the line. Its one i'll watch again and one you'd have to see merely to say you saw it. 6/10 scorpio</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with the poor rating?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a pretty good film. Perhaps the intense nudity and graphic-ness was not likeable but the movie was very closely tied to the facts and history of Caligula himself. You don't see many movies that actually stick with the facts instead of making it 'Hollywood.' I reccommend this to people who "know" about Caligula in advance so that they know what their seeing instead of going into the film not having a clue what its about. I don't think they could've made the movie any better that relates to Caligula- he was a psychopath and it showed in this movie.Tons of great scenes, and it showed what the "real" Rome was like. Brutal and harsh and misgiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of costume and actuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie the first time the night-before last.. and watched it again last night and again tonight.This movie is far from pornography... only a few scenes are hardcore, and only a couple of these are even barely erotic. It does not exactly function as an historical epic, either.The film quality and lighting would make it appear to date from the 1960s.The script is mediocre. More drama could be added, however we do have to bear in mind that the Romans followed the school of Stoicism.The acting (including Malcolm McDowell's) is nothing outstanding, with the exception of Peter O'Toole's Tiberius Caesar. He displays tragedy and lunacy, evoking reactions of disgust, sympathy, pity, and compassion. I found myself much more intrigued by his character and wishing the movie was about his decline from wisdom to near-madness, rather than Caligula. It also caused me to desire to learn more and research the actual life of Tiberius.The film neither condemns, nor condones. That is probably how it should be.Where this film succeeds monumentally is the costuming and unabridged realism. This is the first film I've seen to have a character wearing a toga like the one Caligula's sister (a design many Roman women actually wore) wears in the opening scene. The depiction of slaves and the acts of love and brutality are well-done. It is not erotic, it is not horrifying. With the hardcore scenes excised (the version i saw was the complete version), I believe this movie should be shown in every high school World History class. For centuries, Western culture has censored and toned-down representations of its Pagan past. The filmmakers must be applauded for attempting to make an honest epic.I've become very hard to please when it comes to movies. The last movie I actually liked to a strong degree was Amadeus, which I saw two years ago. Despite its flaws, with its sheer amount of action and atmosphere, I believe this movie deserves a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was running for a stunning 5 years ore so, in a Copenhagen Cinema. I saw it for the first time there, and i was taken by it. The combination of great performance and the open sexuality is amazing, especially the lesbian scene is worth watching again and again, here is no pumped up breast and dumb blondes but hot sexual women who actually looks like the like what they are doing. And the story is great too, that's the way to learn about history. if you haven't seen it, see it now!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Caligula.Somehow, in my early teens I managed to rent this all on my own from a small video rental kiosk attached to our regular after-school amusement arcade.Whoever it was behind the counter (a woman in her twenties, I recall) had either never seen it or was nonplussed as to ratings.As I remember this was just before the video nasty laws were introduced and heavy censorship blighted our lives.It was the full-on no-holds barred version I watched jaw-agape in my teenage bedroom.And, you might ask, how does one grow up from that rather turbulent early experience to NOT become a serial killer? Purely because, even back then, I recognised this as something rather special.More of a pantomime staged in hell than a movie, the reason this provokes such polarised opinion is its complete and utter truthfulness.Subsequent viewings over the decades have slowly revealed Caligula the movie's shameless audacity to be in line with all accounts of the time history can throw at us.Each perversion, each shocking ultraviolent episode is delivered with much relish and much gratuitously beautiful cinematic execution, BUT, and this is the crux of the film's 'charm', BUT NEVER with judgement.It is left to you, the audience, to provide your own moral compass and that is a device (or lack of) seldom permitted to be employed at all nowadays.'Tell us what we're meant to think/feel/do!' your tenderised modern-western conscience screams. Porn! Violence! Outrageous melodrama from some of cinema's finest thespians! Sweeping epic sets, beauty and horror in abundance and very often side by side.And Caligula the movie does offer no answer, merely a repetition of Malcolm McDowell's smarmy, sneery, deadly smile.It'll stab you in the heart; it'll stab you in the back; it'll love you and rape you; it is still quite unlike anything I've ever seen. A truly 'adult' epic.I watched it again tonight and I'm smiling too. At McDowells creepy, campy, over-the-top portrayal of Rome's darkest heart; remember, like Ledger's Joker interpretation, all the world really knew of Roman nobility was the imperial grace of the 50s and 60s blockbusting epics. To show an emperor in such light was brave, sordid, and shocking. Where was the romance, where Anthony and Cleopatra? (scr*wing under a pile of bodies in at least one scene I'd hazard a guess...) I still love this film (and the uber-sexy goddess Helen Mirren), in all it's 'glory'. Hardened to the sensationalism which enrapt me as a teen, I've no doubt that even 30 years later when everyone's seen it all and sees it all on the net 24 hours a day, no major Hollywood production could ever hope to get away with what they did back then.So it is difficult if not impossible to apply any regular film critique to something which will always be more than a film.I long for the day when someone breaks silence and we get the full diaries of events surrounding the production of this monster, because it sure as hell radiates off the screen that everyone was having the time of their lives. After all, don't you always disown your own most indulgent and raucous excesses? Thank you Brass, Gucionne, McDowall, Mirren, Vidal, O'Toole, etc, etc, etc right thru to the 'fluffers' ;)), for a most epically enduring epic and its all-pervading honesty and mayhem.They sure don't make 'em like this any more, and I don't think they ever did; at least not outside ancient Rome anyway.</fullReview>

I think it would have been better if the PORN wasn't spliced into it, and at the same time it wouldn't be the movie I loved. It is HONEST, this is humanity and instinct. History and honesty. The mood is there at least even if it isn't 100% factual...it accomplished unintentionally what it was going for in one respect. I have seen HUNDREDS of movies from silent film to modern cgi/hi-def. I..LOVE..MOVIES. I think this one stands out from SO many I have seen, that alone is worth it. Check out "The Room", because it stands out too but because of how inept and lame it is...it is like art. Caligula is like a trainwreck and pure GENIUS...so it is pure art to me. If you LOVE it it accomplished something, if you HATE it same. If you feel nothing then I guess it isn't your cup of tea and that is cool.

		<fullReview>In the 1970s, with the softcore likes of Emmanuelle and The Story Of O in cinemas, it seemed logical, even vaguely admirable from an artistic perspective, that 'Penthouse' emperor Bob Guccione should take a stab at Caligula, a 'porn-epic'. As he loftily told reporters, "X-rated films... are a force that has to be dealt with (and made) part of the establishment." Italian sexploitation king Tinto Brass was hired to direct a screenplay by Gore Vidal. RSC heavyweights Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were cast as those murderous Romans, along with droog-of-the-moment Malcolm McDowell in the title role. This would be a truly groundbreaking picture, a (heavy) breathing Aubrey Beardsley illustration, combining high-art, high-drama and Penthouse Pets placing their ankles behind their ears.It all went terribly wrong. With a trio of emperor-sized egos in bed, the Vidal-Brass-Guccione threesome collapsed under the weight of those old artistic differences. "I want to screw theeez Penthouse!" the anarchic Tinto informed McDowell, who envisaged Caligula as less an insane tyrant than an anarchic revolutionary, hastening the Senate's downfall from the top. Vidal was barred from the set; lawsuits pinged between Italy and the States; and the 'Penthouse' boss, tired of being dry-humped by Brass, finished the film off himself, inserting extra hardcore, willy-nilly, into the edit. "I just tried to survive it" McDowell explained later.The result is utterly unique. One's enjoyment (the word used advisedly) may also depend on which version you're exposed to. The theatrical cut is a badly-dubbed, silly old mess, a third-rate Ken Russell. The uncut version, on the other hand, is a fascinating mess, made strange and mad through sheer licentiousness.McDowell, who's on screen for pretty much the whole picture, is, well, very McDowell: whether coquettishly swiveling in his boots like a doe-eyed Biggus Dickus, quipping like Lurkio in Up Pompeii ("I thought you didn't like virgins," he's chided. "I've never known any," comes the reply) or simply shrieking like a bat.Among other outrages, he has sex with his sister (dead or alive); marries "the most promiscuous woman in Rome" (Mirren); sleeps with his horse; turns the senators wives into prostitutes for an imperial brothel ("A logical way to balance the state budget"); and rapes a virgin bride on her wedding day. And then fists the groom. The fistee is later charged with being "an honest man and therefore a bad Roman, and therefore a traitor". His penis is cut off and fed to the hounds while cackling hags hoist up their togas and urinate on his corpse.You can sort of see what they were trying to do. But it doesn't work. Caligula hiccups from one sorry sequence to the next, seemingly without connective tissue; the whole enlivened, if that's the right word, by repetitive and bewilderingly gratuitous money shots. If you want a picture of the future two hours and 36 minutes, imagine a scrotal sac slapping on a human face forever.Wherever you look, men and women, often in jarringly different film stock, are performing every permutation of straight or gay sex, or vigorously masturbating to issue like glassy-eyed clockwork monkeys. The effect is exactly like watching distinguished thespians politely attempting to ignore a stage invasion at the Old Vic by furiously copulating naturists, right in the middle of a pivotal soliloquy. As if embarrassed, O'Toole bails out early, as does Gielgud. At least for the latter it was a warm-up for Prospero's Books."I had to take my destiny with my own hands," cries Caligula, as everywhere, everyone is taking their own, and other people's, into their hands too. And yet the film - graphic and coy all at once - doesn't work as pornography either. Aside from the interminable zooms, hardcore is generally characterised by static shots, gentle pans and dissolves. Here, an elongated fellatio scene is continually intercut with an extremely camp sequence of soldiers mincing off to war.Elsewhere, some sisters of Sappho have it off for what seems like an eternity, but the jump-cuts and addition of an ethereal chorus with strident orchestration should frustrate even the most determined onanist. During one early tableau, the film - already the cultural equivalent of PT Barnum's Fejee Mermaid - becomes a literal freakshow, featuring a lusty three-eyed woman and a four-handed man. It's about as erotic as a Francis Bacon retrospective.Vidal's defence (pre-Guccione's meddling) was that regardless of whether the events portrayed in the movie were strictly accurate, they were representative of the kind of debauchery the ancient Romans indulged in. (After all, these were the self same people who'd reportedly dug up a frozen dinosaur from northern Europe and cooked and ate it for a feast.) Yet there's probably more historical veracity in Monty Python's Life Of Brian. Roman traitors were almost certainly not buried up to their necks and decapitated by a gigantic moving wall with swirling lawnmower blades, however impressive it looks.Because visually, Caligula is undeniably fabulous: Derek Jarman meets Peter Greenaway and Federico Fellini - the alternative name for the film could well be '8? Inches'. This may be a bad trip of a movie, dipped in the headache inducing 'deep reds' of Brass's fellow countryman Dario Argento, but here too are Danilo Donati's gorgeously grandiose sets; here are exquisite, hand-crafted larger-than-life sculptures modeled on real Roman artifacts; and everywhere, superbly strange details, rendered almost subliminal, such as a white rat pulling a tiny golden chariot.Except we never get to see any of it properly. At one point, amid all the bump 'n' grind, a man on stilts clops into shot. As he slowly pegs it from one end of the sound stage to the other, you can't help wondering if he's muttering under his breath in Italian, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. What *I* do takes skill, you know?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tasteless and overblown farrago despite the presence of great actor as Gielgud, O'Toole, McDowell, and Helen Mirren</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film builds around one of the most notoriously decadent of the Roman emperors, Caligula? The movie covers his rise to power, his four-year rule, and his bloody assassination? His vile deeds include crashing a wedding and sexually abusing the bride and groom, playing erotic fantasies with his sister (who is also his lover) and turning the Imperial Palace into an exclusive brothel? For a really big-money film, the treatment of the sexual scenes is daringly explicit, but somehow the obsession with it makes the film uneven? It blends very good actors, O'Toole and McDowell, with some simple-minded Penthouse models? The overall effect is disappointing...Guccione does deserve a hand for the exquisite sets, costumes, production values, and very fine cinematography?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong and graphic depravity; but Caligula's story deserves that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very difficult to rate this movie. It's a strong gore-fest, unnerving and gut-wrenching at most times. It has been universally dismissed as nothing more than exploitative semi-porn trash by the critics and apparently by most 'common' people too (the IMDb rating). Under certain circumstances, I would be glad to give a film like this a 1 too.But this is one movie where all those things that were used to criticize are, in truth, virtues. How would one show the story of Caligula, the infamous Roman Emperor that could easily be the greatest monster humanity ever saw? The fact that they had the courage to show violence and nudity, not shying away from the depravity of the subject matter, and also showing the 'dark side' of Ancient Rome, is in the end what makes this a cinematic masterpiece.Another plus is that, if you can focus away from the depravity, the movie is all around very solid. The story is very interesting and engrossing, the soundtrack is great, and the cast? You have big names like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, together with beautiful and talented women like Helen Mirren. And what is there to say about Malcolm McDowell? The man is one of the best, most underrated actors and has shown before that he can play a devious lunatic like no one else.The fact this is directed by Tinto Brass (known for his almost pornographic movies) and produced by Penthouse (no explanation needed) might be one of the motives for the film's overly poor critical reception. A director like Pasolini, for example, made worse depravities years before and got away because 'cinema experts' said it was an allegory for the human nature or whatever it is they use to justify overrating their 'art' films. Or maybe it would have been better to sugar-coat the story, making Caligula seem like a victim of whatever disease caused his lunacy, like John Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind'?</fullReview>

That is his greatness.And also the number of people who made this film and from what kind of arts (Italians especially) are coming,you would be breathless.I give it pure 10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A repulsive, obscene barrage of utter decadence and depravity. Irresistible!! If you're expecting a story that describes the infamous adolescent emperor in traditional, polite terms, then you will HATE this one. As it is, Caligula could have been produced by the psychotic prince himself. Bob Guccione must have found his role as corrupter of an otherwise mainstream production both ironic and satisfying, he obviously identifies quite deeply with the tyrannical paranoid boy-king. Don't think of it as just a film, or a movie. It is a unique spectacle; a totally unapologetic exploitation of everyone and every idea involved. It is NOT for aficionados of elegant discourse. It IS a genuinely sick product from an increasingly corrupt, depraved, declining society. The fault, dear Readers, is not in our stars, but in ourselves... Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most historically accurate movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen lots of movies about Rome. I've read lots of books about Rome. I'm a history major needless to say, and unless something is pretty much dead on accurate, then it makes my face hurt and I bore everyone around me into a stupor due to that fact that I have to point every flaw out individually. Gladiator? Garbage! That movie was pure FILTH compared to Caligula. Malcolm McDowall gives probably his best performance ever as the eccentric, narcissitic, and downright crazy emperor Caligula. Every time I read a history text dealing with Caligula or his uncle Tiberius I picture Malcolm. He's just that good in this movie, he's completely insane and creepy. What's funny is the fact that this was supposed to be a "porno" and it isn't. Nothing in this film is masturbation worthy, as it is too...gritty and creepy. It makes me itch all over. The first time I saw this film, I borrowed it from a friend on dvd (unedited of course) and my girlfriend and I watched it. Needless to say, we were amazed, and she needed to turn it off at the um...."Glory of Rome" scene in the kitchen. This from the girl who owns every "Faces of Death" and "Mondo Caine" ever made, not to mention the Ilsa series of movies! Historically, this movie is spot on, as hard to believe as it is, most of this is true. Cinematically, a masterpiece. "Let them hate me, so long as they FEAR me!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Taste and Decency, Beyond Even Entertainment Value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like "sin" and "depravity" used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.The historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. Rarely has a film proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.Rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. Apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperorship. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.A review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as "hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror." This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's not kid ourselves here, all ye art students, film-school nerds, and other self-loathing "cinema l'arte" snobs: had this exact same movie been released under the banner "directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini" you would have loved it - sorry: CLAIMED to have loved it - and praised it to high heaven, espousing its virtues in long essays, justifying its extreme sex and violence through some b.s. semantic pseudo-intellectual movie-critic-jargon mumbo-jumbo.Go on, admit it. No-one will laugh. We promise.This movie has been unanimously dismissed as exploitative trash and of no cinematic value by "notable" movie critics.After having seen the full two-and-a-half hour version: a) I can certainly see why THEY would choose to view it that way b) I totally disagree The fact that "Caligula" was financed by Penthouse (gasp!) and directed by Tinto Brass (oh no!) is what this is all about.An excellent cast includes McDowell (an ideal choice for Caligula - or any devious lunatic, for that matter) and Mirren (at the height of her enormous sex-appeal). There is terrific music from Khachaturian, an interesting story, some suspense, etc. A strong stomach is needed to watch this gore-fest, though.A corny, historically inaccurate, fairy-tale-like piece of crap like "Gandhi" gets world-wide recognition, while a brutally realistic film about another historical figure gets the finger.

		<shortDescription>Only the ignorant would see this as pornography -THIS IS A MASTERPIECE FOR ITS TIME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen lots of pornography in my time and I'll hardly call this pornography. This film was very beautiful and fantastic and quite an ambitious project for its time. Its just an art-house film with lots of nudity and sex. No different that would you would see today but with accurate historical elements. If all you see is porn or all you want to see it porn here, you must be looking for pornography and I suggest you rent porn. This is a cinematic achievement. The sets, the acting, the story, make up- all in all- a good product. Most, who are in themselves puritans, would see this as porn for they have no sense of what artistic expression really involves. If there is nudity, it must be porn, right? wrong! Sex, nudity, the human naked or nude body, aroused or not, and all that encompasses it can be quite artistic and it is shown here with various degrees of visual artistry. If you want to rent this film because you'd like to see porn for sexual stimulation then why not rent a real porn that has no story or artistic value. Pornographic material ultimate goal is to stimulate you to orgasm. I hardly think that was the point of Caligula. So please, be less illiterate and ignorant for there is some history going on here both for its time, 1979, and as a period piece from pagan Rome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misunderstood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the few positive reviews for Caligula (which generally run along the "so bad it's good" line) I feel compelled to add my own critique. Caligula is a tour de force of powerful, visceral film-making. Many of the films deriders seem to be confused by the explicit sexual content and approach it as pornography, criticising the unattractiveness of the cast for spoiling their experience. (I'm reviewing, of course, the 1h55m unrated cut of the film) If you're looking for a bit of porn there are far better places to go. Likewise if searching for historical accuracy, this is not what the film is about. A taste for the sophisticated discourses on power and desire found in Passolini's Sal?, the gaudy theatrics of Ken Russell's The Devils, or the humour and obsessive gratuity of William S. Burroughs will help you to fully appreciate the experience. Sex, mortality and addiction to power are the overriding themes presented in such a way as to implicate the viewer in this daring and unique cinematic experiment. The cuts switch between images of arousal and disgust with a balletic beauty climaxing in the beatific portrayal of Caligula's inevitable demise. O'Tool is a particular treat in the role of Tiberius and one cannot help seeing McDowell's Caligula as a matured Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer, filmmaker or cultural theorist, and a good conversation piece for everyone else.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen this film and you are reading this you must get your hands on an unrated copy and give it a go.A film as hardcore as "Caligula" would never be made today.

		<shortDescription>Epic Sleaze Masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure CALIGULA will divide a lot of viewers - but I personally loved it. It has to be the highest budget sleaze film ever made - and the fact that they got such respectable actors as Malcolm McDowell, John Gielgud, and Peter O'Toole to star in this trash-fest is absolutely amazing to me.The story is of Roman Caesar, Caligula, and his rise to power and exploits as the Roman leader. How much of the film is accurate and what is total fabrication - I really have no idea - so I can only base my assessment on what the film portrays. Caligula was a power hungry freak who was in love with his sister. Being the Emperor of Rome, Caligula had the power to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted - so citizens, officers, guards, Senators, etc...who outlived their purpose were put to death in pretty inventive fashions. Caligula was also quite fond of the "pleasures of the flesh", so he would bone pretty much whoever he wanted at will. Due to his crazy antics, he was eventually plotted against and murdered...CALIGULA is to this day considered one of the most controversial films ever made - and with good reason. There is more nudity and perversions going on here than you can shake your boner at. My only gripe, is that with all the explicit blow-jobs, lesbianism, orgies, and other fun stuff going on - CALIGULA could have actually used more hardcore sex scenes. There were only two that I counted, and they were brief and not very explicit. I say - if you're gonna make an epic sleaze film - go "all the way" with it. There is also some decent violence, including a pretty inventive head-mowing scene and a few other tortures, but the violence in the film is pretty tame by todays standards. The performances in the film are all quite good, given the trashy nature of the overall production, and the set design and costumes are amazing.As a historical documentary, CALIGULA will surely fail to impress - but to those of us that LOVE sleazy cinema - this film is an absolute must-own. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start..... First off, the sets are wonderful. They are lavish and look authentic of the time, except as if a madman on acid was given a gigantic budget and told to "go at it!" Peter O'Toole is wonderful as the aging Tiberius. Malcolm McDowell gives a great performance as the young Caligula who kills his way to the throne of the Roman Emperor and then soon leads a legacy of terror. The supporting actors do a fine job yet, most of the young ladies were actually Penthouse Pets and were there for eye candy and irrelevant sex scenes. Depending on which film you are watching, the uncut or the R-version, some scenes are extremely graphic. I would usually always recommend the uncut version as opposed to the chopped one, but in this instance, the full length film is purely indulgent. Scenes of sex and gore were added to satisfy the producers (Penthouse) and the expected audience, not to add anything to the story. However, I am and will always be a fan of excess, so get the full version! The story is strong and keeps you interested. McDowell is charming throughout, which is quite the feat considering he murders family members, rapes and molests men and women, and sleeps with his sister. For fans of excess and sleaze, i highly recommend. Viewers who are purely interested in the reign of the notorious ruler might want to skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a teenager I saw unedited version of Caligula and it basically changed my life for good! I was so impressed in synergy of porn and regular film that I thought that new era in the film industry is dawning and that we will not have ratings any more. Oh boy was I wrong! Not only did porn go away from the movie theaters to the VHS and further online that regular film rearly have explicit scenes of sex in it. It is obvious now days that porn and regular films are separated and probably they will stay that way for a long time.Caligula remains an extraordinary tryout in putting those two genres together. And it should be studied in every film academy in the world! I am so glad that Caligula was republished in the unrated version on the DVD and you can find clips of it all over internet. It means it will survive for generations to come. Bravo!!! As far as the actors go they fit their roles well, but Helen Mirren will always stay my favorite playing role in this film and in The Queen.

		<shortDescription>a film that rips the guts out of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula, without a doubt, is one of the most filthiest, most disgusting, vile films I have ever watched. No duh. That's the collective opinion of many people who've seen it. "It's disgusting! It's sooo nasty! Yuck!" But it's much more than filth and sleaze. It's a masterpiece.It's a masterpiece of gore and sex and history, rolled into one weird package. Though not historically accurate in all respects, it is pretty literal when it comes to bringing the horrors of Caligula to life on screen. Those who aren't familiar with the emperor Caligula, or any of the Julio-Claudian emperors for that matter, won't notice much but the Roman history buffs will be annoyed that this film focuses less on the story of Caligula's life, and more on his perverse and strange acts of tyranny and sex. There is castration, fellatio, decapitation, fisting, anal, oral, the list goes on and on. He makes his horse consul, screws his sister, leads the armies on useless expeditions, violently massacres people, rapes a bride and groom, turns his palace into a brothel and does many other stupid things. But hey, Guccione and Brass never intended to flatter Caligula. The film starts off with a biblical passage, For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul. - Mark 8:36 How very scary. The beginning is ominous, a pulsing rhythm pounding in the background, a sort of odd Pagan music. Then we see Caligula frolicking (to say the least) in the woods with his sister, Julia Drusilla. From there on starts a bizarre two and a half hour odyssey of absurdity.You might ask, what the hell is good, much less great, about this movie? There are many reasons why I consider Caligula brilliant.The acting, for one. Malcolm McDowell was born to play the role of the mad emperor. He portrays Caligula as a cheeky bastard, a real son of a bitch who's a pervert and a madman. Malcolm gives the performance of a lifetime, outshadowing even his roles as Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange and Mick Travis in If...Quite simply one of the best performances I've ever seen. Malcolm becomes Caligula, he descends deeply into the character and becomes insane himself.Peter O Toole is amazing as the sick and volatile Tiberius. You can see him laughing during the elevator scene, laughing at the stupid absurd role he was playing and how his career was going down the drain, laughing at himself because he was surrounded by a bunch of naked Italian B-movie actors and Penthouse pets. Even he couldn't take the whole damn thing seriously. John Gielgud as the suicidal Nerva and Helen Mirren as the faithful but skanky Caesonia were a nice addition. The music, is another thing. Aram Ilyich Khachaturian's Spartacus is haunting and beautiful. Prokofiev's Dance of The Knights (AKA Montagues and Capulets) is simply stunning. It's played during the beginning credits and it sets the tone for the entire movie. Intense and atmospheric and powerful.The dialogue is also great. During the credits we hear Caligula say "I have existed from the morning of the world, and shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the name of Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man, and so, I am a god." Gore Vidal at his best. Some people say the script is cheezy or stupid, but I think it's great. Caligula is Roman decadence, personified. The horror and indulgence of the Romans is portrayed wonderfully in this film. It's the best representation of Rome, along with the miniseries I Claudius and Fellini's masterpiece Satyricon. The nudity and violence are excessive, but most Romans were indulgent and depraved by this time period. Gone were the days of art and poetry, the days of bloodshed and the abuse of power had begun. Besides, you can't exactly make a PG Disney movie on the life of Caligula.This movie also made me obsessed with Roman history, especially Caligula himself. Rarely has a film gripped me so powerfully.Although I do think Caligula is an outstanding film, it obviously could've been better. Tinto Brass had something, he was making something different, maybe not Citizen Kane, but still, he'd got something special. Then Bob the perv Guccione came along and was angry that his money was being wasted, so he and his buddy edited Caligula and tore it apart and replaced key moments with porno scenes. Oh, what could've been! Well too bad. This is the result of serious miscommunication between producer and director. People think that Caligula lacks artists merit because they assume that it's a porno because it was produced by Penthouse. If Salo is a masterpiece, why can't Caligula be a masterpiece? Why the hell not? Just because Salo was directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. If Bob Guccione had decided to make a movie version of Salo, it'd be panned, but if Pasolini made Caligula, it'd be praised to the skies. I give Caligula a 10, just for the pure shock value of it. What a brave and bold film. You'll never see a movie like this again, ever. People compromise nowadays, censorship prevails. Who would have the guts to make such filthy mainstream movie? No one.In conclusion, Caligula is a powerful, amazing film that is horrific and magnificent at the same time. Throughout the whole time I watched it, I was filled with dread, terrified at what would happen next. At times it was hard to swallow (get the pun?). The rating of 4.9 is ridiculous. Some people couldn't handle the nastiness, apparently. Watch it....if you have the guts to. They'll probably be torn out by the end.</fullReview>

After viewing this film I did not know what to think. Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula and does a really great job in the role. Peter O'Toole plays Tiberius, Caligula's adopted Grandfather and he does a great job also for the short time he is in the movie. Basically, this movie tells the story of Caligula's rise and fall and all that is in between. This mostly includes orgies left and right, incest, random freaks, sadism, masochism and much blood and gore. This movie truly is controversial and very disturbing.

		<shortDescription>Best and most realistic gritty ancient Rome epic from the 70s/80s I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Caligula" is by far the first and only movie so far that I've seen that I would DEFINITELY not recommend ANYONE under 16 watch. It's very gritty and filled with explicit sexuality and violence, including close-up scenes of stabbings (not real, but gruesome), cutting stuff off, and sexual abuse.Despite that, it's not too much as to make someone cry out and wonder if its actual snuff. I think it was said best by one of the people working on it (forgot who), that Caligula is the kind of movie you can't watch through modern eyes. In order to fully grasp it without revulsion, you'd have to have knowledge and understanding of Ancient Roman morality and such. This means alienating some of the audience.The acting is absolutely splendid, for what has been blasted as being "the most expensive porno ever made", with Malcolm McDowell absolutely fiendish as Gaius Caligula, in his best role since Alex DeLarge in "A Clockwork Orange". Peter O'Toole is fabulous, as is everyone else involved.The cinematography and set design is stupendous and adds a depth to the scenes that is really powerful. The film quality is quite crappy (on the DVD) but you really don't notice or even care once you get into it.With all movies comes a share of problems, which Caligula seems to suffer much of. The most important problems I see is the influence infamous porn director Bob Guccione has done to the flick. Apparently defying the other directors/producers/whoever, he's added some very unnecessary sex scenes which are focused on for far too long and serve no real purpose other than to add to the explicitness of the film. It's really unnecessary to have the camera focusing on a woman giving oral sex to a man for a solid four or five minutes without any transition or overlapping dialogue.Another problem seems to be that one of the editors cut the film incorrectly, and so some of the scenes are completely misplaced from the film (noted by Caligula's lack of facial hair in some scenes, present in another) including the frolic in the forest scene with Caligula and Drusilla, placed at the very beginning of the film whereas its true purpose was to be placed much later on.The way the film portrays Caligula I feel has been misunderstood by people. Granted, the only sources on Caligula left to us by historians has portrayed him as a cold, heartless, utterly insane Emperor who was killed by his Praetorian Guard and did all sorts of obscene and radical things to Rome, including severely draining her economy. The film finds a middle ground in portraying Caligula in the beginning as a mischievous young man who slowly becomes more and more demented as the film goes on and he finds himself in control of all of Rome. His only hold on sanity appears to be his sister Drusilla (whom he loves very much, nearly to the point of incestuous love), which evaporates with her death. The quote from the Bible (I think its the bible) at the beginning of the film perfectly portrays Caligula, I believe: "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole word, and lose his own soul?"?Mark 8:36.The best thing about Caligula I find is the dialogue, which is rich and vivid with absolutely brilliant and great quotes, almost Shakespearian in attitude, had Shakespeare lived and wrote in Ancient Rome. My favorite ones include the one mentioned above, and Caligula's quote at the beginning of the movie: "I have existed from the morning of the world and shall exist until the last star falls from the night.

		<shortDescription>Awesome and worth watching at least once in your life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this is almost a pornographic film, but not quite - just very sexually graphic. If you have an active sex life, you can deal with this movie easily. That being said, it is one of the more interesting films you could possibly view, all things considered. The film tells the story of Gaius Caligula, the Roman emperor who ruled from 37-41 A.D. and was well-known for his vacant soul. His neglect of matters of state and his indulgence in pleasure and torture drive the plot towards its climactic ending. Technically, the film is interesting - some imagery will stay in your mind, such as the circular guillotine. The sets are lavish, and overall, the film is a firm cinematic achievement, technically speaking. The acting is mostly stellar - McDowell is able to step into the psychotic Caligula, both alternately as a charming head-of-state and a deranged pervert, sometimes in the same scene. O'Toole and Gielgud are only in the film's first 45 minutes, as Tiberius and Nerva, respectively. O'Toole is particularly captivating as the dying emperor, fraught with syphilis (according to historical records) and paranoia. Gielgud's performance is lukewarm - maybe he'd already seen the rest of the movie before filming his scenes? Helen Mirren is captivating as well as Caesonia, the lascivious wife of Caligula. I've seen her in many films, but this and Excalibur are the two I remember most, to be sure. Finally, Theresa Ann Savoy is very strong as Drusula, the incestuous sister of Caligula - she plays the role with a certain soft firmness of character, likable and rational, at least when compared to McDowell's Caligula. The film is full of nudity, sex and graphic images. Some add to the content, some detract - that can be said of any film's imagery. A viewer should not let the mere content dictate the effect. What these images do is lend validity to the story being told, a story of an emperor not fit to be so, an emperor more obsessed with his own benefits rather than the good of the people and the Empire, an emperor so morally depraved - well, this may have been the only way to truly tell the story of Caligula. And it's worth watching, at least once. The first time I tried to watch it, I was 19, and not ready to deal with the content. It is a film for mature audiences only, no doubt. It's up to you to assess your own maturity level, though - not me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An aspect of HISTORY, a scent of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula is a most erotic movie ever made and definitely not to be seen but having said that i can't deny the features it shows about the history.Leaving its vulgarity, exploitation, stupidity and many more things, i felt it as one of the significant movie. I don't know if such a story was real or not but such things were there in past. That arrogance of humans in few places is depicted honestly or at least bravely. If one can overlook un-overlook-able eroticses in the film, one will definitely move along with it in its depiction of madness, lust of power and sex, and what not. Can't say again if incidents are real then how much honestly they are filmed but sure thing that such events are reality of human history not too old at various developing places.I wish this movie can tell about or show us about the extreme or limit of money, power, sex in human life. Some idea can sure be taken in as to what happen now when i have everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intrigue, passion, conspiracy, murder and lots and lots of intercourse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most bizarre entries in the recorded history of cinema, this kinky movie is clearly a product of the seventies with its 'laissez-faire' attitude towards movie contents. The story behind this production is at least as intriguing and sleazy as the final product itself. A grandiose mixture of historical epicness and pornography, this movie went through many tumultuous phases, both during and particularly after production. At its core it tells the story of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell), a young man who rose to be Emperor of ancient Rome at the death of his vile old uncle Tiberius (Peter O'Toole surrounded by naked people), but ruled for only four years because of his disgusting appetites. The movie shows, among other things, Caligula hosting several orgies, engaging in incest with his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) and having hundreds of people viciously executed for next to no reason. McDowell does an excellent job of portraying the spoiled but traumatized young emperor, but he's outstaged at every turn by the abundance of explicit sex scenes, including fellatio, cunnilingus, lesbian sex, group sex, people urinating on each other, attempted intercourse with fish and various other animals, naked mutants and about everything else the Penthouse producers could think of: it'll come as no surprise original screen writer Gore Vidal had his name removed from the credits when he noticed what had been done to his serious screen play. From a camp perspective, this is actually all rather fun, but if you're looking for historical accuracy, or subtlety, you'll find little here. The movie is still banned in several countries, while there has been almost a dozen cuts in circulation over the years, and none of the make for a really good film, but all of them are fascinating to behold nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unrated version = full picture ... rated cut = hints and winks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The full unrated version of this film goes to some real extremes of sex and disgust. The rated version is only left with hints to the extremes that are being portrayed.As a tale of the main character Caligula, and his love affair with his sister, her refusal to marry him in hope of him marrying someone respectable and acceptable, alongside his innosence at not being able to kill his adopted grandfather... given the opportunity to choose another wife he picks the worst, seemingly blind to what his beloved was trying to do for him, separating him from something that was good in him... happy to eventually rape women and men, to kill and torture... facing the reaities of being fated to be killed, going to extremes to avoid it yet at other extremes encouraging it... His sister's eventual death and his reaction... Shot amidst constant intermittently-graphical sex orgies...In my opinion it tells the story well, not too blatantly, as you have to consider the characters yourself to see their issues.The sexually graphic and graphic indescency is also nice to see in full, not for pornographic purposes because porn doesn't need a full movie of context and meaning, but that a major film went to such extremes (for whatever reasons, other reviews explain), that it all fits into the context of the movie and that such content is often cut for what good reason other than standardised normality in film.The only scene that does really seem to cut away from the film is the explicit lesbian scene of the two women who have been watching Caligula having sex with his wife and sister. But even that has a point in mirroring the activity going on in the room between Drucilla and Caesonia, without showing it: Which goes further than the cut version to again, merely hint at.Not a film I'd watch with relatives, for them I'd stick to the cut, rated version. I guess that's normality for you. The full unrated version definitely felt to me more like the full picture.Shame there was apparently such a mess around it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caligula - misunderstood classic or porno travesty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`I have existed from the morning of the world and I shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula I am all men as I am no man, and so - I am a God!'Bob Guccione's Penthouse International invested 17.5 million dollars into the production of Caligula, and in doing so created one of the wildest exploitation films ever made.The film, which chronicles the terrifying reign of the tyrant Gaius Caligula Caesar, Rome's fourth and most notorious emperor, who ruled from A.D. 37 to A.D. 41, took eleven months to film and attracted a multitude of talented artists into its creative team. These included renowned novelist, essayist, playwright and historian Gore Vidal, who wrote the initial screenplay the final film was based on, and Danilo Donati, four time Academy award winning designer, and frequent Fellini collaborator, who created the lavish sets, 64 all up, and costumes. The Emperor himself had 26 costume changes alone. 3,592 costumes in all were created. Actors of the calibre and stature of Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole flew to Rome for what promised to be one hell of an experience, and it proved to be just that.Ever since its release in 1979 Caligula has been resoundly lambasted by not only the critics but by most of the participants in the production. It is well known that the production of the film degenerated into a huge slagging match between the main talents and the money men and that the director, Tinto Brass, was removed from the production after he had edited the first twenty minutes of the film. The rest of the film was edited by Guccione and a freelance editor, and if you look at the film from the moment when dawn arrives and all the freaks awake in Tiberius' grotto, they had no idea what they were doing. They probably even used the wrong takes most of the time. The blame for the films failure has been placed mainly at the feet of Brass. Brass reportedly used three to five cameras all rolling at the same time to capture the action. This was one of the reasons used by Penthouse to fire him. They claimed that he wasted film shooting this way. Yet, if you look at the first twenty minutes the film is a sharply edited piece of work, excluding the opening sequence in the forest, which is pretty dire, and which probably was never shot to open the film anyway. It's a shame Brass wasn't left in control, as I believe he would have produced an intelligent movie. Sure, it wasn't going to be the erotic/todger pulling classic Guccione wanted, but who cares. One of the really bad aspects of the film are the stupid porno inserts featuring the pets. I believe Brass was on his way to creating a masterpiece, well, maybe not, but certainly a film of much merit. Piernico Solinas, author of The Ultimate Porno: The Making of a sex Colossal, certainly believed this to be true. It would be interesting to see the film totally re-edited from start to finish again. There is certainly a lot of footage that was shot that never ended up in the final cut.Caligula is an easy film to knock. People don't like it because of its frankness. People claim it is badly acted. People claim it is badly written. People claim it is badly photographed. People claim it is just bad. Well they are wrong. What it is is a prime example of how to ruin a film in the editing stage. Anyone claiming it to be badly photographed need look no further than the Dutch Filmworks release of it on DVD. This is a beautiful, not completely blemish free, print that shows just how well filmed Caligula was. It is far superior to the Penthouse DVD. Sure, Caligula is not a perfect film, and sure it is in your face filmmaking, but at least the filmmakers had the guts to make something different, something challenging. What went wrong with Caligula was that there were too many chiefs. What Caligula was was a brave and interesting experiment that didn't quite come off. Caligula could have been powerful, intelligent and stunning. Instead, it is one of the best exploitation films ever made. And, anyway, who could hate a movie that has a giant head lopping machine in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The decadence of Rome never looked so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie traces the rise and fall of Caligula, the last real emperor of the united Roman Empire; before the military took over the government and instituted a line of puppet rulers.Nothing is held back in showing the moral decay and decadence of the final days of the empire. Because of this, there are very few people who will not find at least some part of the movie offensive. While the attempt at realism is admirable, it makes it difficult for some viewers to look past the offense to their personal sensibilities and appreciate the film as a whole.The movie has a lot of big names stars, but strangely it is a relative unknown, Theresa Ann Savoy, as Caligula's sister that provides the best performance. Malcom McDowell, John Gielguld, and Peter O'Toole present performances that are fine, but far from their best.The film does seem to lack anything resembling a plot. Instead of a cohesive story, the characters move from one unrelated scene to the next. The movie is more akin to a voyeuristic view into Roman life as it was during this period of time.The sets and the atmosphere, however, are excellent. "Caligula" presents the best vision of the opulence and decadence of Rome since Fellini's Satyricon. While some viewers have criticised the movie as exaggerating the concept of Roman orgies, one should remember that "Caligula" takes place during the fall of Rome, where the power of the Emperor and nobility had reached the epitome of corruption. The days when Rome was a center of scientific and philosophical advancement had long disappeared by the time Caligula comes to power. During this time intellectuals and dissidents were slaughtered, the nobility had given up any appearance of proprietary, apathy ran through the citizenry like a plague, the military assumed more and more power, and celebrations and orgies were held constantly in a vain attempt to stave off rebellion. Because the strength of the movie is in its ostentatious depiction, I suggest watching the long version (the short version just doesn't convey the intended vision strongly enough).While not everybody can appreciate the movie, I would recommend it to any student of Roman history or afficionado of film techniques.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caligula: The Mad King Of Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must see film for anyone interested in Roman history, particularly the fall of the Roman empire. "Caligula" (Latin: Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) was the popular nickname of Gaius (31 August 12 AD ? 22 January 41 AD), Roman emperor from 37 AD to 41 AD. Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The film focuses on the period from his adolescence and crowning as Emperor till the time he is brutally assassinated with his wife and child. The method of assassination of Gaius is eerily similar to that of the emperor Julius Caeser who was stabbed 30 times. The film portrays him as a cruel tyrant who loves to torment his Senators and also as sex pervert. The film shows him having sexual relations with his sister Julia Drusilla. The film shows him as a man who thinks he can do anything he pleases, without any shred of thought to the consequences and also thinks that he is a God.He doesn't win favor with the Senate and is assassinated before he can do more damage to the Roman Empire. Veteran actor Malcolm McDowell(A Clockwork Orange, Time After Time) plays the emperor Caligula and gives a powerful performance. Other notable actors/actresses are: Peter O'Toole as Emperor Tiberius John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Paolo Bonacelli as Senator Chaerea.The film contains scenes of sex and violence and I therefore do not recommend it being shown to persons under the age of 18. This film is one of the most infamous cult films ever made and remains banned in several countries to this day.Despite this film being regarded as one of the worst films of all time, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it portrays the most chaotic period in Rome's history.Similar films: The Robe (1953) and its sequel Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954), Julius Caesar (1970).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the most bizarre movie i'd ever seen up to this day and it certainly is one reason to dig into Italian cinema and see more of their hidden and forgotten gems.The movie isn't by any way historically accurate but still it captures the roman decadence that lead to the destruction of the empire. Caligola is colourful, visually stunning experience and at the same time distressing for some. It's certainly not a cheap adult movie as some might think but it does contain a lot of nudity which may be disturbing and that might be the reason for such a low rating as many viewers are expecting more conventional movie.After seeing it i was left puzzled and i didn't quite know what to think of it. I do understand why it was censored in so many countries as it did in a way have political messages which are still accurate in today's world.I can recommend this movie for adults who aren't easily provoked and disgusted.

		<shortDescription>Controversial in 1979! Tame by Today's Standards!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula has a stellar cast of actors like Dame Helen Mirren, Malcolm McDowell (why isn't he knighted yet), Peter O'Toole (surely another actor who should be knighted) and Sir John Gielgud with an Italian cast. This film isn't for the prudish or those squeamish by violence, sexuality, and nudity. It's funny how controversial it was in 1979. Despite it's weak script at times, the film is entertaining and short enough under 2 hours to wrap a Shakespearean style tragedy in the making. I relatively enjoyed it even with the open sexuality which was more sensuality and nudity in the film. It was done a lot more artistically even the orgies scenes throughout the film. The story of Caligula could only be told by Bob Guccione who directed the film. The uneven story and writing weakens the film but it's worth watching even seeing Dame Helen Mirren in such a role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1970s, with the softcore likes of Emmanuelle and The Story Of O in cinemas, it seemed logical, even vaguely admirable from an artistic perspective, that 'Penthouse' emperor Bob Guccione should take a stab at Caligula, a 'porn-epic'. As he loftily told reporters, "X-rated films... are a force that has to be dealt with (and made) part of the establishment." Italian sexploitation king Tinto Brass was hired to direct a screenplay by Gore Vidal. RSC heavyweights Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were cast as those murderous Romans, along with droog-of-the-moment Malcolm McDowell in the title role. This would be a truly groundbreaking picture, a (heavy) breathing Aubrey Beardsley illustration, combining high-art, high-drama and Penthouse Pets placing their ankles behind their ears.It all went terribly wrong. With a trio of emperor-sized egos in bed, the Vidal-Brass-Guccione threesome collapsed under the weight of those old artistic differences. "I want to screw theeez Penthouse!" the anarchic Tinto informed McDowell, who envisaged Caligula as less an insane tyrant than an anarchic revolutionary, hastening the Senate's downfall from the top. Vidal was barred from the set; lawsuits pinged between Italy and the States; and the 'Penthouse' boss, tired of being dry-humped by Brass, finished the film off himself, inserting extra hardcore, willy-nilly, into the edit. "I just tried to survive it" McDowell explained later.The result is utterly unique. One's enjoyment (the word used advisedly) may also depend on which version you're exposed to. The theatrical cut is a badly-dubbed, silly old mess, a third-rate Ken Russell. The uncut version, on the other hand, is a fascinating mess, made strange and mad through sheer licentiousness.McDowell, who's on screen for pretty much the whole picture, is, well, very McDowell: whether coquettishly swiveling in his boots like a doe-eyed Biggus Dickus, quipping like Lurkio in Up Pompeii ("I thought you didn't like virgins," he's chided. "I've never known any," comes the reply) or simply shrieking like a bat.Among other outrages, he has sex with his sister (dead or alive); marries "the most promiscuous woman in Rome" (Mirren); sleeps with his horse; turns the senators wives into prostitutes for an imperial brothel ("A logical way to balance the state budget"); and rapes a virgin bride on her wedding day. And then fists the groom. The fistee is later charged with being "an honest man and therefore a bad Roman, and therefore a traitor". His penis is cut off and fed to the hounds while cackling hags hoist up their togas and urinate on his corpse.You can sort of see what they were trying to do. But it doesn't work. Caligula hiccups from one sorry sequence to the next, seemingly without connective tissue; the whole enlivened, if that's the right word, by repetitive and bewilderingly gratuitous money shots. If you want a picture of the future two hours and 36 minutes, imagine a scrotal sac slapping on a human face forever.Wherever you look, men and women, often in jarringly different film stock, are performing every permutation of straight or gay sex, or vigorously masturbating to issue like glassy-eyed clockwork monkeys. The effect is exactly like watching distinguished thespians politely attempting to ignore a stage invasion at the Old Vic by furiously copulating naturists, right in the middle of a pivotal soliloquy. As if embarrassed, O'Toole bails out early, as does Gielgud. At least for the latter it was a warm-up for Prospero's Books."I had to take my destiny with my own hands," cries Caligula, as everywhere, everyone is taking their own, and other people's, into their hands too. And yet the film - graphic and coy all at once - doesn't work as pornography either. Aside from the interminable zooms, hardcore is generally characterised by static shots, gentle pans and dissolves. Here, an elongated fellatio scene is continually intercut with an extremely camp sequence of soldiers mincing off to war.Elsewhere, some sisters of Sappho have it off for what seems like an eternity, but the jump-cuts and addition of an ethereal chorus with strident orchestration should frustrate even the most determined onanist. During one early tableau, the film - already the cultural equivalent of PT Barnum's Fejee Mermaid - becomes a literal freakshow, featuring a lusty three-eyed woman and a four-handed man. It's about as erotic as a Francis Bacon retrospective.Vidal's defence (pre-Guccione's meddling) was that regardless of whether the events portrayed in the movie were strictly accurate, they were representative of the kind of debauchery the ancient Romans indulged in. (After all, these were the self same people who'd reportedly dug up a frozen dinosaur from northern Europe and cooked and ate it for a feast.) Yet there's probably more historical veracity in Monty Python's Life Of Brian. Roman traitors were almost certainly not buried up to their necks and decapitated by a gigantic moving wall with swirling lawnmower blades, however impressive it looks.Because visually, Caligula is undeniably fabulous: Derek Jarman meets Peter Greenaway and Federico Fellini - the alternative name for the film could well be '8? Inches'. This may be a bad trip of a movie, dipped in the headache inducing 'deep reds' of Brass's fellow countryman Dario Argento, but here too are Danilo Donati's gorgeously grandiose sets; here are exquisite, hand-crafted larger-than-life sculptures modeled on real Roman artifacts; and everywhere, superbly strange details, rendered almost subliminal, such as a white rat pulling a tiny golden chariot.Except we never get to see any of it properly. At one point, amid all the bump 'n' grind, a man on stilts clops into shot. As he slowly pegs it from one end of the sound stage to the other, you can't help wondering if he's muttering under his breath in Italian, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. What *I* do takes skill, you know?"</fullReview>

Get the Netflix UR director's cut. That's the best version available. Avoid the watered down, compromised, R version which is a travesty created to please the censors.I have bad news for the prudies who don't like this movie because of its extreme sex, violence, and sensuality. The movie is accurate. This is how it was in Rome at that time. Go read the contemporary histories in Latin. I have. If anything the film downplays the reality of Rome during Caligula's reign.The people who agreed to be in this movie, knowing full well that the project was VERY controversial, provide world class and Oscar level acting for the most part. The script is very good and largely based on histories of the time which are in the Vatican library.Watch it twice. The first time you are going to be blown away by the sex, violence, and action. The second time you can see the acting. If you are a good Christian, cross yourself and run the other way. This film isn't for prudes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought the complete unrated uncut DVD and it was everything I could ever ask for in a movie. I'm a huge fan of 1970's exploitation films and this is the best. There is lots is hardcore, XXX, full penetration sex. The gore was decent but I the story telling made up for it. It's one of those rare movies that I could watch forever and wish it didn't have to end. It gets it point across very well and it portrays Caligula as not a monster or a mad man, but as an average young man given more power than he knows what to do with. It show him as a scared young man and how the power gradually corrupts him and he gets more evil and becomes more of a tyrant as the movie goes on. As far as the sex it's very erotic and high quality. The only down side is the gore was a bit lacking. I don't know why so many people hate this film, I would guess there just closed minded, uptight, prudes that can except a movie that is daring and won't hold back to tell the true story as accurately as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is interesting that this film is so reviled and does not even exist in a definitive version. Watching it again recently, I saw that instead of it being a monumental folly ? or the most expensive porno ever made ? it is in fact a work of Visionary Prophecy which predicts and shows the horror that the Western World has fallen into in the last 30 years. The first section of the film, in Tiberius' court, is obviously based upon what was happening in America in the seventies. The continual partying, the fascination with loveless, experimental and sado-masochistic sex, the self-indulgence and egotism are all there. The film goes on to show where this behaviour leads: to the madness which is the tyranny of an uncontrolled Ego. Caligula in this film is Egotism personified ? paranoid, authoritarian, insane. The film is a series of poetic Visions ? the harvesting machine which crops human heads (the harvest of global capitalism has been and continues to be wide-scale suffering and death); the wedding of Proculus and Livia (loyalty and honour is raped and humiliated in the service of despotism); the prostitution of the Senators wives (those in power-positions in corrupt states find themselves wedded to harlots ? i.e. corrupt materialist philosophies); the election of a horse (Man's animal nature elevated); the pyramid-structure of Rome (a rigid hierarchy with a `reptile' consciousness at its head and slaves at the bottom). Caligula IS Western Capitalism as it now exists. If you buy into it ? if you live in its court ? you will find yourself on an uncontrollable wheel of fate which will replace and kill you at the finish. Mankind's rational ego has set itself up in the place of God and finds only horror and tragic death. The most poignant moment of the film has the Emperor attempting to make love to his sister's dead corpse ? the barrenness of life lived on a purely physical material level exposed for all to see ? nature breeds only a perishable vegetable being. The film looks as good as any Fellini and contains some brilliant work from the actors ? McDowell is legendary, Gielgud and Steiner great (notice how Steiner's Longinus, Caligula's treasurer, is a physical manifestation of the penis, complete with a slit on the top of his head). The film is a grand warning for us all ? and a portrait not of ancient history but of the HERE and NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliantly Vile History Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In regard to the Bob Guccione-directed pornographic inserts in the uncut version of "Caligula"--what better way is there to exemplify the excesses of a crazed Roman ruler than with a little of the 'ol in-out, in-out? And what better actor to preside over the excesses of a Sodom-esquire Rome than Malcolm McDowell, who lent "A Clockwork Orange" its amoral backbone? Here he plays the titular emperor, who carries on a long-standing incestuous relationship with his sister, Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy), and weds Rome's most promiscuous prostitute, Caesonia (Helen Mirren), only to descend down a power-mad spiral of paranoia, insanity, and death. Director Tinto Brass (himself a porn auteur) uses this bit of history as a springboard into unspooling a lavish, extravagant pseudo-epic, rife with overwhelming sets, costumes, and carnage (dig the motorized decapitator!)--all of which become extensions of Caligula's excessive character. McDowell--who at first seems to be doing a gloss on Alexander DeLarge, clocks in a portrait of murderous tyranny with a mix of cold-blooded conviction and tongue-in-cheek camp. The rest of the cast--including John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole in small roles--adopts the same no-boundaries Method histrionics, which lends the film a fittingly surreal tone. Furthermore, the porn inserts (including two lusty lesbians and a wild, full-blown (pun intended!) orgy scene)--whose integration runs the gambit from clumsy to seamless--are entrancingly sleazy, a complement to Caligula's own prurient pleasures, and an affirmation of our own.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misunderstood masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula is not a porno film. It is a disturbing historical drama and should be viewed as such. I, for one, found this film hard to watch, it is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, along with films like Salo: 120 Days of Sodom and Cannibal Holocaust. The idea that there could be a ruler that forced people to have sex, and so on. Sure, this movie has much nudity...male and female...but this all adds to the film, making it more disturbing. These sex scenes aren't meant for you to whack the weasel to, they are more meant to get a reaction like "Oh my God, we DO live in a good world." Imagine being in a place like Rome in this time, we are just lucky we don't have to live in it. So the movie is not exactly historically significant, but it gives you an idea of what it was like to live in these times. A time no one wants to live in. Also, this movie, like such films as Scarface, is about the fall of man. Caligula was a ruler, and he was on top of the world, then he lost it all. Poof. So if you watch this film, don't think of it as a porno, think of it as a disturbing historical drama. People who see a movie just has sex and just label it a porno and don't try to look deep down into the film, to find meaning and plot are not true movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly mind blowing epic of sleaze and violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Caligola" stars Malcolm McDowell as the Emperor and chronicles his rise and fall as the brief ruler of the Roman Empire.The film focuses heavily on Caligula's infamously deranged sexual practices,as well as those of his contemporaries.It's surly a pretty controversial piece of work which was heavily censored in several countries.I own the original 156 minutes long version which was cut down from the Cannes 210 minute version,which may still exist somewhere as a bootleg.The film is not as bad as it's reputed to be,unfortunately both Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have since expressed regret in participating in the film.It's clear that "Caligola" was directly inspired in look and theme by the vastly superior and even more controversial 1977 Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Salo:The 120 Days of Sodom".Still this is a strong film guaranteed to offend the prudish and the squeamish.The sex scenes are as intense as most of your standard hard core porn,with rampant fellatio(male/female plus homosexual)and actual sexual penetration featured throughout.The film also boasts some fine grue including a castration(with the penis fed to dogs),numerous decapitations and disemboweling,so fans of sleaze and gore won't be disappointed.The lesbian scene between Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner is truly arousing as is the imperial orgy sequence.Overall,I enjoyed this film and you should too,if you are a fan of exploitation cinema.A must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malcolm McDowell is breathtaking!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eager to see this film because I am a huge fan of Malcolm McDowell(even though I have seen very little of his work) and I saw some positive reviews on his performance. I first became familiar with his work when I saw A Clockwork Orange and after seeing him in that film I immediately rated him 3rd in my all time favourite movie stars. I then saw him in Cyborg 3 which was disappointing but his short appearance was legendary acting. Very recently I have seen Caligula and McDowells performance touched me. Usually my top 2 favourite actors were Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro but after seeing McDowells performance in this film I have to say in my opinion he puts them both to shame.Caligula is about a prince (who has the same name as the title of the film)who's grandfather is the lord of the world, Caligula then sees the opportunity to take it all away from the King and he does not let the opportunity pass. Caligula becomes a man of true power and this power turns him into someone evil! with outstanding performances from not only McDowell but also from Peter O'Tool and Helen Mirren Caligula is a great experience.If you ARE AGAINST STRONG Violence AND STRONG SEXUAL PREFRENCES THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU, but if you don't mind all that and you are a fan of Malcolm McDowell then you must see this movie!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I tried to be fair. I looked at the cast which includes some very talented actors, the writer who is supposed to be a intellectual giant of sorts.. I saw this film in the movies, and it stunk. I saw the r-rated VHS version and it stunk, and now, I dumbly rented the "unrated" DVD and it was, I believe very much longer, but stunk just as much. I thought perhaps over a quarter century, I would have grown to appreciate this film more. I do not. Please understand that I have nothing against sex on screen, or nudity on screen or just about anything else on screen, as long as it all comes together and makes a good film. This film is not a good film. It is a real, first class stinkeroo. If I had to pick one film to show to a class (an adult class) as an example of how to make a terrible film, this would be it. I wonder, did John Gielgud or Peter O'Toole ever publish any comments on this film? It would be interesting, I think, to hear their comments. If you have a chance to rent this film, rent the R-rated version, because I think (at least if memory serves me) that it is mercifully, shorter.If you want to watch a low budget film along similar lines, that is not quite as bad as this one, (but still very bad indeed) you might try the less awful "Warrior Queen", which is also, mercifully, shorter. It has lots of nudity and death, but no Gielguds or O'Tooles to waste in its making. They claim that "Caligula" is historically accurate. Perhaps it's true to some extent, but if so, it's a story not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed that I have been able to find this movie at all because it's probably the only pornographic film I'll ever watch. I have no idea how this made it to mainstream theaters. I normally never watch porn at all, but I was willing to make an exception for this movie because it was the only one that I could really find that was in standard movie guides. I remember reading how much Roger Ebert despised this film and then hearing that it was Brad Jones' (Cinema Snob) favorite movie. It's so ridiculous because all he did in his review was talk about how horrible it was.This movie may have at least been tolerable if not for the fact that it goes on forever. It might be the longest porn movie ever made. You could have trimmed all the nudity out to make this an hour and a half. The film becomes too predictable, being nothing but sex scenes over and over. The acting and dubbing is quite poor too. As far as I know, this is in fact a historically accurate film. I don't know quite that much about the real life Caligula. It doesn't matter, because it's awful any way. I consider myself open to new ideas, which is why I saw this. I will now never watch a feature length porn movie the rest of my life! At least I gave it a chance. *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ancient imperial Rome died of perversion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly Malcolm McDowall has been excellently cast as the most nefarious of ancient rulers. Whether you have read historical accounts of his life or Jay Robinson's portrayals in "The Robe" and "Demetrius and the Gladiators", or most notably John Hurt's in " I, Claudius", then you know what a mad man he was. Taking that BBC mini-series to a different level in dramatic liberties, adding various perversions into the story.Starting from the last days of Tiberius (Peter O'Toole, much more lively than the subtle George Baker of "I, Claudius"), this tries to give the impression that Caligula didn't really start going mad until Tiberius began taunting him about being murdered by family members himself. It lacks the motivation of what Caligula was like as a child which through history made him mad from the start.The sexual activity of the film gets boring after a while, showing straight and gay sexual acts of every kind and even having McDowall deflowering a virginal bride on the wedding night and even taking it upon himself to humiliate the groom as well. While not shocking to me, I just found it gratuitous to show that, especially after a scene where Caligula and his court pelt victims of a head chopping machine with eggs right before they get lopped off.It's lavish to look at, much like a Fellini movie, but lacks in real artistic flair. A lengthy orgy scene with Tiberius is tried to be topped later with one when Caligula turns the senator's wives into prostitutes for his palace bordello. There are some moments where I did laugh and do double takes, but mostly, my eyes just rolled.John Gielgud manages to save some dignity by departing after only two scenes. I couldn't even recognize a young Helen Mirren, and I didn't care enough to rewind. But the hand on the fast forward button did come in handy to get through close-ups of the groins of naked women, leading to unnecessary lesbian sex scenes. All I really wanted to see were the historical highlights. The rest of it, well, not so special, and ultimately sleep inducing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gob-smacker of a film that needs to be seen to be believed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charting the titular Roman emperor's rise to power and his descent into madness, Caligula (the unrated version) is a curious beast. A top-class cast star in this lavish big-budget spectacular, written by renowned scribe Gore Vidal, but produced by Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, and directed by erotic movie maker Tinto Brass. The result is a fascinating epic with fantastic production values, some gruesome violence and a whole load of explicit sex.Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (or Caligula for short), as you may be aware, was the tyrannical ruler of Rome from 37AD to 41AD. During his short reign of power, he ensured his place in history with his many acts of depravity, cruelty and sheer madness. Malcolm McDowell is totally believable as the loony leader who shags his sister, makes his horse a member of the senate and forces his senators' wives and daughters into prostitution. Other big names that signed up for this highly controversial movie include (Dame) Helen Mirren, (Sir) John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole.Watching these highly regarded thesps mixing with Penthouse pets performing hardcore lesbian trysts and blow-jobs is a real eye-opener and really has to be seen to be believed. The film, at a running time of two and a half hours, is quite slow going but it's worth persevering! Where else will you get to see McDowell raping a virgin bride and then fisting her husband, or a man being killed, emasculated and then urinated on. What other big budget movie gives you a smattering of dwarf sex, a machine that decapitates prisoners buried up to their necks and a woman using semen as a skin lotion? The film might be a bit hard going at times, but fans of extremely bizarre and trashy movies should definitely see this one if they can.Caligula is by no means a great film (it is overlong, factually inaccurate and at times I was tempted to fast forward through the slower bits to get to the next 'shocking' scene), but it is one of those movies that one needs to witness first hand in order to understand how truly unique and unusual it is. It's a hard one to rate, but I think I'll give it a reasonable 7 out of 10 just for its willingness to go the extra mile to entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the presence of Mcdowell, the dreamy incoherence brought brutally back to earth with XXX &amp; violence, the historical/ahistorical milieu -this could be one Alex Delarge's pornographic daydreams, explored in epic length!'Caligula' is the cum stained comedy of a vain child elevated to the status of a god walking the earth, a petty deity without the inner resources to make his reign anything but one of terror &amp; suffering, leaving his subjects no choice but to rise up &amp; dethrone him...Truly the height of porn-chic, the credit sequence is scarlet typeface on black with portentous choral backdrop readying viewers for the atavistic charnel house to come, but not before that trademark coin-face, the one with bleeding eyes overlaid with Prokofiev's Dance of the Knights, bouncy &amp; sly like our Little boots (while everything else here is fair game, the general consensus rightly holds the score beyond reproach).Plainly aping fellow freak-show Satyricon, Caligula too taps Fellini's sci-fi past instead of Gore Vidal's preferred straight verisimilitude. This is an idea of pagan Rome,a fragmented dream-world loosely based on fact with unreal tangents sprinkled liberally in between fornication, bloodshed &amp; bureaucracy, presided over by our stunted man-child.The shoddy camp chintz scenery establishes a sickly-sweet air,overripe &amp; too bright &amp; just plain off, Flash Gorden meets John Waters,a fetid atmosphere where vipers thrive. It feels like a squalid imitation of something real, right down to the plywood marble columns, cheap &amp; luxurious at once.Everyone's playing dress-up here, children in costume."It doesn't matter" exclaims Caligula at one point. "Its only a show!" Plethoras of naked slave bodies melt into a neon pornotopia decor, denied any individuality outside of objectification, used &amp; discarded at will. The entire ruling class of Rome show such a callous indifference to humanity in fact, removed from it by virtue of position, that scene after scene of vile cruelty is constantly enacted: sliced c*cks &amp; fisted men, giant baroque beheading machines, lesbian golden showers &amp; hermaphroditic penetration - the swine must be shown a firm hand at all times.The grotto scenes offer the most succinct vision for what the filmmakers were going for but which is sadly not sustained through-out. Like entering one of Dante's circles of hell complete with billowing smoke, its an underworld of writhing bodies, torture devices &amp; disembodied screams with roman aristocrats leisurely strolling round discussing the naked art of power (every now &amp; then the Caligula that might've been pops up between the cracks like this).The best performance isn't Mcdowell doing his spoiled-child-from-hell shtick though. Peter O'Toole's loathsome emperor Tiberius easily steals the show, sinking into a pit of self immolating depravity in his final years, literally rotting from within while spitting out words lest he choke on them. Only a lapsed idealist spews this much venom and in Tiberius we see the last vestiges of a great republic before its down-slide into an iron clad boot heel. Caligula has no such context- he's a sheltered uncivilized youth. His cruelty is weightless &amp; banal, a product of boredom. He never had a soul to sell, the opening biblical quote belongs more to the old man Tiberius, a once-goody whittled down into a self-loathing, sadistic monster that O'Toole sells with every bit of scenery he chews. When he goes the spirit of his island fortress goes, deprived of its black animating force. I wish the whole film had been about this guy.Caligula paints a candy coloured burlesque of power, ostentatious pageantry hiding a dreadfully empty centre. Everyone wants power here &amp; will gladly murder for it, hollow cut-outs playing human on the stage of the imperial court. Little Boots wants &amp; gets but only because he has nothing else to do besides fondle his sister.This is no tragedy, he's an empty vessel. Once he's crowned he's clearly at a loss how to use his power beyond masturbatory ends, leading a lazy life of cruel hedonism like Peter Pan with the world's greatest train-set. All too quickly we witness the boredom, the frustration, the spiritual emptiness of unlimited power &amp; what it would be like to truly never grow up. Its like that episode of the Twilight Zone where the crook thinks he's in heaven and gets everything he ever wanted, only to find its actually hell he resides in. The final shot really pounds home the arbitrariness of this charade- one minute orgies in the sun, the next your guts pooled in a gooey mass round your sandals, wondering where it all went south. Ba da boom. Significant too, the idyllic grace before the killing shot, rising to a beautiful crescendo as the state eats another of its own, complete with kiddie slaughter &amp; be-headings. Caligula sees whats coming &amp; naturally embraces it, death being the only rush left. It all happens so fast as to be an afterthought too; just as Caligula &amp; co. hit the ground their entire retinue disperse, the assassins moved onto more important duties while the help quickly rinses the blood off the furniture lest it stain. Ouch- the rat race goes on. There wasn't any other way for the movie to end, really: an upside down, bloodied Gaius staring freeze-framed into the lens as credits crawl up his corpse- It's nihilistically note- perfect &amp; kind of beautiful. The Apollonian I Claudius dealt with its politics in a rational, Masterpiece Theater way, while Caligula the low-brow Dionysian flip-side, revels in the mud like its drooling idiot brother, laughing away those airs of grandeur &amp; rubbing our faces in nothing *but* the p*ss, the sh*t, the vomit, cum &amp; other fallout of those same politics. Uninhibited new guard meeting high-dignity artifice old- I don't see how it could've ever achieved the mainstream recognition it clearly pines for, thank Jupiter. Its failed obsession with respectability, with being a contender inverts it into a hideous three-ring circus instead, a farce.Priceless</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hardcore Porno With A-List Actors - Never Before - Never Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came downstairs one evening, when my mum and dad had gone to bed. My dad was recording something on Channel 4. I checked it out on Teletext, and it seemed appealing - a Roman epic from 1979 about an emperor who goes mad with power. I thought, "why not?" I was certainly not prepared for what I ended up seeing.I get the impression Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought what I thought - that this was going to be a Roman epic and not a porn film. Oh, well. I enjoyed it. The version I first saw was three hours long and had historic scenes interspersed with almost hardcore pornography.Obviously, the sex scenes turned me on, and watching this film felt like an extremely guilty pleasure, but to be honest, I really enjoyed the other scenes too. The film as a whole seemed scattered and not professionally edited, but it had a charm all of its own. I began to feel compassion for Caligula, despite his faults heavily outweighing his strengths.One thing that deserves a special mention is one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever. The main theme is one that provides the essential backdrop to the film, and in this case it paints Caligula as a tragic hero, defeated by his own madness, giving a sympathetic feel, overall.By the end of the film, I felt as though I had been on an epic journey, and I didn't feel shortchanged. It was full of bizarre sex, bizarre violence, and bizarre decisions - phallic symbols aplenty and sexual deviance accompanied by a king mad with power.It's well worth watching, because there is nothing out there like this film. It's a hardcore porno, with A-class actors. Something that will probably never occur again in our lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not porn... brutal truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film and decided to watch it because Malcolm McDowell is in it. The fact that some described it as a "semi porno" gave me a bit of a shock, since McDowell was a well known and successful actor around that time. Why could they get him for such a movie? But I looked aside from that and took the chance because I adore his acting.The movie starts with nudity, and it's beautiful. Two people in love. Young, careless! Nothing like what you're about to see later in the movie. So you get something sweet and pretty that plays with your mind. Having said that, I love the costumes! They are so simple, yet so perfect, that they make you believe this movie.Tiberius played by Peter O'Toole, shows the madness that Rome stood for! A man with all that power. Of course he makes a "whore house"! For all the wealthy men of Rome to have endless pleasures for the money they own! It wouldn't surprise me if people in that time did have this much sex, nothing to do except war over power. But in this movie, it shows what women had no power at all, over themselves or their body. Which is so tragically displayed. These brutal sex scenes, you should not feel pleasure but disgust. Because they show nothing else but discrimination against women in that time.But one woman in this movie comes close to having power, even power over Caligula. His "sister" Drusilla. You can see how much she loves him and knows him. The look she gives him every time she sees him losing it more and more, is outstanding. He just drifts away and loses interests in what really matters. She's like an angel. You can see in a heartbeat that Caligula doesn't care for his wife as much as Drusilla. Which is sad, oh so sad. I love the scene where Drusilla doesn't wake up. When Galigula takes off all her clothes and starts kissing her all over, trying to give her a reason to wake up... heartbreaking. He realizes then, how much she meant to him, and falls apart. Completely. Although Caligula got the power over Rome with the death of Tiberius, you can see that no one respects him. Everyone looks at him like a child with a golden ring, and nothing more. It's only his name that gives him the time he got in the thrown. They know he knows nothing of his doings. And their right all along. People on the streets don't even know his face, because he's so self loving and does nothing for his country! Just stays in his palace, fulfilling his own pleasures. And then suddenly he thinks he can satisfy the people of Rome with yet another "whore house"... great idea? that scene I find a bit silly. But the idea behind it is OK.I made it through this movie because of the beautiful acting of Malcolm McDowell, Terresa Ann Savoy and Helen Mirren. This is truly a sad and tragic story, but it all fades away with these hardcore sex scenes! If they hadn't been so long, detailed and wet, the movie would have been much better to watch. But STILL I think the movie wouldn't have had such affect if the scenes weren't as shocking. I think it only shows the brutal truth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the earliest movies I can remember seeing. The other two being Conan the Barbarian and Halloween. My initial view was a brief 30 minutes or so, caused by a cultural misunderstanding. It would take another 10 years or so before I saw the movie in its entirety. It is interested to see how things have evolved and shows like Rome and the Tudors (movies like the Gladiator, 300 and Alexander) have come in the aftermath of this movie. It would almost seem as the prototype for the dramatic historical fiction narrative. It is graphic in terms of sex and violence and tries to depict Rome in terms of its own morals and not ours. This isn't an everyday Roman's view, but rather a look at lasciviousness of the ruling class.Written by Gore Vidal, starring a pretty good cast. Peter O'Toole (as the dying and diseased Emperor Tiberius), Malcolm McDowell (Caligula) in yet another full frontal movie (Clockwork Orange), Sir John Gielgud and Helen Mirren (thats right the Queen herself).It is nice to see Peter O' Toole and Malcolm McDowell fully embedded in the hedonism of ancient Rome. I can easily see them as downing cartons of wine before scenes and hanging out with John Holmes in the mirror room. It is nice to see the classically trained (Mirren and Gielgud) joining in this Roman foray as well. I can't help but me reminded of Fellini in terms of style. I am thinking of the influence of Roma and Satyricon. It is heavily stylized and the theatricality is quite visible. At time is feels more like theater than a movie. It might lead one to forget that one is watching porn.Even though there is a heavy story about how Rome works and perhaps the other motivations of the young Emperor (sympathetic eye towards Caligula amongst the cruelty and scandals), the politics of Rome and the question of morality, it is still in the context of the incest, sex, orgies, homosexuality, sex, bestiality, sex, masturbation, and pure unabashed hedonism (and sex) of a corrupt and failing system. The authenticity and production quality leads more to the impression of a stylized documentary rather than porn. And just when you are comfortable with that assessment of the movie, it shoves some genitals in you direction just to make sure you remembered this was a porn. Yet despite all this it still somehow works and has some time to develop. As opposed to most porn, it doesn't forgo the story for the sex. The story develops organically, while periodically linked by one of Rome's eccentricities (a.k.a. the sex). The scene where Caligula rips the Emperor's ring off is amazing. The sheer energy of this scene(sound and imagery) sets the mood for the rest of the movie. Powerful imagery such as the metaphor of casting a ship to sea (and thus declaring war) to the frenzied energy of a fellatio. This one is hard to recommend to anyone. This is a view at your own risk kind of movie, not suitable for the TGIF/Fast Food Nation family crowd. It is artistic, graphic and somewhat accurate. I guess its a lot like the history its trying to recreate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageously outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2008 edition of this film in four DVDs is a marvelous piece of information about a film that was scandalous when it came out in its theatrical format. At once there was an "uncut" edition in VHS but the present imperial DVD edition gives three versions of the film; the totally uncut version, the alternative version, the theatrical version and a full DVD of extras. The interest is to see how our societies cannot accept to be shown what history was, cannot accept it to be shown in public, and yet let that historical reality be distributed in private, even commercially, because, among other reasons, there is a lot of money to make with it instead of a confidential black market profit.This film is basically in its total uncut version a pornographic depicting of what the reign of Emperor Caligula Caesar was. The pornography is in the film because it was in the real life of this time, of Rome in this time and of Caligula in particular. Rome was in the first century after Christ, and even probably before and long after a completely morally decadent and economically expanding society based on slavery. This slavery meant that a great proportion of the population was deprived of all freedoms, forced to do all kinds of work and they did not even have the control of their own death that could be the result of any exhaustion caused by overwork, any mistreatment from physical punishment to starvation or from whatever some slave-owners could think of, and any caprice from any slave owner or free Roman citizen that could kill, maim or in anyway torture to death or to temporary vegetative survival of any slave available at this or that time, when this or that perverse caprice, desire and impulse came into the head of the said slave-owner or free Roman citizen. We have to understand that it went even farther than Willie Lynch's recommended practices because in Lynch's case the slaves were supposed to be productive for the profit of the slave-owner to be as high as possible. In Roman times they had so many slaves and slavery was so much part of the general culture, practice and environment that they could deal with an average low productivity with some slaves working harder and some just being the toys of free people, including children.This is atrociously shown with a particular emphasis on the sexual level of this slavery. Slaves, women, men or children, could be used to satisfy any of your phantasms if you were a free citizen of Rome. There is absolutely no limit to that. What's more the Emperor had the full free use of anyone under him in any way he wanted. He could use a simple soldier or legionnaire for his own pleasure that could imply the torturing, raping, maiming in any way imaginable the said soldier or legionnaire at his own hands, or at the hands of any person under his authority. Caligula is one extreme case of such emperors, but by far not the only one. This is fully shown in the uncut version, and mostly censored in the theatrical version. The reasons of this censorship are obvious, though totally unacceptable in a free society. If a film does not satisfy the moralistic standards of our governments, then rating is the way it should be controlled. For a film producer to be X-rated is of course a catastrophe. So they prefer to be R-rated and to cut off some scenes to get that rating, knowing that the VHS version (at the time) and DVD version (today) can distribute and circulate the uncut version. The R- rating is a guarantee that the uncut version will be wanted by the public, at least a wide enough public to make it profitable. The R- rating becomes then the object and subject of some publicity if the communication necessary for that is properly organized. That was the case. This nevertheless is not supposed to hide that this atrocious social and sexual situation has to be seen in political perspective.Caligula is the relapse of the Roman Empire or society into a barbaric state that it had only partly, and even superficially left behind. This slave system was not typically Roman since it existed before and was in fact inherited from the Greeks and even beyond from the Egyptians and all societies that developed from these two centers of civilization. That kind of social order was in fact the result of the emergence of agriculture and cattle husbandry as basic activities somewhere around 10,000 BCE. This development needed division of labor and intense work in some fields like agriculture and various crafts connected to the building "industry". The sexual part of it was only the result of the simple fact that human beings were sexual animals. Sex was nothing but a natural activity like drinking or eating. It is this society that produced Socrates, Plato, Cicero and many others. These philosophers were the advisors of the rulers themselves, including in their sexual phantasms or their torturing pleasures.The film shows more or less, but probably not enough, how political decisions were validated, never how they were made. They were validated by the Emperor who did not even read them. They had been made by the Senate and the various counselors of the Emperor, with very little participation from this Emperor. What some people today consider as the acme of democracy, a Greek word by the way, was in fact the anarchistic dictatorship of a very narrow elite over the whole society. Human rights and civil rights did not exist at all. At best you had some "rights" of the elite as long as the Emperor accepted to respect them. Then if the Emperor did not respect them the only solution was his elimination.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex, Violence and Togas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years there have been a number of movies released that contain explicit sex (Ken Park, Baise Moi and Romance). None of which really need it and they are generally low budget affairs.I was surprised to find out about Caligula, and wanted to see this seventies attempt as a explicit movie was like. Caligula is different, it is a big budget movie that is part porn movie, part Hollywood epic, part bad seventies camp romp. Yet, it was one of the most powerful movies I have seen recently. Sex and violence were explicit and common place in Empirial Rome, and so they must feature in this movie. They are not little inserts but they are the raw emotion that over shadows the plot (maybe there is too much sex really).In Empirial Rome your father had the right to kill you, an Empress once competed with the most famous whore in Rome to see who could sleep with the most men in one night, and the Empress won. Violence and death were public entertainment and emperors lived in fear of their lives while being obeyed instantly.The pure feeling of this movie makes it powerful beyond any other sword and sandals epic made before or after. Historical accuracy is not important, only the fantasy being emperor and the thought experiment of what such a life would do to someone.See it becauseit is differentbecause it is emotional and primalBut don't watch Mel Brookes' History of World before watching this or you will probably laugh too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still after 22 years, the most intense and erotically powerful and symbolic scene in this expensively lavish and beautifully scored violent historical film is the one that ends the orgy brothel boat scene: where two senators' wives (played by 1975 Penthouse Pet of the Year Anneka di Lorenzo and another Penthouse Pet) graphically and enthusiastically fellate a well-endowed young Roman citizen, at the end of which "Anneka di" lasciviously proceeds to consume the young man's climax but not before exposing the healthy bubbling dollop to us movie viewers in an extreme on-camera close-up. When viewed on the movie theater's huge screen, this particular scene is dizzyingly overpowering, and truly epitomizes the excess of power, wealth, cruelty, lust, and tyranny that surrounded the emperor Caligula's reign--therefore strangely acting as the entire film's centerpiece and focal point--but also the excess that surrounded the very making of this hugely expensive and protracted production. If there could be a preview or summation of the entire film, this brief 2-3 minute clip would be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this on one of the many HBO channels, one night, a month or so back. It was absolutely fantastic! The one thing that really added a lot of character to the protagonist, was how he led his wife on his leash, while he secretly lusted after his long-time mistress, who he couldn't have because she was Egyptian. This really dulls down the non-stop killing machine, which most characters of this sort turn out to be throughout the film. Otherwise, he's an all-around nasty dude, killing people and setting others up for the fall, until he finally meets his by his own uncle's hand. Elsewhere, I thought the little brothel at the beginning was far-out! A real avant-garde scene, which set the mood and atmosphere for the rest of the film. Nicely done and woven into the story, I thought.BTW, Kudos to McDowell who's an excellent but very underrated actor. He and several other notable faces were what separated this from the rest of its contemporaries, in that the acting and dialogue actually had some quality to it too. A real plus! A must-see for all those who are into underground or exploitation cinema.</fullReview>

It's got buckets of blood, courtesy of beheadings, disembowelings and so on and so forth. It's got sex throughout. And face it, the hardcore sex that Guccione filmed &amp; inserted is terrific - even Leonard Maltin added an extra star in his rating because of it! The hardcore sex comes mostly near the end of the film when Caligula realizes that Rome needs to fill its coffers, so he makes the senator's wives become prostitutes when he turn the senate into a giant brothel. If you're a true fan of exploitation B Films, don't buy into that garbage the other reviewers chime in about how this isn't Ben Hur and it's production values are trash. They're wrong.

		<shortDescription>Caligula's world is a dark dream-I champion this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Caligula a lot and will always rush to its defense. here is why.1. cinematography-is almost dream like. Great mammoth, yet cheesy sets. Like a very sick costume drama.2. Caligula's world is a dark dream, do you like dark films-while it is uneven(most films are) it succeeds here.3. it uses violence and sex exploitatively and with equal zeal. While many films pull their punches Caligula is very much unabashedly in your face. Yet as over the edge as it is from all accounts, it's no exaggeration.4. it is well cast. Teresa Ann Savoy is a beautiful and effective actress as you will find but is in no other american films-really, with so many euro influences I don't regard Caligula as an american film. Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole are all great here and play this sick costume drama for all its worth-O'Toole and McDowell in particular. I love the scene where after trying to half-heartedly poison Caligula he states while leaving "you're not looking well today,not at all"5. the score is beautiful and lush.6. time has been kind to this film. A. many of us saw it on release but just didn't get it--many were merely focused on the porn inserts. B. films have become so homogenized , predictable and safe C. through horror and exploitation films many americans have a new appreciation-if not love- of Italian/Euro film-making.7. Its a curious fact that many ridiculously conform when confronted with decadence. Yes we can become real pigs if given the chance. In many ways this is what Caligula is all about. This with great execution is why Caligula never rings false. Also this was made in 1980 and shows that mindset. So if you want to flee the traditional, forgo the R rated version and try Caligula. It will not remind you of another film before or since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most misunderstood movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula is not a masterpiece of modern cinema, or even that good a movie. What it is is a no-holds-barred-in-your-face-boot-to-the-head glimpse at the Roman empire during the rule of the most infamous Caesar in history. Most of the negative comments I've read deal with the movie's excessive violence and sexual depravity, and certainly there are mass amounts of both. But that's what the movie is about.You think it was too violent, too disgusting? It's gratuitous sex and sadistic violence made you sick to your stomach? That was exactly the point. Caligula is no fairy tale story of the glory of Rome. It is an examination of the debauchery that pervaded everyday life. Many condemn Bob Guccione for turning the film into a cornucopia of sex and violence. I believe that someone like Guccione *had* to be involved. To use a more reserved filmmaker would lessen the impact, and therefore cheapen the message.Caligula is not for everyone. If you are disturbed by strong visual images, then steer clear. But if you want a more accurate picture of life in ancient Rome, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the "uncut" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out (almost smokey) look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it "paganography") wears thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. If you want a far better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century watch the mid-70's BBC production of I, CLAUDIUS instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look somewhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but "Caligula" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence....If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever.You've been warned</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Car Wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early this morning I started watching one of the most notorious cult films ever made, Caligula (1979). The full uncut version is available on YouTube (without an 18 and over warning! Kids, do NOT watch this! Seriously!!!). I saw the first half hour of it, tried to go to sleep afterward, and I couldn't (it disturbed me that much). Then I finally went to sleep and resumed the rest of the film when I woke up. It is disturbingly pornographic and violent, and shows the basest of human nature. The back story behind the film is even more interesting than the film itself since it had a lot of big names and blurred the line between mainstream and adult. The 70s were a time of experimentation, but this went way beyond that and it is truly decadent and over the top, showing the licentiousness and depravity of Imperial Rome. There are gruesome things in it that will turn your stomach and wall to wall sex that was thrown in without the actors' knowledge after principal photography was completed. So many of the people involved disavowed this film because it devolved into a different kind of animal than what the screenwriter (Gore Vidal, of all people) envisioned. It's like a car wreck, so horrible, but at the same time, you can't help but crane your neck to look at it. It was done with a lot of style, impressive sets and costumes, and even had a bit of dark humor. It is a fascinating yet bizarre and shocking picture, one of the darkest I've ever seen, despite it being a big uneven mess. The only good people in the film get killed off and the rest are so corrupt and evil. However, you have to consider the time it was made and the time period that it depicts. In a way I have to admire the balls of the filmmakers. Very few filmmakers today take those kinds of risks, to shatter taboos, and dare to show the ugliness of humanity. It is mainly cult filmmakers that make midnight movies such as these that do.I draw the line at this film. It's one of those that you see once and once is enough. The only other one I can think of that goes beyond this is Salo, and I am definitely not brave enough for that one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An historically-based movie that most wanted to see, but, no one wanted to speak of!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teen, I remember all of the controversy surrounding this film being pulled from theaters and cut-back/edited-down from a XXX rating to X, then, finally to R...but, by then, no one wanted to see it.In 1979, I was thirteen and really didn't understand any of this. But, I did understand that film makers can make a gory movie; and, film makers can make a pornographic movie...but, if a film maker makes a gory-pornographic movie, everyone in America (at least, if not the world) pisses themselves, forgets who they are, and, cries themselves to sleep!?!? I read about this in the newspaper, and, saw reports of it on TV!I finally saw this movie in 1987, and, I was amazed at the quality of this production that media made me feel and believe is such a terrible movie on every level. The props are great and extravagant; costumes look authentic (when characters are actually wearing them); the script (by Gore Vidal) is accurate according to what I've read of Gaius Caligula, and, of other Roman Caesars, such as Nero; and, mainly and most importantly...only Bob Guccione and a handful of others actually had the guts to make such a film.The acting, by such heavyweights as the great Peter O'Toole as the crazed, rotting-faced syphilis-carrying Tiberius Caesar; the Award-Winning John Gielgud as Nerva (not the Roman Emperor of the same name much later in history); the classy and ever-beautiful Helen Mirren as Caesonia; the One-Hit-Wonder and beautiful Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla; and, of course, the 'almost-always-villainous' yet 'definitely-always-talented' Malcolm McDowell as the cruel and megalomaniacal Caligula Caesar.I don't condone or condemn anything about this movie as it's based upon historical records (just like "Mark of the Devil" 1970). This movie contains a lot of grotesquely-horrible scenes of torture; murder; execution; etc. As well as scenes of graphic sex, both hetero-and homosexual; rape; orgiastic sex; and, even hints at animal-contact...BUT - how can anyone possibly and fully understand the Roman Empire, or, "ANY" ancient culture or nation lead by a tyrant, if they so choose to, unless it is presented in the way that this film is - the way it really was...graphic and without any inhibitions whatsoever!?!? There's really nothing in this movie that people haven't read about in a newspaper or a book; or, heard about on the news. In fact, all of that is usually much worse than what happens in this movie. If you're prudish, this movie is not for you. There's very little sanitizing of history going on here!Some of the reviews of this movie are entirely understandable if those people are appalled; but, they'd probably complain, anyway, if all of this "Extreme Nastiness" (Malcolm McDowell in "A Clockwork Orange") wasn't there...because, it wouldn't be realistic to the Romans. It's no different than making a graphic film of the early Native Americans cutting-out of the hearts of enemies; or, the Incas eating someone's heart; or, even the French during the inquisition cutting-off sexual organs and burning them when someone was accused of witchcraft (these are all factual). The meaning of 'primitive' means exactly that; and, in primitive times with primitive cultures, this/that sort of thing(s) happened.Imagine some clown making a "G" rated movie about Joseph Stalin; Adolph Hitler; Pol Pot; Saddam Hussein; or, any other tyrannical leader!?!? That would be propaganda and BS with an agenda! This movie has no agenda, only reality of that period in that empire...actual-actuality!This movie is graphically-detailed in most every way imaginable that applies to an ancient culture. It's repugnant, deplorable, perverted, pathetic, and, deviant in every which-way possible according to the people of today who either refuse that such things once occurred; or, they're just more likely to only believe and understand it in private, and, that's where the word 'hypocrite' comes from, boys and girls.Every negative adjective likely applies here...but, despite what people think, if people even 'think' anymore, this movie is historical, and, to hide parts of history, even the smallest parts, is lying.I give this historically-accurate movie '8 Stars' for everything - accuracy to written history (screenplay); props; acting; casting; believability (if you choose to be realistic); and, all else dealing with production...and, as I wrote before...someone with the balls to even make this.However, I give it a BIG "0" (A GIANT GOOSE EGG) as a 'date movie.' Don't show a date, especially a first-date (or, a dummy who's naive of history), this movie as they may think quite oddly of that, and, of you. The same goes for Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Salo" (1975), which is not as graphic, but, more disgusting in a fecally way than "Caligula.""Gladiator" is a great movie set in Roman times and it's violent and very popular. "Deep Throat" is probably the most well-known and popular pornographic movie ever made. However, if you mixed these two movies into one, popularity turns to controversy, and, you pretty-much have another "Caligula."I'm betting there isn't a history teacher/professor on the planet who hasn't seen this, and, every other movie I've mentioned in this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as it could have been, but I was entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the 160 minute version, which may have been a mistake on my part (or not?) because it had all of the pornography that wasn't in the original script added to it. If the film had had more direction, if it truly had buckled down and focused on Caligula and simply had the sex as an *element* of the film and not an overall theme --though that may have been difficult as the Romans were more liberal than many at the time, even more so than the neighboring Greeks when it came to sex in some aspects--and while that may paint the background, I do not think it was really necessary to be a part of nearly every single scene. Naked slaves and worker bees I can understand, and of course Caligula's reign did have a very promiscuous color to it, but there were, in my opinion, much more pressing matters that the film only touched upon that could have served as more entertaining. Him naming his horse as senator was obviously a joke and with Malcolm McDowell's wonderful acting you are left guessing how many of his actions are due to mental instability and how many of them are as a means to belittle the system that he rules over.Don't take this the wrong way, readers, but I never thought I would have ever rooted for a brother-sister couple like I did with McDowell's Caligula and Savoy's Drusilla. Their chemistry was beautiful and lovely, their sibling bond plunged into erotic and romantic waters which never ebbed up until the very end. Again, it is very, very weird to me that I *felt* for them during their time on screen and wished them to be happily married (shivers) but somehow McDowell always seems to make the most taboo into a "Eh, why not? It can't hurt". I recommend you watch a fairly well-edited version instead of the full 160 minute slog. Too much porn ruined the story telling. Goddamn Guccione. There's no way a film like this could ever be made again with the same Shakespearean seriousness, stifling awkwardness, and on- screen lasciviousness that for the latter may be a good thing in the end.</fullReview>

It was actually even more extreme than I expected with orgies,anal fisting and "wall of death" but still nothing mind blowing. I guess nothing surprises me after seeing Sal? o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom)I was drawn to this movie because of the exploitative elements but while watching I have to say the plot was really what kept my interest during the film. So plot wise it was good. Acting was also very solid with Malcolm McDowell as Caligula which was a nice surprise.Overall its kinda neat, sure it has boobs &amp; gore but the plot is also there and its a well made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caligula is in many respects a great bad movie, full of overacting and the always humorous spectacle of distinguished actors juxtaposed with pornographic inserts. Although no one would confuse this with I, Claudius, it's still worth a laugh.Malcolm McDowell plays hyper-depraved Roman Caligula, who becomes emperor after the death of Tiberius. McDowell chews scenery by the Corinthian column, matched only by Peter O'Toole, who appears to be drunk for his entire performance. Other actors who find themselves in this mess include Helen Mirren, who despite playing "the most promiscuous woman in Rome" has no real nude scenes. Compared to the porno actresses around her, she seems positively chaste.Overall, this film works better as comedy than as sexploitation. The sex, although explicit, is nothing you haven't seen before. Better to watch it for those wacky Romans, with their head clippers, horse-men, dwarf sex, and imperial brothels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is something really strange about this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to say about this movie, to be honest... It seems to me that there are two movies in one. There is a tremendous cast and great performances by Malcolm Macdowel, Helen Mirren, etc side by side with a porn flick, with close ups of vaginas and penises and lousy porn actresses! I am not exactly shocked about the nudity, explicit sex, orgies, that is all part of the story. That's how roman emperors lived according to historical records. What's wrong is that there is no fluidity in the way the images are shown. OK, I am finding the plot interesting, but then all of the sudden, there's a vagina. What am I suppose to do with that? Get aroused? I get distracted from the plot right? On the other hand, I am jerking off like nuts with the sex images, but then, all of the sudden here comes John Gielgud with one of his speeches, what a turn off!!! It looks like there were two different people directing this. Could have been a great flick if they showed it realistically, but they completely screwed up. Total mess!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kind of antidote to "Quo Vadis" I watched this fascinating film last night. It's probably a more realistic depiction of Ancient Rome and its debauchery, which is shown in explicit detail. There is the kernel of a great film here, with stunning sets and costumes, Oscar calibre performances from Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell, and a script by Gore Vidal. Sadly the director was replaced by Bob Guccione from Penthouse, who was producing the film, because the film wasn't explicit enough for Bob's taste. So he re-edited it, and added some completely gratuitous hard-core porn sequences. The result is something of a mess (if you excuse the pun), but the controversy ensured the film's big box-office success. This is the first time I've seen the uncensored version and it is pretty full-on! Sad really because this could have been a great film instead of just being an infamous one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge sprawling epic misfire about the life and times of Caligula was written by Gore Vidal (who had his name removed), directed by Tinto Brass (who was thrown off the production and "finished" by Bob Guccione who added hardcore sex scenes). The film was never truly finished, production was just stopped with sequences never completed and others never filmed, it was simply thrown together because of strict release date and released on an unsuspecting public (much like the unsuspecting cast who only learned off the added hardcore after the fact). This is a unique road accident of a movie that really needs to be seen by anyone interested in films and film history.Is it any good? I honestly have no idea. I originally saw the R rated version of this film in a mostly empty theater. I was horrified and enthralled by what I was seeing because I had never seen anything so spectacularly wild. Years later I saw the uncut film on video (the only remotely adult film I ever watched with my parents) and continued under its spell.As I said the film is a road accident. Its an odd mix of wonderful scenes, poorly edited sequences, thoughtful dialog, over the top performances and a wonderful sense that more is more. Sequences begin and end at times randomly. Things happen that make no sense, people have sex and are killed in horrible fashion. There has never been another film like this and I hope there is never another.Anyone with any sense will hate the film and be offended, but then again there is something about the film that has made it survive for 30 years as a well known film when so many others have gone by the wayside. I doubt that you will be bored for long at any time in the film.Truly one of the most unique films in history</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No masterpiece, just great epic sleaze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the 1960s filmmakers couldn't get away with too much when it came to things like sex and violence. Even then you couldn't show much, but times they were a changin'. Throughout the 1970s there were plenty of films with blood and gore, nudity and sex, and foul language. Not that all these things are everyone's cup of tea, which is just fine, but it was a step further in showing real life. But then some films went really, really far with it to the point where people would get physically ill, pass out, protest, warn their family and friends, etc. 'Caligula,' which ultimately is just one big expensive porn movie, is such a film. It was extremely controversial at the time and was unsurprisingly cut to shreds and not shown again on a large screen for some time. Even today, in the 21st Century, this film is utterly shocking and will undoubtedly turn off many viewers. But if you're like me and like to see those films that are supposed to be so dangerous and forbidden then you've come to the right film. Now available in it's full X Rated version, you can see it the way it was seen decades ago. Whether or not that's a good thing is up to the individual.Pros: For the most part the performances are fine. Impressive sets and decor. Stunning costumes. Good, at times really powerful, musical score. Moves at a good pace for most of the running time. Many memorable moments of craziness and images that will drop your jaw to the floor. Fair amount of camp value. Like them or not, the sex scenes are well done. Nicely photographed.Cons: Really just an excuse to show lots of nudity and sex. Some scenes, one in particular that I won't spoil, are really drawn out. Some really hammy acting. Final thoughts: This movie will never be hailed as a classic (Maybe cult classic), nor should it be seen by everybody. What it is is a film that must be seen to be believed. Some will hate it and regret seeing it, others will enjoy it on some level, but one thing is for sure you won't be able to take your eyes off of it and will never forget it.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what can only be described as one of the most notorious and audacious major films ever to be produced, the very short reign of one of Rome's most infamous rulers is depicted. McDowell plays the title figure, a young man whose family has mostly died or been killed off and who inherits the title of Emperor of Rome when his grandfather O'Toole passes on. Already involved in an incestuous relationship with his sister Savoy, he searches for a mate and happily settles on "the most promiscuous woman in all of Rome" Mirren. Once firmly entrenched in the scheme of power, he begins ridding himself of all enemies and perceived enemies and torments, or has killed, anyone who doesn't suit him. As his horror show escalates, the few remaining statesmen of Rome consider whether assassination might be the answer. That's the story in a nutshell though it takes this movie two and a half hours to tell it and it tells it rather disjointedly thanks to some careless editing by the producer (director Brass was shut out of the final editing.) McDowell is fairly enthralling in his role and seemingly willing to do everything from frolicking half-nude (and at least one time completely) to urinating on camera to raping a virgin to fisting a young man, though he did refuse to film a man-on-man rape scene (something he would later portray, in a fashion, in 1993's "I'll Sleep When I Die". What? It was more acceptable to appear to cram his hand inside a man rather than his penis?!?) Because of the sensationalistic nature of the film, he sometimes overdoes it, occasionally getting close to having his own personal "Mommie Dearest", but generally he turns in a strong performance. Mirren, who doesn't appear until well into the film, is interesting to watch, though she really doesn't have many lines. Savoy is here for her body and, on that level, she delivers. Her acting is adequate at best. O'Toole, done up in a fright wig and syphilitic makeup, gives his scenes some weight, but it's jarring to see him playing in a pool with several naked young men and women (his "little fishies".) Gielgud appears briefly as one of his confidantes and escapes from the film before his reputation can be too badly tarnished. Steiner, head shaved and gaunt, is decent as one of McDowell's advisors. Placido, a very attractive young man, has the unfortunate distinction of being the frequent object of McDowell's wrath, simply because he is in love with the lovely D'Angelo. Several centerfold models appear, frequently naked, as featured extras. It's all played out amid some spectacular sets and vivid costumes in an attempt to appear Fellini-esquire. What was intended to be a deeply dramatic spectacle, penned by Gore Vidal, is instead a lavish, but garish, parade of blood, skin, depravity, perversity and pornography, since the final cut (complete with added XXX scenes) was engineered by Penthouse publisher and the film's producer Guccione. That is not to say that the film isn't eye-poppingly captivating in a "can't look away", shock value sort of manner. Several scenes occur which are practically unforgettable. Unfortunately, the way it was put together, it winds up as a series of vignettes, reveling in squalor, but with no strong narrative drive to make the journey worthwhile. Some truly splendid music, cribbed from classical composers, makes the imagery seem better than it is at times. The film, massively successful despite limited release due to obscenity laws and internal squabbling among its creators, remains one of the very few films to blend major movie stars and pornography, though the mainstream actors limit their participation to some nude scenes and implied sex. Sadly, the viewer knows little more about the Emperor in question when the film is over than when it began because someone forgot to flesh out the story while they were unveiling all the flesh. Though it's worth viewing just for the sheer jaw-dropping content, it is not for the squeamish. Gorings, impalings and other torments abound and every other frame features frontal nudity or kinky, graphic sex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable! But . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be the only person in the world who has figured out what this movie really is. Yes it is a porno of course but it's more than that. Brace yourselves ladies and gentleman. It's a comedy! Could it be? Really? Granted it would make it the most sickest, depraved, most-outrageously unfunny comedy of all time but it is a comedy nonetheless. Think about it for one second. His little boots hanging from his bed, the thing with the horse, his sister calling him little boots, and especially the scene with him stamping the documents over and over as Caesar of Rome, the scene with the senators making him a God, the "conquest of Britain" scene, and so on and so on. The sex scenes are so erotic they blow your mind thanks to the beautiful Penthouse Pets and the violence is the most demented and sadistic I've ever seen. This one was way better than A Clock Work Orange IF REPEAT IF you are interested in those things and those things alone. I tell you this guy was one disgusting, crazed, megalomaniac probably the biggest and unabashed one in all of history bigger than Hitler and Stalin put together as far as personality goes. The very fact that Rome allowed this nut to take and hold power explains why Rome fell even after 1000 years of glory and purportedly this was due to of all things lead poisoning! It appears Rome used a lot of lead in their drinking cups and this caused extreme insanity and eventually death which affected many of their Imperial Emperors like Caligula. In any event this is one that has to be seen to be believed. Not for classroom purposes or entertainment but for insight into the real Rome and the end results of madness and power mongering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years and years I'd heard about this film - and how horrible it was.... how great it was.... how nasty &amp; perverse it was... how tame it was....So, I finally bought it (on ebay) in the unrated version....Well, the acting is actually very good.... Much of the cast is well known - Helen Mirrin, Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole and I'm sure that there are others.... Some of the cast is only moderately known - only from their layouts and spreads in Penthouse magazine.Some have painted this movie as being gratuitous in the use of sex and violence and gore... NOT! It is a fairly accurate depiction of what the Roman empire is reported to have been like in written history....Was some of the nudity and hard core sex (seen in the unrated version) over the top? Not really.... Did it add to the story? Not really.... Did it detract from the story? Not really.... it was all good depictions of what that time and area was like...Malcolm McDowell puts in a smashing turn as the titular Caligula Caesar... being able to show you his insanity and how unstable he is reported as being.... he slips with ease from anger to insanity to clarity to depravity to whatever emotion is required of him...If you are NOT into seeing numerous naked men and women engaging in some luke-warm to steaming hot scenes - including major hard core sexual intercourse and the so-called 'money shots' that this film has - rent/borrow/view the rated version.... it will be a little cleaner and less offensive.... if those types of scenes do not bother you or you enjoy seeing those hard core sex scenes - go for the unrated version...The movie is good, the characters are spot on and the eye candy - male and female is hot, hot, HOT! Some of these men and women are straight (and maybe not so straight!) out of porn - or should have followed up on a career in the skin flicks..... One man is memorable in the size and capacity of his member and what he could do with it - he'd have made a fortune in porn - gay or straight....In all - about a 7 out of 10...</fullReview>

Although I must say that I am convinced that Peter O'Toole only did this movie because Richard Harris dared him to. Oddly enough, the true beauty of this film is not the orgies or castrations, but the fact that it manages to take itself very seriously which I find amazing. I am a worse person for having seen this.

		<fullReview>(Spoilers Herein) The infamous Caligula. Labeled as "the most controversial movie in history". Even it's actors were allegedly appalled by the film (did all of them even see it?). And there are reviews a mile long all over the internet about how "rediculously bad" this film is. Here are my thoughts; Although I have mixed emotions about it, I liked it. I can say with all honesty, that I have never seen anything quite like it, anywhere before. (SPOILERS)The premise is as follows; a young budding man takes the already corrupted throne of power from Tiberius, who is sick and dieing. He makes the love of his life (his sister)his unofficial "queen", and allows the power of his new found authority to go to his head. After running the might empire into the ground, a conspiracy conspires against him and he is assasinated (along with his family). Another page in Roman history is turned. I feel it's "king of bad cinema" reputation is highly overrated and incorrect. Is it revolutionary in idea? Not really. Is it the worst film I've ever seen? No way. This type of period piece has been done many times before. The 'power corrupts' story and the 'decadent portrait of the pagan Romans' theme is pretty much a universal theme in the sword and sandal epics of American Cinema (see Ben Hur,Gladiator,etc.) But the Excesses of Rome were never quite as in your face as they are here. Although many would disagree, I feel I can take this film's plot line somewhat seriously. It has a story-structure in which I must admit, does grow dimmer by the end of the film, but has wonderful actors, all giving a very serious and credible performance. It appears to have a budget, with gigantic sets, hundreds of extras (mostly Italian I believe)and it has a heart, of sorts, in the caligula character, and his control over Rome and it's plight. This alone is more than most Arnold Schwartzenegger(sp?) movies have, but nobody seems to spend a lot of time bashing these flicks. Although Caligula the character, is despicable, and does some pretty terrible things, I felt as though, in the film, he was only the product of the society that gave him that position. Malcom Mcdowell(sp?) portrays an eagerness, to his soon coming of power, at the beginning of the film and then lets his grasp on reality immediately start slipping when he takes the throne. I enjoyed seeing the softer side of Caligula at the beginning (when he is shown frolicking in the forest with his lover).Much of what you heard about the sex in this movie is true. The sex is real and all of it seems to be shot as though the director (Bob G.)wasn't even aware of censorship laws. In terms of intensity, you won't find anything here that you didn't see in "In the Realm of the Senses", in which many, including myself, deem as an artistic classic. For those of you who haven't seen that film, this means real penetration, real mouth to genital contact etc. In terms of content, I saw a lot of shots that by themselves, look like they were shot by someone who deals in the business of sex (and fetishisms; the urination scene for instance). Personally I did not even really feel the excess of sex scenes in the film until the final orgy scene, where I admit, it did seem slightly gratuitus. Sometimes I felt the director was trying to use the sex scenes as metaphors for the story line as we realized the full excesses of Caligula's corrupted reign. And that we the viewer were also indulging in Rome's excesses with Caligula, and we were supposed to feel uncomfortable about that. There seems to be myths about the film that go unchallenged; First, there is no 210 min. print in commercial existence. Only the "unrated cut" (which is the one I have seen), and the "R" rated cut. Second, contrary to many user-posts on IMDb, there are no scenes of bestiality (although he's uncomfortably fond of his horse), there are no scenes of pedophilia (child-sex)(although there is a verbal reference to it in the line: "do you like little boys?" "No, big boys-my soldiers")and there are NO scenes of necrophilia (although it is perhaps suggested with Drusilla). All in all, Caligula's flaw seems to be excess, and a lack of control over something that was too big for anyone to hang onto. But then again, that could be said of the Roman Empire... And whether the film is historically accurate or not, there certainly were rulers of ancient Rome who were capable of this kind of behavior and probably did act this way. Not for the squeamish, but for those who are used to contemporary sex and violence, give it a shot. Also check out "Queen Margot" for another view of a different corrupted empire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From what I understand of the history of this film, Franco Rosellini started to make the film, but needed more money. He went to Bob Guccione (among other things, editor in chief of Penthouse magazine), who agreed, but at a cost. The cost is the addition of more sex, including some scenes directed by Guccione himself.The result is a mixed bag, the scenes with story, presumably directed by Tinto Brass, are wonderful. Then there are scenes that have no story, appear to be filmed with a different grade of film, and add nothing to the movie except skin; I assume that these were done by Guccione. I would love to see a reedited version, without Bob Guccione's scenes, but it will never happen, since Penthouse is the one holding the rights to the movie.Note: I'm not saying "take out all the sex, and the movie would be good", I'm saying take out Guccione's sex, and leave in Brass's. Some of the scenes I attribute to Brass are quite graphic, such as Tiberius's living sculpture and the Ship of Noble Prostitutes. These scenes are not only interestingly filmed, but are important parts of the story. Guccione shows me nothing I can't find better by getting a porn flick.So with that caveat, and with the warning that people offended by explicit sexuality or graphic violence should not watch this film (and that's graphic violence in the disturbing, matter-of-fact way that Italian Cinema seems to do so well), I'd recommend this film. It's an interesting exploration of the intersection between madness and power, as well delving into some depravity that you don't see every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Caligola" is a movie that leaves speechless.The presence of four very earnest thespians (McDowell,Gielgud,O'Toole and Mirren) is weird beyond comment:to my knowledge,it's the only overtly hardcore movie which features actors who have also played with great mainstream directors ...and Skahespeare on stage.Director Tinto Brass claimed that most of the sex scenes were added unbeknownst to him.Actually Tinto Brass's two more famous movies follow the same pattern:-the notorious "salon Kitty" which was released about two or three years before,was a pale imitation of Visconti's "la caditi dei degli" (1969),using two of the Italian master's actors ,Ingrid Thulin and Helmut Berger.-and "Caligola" resembles "Fellini-Satyricon"(1969) ;had Fellini's work not existed,maybe one would have found in Brass's work some kind of originality.Of course McDowell is impressive:he was ideally cast as the emperor,but the scenes of orgy are overlong and are not suited for cine buffs ;tortures scenes repel -they were influenced by Pasolini's "salo" (1975),but one feels none of the pain and despair of the murdered director.Caligola was the subject of one of Albert Camus's play.If you cannot attend a performance,reading the book will reward you more than Brass's pornographic peplum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read about this on IMDB before renting it. I assumed that the people complaining were a bunch of american prudes who have been conditionned by their media to respond with disgust to male nudity (but not female nudity), and that a great movie could be hiding behind a few penis shots.It's not the case. Some people are calling this pornographic: I disagree. Pornography, in the common definition attributed to adult videos, still tries to show SOME beauty in sexuality (which is why I prefer softcore skin flicks, btw: it's almost all about the beauty of sexuality). This is Ugly Pornography, something entirely different. This is satyriasis coupled with destructive nihilism. Something straight out of a nightmare.The most repulsive moment for me was when Tiberius smells wine in a guard's breath. He orders a few guards to tie his penis tightly with a small rope (so that he cannot pee) and force him to drink a barrel of wine through a funnel. This isn't suggested violence, you are SHOWN this, you actually SEE his penis tied painfully (I cringed), and then you SEE the emperor cutting him open after 20 minutes, and the wine pouring out like a fountain.Now obviously, this is what the director wanted: he wanted to show you the decadence of Rome at the time, and you'd think I shouldn't hate his movie for being realistic in a way. Perhaps, but I can't bring myself to not hate it.I won't rate this movie, because I'm still not sure if I should punish the movie's merits as a film (not that a vote on a movie website matters) due to the horrible content, but I do have one suggestion to anyone reading this and who hasn't seen the movie yet: stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob Guccione's epic production stands to this day as one of the most notorious movies ever made. Malcolm McDowell is the vicious, maniacal Caligula, emporer of Rome, who enjoys passing the time engaged in hetero and homosexual rape, beastiality, incest with his sister, murder, torture, scatology and dismemberment, while his colleagues try and figure out a way to get rid of him. A few steamy softcore and hardcore sequences (featuring many PENTHOUSE pets) are literally swallowed up in ugliness, violence and depravity the likes of which hadn't seen the light of day since Pasolini's SALO. Good performances from an astonishingly high-scale cast, some gorgeous photography and impressive production design are all that keep one from gagging. It's certainly never boring, with enough mayhem, weirdness and T&amp;A to fill a dozen Russ Meyer and John Waters movies, but difficult to enjoy as anything other than a grotesque curiosity. Definitely one of those movies often referred to as an "endurance test," and absolutely NOT for the squeamish. Who would ever have thought Peter O'Toole was capable of being this repulsive? Original screenplay by Gore Vidal (!), who sort of has his name removed from the movie, as does renowned erotic director Brass, who's credited only with "Principal Photography". Many of the hardcore sex scenes were added later by Guccione and Co. R rated version runs nearly an hour less than uncut version, and is incomprehensible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never a movie, not ONE movie, that even remotely touchedthe explicit nature of this one. The explicitness is, without doubt,the aspect of this film that I will remember the longest.In my mind, there are two kinds of movie: the "standard" movie andthe "X-rated" movie. Both have in essence the right to exist. I am speaking of course of the high budget, main audience, majorfeature film; in the likes of 90% of the movies we regularly see...And of the, low-budget, mass-produced, pornographic flics of theanonymous masses. -- I have NEVER seen a film in which these two were united; untilthis ONE exceptional movie.Let there be no doubt about it: This is one hell of an EXPLICITmovie. It will show you scenes of extreme sexuale violence, thelikes of which whould put a smile an "the Marquice the Sade?s"lips. It will show you orgies in which no bodily fluid is spared.People are tortured to death.... in real time! Well, you catch my drift.But... there is a totally different side to "Caligola". It had hugeproduction cost! I casts some very fine actors, who perform theirparts with perfection. It has an intriging, fabulous, story aboutPower and the abuse of it. It puts you back to the Rome of twothousand years ago. I is one of the grandest movies made.Thus, I marvel... What great courage of the makers, achieving thecombining of these two in the same movie!If you have an open mind, this is the thing to see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I believe that anyone who says that this is an accurate depiction of ancient Rome has done little reading about the period. Costuming errors abound and the use of glass is hysterically incorrect. The second problem is that, I, Claudius not withstanding (Robert Graves made a lot of stuff up), we have very little information about this era. Taking the word of Suetonius, who had an axe to grind, would be like using the National Enquirer to understand the life of Diana Spencer. We do not even know for sure whether thumbs up or down meant life or death. Okay on to the film. Without a doubt this movie has the biggest budget of any porno film I've ever seen. Peter O'Toole and Sir John are lucky in dying in the first 20 minutes. Malcolm McDowell is excellent as always and Helen Mirren puts in her usual stellar performance. The sets are beautiful, if inaccurate (Romans painted their statues in life-like colors for one instance), likewise the costuming (Roman matrons were dressed with far more modesty). I also was amused at the bad ADR. It looks almost like dubbed Godzilla movie and the music, in a word, sucks. Someday someone will make a film that combines the wonderful writing and acting of the British mini-series, I, Claudius, and the budget of this horrible movie. I hope it's soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not THAT Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, I've found that "Caligula" is not that bad of a movie, especially if you get past the sexual stuff (which most never do). Also, I don't find the violence that bad either. Sure, it was for 1979, but not for 2001. I've seen worse in other movies.Many have said that the acting was terrible, but I found this not to be. Sometimes it seemed forced, but I think the reason why it seems bad is because the actors (specifically McDowell) tried to put some humor into their roles (I mean, if you were acting in this movie, would YOU take it seriously?). The film makers, on the other hand, treated this movie seriously and the two clashed. And in the end, it seemed like, at times, the acting was bad.I also think that, after reading a biography on Gaius Caligula, they painted a good portrait of the guy. The way he sucks up to Tiberius, when he gets his fever, how he seems to go insane afterwards seems to be accurate. The only problem is that they didn't focus on one of the reasons why he was so full of himself: when he was a child, he was the favorite among his father's troops. Plus, his father was a very famous general of his day.All in all, "Caligula" was a decent, if not very bizarre, movie.</fullReview>

I think it is one of the very few movies that picture the atmosphere of Roman times in a realistic way. The camera work is the perfect mixture between very romantic and explicit shots. Malcolm mc Dowell is perfectly casted as Caligula. He runs around like a true madman. The only small minus, is the performance of some of the Italian actors. Extra note: The scene with Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner is one of the most sexual in a non porno movie. Overall is this one of the best movies i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>failed potential, gratuitous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no way in which a film on Caligula could be non-sexual. A certain amount must be depicted simply because of Caligula's character and behavior. So, for example, it is necessary to show sex scenes and scenes in which our culture would term "perverted." Normal sex scenes demonstrate Caligula's infatuation with sex. Perverted scenes illustrate the magnitude of this infatuation. Thus, both normal sex, orgies, and incest are necessary for the accuracy of the film. Orgies are especially relevant historically given that they became a large source of state income under Caligula. However, each of these types of sexuality were depicted in gratuitious way that was not necessary from the point of view of accuracy; i.e., it is not necessary to spend ten minutes of footage - with multiple close ups to boot - to present the fact that orgies existed in Caligula's life. Though some sexual aspects are left out which would have strengthened the idea of Caligula's immersion into sexuality of all types; namely, acts of beastiality which are as historically true as any other sexual facts on Caligula. This would have been, from a standpoint of accuracy, much more desired than the actual gratuitous sexuality displayed. A superfluous amount of these director mis-judgements compromises the potential for a good film. It is important to understand Caligula from both a modern and classical perspective, but educational and historical understanding and partially bartered for mere arousal and porn profits. But what can you expect from a penthouse-produced film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Come, my little fishees"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene mid-way through Caligula where Malcolm McDowell as the eponymous emperor kisses every square inch of his naked, dead sister's body. Surprisingly, this is perhaps the least repulsive image in this crass movie.Any film which contains such a high sexual content as Caligula indeed does will always face a negative reception of knee-jerk reaction and authoritarial opinion. But what really offends about this movie is how witlessly the pieces are put together. The most divine music imaginable is used, with Khachaturyan and Prokofiev used to decorate the drama. Unfortunately, this acts as an ironic counterpoint to the low quality of the script (at best) and, at worst, an insult to the music and a feat of utter pretentiousness. Famously, between five and six minutes of hardcore pornography were filmed and inserted into the film by Penthouse representative Bob Guccione, causing it's ban in many places, including England. The version I got to see was a 20th anniversary special cut for the British television company "Channel 4". This excised - where it could be identified - Guccione's additions, and reinserted some cut scenes of the original work. However, even on the open-minded fourth British Channel, this came under close scrutiny of the BBFC, causing some scenes to remain almost statically focused (or out-of-focused, as the picture was blown up to centre on innocuous images) while the soundtrack gave a clue as to what our eyes were prevented from seeing. Even without the hard-core content, the movie is repugnant in its almost infantile need to constantly shock. The images of graphic violence, notably near the climax (no pun intended), are so over-earnest they are nought but repellent.Where the film could have salvaged itself is by the acting, and the central core of the plot. While Peter O'Toole is wonderful, (though Guccione alluded in interviews to him being under the substance of narcotics), Malcolm MacDowell greatly disappoints and in no sense recreates his magnificent display of ability in "A Clockwork Orange". An insane dictator with a predilection towards bestiality and incest, it is a one-note performance throughout, with no hint at depth beyond the crazed rhetoric to give the audience something to fear, sympathise, or even RELATE to. This may have worked if there were some other sense of normality within the film to anchor it to some sense of reality, but every other character is as mad as Caligula. Only towards the finale, when the senate discuss their hatred of his actions, do we get something approaching an honest emotion, but by then it is too late.The budget for this one was revealed as coming in at $17.5 million, a proud boast from Guccione who intended the film to revolutionise modern motion pictures. This it may have done were it of merit, but every cent of its overblown budget is turgidly transferred to the screen without any ounce of artistry. Though notorious, very few people have seen this film (as the low number of IMDb voters - 745 at date of writing - attests), whether due to its widespread ban or merely due to indifference. Famous it may be, its contribution to the film canon is negligible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROME it is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the Netherlands, I'm not one to call something 'pornographic' quickly. Sadly, the influence of the Penthouse magazine producing this movie is pretty obvious.If you compare this movie to the hit-series ROME, nowadays this movie shocks people less with it's nudity and sex. Still, the focus of this movie is needlessly on sexual escapades and nudity. If you're offended or bored by gratuitous sex, thank God for fast-forward, you're going to need it. About the only sex-scenes that had much function in the story was the (historically fairly accurate) prostitution of the Senators' wives. Even so, this scene was overlong. The best aspects of this movie are the music and the art direction; they're not historically correct by a long-shot but have that Dr.Phibes-over the top thing going for it. Also, the basic premise of the movie (Caligula takes Tiberius' disdain for the Romans to heart and is anxious to see how far out his behaviour can be before someone shows some spine) is interesting. It would have been a much better movie if it left out most of the graphic sex scenes, and added more action/gore. Caligula was noted for having an obsession with gladiatorial fights so this would be accurate.If you want to see a more 'historically correct' version of Caligula, watch the splendid "I, Claudius" TV-series with Jacobi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Preview of Daily Roman Life; Also Great "Thinker"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula is one of the most fantastic films I have seen, and yet I do not feel comfortable forwarding it to the "immature" of mind. Because the movie touches on some very 'controversial' issues, such as nudity, violence, and sex, the film is immediately labeled as some sort of a historical-pornographic film.I believe that "Caligula" accurately depicts what daily life was like during the reign of Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (Caligula). Malcolm McDowell brought Caligula to life in his role as the crazed emperor, showing his many mood swings, and even sincere emotions.I popped in the film not knowing what to expect--some sort of cheesy play-off of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.It is anything but.The music fit the mood perfectly, giving an "eerie" sense; but perfection arrived with the fade-in of Mark 8.36 "What shall it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul." Even before the opening credits began rolling, the movie had my full attention, because of that first verse.Caligula is a movie profound on many different levels: not only does it accurately depict daily Roman life; it humanized Emperor Caligula, bringing to realization the fact that he also was human.**If you perhaps enjoyed "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", I believe you would also enjoy Caligula, only Caligula is very explicit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore Vidal Disavowed (Mis)Treatment of his Writing But Still Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the worst of a great writer is better than the schlock of an expensive movie with well-known movie stars, poorly written. Such is 'Caligula', which I bought several years ago and was disgusted by because of the continual sex scenes. In fact, there's so much sexual activity, it gets boring. It's amazing that the present Bush administration hasn't ordered all copies bought up and publicly burned. That's coming, as we march backward into der Fuehrer-land. It's almost refreshing to watch this movie, so as to remind us of a time when movie producers weren't terrified to produce anything that showed the left titty of a woman. On some discussion boards, the word 'titty' is censored as we become a nation disgusted by sex and turned on by violence."Caligula" needs to be seen as well to remind us of that other empire, where the moral degeneration was such that the leaders of the empire provided the people with sex orgies and animals rending human beings limb from limb to divert their attention from the rot within the government. This is similar to the NASCAR and "Desperate Housewives" diversions, in which people profess 'moral values', but flock avidly in the hope of seeing death on the circular track, and sexual teasing in prime time.Roddy McDowell was not at his best in this movie, and you can see why Gore Vidal wanted nothing to do with this director, once he saw the way the movie was being shot. It would be interesting to find out how much of Vidal's work was actually left in the film. Should be seen for historical interest, and a lesson for today.</fullReview>

McDowell is a good actor, he does his best to portray the mad emperor convincingly. Peter O'Toole is really great as Tiberius: for me, he is the ultimate highlight of this film. And Helen Mirren is at least well-cast as Caesonia, Caligula's worn-out but clever and affectionate wife.I don't know why but I think it is a film one should have seen, maybe because of the extremity of disproportion and excessiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tinto Brass always struck me as a kind of Italian Ken Russell. They shared the same anarchist tendencies to push the limits of taste, and not only challenged what was morally acceptable, but artistically. They had the same obsession with over-the-top grandiose and baroque set pieces that always seemed oddly stagy, as if the whole movie was taking place beneath the proscenium of an enormous opera house. These director's work in symbol and metaphor, and possess a certain crazed wit and artistry and a keen eye for the outlandish.Gore Vidal clearly intended a more serious, though not necessarily less extreme, story of the dehumanizing nature of absolute power. Anti-establishment mavericks, Brass and McDowell were more interested in exploring the idea of Caligula as a revolutionary anarchist, an anti-hero (much like Little Alex) trying to dismantle and destroy the bureaucratic institutions of power, only to find that those institutions are able to crush even the cruelest of tyrants.Of course the whole thing would have been wildly tasteless and over-the-top had the slimy Bob Guccione never gotten involved. It was clearly Brass and McDowell's intent to produce a shocking, outrageous, almost psychedelic, and thoroughly offensive piece of work. That's not a bad thing if it's for a just cause, but any illusions of political commentary that Brass and McDowell intended is obscured by the heavy handed, self-serving agenda of Bob Guccione.From the outset, whether the others involved really knew it or not, his intention for 'Caligula' was to bring adult entertainment to the masses; pornography in to the multiplex; and he brought on board the latest Penthouse pets to costar. Their are those who refuse to call the offending scenes in this movie pornographic, though it's tough to imagine what else you call multiple close-ups of blow jobs and masturbation. Perhaps Brass and McDowell underestimated him and thought they could take his money and retain some creative control. They didn't. Throughout the movie, the dull and heavy hand of Guccione can be seen everywhere. You only have to compare the gleeful fun and theatrical shocks of the Tiberian Grotto scene to the later dull and boring porn inserts to see the difference between the two directors. Where Brass attempts eroticism, Gucionne goes for porn. Where Brass injects wit and humor, Gucionne in boringly earnest. Where Brass in inventive, Gucionne is dull and repetitive.What could have been a shocking, but provocative, art house commentary on the indestructibility of bourgeois rule, was turned in to a crude exercise in the most dull and tedious kind of porn. There's enough of Brass's original vision to keep things interesting. It's not for the feint-hearted, but fans of Ken Russel, and later, Peter Greenaway, may appreciate the sheer insane spectacle of it all. But Guccione's ham-fisted ineptitude is so apparent in almost every scene that it becomes, at time, almost impossible to watch. Although he only shot six minutes or so, the most sexually hardcore six minutes of the movie, he re-edited the entire thing in to the mess that it is.I've never been an advocate of censorship, but 'Caligula' seems to be so far removed from the intentions of all involved that Brass needs to be given the opportunity one-day to re-edit it back to the film it could have been, which I suspect for all its shocking and offensive imagery, would have been pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the images and themes of bestiality, incest, sodomy, sadomasochism, lesbianism, cross dressing, homosexuality, decapitation, castration, necrophilia, impalement, disembowelling, urination, defecation and nudity, 'Caligula' is unsurprisingly as far from family entertainment as you can get... Then again, it's as far from any entertainment as you can possibly get, with very few people willing to sit through a two and half hour onslaught of depravity and overacting, all dressed up with 'Spartacus'/'Ben-Hur' pretensions.Chronicling the life and times of the controlling Caligula Caesar, the film paints the man as a two-dimensional caricature, lusting and thrusting his way through the senate with wild eyes and a joker-like smile. He is portrayed by the usually reliable Malcolm McDowell, he of 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'If...' fame. Once a respected actor, McDowell can now be found prostituting his self-respect in the likes of 'Fantasy Island' and 'Gangster No 1' -- which asks the question, where did his career go wrong?Well, all eyes will probably fall on 'Caligula'. Perhaps the most debauched film with the most infamous of histories. It's the kind of film where the 'making of' would probably have been more enjoyable and entertaining, if only the cast and crew were willing to speak frankly, and in full, about the production. Alongside McDowell there is a wealth of British acting talent being flushed down the pan, with Helen Mirren as Caligula's wife Caesonia, John Gielgud appearing briefly as Nerva -- wisely bowing out after the first ten minutes -- and Peter O'Toole, who fares least well in the embarrassing role of syphilitic paedophile Tiberius, a role which probably did his ailing career little favours.Of course the film will no doubt be written off on the grounds of the sex and violence, which are purposely excessive. But knee-jerk reactions aside what is just as shocking is the lack of technical ability and overall grandeur the film demonstrates. The exterior sets do look majestically impressive, but interiors look like two walls, some curtains and dramatic lighting to mask the faade of the set. Direction and cinematography relies heavily on panning and zooms that often look improvised, as the camera will begin to zoom in, only for an actor to step out of frame, forcing the camera to quickly recompose, which makes you wonder whether or not this effect was done for cost cutting reasons, in order to reduce the number of editing hours, or whether it was insisted on by the censors to creatively pan and scan the more salacious and explicit sequences.Because of this it becomes a task in it's self to recognize which cut of the film you are watching, since there's apparently three or four different versions available -- including the penthouse-cut, featuring fifteen minutes of hardcore footage shot by producer Bob Guccione that was deemed too offensive by the BBFC, detailing everything from erections to penetration. Then there is the directors-cut, which removes the hardcore sex and replaces it with further narrative development, and then finally the edited version, which removed almost all traces of violence and sexual activity -- which in a film like 'Caligula' would be the equivalent of a film version of the moon landings where you never actually see the moon. I believe the version I sat through was the director's cut, with some creative work done by the powers that be to remove footage that failed to meet the taste and decency guidelines.Because of these offending images, the resulting ban of the film in many countries means that 'Caligula' now, somewhat undeservedly, has acquired a place in cinematic history as "the first pornographic epic" -- the proud words of Mr Guccione. As legend and folklore continue to grow around the film, giving it a mythic, almost classic status and reputation, people will judge the film without actually seeing it. This is a film in which greatness relies on reputation, a reputation more than this mediocre event deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by no means a good film - and that's why I'm going to rate it only *1/2 out of **** - but it's a uniquely, fascinatingly bad one. It runs (in its unrated version) 155 minutes, the plotting is poor and there isn't even one sane character in sight, to draw us in. And yet, you are never bored. You just sit there stupefied, wondering how far it's willing to push the limits of your tolerance (and of good taste!). It's a bizarre hybrid of gore, sex and historical drama; the different parts don't connect well at all, so the graphic depictions of oral sex and rape, for example, seem to come out of nowhere. As for the acting, McDowell is actually pretty good, John Gielgud keeps his dignity (and departs early on) and Teresa Ann Savoy is quite luscious as Caligula's sister, but Peter O'Toole hits an all-time low with a brief but shameful performance.All in all, this movie IS worth seeing, if you are prepared for some of the most inconceivably and jaw-droppingly graphic sex scenes you'll ever see in a non-purely pornographic film (the violence is also strong, but not THAT strong). If you do manage to make it to the end, you can tell other people you've seen it and feel like some kind of winner. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty. As one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse', there is much naked flesh to be seen, and the film lovingly catalogues Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as though Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called 'Gore'). Characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles, so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. I do, however, question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were set during the reign of Commodus, an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both those films are artistically far better than 'Caligula'.The acting in the film is not particularly bad, with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably insane Caligula. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film. The real Caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill). The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star) it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy, but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike some other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva, a decent and honourable Senator of the old school. Unfortunately, in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill. Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question). The film does not, however, succeed upon any other level, either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even seen as erotica it is second-rate. 4/10</fullReview>

This historically inaccurate (for the most part) film is about emperor Caligula's brief reign of terror in which he threw orgies (his bisexuality is very played down in this film) and murdered people for his own amusement. Poor sets, even worse costumes (or lack of), and one of the most inept directors in history sink it. Sick, disgusting, and vile movie with no redeeming qualities.Unrated (156 mins.); Extreme Graphic Violence, Strong Explicit Sexual Content, Graphic &amp; Explicit Nudity, Strong Adult Themes, Torture.

And how could of Gore Vidal have written this? Everyone should be ashamed of themselves.  The direction and acting for the most part is terrible. And it seems all the camera can do is zoom in and zoom out. And then there is the infamous porngrapghy and extreme graphic violence. It is all sick and disguisting. Please don't pay attention to all the hype, because this movie is awful no matter how many hardcore sex scenes they add to it. And please don't waste your money on such a vial affair.

		<shortDescription>Bad, but bad in its own way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is incredibly bad, but it's so strange that it's bad in its own way. The question I kept asking myself throughout the film is what kind of audience did the filmmakers have in mind who would want to see this? Certainly not history buffs, because the story is all but incomprehensible, and offers no insights into the life of Caligula or anyone else. Certainly not fans of the gifted and famous actors like Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud. If they did this film for any reason besides the money they should get their heads examined. They have never done anything remotely like this before or since. If the producers hired them in order to give their film "legitimacy" were sadly mistaken. Certainly not for people who like pornos. The film is absurdly overlong at two-and-a-half hours, and only a few precious minutes feature hard-core porno. Since Penthouse produced the film, what they should have done was cut an hour out of the film and add more porno scenes in order to make it a standard porno movie and not some half-hearted epic. I was at least expecting the film to feature glossy photography just like in the Penthouse pictorials. Boy, was I wrong. The cinematography is really ugly. It's underlit and washed out, and it looks like one of those cheap Italian gladitor films of the '60s. The editing is a joke. The scenes don't flow together, they just pile them on, one after the other, in no apparent order. Nino Baragli, who edited Sergio Leone's films, worked on this film as well, if you can believe it. This is the kind of film that should be put into a time capsule for a hundred years and then seen again to see if it's any better. It just might, because I was surprised at the high number of "10" votes by imdb users. My only other comment is about Malcolm McDowell. He actually gives a performance. He is onscreen almost all the time, and he plays his part with a straight face. He recites the silly dialogue as if he was making an important film like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Nothing fazes him, not what happens onscreen. One would be hard-pressed to recall another instance in which a talented actor worked so hard for such a minimal payoff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to rank as the most reprehensible, most repellent piece of excrement ever assembled on film. What was intended as a look into the life of the most debauched of Roman Emperors comes off as endless and pointless parade of violence and graphic sexual content. I have no problem with sex or violence in any film, provided it's motivated by the narrative and character development. When it's dredged on the screen just because the producers had the money to do it. When this is the case, then I'm left with a couple of basic thoughts: if this is to be about Caligula and I leave this film with no better insight into his nature as a ruler or the atmosphere he functioned in, then it doesn't function as drama. Secondly, if I were to sit the multitude of graphic sex scenes only to be repelled and mystified by their presence in the film, then it barely functions as good porn.In short, CALIGULA has provided me with two and one-half hours of cinema (if you wish to call it that) that I would never wish on anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me clarify that. This is the worst film ever made that isn't in the category of being so bad it's good. It falls into the class of execrable films that you don't want to see. Trust me on this, or you'll be very sorry later.I saw "Caligula" in its theatrical release in 1979. Coming off the high of the superb BBC mini-series, "I, Claudius", I thought "Caligula" might be in the same spirit. What a horrific mistake! "Caligula" was entirely lacking in dramatic merit. There's no dramatic progress, there's no lesson, there are no surprises, there's nothing except base depravity in scene after scene after scene. And the scenes that aren't disgusting are boring. The titular Caligula is a reptile at the beginning, and he's the identical reptile at the end. He lives, he stinks, he dies. The end.I'll close by noting that, as far as I know, this is the only film the erudite Roger Ebert summed up by invoking the word "sh**".

		<shortDescription>Well.....I just had to go and watch this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a semi-film buff, I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula, complete with hard-core pornography. What struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it!!?? A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me, I foolishly rented the DVD and even more foolishly watched it.Within the first 30 minutes I was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an NC-17 even by todays standards. Was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword (all in very graphic detail). And a scene where a guy gets his d*** cut off and fed to dogs (again in very graphic detail)....and this just scratches the surface. The argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and it's excesses. When in fact what this movie really is, is sheer exploitation. From beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture, and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophelia, it just never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula himself, what might have propelled him to go mad, the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult. This is not a historic film, it is sleaze. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this when I wasn't gagging I was just incredibly bored. By the time it was over I was depressed, didn't feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible, it actually can turn you off of sex.What were these great actors thinking when they got into this. I did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into. Right at the opening credits it says "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves. Apparently director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely, as did the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes film festival.For the amount of money the producers spent on this, the movie's quality is terrible. Everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed, and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in-focus. The sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful.Anyway, I brought this movie on myself. My advice...don't watch this, don't watch this, don't watch this......as for myself tomorrow night I am going to watch something lighter....like DAWN OF THE DEAD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is bad and it has no excuse for being so given the budget, the talent and the story. The reason I find it such a stinker is that I wish Guccione had bankrolled me to make it. this is what I would have done.Firstly I would have inserted some "subtlety" into it. The British pride themselves on it, yet the gathering of fine and actual "great" British actors must have been overcome by the Mediterranean heat and forgotten how to add nuances to their performances. I would ask them to infer some erotic aspects rather than simply filming them only to have them later excised. This could have prevented the film from being simultaneously titillating and boring, a difficult thing to achieve.I would make the characters actually interesting. Cassius Chaerea for instance, could be the catalyst of the film. A true martial hero who knew and protected Caligula as a child and now humiliated, insulted and driven to treasonous murder. Let's see it. We get one quick glimpse of his underlying passionate hatred at the "boat scene" then little else. Wasted.Or bring some of the dark evil al a Hitler's bunker, where a grotesque monster is surrounded by timorous "yes people" or creatures equally as vile as the leader himself. No, instead we get a rich working class American publisher's view of how he thinks everyone would behave if sex in all it's aspects was acceptable. This makes Caligula a small minded big movie.Or add any perspective taken from a character's point of view wherein we at least think that what is being portrayed as deviant behaviour actually is. Instead the blurb asks us "What would you have done?" meaning wouldn't we all have just jumped onto this carnal bandwagon and joined in. Perhaps we would, perhaps we wouldn't.In short I, or any director worth his salt would inject some GUTZ into this film, the addition of which could have made a forgettable film unforgettable.Caligula could have been so much better and there is no excuse, excepting perhaps the small one that the guy with all the money was calling the shots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini it ain't...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "Fellini Satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini it ain't... First of all it is not as entertaining. Far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. The portrayals by Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. As it is, they are little more than cyphers. One example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. The only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. These two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caligula, an aberration of an emperor,an aberration of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm currently slogging through Gibbon's 'Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire , so I've had all things Roman on my mind. I'm not very far into it yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it is amazing just how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I've read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only Antonius, Trajan, and Hadrian haven't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome. Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. This brings me to reviewing this film. I'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome,as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period.My point is I do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it's proponents. I do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island ,exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards, Little Boots, this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless. He is handed the empire after Tiberius dies, the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant, and lead Rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into. Caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor, but gets sick, almost dies, and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster. His perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters. The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God. Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him. His violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway, and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of Tiberius. Well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent, which is not common through it's entirety, it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns, in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails. It is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered, raped, tortured for no reason but fancy. The depictions of the violence are possibly, but not probably, accurate. Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome, torture beforehand was rote. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while the bystanders watch with nonchalance, I just don't see it having gone down exactly like that. The death machine, the beheader, is certainly something like you've never seen in movies, and something once seen you shall probably never forget, even as I, you wish you could. The wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same, once you've seen this shame it is yours forever. These things strike me the director's and that porn magnate's fantasies. They sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record.The acting is pretty good. I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to behold, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. The portrayals of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors. The film could have done so much better story telling, it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was. For example it could have given opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or shown that he was mad, paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously. It could have shown the weakness of Claudius and the miracle it was he survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things but it stuck to it's sad nightmares.Finally about the sex. It is porn. It shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people. Male on male, female on female, male on female. It is passionless, disgusting sex. Sex that if your point is to get off on it, I seriously doubt you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a Greek time than a Roman. I don't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange, depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it.This film should probably never be watched, if your curious about it , let it go. It is something, as I said earlier, if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come. I don't think its an accurate historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite pretensions to being some kind of accurate historical epic, this is basically a 2.5 hour porno, with lots of close-up violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked, copulating couples that's just what you'll want to do. Add to that Peter O'Toole as syphilis-ridden emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell sticking his finger up a male victim's anus, and you begin to appreciate that Caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sick/outrageous films.The film charts the life of notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, decapitations, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes.Although Caligula was totally mad in real life, and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not, the film is still inexcusable filth. The sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi-layered story - the sex IS the story. After a while, all the nudity, hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, particularly McDowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild-eyed posturing. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves (surely he's in it purely for the money?!). Rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post production, but in truth there isn't a single minute in Caligula that is dignified or well-made. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again, so in that sense Caligula is a one-of-a-kind experience... on the other hand, it's so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is "one-of-a-kind" is a blessing in disguise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed would-be Roman epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a historical film that's epic in length, if not in production values. A film financed in the US by Playboy, made in Italy with a cast of British leads, this was hugely controversial back on its release due to the explicit scenes of sex which litter the production. Be prepared for acres of heaving flesh throughout the film's course. Only one or two scenes (the lesbian interlude in particular) seem to have been clumsily inserted into the movie by Tinto Brass and generally the rest of the sex fits the story and adds to the realism of the times, e.g. the epic Roman orgy which is probably the closest filmed to how it really happened back then.Sadly, despite some impressive sets, the movie just looks cheap all the way through. Cheap, tawdry, with poor costumes, and not at all the expensive production I had expected it to be beforehand. Despite the incredibly long running time, it doesn't really drag much, even when nothing is happening, which can only be in the film's favour. It's also not as violent as I had expected, with only two scenes of graphic bloodshed which really stand out - the first is an offbeat interlude involving an incredible "decapitation machine" which rolls along and chops off heads sticking from the ground with huge metal pincers; the second, the film's grisly close.The inimitable Malcolm McDowell takes the lead role of Caligula and puts in his trademark intense performance. This is a very scary man who convinces you that he's insane and McDowell's turn is commanding without being over-the-top or hammy. Instead, he's just believable, underplaying it to the point in which you understand his motivations and actions. Top-notch support comes from Helen Mirren, who also excels as Caesonia, Caligula's arranged wife and a former prostitute who stands by him until the end; Peter O'Toole also appears as a madman, Tiberius, the former Emperor.As well as Mirren and O'Toole, we also get a cameo from British thespian John Gielgud, who was obviously convinced that some kind of high-brow movie was being filmed and not just a cheap exploitationer. Two other cast members are worthy of note; firstly, Teresa Savoy, who plays Caligula's sister Drusilla who is the object of her brother's incestuous desires. Savoy is underused but from what we see of her, she's totally convincing as a voluptuous, smouldering love interest and it's easy to see why Caligula wants to marry her. Euro-action man John Steiner has a memorable turn as Caligula's bald aide, Longinus, always plotting and toadying to his master until his true colours show through at the end.There are many memorable moments in this production - the aforementioned decapitation machine being one of them. Caligula's descent into a bleak madness is shown by scenes of him sharing a bed with a horse (!)The scene in which McDowell cavorts naked in the cold night air is very similar to a moment with Olivier in Shakespeare's King Lear, yet this is the more convincing situation thanks to McDowell's half scary/half tragic portrayal of the doomed Caligula. Without McDowell, I have a feeling that this movie would be worthless trash. With him, it's a flawed but occasionally worthwhile would-be epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, I am one of the unfortunate few who have sat through this onslaught of vicious and violent pornography trying to pass itself off as a historical drama. I first watched this as part of a University Dare Night, where myself and my flatmates decided to watch something really racy and preferably controversial (because as we all know, when you go to University, you check your brain in at the door!).So what's the grilling? The film tells the story of Caligula, played by the always controversial Malcolm McDowell, the infamous psychotic, incestuous and delusionally murderous Caesar of Rome as he rises from his frightful youth under the rule of his Uncle Tiberius (played by Peter O'Toole, while drunk apparently), to his dominance as lord of the known World.What are the problems with this movie? Just about everything you could imagine, especially seeing as it is in fact a pornographic film. It's got all the gratuitous sex and perversion that you'd come to expect from a movie like that, the only problem being that it's not particularly sexy, if anything it would probably put you off.At the same time this is offset by incredible amounts of graphic violence, including brutal beatings, stabbings, murder, suicide, decapitation by moving wall with spinning blades, etc. This film really does push the boat out.The acting is incredibly questionable, either because you question what the actors were thinking when they did these unspeakable acts to each other, or questioning how many of these actors may or may not have been actually killed during production. Malcolm McDowell especially, who really seems to be getting into his role as the debauched ruler.I will however give this film two points. One point for the magnificent sets and locations built for the movie, which, now that I think about it, all seemed to have gone to complete and utter waste, and another point for the outfits, of which quite a lot of work appears to have gone into, for the few people who actually wear outfits and don't just wander about in the nude!Bottom line, I really cannot recommend this film on those two points alone. If you want a historical drama, this isn't for you, if you want a pornographic movie, it still isn't for you. It's incredibly violent, not sexy in the least, has no historical accuracy, and is about as fun to sit through as Root canal treatment. Stay away folks, stay far, far away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye-popping mish-mash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula was the Roman Emperor between Tiberius and Claudius. He was also a card-carrying fruitcake, given to extreme sexual deprivation and horrific violence, and this film purports to give an account of his period as Emperor.This odd - one might even say extraordinary - film pretty much defies description, but here goes. The subject is undoubtedly a serious one: Caligula has been studied by many serious authorities on the Roman Empire, features heavily in Robert Graves' I, Claudius, and is here the subject of a screenplay by respected heavyweight writer Gore Vidal. And one must recognise the quality of the cast: Malcolm McDowell, always edgy as a young actor, is perfect casting here, and he is joined by the likes of Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Geilgud.All well and good. But now factor in the fact that the film was financed by Penthouse magazine (and produced by its then chief executive and managing editor Bob Guccione), was directed by art-house sexploitation director Tinto Brass, was the subject of massive fallings-out between all the major creative people involved, had hard-core sex scenes filmed and edited in afterwards by Guccione without the knowledge of the featured players, has ended up with at least a dozen different versions edited differently for different reasons, and has been disowned by virtually everyone associated with it.It is a mess, whichever version you see. The sexual material, whether trimmed to the bone or in full explicit flagrante delicto, is salacious, rather unpleasant, and mostly gratuitous. The same can be said for the violence. The thing screams "sensationalist exploitation." But the main actors all give wonderful performances, deserving of the serious film they thought they were making.Don't take that as a recommendation, though: this is a shocking film in more ways than one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Details the graphic and shocking, yet undeniably tragic story of Rome's most infamous Caesar, Gaius Germanicus Caligula (Malcolm McDowell).The film should have been good. Written by Gore Vidal, and starring an actor who was not afraid to tackle sex and violence... how do you mess up the biography of one of the most disturbing people in history? And yet, Roger Ebert gave it a rare zero stars rating, calling it "sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash", criticizing not only the film's vulgarity in its depiction of sex and violence, but also its technically incompetent direction and structure.I watched the R-rated version (at 101 minutes) and thought it was no masterpiece, but hardly the tripe some say it is. Perhaps the unedited version is much worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man is a social animal.Whoever said this must be a real genius in understanding the psychology of the human brain. We live in a society which is bound by a set of rules called Law. Try to imagine what the world would be like if there is no law to govern! Man will become animal. His thirst for blood grows. Absolute power to an individual will bring out the animalistic cruelty and sexual perversion.Caligula is a film that deals with such absolute power and its by-products, that are bestowed on the infamous Roman Ceaser. Malcolm McDowell did a wonderful job in enacting the maniacal role. All the other actors are merely supporting his performance. Peter O'Toole was great in his role. He was very expressive as a dying tyrant who doesn't trust his heir to the throne. His character is also very pervasive and Toole splendidly performed a s one. Helen Mirren has nothing much to do than standing as an eye candy wife of Caligula.The movie is filled with nudity and gore. Yet, you will not remember the movie as a softcore or you wouldn't be aroused by the content. Director Tinto Brass made sure that the tone was maintained throughout. Watch Caligula for the pure passion of a bunch of men to tell a shocking story.In my opinion, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. Try this movie, if you are OK with the nudity and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched this gem of controversy. Anything that has to do with hardcore and explicit ways to display any historical fact; will be of my interest.The truth is that Caligola is not a film for everyone. It should be watched by those who know this peculiar part of history and it's reaches. I mean, that way you will know what to expect and not be grossed or impressed. The art direction is truly impressive because it displays perfectly the settings of the antique empire. It also works perfectly as a support to the excesses of the emperor and best of all, with the tone of the movie.The acting is just average except for Mr. Malcom McDowall who always delivers fantastic performances. He's really good. The rest of the cast do not need to act that much as the main events of the movie are performed by physical acting. This is a gem of depravity but at the same time it could be used as a perfect example of accurate history in a film. A must see for fans of 70's exploitation in art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not pornography...but paganography!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...these are the words of Bob Guccione as I saw the documentary! It's Paganography alright! Deep inside we all would love to live in total awareness of sex as the Romans did in the past and see it not as sin but as a natural thing! I'm not going to comment much about the movie itself because only by seeing it...you'll understand all the mystique of the gossip surrounding this movie! And I'll explain my vision why:Several pornography companies dedicate all their efforts to make tons of money on tons of movies of the same awful background stories with the same porn "actresses"! What should they do is to make what Bob Guccione made with this one...take a script...and make the sex part within that script rules! Therefore they actually would be putting in the market something worthwhile to buy and see...other the same sex positions...the same plots...the same bodies...all the same...same...same old news that people actually buy and they make money out of a no good piece of s***!Caligola is a good satire movie about the vicissitudes of Roman empire and it's Senate, using sex and senator's wives to put an end to their power without sacrifice! Don't know if Emperor Caligula actually made senator's wives sell their bodies for 5 gold coins as it states in the movie...but sure hell is a way to criticize the corrupt and vulgar ways that one get to conquer power! Caligula (at least in the movie) only tried to actually made the senate sacrifice themselves for the people...as they never did (and unfortunately never will do)!As for me...I sure liked to see more theatrical paganography in the future! I doubt it ever will happen like this again...but it sure would be awesome to pick up historical figures and make movies of this kind!I gave it a 6 out of 10 for three reasons: Tinto/Vidal's open war actually made a bad influence in the movie! As it was said (Tinto Brass words) in the DVD I bought...every guy was there for an "egotrip"! Every Penthouse-pet wanted to show off and get in a movie with good acting and good actors such as McDowell and O'Toole and that huge monument of a woman that is Helen Mirren (the cause of me buying this DVD in the first place, as I love her work and her posture, body, face - even after years passed...as an aged woman, she looks wonderful in "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" a movie that I also recommend)! They really should work as a contribute to that movie and not traveling the "egotrip" train so much! Also because I really thought that the movie has a awful editing job (without the Tinto's hand on it, became another product to sell as much as possible with the largest amount of profit)! As it was said by John Steiner (who played Longinus), Bob Guccione made this movie without costing him anything...and got a profit of hundreds of million dollars! And finally the inaccurate historical facts of Caligula!It's a fairly good movie, not for all people (as it shows explicit sex), worth to watch (because of the satire involved)! The DVD set includes some good extras about the movie and characters and some things that went really wrong (as the first choice of Drusilla that was going to be played by Maria Schneider, who states that she said to Tinto that she's not a prostitute, but at the same time she came to Caligola's audition right from making money with "the butter scene" of "Ultimo Tango a Parigi" and other sex scenes movies that she was involved in!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting movie to watch, though the sexual overload may be disturbing to some, considering that the movie depicts sexual acts being performed with total abandon, with little concern towards the presence of other men.Most of actresses and extras used in the movie are quite an eye-full to watch, clothed or out of them and the beauty of some gives you a double-take. The sex scenes, especially the last orgy in the movie are erotic, intense, explicit and live up to the hype. But they do leave me wondering........ wasn't circumcision considered mutilation of the body by the ancient Greeks and Romans? What is with so many of those circumcised penises?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all that bad, but there wasn't much to work with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally succumbed to the hoop-la and decided to watch this movie, just to say I did.Gore and pornography aside, this movie's greatest weakness was that Caligula was simply not an interesting person. He was the Uday Hussein of the classical era; a sadistic and emotionally stunted 15-year-old in a man's body. There was never any intelligence or forethought to his brutality, it was purely random. That alone might make a movie interesting for an hour or so, but after that it just gets boring. Watching Caligula for 2-1/2 hours was like watching a child slowly pulling the legs and wings off insects.For the first half of the movie there is a rather competent storyline (which is repeatedly interrupted by scenes of gratuitous porn that appear to have been added after the fact for no apparent reason), but beyond that it's just one scene after the next of a deranged man-child laughingly dishing out sadistic punishments to whomever happened to be standing around him.The first 30 minutes or so are well worth watching. Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) was Caligula's predecessor, and he was a much more fascinating character. One gets the idea that he started out as a wise and noble leader that slowly went mad over time, and that would have been a much more worthy subject for a movie of this magnitude.After nearly 2 hours I had all I could stand and fast-forwarded thru the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointed is not the world. I first heard of Caligula on wikipedia when I was researching Ancient Rome. I looked at the image of the poster and the brilliant tagline: What would you have done if you had been given absolute power of life and death over everybody else in the whole world?. Without even reading a review of the film, I ordered the glorious-sounding "Imperial Edition" and got the shock of my life watching it. I expected an epic showing of the rise and downfall of Rome's most monstrous Emperour and instead I received a combination of a great film and hardcore porno. The actual sex footage and some of the suggested actions like the anal fisting, oral sex etc is so repulsive that it actually put me off the brilliant scenes which also happened such as Nerva's suicide in the glass bathtub and the brilliant "If only all Rome had one neck" line which blew me away. I give the film a 5-star rating because it was a good film, a brilliant film but I give it a 5-star rating also because it was filthy, queer and brutal piece of trash which doesn't deserve a showing anywhere,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this way back when and faintly remembered the porn, the head chopper and doggie snack bits. Recently I picked up the translated book from Suetonius, "12 Caesars" and then you see where this movie comes from. The Tiberius and Caligula characters are extrapolated from that book. Now, in seeing it again, some of the set pieces are pretty good - e.g. the all white building interior in wide angle and a bright red-robed Caligula sashaying up the middle, that kind of stuff is still cool high style today. Surprisingly, the dialog/soundtrack itself is pretty tame and apart from some screaming is actually only PG, and banal. McDowell hams it up a bit too much, the bug-eyed maniac is tiresome, the point seems to be that this Caligula knew he wasn't a god and resented the way the Roman aristocracy propped up the role of emperor, and seemed relieved to finally get his in the end. So, too bad about the uber violence, porn and poor editing, could've been something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie many years ago and thought it was just OK. I thought it was too sexually graphic and a bit too melodramatic but I saw this again several years ago and found the movie to be quite good. The reason for my change in attitude is that, in between the two viewings, I had the chance to learn more about Roman history; specifically their culture. This movie portrays Rome as it really was during Caligula time. They were very sexual and openly displayed it.This is the story of Caligula or Caligola, the emperor of Rome. In historical context, he was not as bad as some would have it. He actually accomplished quite a bit even though he was not mentally all there. But then given how he grew up, I am surprised he was able to accomplish the amount that he did.When he was young, his uncle Emperor Tiberius killed Caligula's mother and father. He went to live with his uncle who subsequently molested him countless times. I was shocked by this but pederasty, an intimate or erotic relationship between an adolescent boy and an adult male, was quite common in those times. The real shocker was that Tiberius had his Praetorian Guards throw many young boys over a cliff after he was bored with them. If I recall, hundreds if not thousands of boys met their doom in this way. Caligula constantly lived in fear that he too would be thrown over the cliff like those other boys.If you don't know much about Roman history, I don't think you will fully appreciate this movie. There are intricacies here that will escape those who are unfamiliar or are a novice to Roman history. I'm not saying that you should read a whole college textbook on Roman history but do some internet research on it and afterward watch movie. I'm sure you will like the movie more if you do so rather than just watching it without doing any research at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from Awful, But Not for the Faint of Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to strongly disagree with the previous comments. Yes, this movie has inaccuracies - of course it does. Gore Vidal was not around in the time of Caligula. The point of this movie is not to portray a dead-on account of Caligula's rule. The point is to give you a glimpse of what life was probably like when he ruled, as well as to show what can happen in a society when one person is given absolute power. The point is also to shock you. This is a graphic movie, and not only the sex scenes. I think the acting all around was very good. Malcolm McDowell is downright scary as Caligula, and Helen Mirren is great (and sexy) as his wife.As for the sex scenes, there are really only two major ones in the movie. There is a lot of nudity and other sexual activity, and I can see how someone could say it's gratuitous - but, they didn't wear much for clothing in those days and it fit with the rest of the movie. Now, the two major sex scenes - they're a little misleading in the context of the movie. They were not filmed with any of the main actors present - they were done separately (yes, there are clips of the main actors during both of these scenes - but they're not involved directly in them). Malcolm McDowell has said he was upset that they were added and claimed he did not know they were being added. They are very graphic scenes, and certainly the term pornographic would fit. However, they are not like what you would see if you went out and rented a xxx movie today. There is no, or at least very little, direction in the scenes. The sex is passionate and unscripted - you can tell they're actually enjoying it. The two scenes are much more erotic than any porn made today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating ingredients, but cinematographically mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People tend to understand this movie entirely wrong. It is definitely not just porn.The story of the Roman emperor Caligula has it all. Love, sex, paranoia, treachery and fear in a morally quite different landscape. I don't think that a pornographic approach is wrong at all when studying a Roman emperor. Our moral barriers are a creation of our own culture and Christian heritage. People might be discussed by the explicit sex scenes, but what are these scenes compared to the facts that these people could murder their own parents, brothers, sisters and even children? In such circumstances perverted orgies seem quite acceptable and realistic to me.Acting is fair and the choice of music is great (Khachaturyan and Prokofiev). The historical surroundings are adequate, but the camera work is terrible. Some scenes also obviously attempt to shock you at the cost of historical credibility. Even if the overall picture of the movie is positive, you easily start to fantasize what an unforgettable masterpiece you could made using such dramatic ingredients. Ancient Rome is such a fascinating subject, especially from a moral perspective. Some day they'll maybe make a movie of emperor Nero, in which the characters talk Latin and the city of Rome is recreated with computer graphics. The more realistic the would try to make it, the more shocking it would be. Or why not use renaissance Italy? They could be quite cynical too.I don't regret buying this film at all. The first and last ten minutes of this film are great. The way to approach the movie is also far more correct than the melodramas of the 50s and the 60s. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

Caligula is in love and he haves a unholy passion for his sister (Teresa Ann Savoy). Which his sister feels the same way towards his brother. Things Changes, When the Emperor's best friend (John Gielgud) dies from killing himself and the Emperor is killed by Caligula's best friend (Guido Mannari). Once Galigula becomes the Emperor, He becomes the Ruler of Rome but his style and his ambition goes out of his control. But Caligula takes a liking to Rome's Most Infamous Prostitute (Helen Mirren). Caligula's fiendishly inventive means of disposing those who would oppose him and the details of his cruel, bizarre reign are revealed right here.Directed by Tinto Brass (Salon Kitty) made a strange, strong, bizarre and campy film with surreal moments. This film meant to be soft-core drama with some explicit scenes of both sexes. But when Bob Guccione produced the film, he added some hardcore pornography footage. Which the film stock doesn't match with the original cinematography of the movie. Brass was fired from the film, when he was nearly done filming the picture and sadly... he never had final cut. Which i am sure with Brass' cut, it could have been a greater film. Although Brass and actor McDowell made any changes to Gore Vidal's original screenplay. Which Vidal's screenplay was more of a historic drama. The original DVD version is the uncut version. DVD has an good non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an actors biographies and an interesting although silly vintage one hour documentary of the movie. The new Three Disc Set is "The Imperial Edition". Disc One has an new anamorphic Widescreen (2.00:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.0 Surround Sound and the original Mono sound. Disc One also has Theatrical Trailers of the infamous picture.Disc 2 is the pre-release version with most of the hardcore footage is gone from Guccione infamous version and this version is more coherent than disc one and correcting the bad obvious continuity error in this version. Disc One has the same anamorphic transfer and sound but the picture quality is slightly darker than disc 1. Three version has three commentaries tracks. Commentary one is by actor:McDowell and moderated by film writer Nick Redman. Commentary two is by actress:Mirren and moderated by film writers Alan Jones &amp; Chaffin. Commentary three is by on-set writer of the film:Ernest Volkman and moderated by Image DVD Producer:Nathaniel Thompson. Disc 2 also includes Deleted/Extended Scenes, while some they look interesting. Unfortunely, there's no sound on the dialogue and even no subtitles. Only could hear the score from the late Bruno Nicolai "Paul Clemente".Disc 3 has plenty of new bonus features as well. Three different featurettes with actor:John Steiner, Ex-Penthouse Pet:Lori Wagner and director:Brass. Which these interviews are fascinating and they offer different in-sights of the film. Disc 3 includes the original vintage one hour documentary as well the alternate 10 minute featurette, 15 behind the scenes featurettes and more. Die Hard fans of the film will enjoy this new edition. Although some viewers will find the Special Features more fascinating than the movie, especially the commentary tracks. This film went on to be a cult classic and it's the notorious behavior of the picture what makes "Caligula" is still talked about all these years. It would have been a different movie if Brass had his final cut on his film. Especially if Guccione didn't produced this film. The cast are extremely good in the movie (especially McDowell), production values are first-rate and Brass visual style makes this distasteful if odd film an strange experience. If you dislike pornography, it is closer to be a real film on disc 2 of "The Imperial Edition". It's still a very flawed film but at least, you knew the director of the film or the screenwriter intentions didn't want to make this picture a XXX feature. It was certainly one of the most fascinating movies ever made during the 1970's. Don't miss it. (****/*****).</fullReview>

I think Bob Guccioni tried to be all things to all people and it was just TOO MUCH. Too much blood and gore, too much graphic sex, the sets were huge and over the top. In fairness to everyone involved in this mess they had a great idea and just went overboard. The violence and sex, as graphic as it is, has almost a comical feel to it, as if not to be taken too seriously. McDowell wildly overacts as Caligula. This could have been great if only toned down somewhat and also if Guccioni had given the viewer some insight as to the cause of Caligula's madness instead of this viewer left groping as to figure out what the hell went wrong in Caligula's mind to do the terrible things he did. I wanted to know more about Caligula and wasn't given anything to try and figure him out. Instead we see sex (very graphic in the original version) and lots and lots of violence, which if handled properly I don't have a problem with. But Guccioni, in his attempt to shock (he succeeded very well)forgot the storyline and just went scattering in all different directions.

I don't know the history of how the film came together. Obviously it's controversial, but is it a quality film? Probably not, but I rated the movie alot higher because I found it deceptive. I heard lots about the nudity part. But I had no idea the film would show insanity to the core. It is much like the propaganda film Triumph of the Will. It changes your mood. Midway thru the film I was pretty much like whoopie.There is no plot. Sure he's gonna die. But that director while silly, but just deceptive as hell. Very good editing. To take a film that the actors thought had so so nudity and turn it into Penthouse was a feat. It's so seamless.One complaint. The dvd label. Penthouse musta used cheap ink.

		<fullReview>Although made in 1979, CALIGULA was touted as 'THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL FILM OF THE 1980'S. Released after experiencing censorship problems in the UK and heavy cuts, the film proved to be a debacle of filmmaking, not least due to the excess footage shot by Penthouse owner Bob Guccione. A 90 minute video version was released more recently, compared to the original full length two and a half hour version.In spite of some great sets, the film plays like an am-dram production at a community hall. The performances are substandard and every actor and actress seems underwhelmed and bored with their own performances.There are shock moments, but they are undermined by everything else and at the end of the film, you are not particularly interested. Still, there is potential for a much more assured remake, given the right film-maker and script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appalling film with a great film inside but unable to get out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb lists 121 users who have commented on this film - these comments will make 122. Clearly this very controversial film has attracted much more interest than many outstanding films that were released at about the same time, and this is presumably a direct result of its controversial content. Some information relating to the production of this film has become common knowledge and is referred to by several of the users who have provided comments for this database, nevertheless when the whole story is told, it will form a very interesting account of how not to create a great film. It appears that there are at least three often incompatible threads contributing to the film as it was finally released. The original script was an attempt to provide a framework for a historically accurate account of life at the Roman court during the reign of a mad emperor. This script was sufficiently complete to enable many fine stars to be signed up for major parts, but when filming began the Director, Tinto Brass, chose to exploit all the violent parts of his story to such an extent that several of the cast became very dissatisfied. John Gielgud for example who gave a very fine performance as Senator Nerva, later commented publicly that he wished he had had nothing to do with this film, even though his contribution to it must certainly have enhanced his reputation. Then we are told that prior to its release Bob Guccione, one of the principal backers, decided the excessive violence was so distasteful the film as produced would be a major flop. He therefore insisted on adding to it a large amount of additional sexual material, including the highly controversial lesbian action scenes, which did not readily fit in with the original story, but which he felt would increase its general appeal.How far all this is true may be hard to tell, but there is no doubt that some parts of the final film do not blend well with others. Whatever ones personal inclinations and tastes, there will be parts of the film to satisfy them, whilst other parts of it are likely to be offensive. Depending upon which parts one feels are most important, it is as easy to defend it as a great work as to condemn it as pornographic garbage.Sex and violence are both part of everyday life and therefore must have a place in many films. Fortunately most people enjoy a considerable amount of sexual activity but relatively few experience serious personal violence. Unfortunately current moral standards have meant that the latter is exploited far more often in films than the former, which immediately creates a distortion of normal life. The problem with Caligula is not that it faithfully reflects the violence that was a part of everyday life at the time, but that it concentrates on and emphasises this in a totally unrepresentative way which panders to any sadistic instincts that we may have. Its period is now historically fairly distant, and when we watch it we develop a self righteous glow because the standards of our own society have advanced such a long way during the intervening period. We do not think of the many modern dictators such as Hitler, Idi Amin or Sadaam Hussein who have recently behaved in just the ways portrayed by Caligula in this film. A film that would make us do this could be a great work of art.Ultimately Caligula is an appalling film as it is designed to pander to the worst instincts in each of us. There is a really great film within it which we sometimes see struggling to get out. But unfortunately it is never given the opportunity to do so. The rating I give it would depend upon whether it is being rated simply to guide readers as to its possible interest to them, or whether the rating is intended to recognise how far the film is successful as a work of art. In the former case my rating would be 1 on the 1-10 scale. In the latter case this film deserves some credit for attempting to display Roman court life with a semblance of historical veracity, rather than simply showing it as an ongoing sexual orgy liberally decorated by Penthouse pets (this would have been much easier to do and might have brought in better returns). It also merits credit for some fine acting from a few members of the cast such as John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole. On this basis I would reluctantly give it a rating of 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art Or Porn? . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this art or is it porn? I guess you could call it art-porn. Much like the Japanese classic, In The Realm Of The Senses (1976), it's a tough watch at times. Unlike it, however the sex is left to the extras -- however that was more art than porn, while Caligula is more porn than art. But after all, it was made by the guy who publishes Penthouse. However unlike most porn it has a plot, and some good acting as well, with some unforgetable performances. Malcolm McDowell's stomping "Little Boots" dance, with his thumb up, reminds me of him giving the "thumbs up" to the press at the end of A Clockwork Orange (1971), and is burned into my brain -- much like the giant head chopper. Truly one of the most unique props in cinematic history. And Hollywood stars in a porno movie? Now that was quite a promising idea! It's certainly been done enough the other way 'round -- what with Traci Lords and Ron Jeremy popping up all over the place. But this one was in done such bad taste, don't expect to see you favorite film stars doing any sex scenes anytime soon. I don't really think the ones in this flick knew hardcore would be edited in later. If you look at the votes on this film, you'll see most people either gave it a 10, or a 1. You'll either love it or hate it . . . but probably a bit of both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not so much a historical drama, as it is a fantasy movie. The depictions of sex and gore are graphically extreme, and sometimes they can even get disturbing. But I don't believe the producer's intentions for this movie were educational, but as an exercise to push the limits of what were acceptable on screen at that time. A lot of the stuff shown are still not acceptable in mainstream movies to this day, a quarter of a century later.The extreme stuff you see in this movie are not all that different than what you can see in a porn movie. However, a porn movie can't compare to the writing and acting in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real Gaius Caligula was a young boy thrust into power because the new order wanted to rid itself of Tiberius Caeser who represented the old decaying order. Caligula being the young boy he is goes about irresponsibly running Rome his way till he psychologically breaks down and soon after developes a nasty fever which sends him even further down spiraling into madness. His final days were closely monitored by his associates who eventually snuff him, his wife, and child out and place his stammering, limp walking Uncle Claudius into power. Claudius does bring peace to Rome but that is another story for another time. Penthouse Films under the leadership of Penthouse Magazine Publisher Bob Guccione takes the sexually perverted murderous side of the Caligula story and thrusts it into the spotlight. So much has been said about this movie that I cannot even begin to think about what actually to say here on IMDB. Because of the MPAA and The Federal Government under fire from Right Wing Liberal Christians, this movie will never ever be fully and truly a "Director's Cut Edition" untill the Right Wing Liberal Christians stop jerking their knees about pornography and obscenity. Also the MPAA needs to go out of business so that Guccione and other film makers out there can release their movies totally uncut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good description of a great but horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was unfortunately ruined by excessive violence and sex,but apart from that it was in some ways a good film surprisingly. For one thing I found this an extremely realistic and historic portrayal of the mad emperor Caligula. According to what I have read about this emperor the film is an accurate biography,however like any typical hollywood production it has been overdone. This film with it's scenes of depravity and gore may be disturbing or upsetting to those with either sensitive natures or sensitive stomachs. It has an amazingly good cast with Malcom McDowall portraying Caligula,Peter O'Toole playing the part of Tiberius and John Geilgud as Nerva. The acting for the most part was excellent and Peter O'Toole did a splendid performance as the depraved emperor Tiberius. I seriously doubt that such creatures like Tiberius and Caligula could have been portrayed any better than this. Such foul human beings as they were could only be depicted in this seemingly realistic manner. If this film can teach or show any thing instructive it can only be this. That the exercise of absolute power is corrupting to those who wield it and absolutely degrading to those who live under it. As Lord Acton put it "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gigantic, sparwling ugly mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula was a waste of time for everybody involved. So why not buy it and join the club! A somewhat ambitious project, written by Gore Videl, with an impressive cast and a $15,000,000 dollar budget, the film managed somehow under Tinto Brass' delicate and restrained, ahem, guidance to become two and a half hours of ugly overweight people fondling each other interspersed with some prime ham performances, extraneous gore footage and a really claustrophobic sense of set design. I don't mean that there is anything remotely psychologically adept with this, simply that for a film that wwas supposedly shot on location, this could mostly have been done on a sound stage at Pinewood. We get no shots of any real city streets, vast crowds or architecture, just murky and sometimes inaudible master shots that could have been taken in a cave.Is it accurate? Pretty much. Is there lots of gratuitous T&amp;A? Yep. Is it remotely engaging or entertaining? No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a follow-up to a review of CALIGULA that I've already posted. In that review, I stated the Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of the title character was an interesting departure from the creepy, effeminate image you usually see. I also, ignored John Hurt's portrayal in I, CLAUDIUS, because I hadn't seen the classic BBC television series when I wrote that review. Having remedied that situation, I wish to say that I still stand by my original statement. Hurt is a fine actor, but I still thought his portrayal fell into the effeminate creep category.I also think it's worth mentioning the CALIGULA omitted the brutal murder of his sister and unborn child that was attributed to him in I, CLAUDIUS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the documentary about the making of this movie was as interesting as the feature itself: Bob Guccione bravely saying that the film was very important amd would be a "must see" for every man and woman. I would like to know if the movie made boffo bucks. I think that would be interesting as a way to evaluate how it did. But as to the movie itself: it made me smile the way Guccione was taking it so seriously. Despite all that intention, it has the most amazing combination of clashing elements: top-name actors (surprise surprise), curiously amateurish sets (caves colored with spray paint, backdrops that look like an abandoned theatre stage), penises and poontang, hooters for all (including urination to make it complete), and murder any old time of the day (clean up that bloody mess will you please). It is way over the top, as it tries to create a new genre of dramatic cinema with real sex, and Guccione hoped it was going to be something serious in the cinematic world, like Vince McMahan thinking the XFL would create a revolution in American football. Well, they tried. Like the Xtreme Football League tried. Had they succeeded in establishing a new genre, we'd have uncut sex in more movies. More like real life, with a bit of the gritty bits of the old in-and-out included. Not a bad idea: Jack Nicholson's johnson for example, in widescreen, poking away. Definitely would add flavor to the screen. Can you imagine the makeup needed. But in Caligula, the main actors were professionals, except that the designers, directors, and the rest were goofy without realizing it. Had Guccione tried again with a few more films, polishing the product till the concept was smooth, he might've succeeded in carving out the genre he wanted, and we'd all be flushed in our seats. Well no one said movie making was easy, never mind re-invention. Caligula's interesting, worth a look (get the uncut version for the full effect), and a brave effort. Keep a barf bag handy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been talked about as one of the most controversial movies of all time, well, there is no doubt about that. What distinguishes Caligula from the rest of your run of the mill Roman Empire movies isthat it is loaded with weird and disgusting violence and sex. I'm no history buff, but I very much doubt this movie is accurate. Something went incredibly wrong with this movie when Bob Guccione picked up thescript. Penthouse and film are not one in the same. Mr. Guccione insisted on this statement being false. I'm not going to completely give this movie a 0 because I believe Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, and Helen Mirren played there parts very well. Especially McDowell giving a performance very similar to A Clockwork Orange. Therefore Iwill give the movie a 2/10 mainly for the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art or obscenity? Very much in the eye of the beholder!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When discussing CALIGULA (That being the title by which it is predominantly known world-wide - not CALIGOLA !) it becomes necessary to distinguish WHICH version you are referring too. Personally I have had the (mis)fortune to see all three and they vary colossally - trust me! The original Penthouse-release which has been screened at mostly underground art-houses runs for over 210 minutes and contains scenes that would pale the most ardent voyeur or paedophilic raincoater! Full on rape with full-blown (poor choice of words, I realise) penetration, sodomy, erections every which way and total hard-core sexual perversion. Violence you just wouldn't credit to being filmable let alone able to be released etc etc. I really don't feel inclined to "review" this particular monstrosity. Just take it from me, it projects sick-filmaking to never-again-to-be-approached stomach churning levels. The "Director's Cut" runs nearer 150 minutes. Most of the (really) hard-core stuff has been sliced and diced but still offers "enough" if you get my meaning! The "Edited Version" is almost sanitised and at barely 110 minutes (Less in the US and some other countries) has had almost two full hours of sex and violence trimmed from the original. The Directors Cut and Edited version I believe contain more "historical" footage. Many other "cuts" exist in various countries which have "trimmed" or "allowed" certain scenes according to individual censorship.One thing remains inarguable however. This is a strictly one-off film or to put it another way..one, extremely "off" film! Question is? how did they get so many respectable people to appear in it? My guess is that actors such as Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud, were not made aware of anything much beyond the scenes they were in. Malcolm McDowell was a different proposition. After the experience of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE...probably nothing would have seemed to be too much of an excess! As the mad emperor, McDowell gives a credibly insane performance. His pursuit of his sister Drusilla pulls few punches, not that the average family would want to see this particular aspect. Tinto Brass who at best is a celluloid exploitationist ran hot and cold here. Exterior sets were surprisingly impressive. Interiors were rather less grand, running the gamut of acceptable to laughable (Curtains to hide the studio behind!)Historically questionable, morally reprehensible and of dubious entertainment value CALIGULA is one of those films any serious film-buff needs to see. Just don't either TELL anyone or TAKE anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting experiment, Bob, but it didn't work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CALIGULA isn't great art and IS repulsive enough to outrage all but the most jaded of viewers. But is it simply a sham? Myself, I consider it an especially twisted example of what Gahan Wilson calls an "art trap"-- a film that attempts to be art, but instead ends up being a device that hopefully will trap art, just as a mouse trap hopefully will capture a mouse. I think Bob Guccione was aiming at what Ridley Scott successfully created twenty years later with GLADIATOR -- a historical epic with the brutal frankness that was prohibited back when Rhett Butler almost wasn't allowed to say "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."And CALIGULA has good points,, such as Malcolm McDowell in the title role. McDowell's evil magnetism serves this role well, mainly because it helps convince you that Caligula was as charismatic and popular as history tells us. This is in sharp contrast to the creepy, effeminate image presented in movies such as THE ROBE. McDowell's portrayal also works toward Gore Vidal's intended goal of suggesting that Caligula wasn't simply a monster, and actually may have had more in common with some of us present-day "normal" folk than we want to believe.. An interesting corollary to this suggestion is that Caligula's monstrous behavior might be due at least in part to his knowing he wasn't qualified to be the emperor, and thus trying to cover it up by torturing and killing everyone who might have exposed him. In fact, we see him utter his famous statement, "Let them hate me, so long as they fear me," in self-defense when his wife takes him to task. Up until he executes Gemellus, he even reminds me a bit of Macbeth.And consider the similarity between Caligula and CLOCKWORK ORANGE's psychopathic Alex,, perhaps McDowell's most famous role. If Alex was a student of Roman history, Caligula was probably his hero. This connection makes the two movies interesting companion pieces to each other. Then, there's the surrealistic, other-worldly atmosphere. I'm thinking especially of the sequence in Tiberius's weird, multi-level abode, and the way the action goes from one level to another when the mood changes. We're on one level while Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) enjoys his romp with his "little fishies," then move to another level where he brutally tortures and executes a young soldier for drinking on duty. But all of this manages only to elevate CALIGULA from a fiasco to an interesting failure. CALIGULA's main problem is what I call the Take advantage of/Taken Advantage of Syndrome, That's when the filmmakers set out to take advantage of some resource that wasn't available to others before them, and end up being taken advantage of by that very resource, because it takes over. In CALIGULA, the resource is the aforementioned explicitness that was prohibited in earlier times. So much attention is devoted to portraying the depravity and debauchery of the times that precious little is paid to anything else -- Like making the point that was originally intended. I'm guessing CALIGULA was SUPPOSED to argue that the combination of debauched society and absolute power enabled and nurtured the worst facets of Caligula's character, ultimately making him a monster. This argument was then supposed to raise the question of what you or I, or any normal person we know, might become under the same circumstances. Instead, CALIGULA waffles between two contradictory but equally simplistic assertions -- "Society was to blame," and "He was a sadistic wacko." If only CALIGULA had tried a bit harder to convince us that there was some other, more positive, side to Caligula's nature that Roman society suppressed.And if only a major historical event hadn't been conspicuous by its absence. If I've got my history correct, Jesus was crucified at about the same time Tiberius was assassinated, which means that the Apostle Paul would have shown up in Rome during Caligula's reign to say, "Hey remember that guy you THOUGHT you got rid of?" The Good News would have been both significant and disturbing to Caligula, since he believed he was God Incarnate. (This issue is dealt with in THE ROBE.) This omission might not have jumped out at me if the movie hadn't begun by putting Mark 8:36 on the screen. Still, one positive thing I can say from a Christian perspective is that CALIGULA lays out in very graphic terms what the first Christians were up against.Even if there had been a better balance between the graphic sex and violence and the other elements of CALIGULA, there's another problem that still might have proved fatal -- trying to have it both ways. Part of Guccione's stated intention was to combine two genres, the grand Hollywood epic and the underground adult film. And I think there might be a third genre in the mix -- the deliberately "sick" movie, epitomized by PINK FLAMINGOS. Well, as other filmmakers have found when trying to combine disparate genres, the audience that's interested in one will hate the other, so that everyone will hate the movie as a whole. Those who want to see serious historical drama don't want to watch lesbian sex scenes, and vice versa. And I bet neither faction wants to watch someone vomit blood -- in slow motion.But again, I wouldn't dismiss CALIGULA as a rip-off. It's an experiment that didn't work, partly because of poor judgment, and partly because it may have been doomed to failure. As such, it deserves some kind of recognition for trying to break new ground. I do, however, think Guccione needs to get off his high horse (or maybe he's in bed with his high horse?) and stop trying to convince us this is great art. If he would admit his experiment didn't work, maybe Mr. General Public would be more sympathetic to his having tried it.And by the way -- did that horse still respect Malcolm McDowell in the morning?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The life and times of the mad Roman emperor Caligula.What a curiosity piece: A Gore Vidal script that had been doing the rounds for years, but considered too risqu for mainstream Hollywood, produced as a big budget epic by softcore powerhouse Bob Guccione..Quite what the Penthouse boss had in mind is anybody's guess, but it cannot be what appears on screen. This production seems like a video nasty made by the Carry On team. Most of the blame has to go to director Tinto Brass who was only known for producing low budget exploitation - and this hasn't changed in the years since.Amazing cast: Malcolm McDowell (doing his best-of-breed mad act in the title role), Helen Mirren, Peter O'Tool and - wait for it, wait for it - John Gielgud (Sir later): What a brave actor he is, takes every part so seriously and his diction is in another league.The problem with this film is that some people want to see a porno, others want a horror film, while others might want a black comedy. It is non of these things. What it is doesn't actually have name but if it did the word would have to smack of excess.To be fair, real Roman times were bloody and violent and sex was the TV of the day. The fact that so many people have been brought up on the Hollywood myth version is not the producers fault. Some of the scenes are gruesome (the beheading scene is gross!) and some of the text is pure silly. There are hints of child sex (adult actors were chosen that looked young) that leave a bad taste in the mouth.The movie shows all the signs of the internal struggle that overtook the production and you feel that those that initially passed on this script had plenty of good reasons to do so.Worth seeing if you have a strong stomach and want to see a one-of-a-kind movie. That doesn't mean it is very good though.</fullReview>

Some years back the BBC produced a series with Frankie Howerd called "Up Pompeii" and this pic is along the same lines but with the added spice of titilating scenes which the cast do with real relish. I did some Web research into the real Caligula and there is quite a lot of truism in the movie; for instance he was bonking his sister and 2 other sisters as well, and he was so worried about going thin on top he ordered that no one could look down on him from on high. There is a star "studded" cast including Helin Mirren as a sex symbol. A Cult picture for sure!</fullReview>

Caligula is nuttier, but both characters display a lovely amount of deviance and depravity. I felt that the Tinto Brass's directing was pretty average, but the story was well constructed, and it feels reassuring that a movie like this could be made in the late 70s. Tricking respected actors into starring in a historical porno is really a great success story for the adult industry, and I'd like to see it happen again sometime.In summation, if you like old cult movies that have scared the moralists and the self-righteous with soft-stomachs, then this no holds barred, historically accurate film is right up your alley. Not to be cliche or anything . . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average movie, not as bad as it's reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this film I had some expectations. Now I've seen it and it really isn't that bad. I have to admit that some porn scenes don't really fit in the movie very well and they are needless. If you just ignore that, you'll find an average and in one way very interesting movie.It's unusual to make this kind of movies of Rome and I have already seen enough great hero and happy end movies of Roman Emperors etc. The story itself is quite good and the actors do their job ok. Malcom McDowell really looks like mad.This movie is already some kind of a legend and I recommend it to all people who want to see a different movie. Of course if you think seeing blood is disgusting this one isn't for you. I thought giving a 6 to this but ignoring those useless porn scenes it's a 7. I have only seen the longer "original" version so it might have been interesting to see the short version too. I'm still glad that I saw this version and the material that have made this movie so famous. It's a movie you're going to like or hate, watch yourself and decide. Don't just look the overall user rating.</fullReview>

Well, the version that I saw had none of what I was expecting - the scenes that made the film controversial. I wanted to see the whole movie, including the graphic elements to accurately evaluate the work. If you want to see what all the talk is about, don't bother with the version being shown on cable.

		<shortDescription>A mutant-extreme-adult-epic-opulent pantomine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about the Roman Emperor Caligula and his mad, mad rule encompassing all manner of sexual, violent and despotic acts. As his mind became increasingly erratic, uncontrollable and unstable, Rome faced a dangerous period of uncertainty. The period of cinema from 1968-1982 was arguably characterised by a number of films with similarly conflicted temperaments. Its an era which produced some of the darkest, cruelest, most explicit and yet most lush, grand and fascinating films ever produced. Often epic in scale or aim, these films contained scenes of fading hope buried deep beneath their harsh, exotic exteriors. In spite of their odd beauty, these films remain severe indictments (whether intended or not) of societies and cultures while recognising the seductive and indulgent ecstacy of their era. Caligula (the 1977/80 film) is the opulent, fascinating but often empty climax to this genre. Few films are such a potpourri of forces, such a bastard blend of genres, themes and aims. Caligula is an epic runaway horse, bolting from the reins of all its conlicting masters: Tinto Brass (original director/disowned end result), Gore Vidal (original writer/disowned end result), Bob Guccionne (money man/final cut master - film extremely altered by him). All these Dr Frankensteins' added something to this film before unleashing it as the tainted, demonised monster it now has become. Guccionne tried to (w)rec(k)tify the film by adding porn inserts and Penthous-ing it up while Brass seems to have attempted to make the film an historical, decadent epic along the lines of his own film Salon Kitty which focused upon Nazism in WW2 (which featured similarly extreme violence and opulence in dubious circumstances). Gore Vidal provided the outline of the tale but much of the homo-eroticism and cruelty of the era have been de-nuded by Guccione's straight-porn industry busi-nous (sic). Of course none of them reign supreme but elements of all these men's visions compete in the film no matter which version you see (the original version shown at Cannes was apparently 3 hours and 30 minutes, the "uncut" versions are around 2 hours and 30-40 minutes, and the modified/"cut" versions range from just under two hours to just over - there are a number of versions about.) Caligula is a piece of cinema history not to be missed; its scale and vision are distinctive to the 70s/80s film universe where porn flirted with mainstream filmmaking and vice-versa (Deep Throat, The Case of The Smiling Stiffs etc); where extreme-films and horror-flicks were reaching supreme powers (think The Exorcist, Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, Dawn of the Dead to name only a few). Caligula was the end of an era however in many ways; its extremity and warped historical consciousness would give way to a more limited extremity in the likes of Tarentino (a pulp consciousness though no less cruel or indulgent). In Caligula there is something of a mockery of the institution of power, a nose-turned up at the righteous who believe power and desire can be controlled and yet equally a fear concerning the limits of unlimited passion/desire/power and its expression. Its a film full of excellent performers who no doubt quietly relished the excesses afforded them in this wild epic film. Its reminds me of a mutant historical, adult-epic-pantomine. The sets are huge and the fantasy elements of mutations and deviations are over-the-top. It would be incredible to see what was left out of this film on the cutting room floor - to see three different versions - The Vidal Caligula (more homo-erotic/literate) + The Brass Caligula (more extreme/saucy) as well as the Guccione Caligula (porn-pourri). I imagine this may remain something of a fancy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie? I dont think so!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "Caligula" two years ago I hated this film totally! It seemed to be nothing more than a boring and ridiculous porn movie. The rumors that were going around were more interesting than the film itself. Recently I saw "Caligula" again and now I watch it as a bizarre piece of art. Nowadays such movies dont get made anymore, but this were the early 80s, the golden age of the adult cinema, Grindhouse, gore and exploitation. Modern shots like the French "Baise-moi" try to cause a scandal by combining a "real" story with explicit sex scenes, but its nothing else "Caligula" did more than twenty years before... Next to "A Clockwork Orange" Malcolm McDowell gave one of the most powerful performances of his career with playing the charismatic and megalomaniac tyrant, although this film got nothing but bad reviews when it came out. Also brilliant actors like Peter OToole, Sir John Gielgud or Helen Mirren seemed to have appeared in one of the most awful films ever made. Actually, the story of "Caligula" has got the same potential as the praised "Gladiator" has. The problem for many people was that the film was much more radical and provoking because of its explicit porn sequences as they had expected. Definitely not a film for everyone, but for those who like unusual movie culture it is a must-see!7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caligula is a very neat movie from many points. First, that someone like the people from Penthouse really being interested in history, and this film is very historically accurate. As well having big name actors baring thier souls and bodies for a film like this. Also, sex seems to be a point that other reveiwers bring up, but in this film the sex is actually dirty and not a turn on. Even in the graphic lesbian scene, while the girls enjoy each other, the music is actually very sombre and dark. This is not a hard core sex flick, and I hate it being described that way. There is excellent acting, a good story, and great sets. It's a little dated from 1980, but still holds up well 20 years later. It's also obvious that the actors loved what they were doing, and believed in the over all project. This was a labour of love, and a very important movie. Hats off to all involved in this movie, I'm glad you all had the guts to make it, and put your reputations on the line. For people who have not seen this movie yet, you have to watch the unrated version that runs 156 minutes! Cheers! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outsider Cinema with a Big Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Further proof that the line between inept and visionary is sometimes invisible. Having heard about Caligula since it was first released, I took advantage of the DvD issue to see it. Neither as good nor as bad as its reputation, I found the film to be one of those movies that is hard to compare to traditional films. The reviewer here who compared it to Plan 9 is right -- not because Caligula is as bad a movie, but because, like Plan 9, it discards nearly all the conventional ideas about filmmaking and strikes out boldly, even foolishly, on its own. The unrated version is far more graphic in its sex scenes than I was expecting, and adds to the sense of the film's resolute difference from other movies. A mish-mash of directorial styles -- from trite to frenetically bizarre -- Caligula lurches from predictable to surprising, sometimes within the same scene. Nearly every element of the film is eccentric, from the script to the lighting, whether through design or mistake is beyond my ability to judge. For fans of outsider cinema, with a tolerance for porn and an ability to forgive silly costumes, strained dialogue, and a moral stance that can only be summed up as deranged, Caligula is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as all that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment refers to the unrated 156 min. version. Although I haven't seen "Boogie Nights," from reading about it, it seems that in the late '70's there was some thought that porn could go mainstream. "Caligula" should be seen as an effort to further that idea. Well, we all know that didn't happen. But, I think that's why the porn scenes were included. Otherwise, this film unsatisfactorily straddles two incompatible markets. Many people will be offended by the explicit scenes, but there aren't nearly enough of them to satisfy the porn crowd. Perhaps that's also why some major stars appeared in this film. It may have been unclear at the time what the ultimate limits of sex in mainstream films would end up being. "Caligula" answered that question, the answer being "Not that far."About the film. Direction was fairly poor. The script could have been better. Within these limitations, most of the cast did very well. Malcolm McDowell nailed the part. Peter O'Toole played it a bit over the top, but how could he resist. Sir John Gielgud maintained his dignity, as he always did. I haven't seen Teresa Ann Savoy anywhere else, but she certainly was beautiful, and did OK. Helen Mirren was great. No, the film wasn't totally historically accurate, but it's a historical drama, not a documentary. I saw men sitting at tables to eat, and to a Roman, only barbarians did not lie down to eat. I never saw an accurate-looking toga, either. Although Caligula often wore deep red, which is likely what the ancients referred to as purple. A historical note to a previous comment. Caligula wasn't the last of the "legitimate" Roman emperors, meaning those with some familial ties to Gaius Julius Caesar. He was followed by Claudius, and then Nero, who was the last emperor related in any way to Caesar. Afterward, the emperor was usually whoever could amass the most military power. Overall, this film is OK. There are some disturbing, and even offensive images. There are some good acting performances, limited by direction, writing, and some cheesy sets. The violence is not really any worse than that occurring in the average slasher movie today. It has some (cinematic) historical value as the failed attempt at merging porn with other filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since i was twelve i wanted to see this film because it was in the ADULT section of the video store and it had plenty of sex and violence. I was 15 when i finally saw it and i was very disappointed. First of all it is no where near an ADULT film at all!!!!. Its more an ART HOUSE/CULT film!!! Second of all its a huge expensive mess. While it can be visually interesting at times it is also extremely boring at times, it is no where near as violent or sexy as it is hyped up to be. What also amazed me was it should have been a great epic due to fine actors, many shakesperian actors including Malcom McDowell, Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Gielgud. The only scene i liked was the love scene between Lori Wagener and Anneki Di Lorenzo. See it anyway, just so u can say u have seen it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Under the pretense of giving us Caligula and his empire as a mirror of the modern world and our own excess, the film revels in the very things it claims to show as corrupt. The quote from the Gospel which opens the film is part of the pretension of this sex-fest masquerading as a morality play.The film is hypnotic as it appeals to Freud's primitive id and labido, but its own excess is silly to the point of being parody. It seems that Gore Vidal couldn't make up his mind as to whether Caligula was mad or just an anarchist trying to tear down outworn institutions, so he is played somewhere in the middle.The "making of" documentary is just as interestingly pretentious as the film. It is narrated by a voice that is a cross between a spooky vampire and a dirty old man, and with such ominous tones as to make the film and the making of the film seem to have a grave importance far beyond what it deserves. In the end, I had the feeling that the whole thing was an elaborate hoax used to display Penthouse pets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should only be seen for one reason..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wondering why this was a classic, I guess because of the explicitedness of the movie and the well known actors in it. Unfortunately I fast forwarded most of this movie because the sex and violence got to be too much. It could have been a much better movie if it stayed on the character of Caligula more then having the shock value of disgusting torture and orgies. Maybe a little of the would have been enough to save this film. But I guess it understandable since the founder of Penthouse funded this movie. The only reason to see this movie is for Malcolm Macdonald. He is incredible and disturbing in this movie. He plays crazyed maniacs so well, take Clockwork Orange. He is ten times worse the character of Alex in Orange! If he wasn't in this movie, it would have been a porno with a plot. Malcolm saved this movie. The only other thing in it worth watching is the scenes with his sister. Yes, again it is disturbing knowing they are doing naughty things to each other they shouldn't, but there is good chemisty and the final scene between them is interesting and very well acted. Other wise this movie leaves you sick and disgusted. Maybe that was the point. But sometimes the more subtle works then having it in your face constantly. If they went with the more subtle in this movie, then I think it would be the classic that it could have been. But one question, why did 4 well known and superb actors go for this movie? Other than Malcolm, I don't see what it can do for their resume. Maybe just to say they were in a semi-porno?? But if you ever do really want to see it beware!! But see it for Macolm Macdonald's performance. He makes the whole movie. Other than that it's is really a waste of fine actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was around 8 years old a friend of the family told my brother about Caligula. I was born in '77 so this had to be about '85 or '86 and that is how long I have been looking for this film. I found a little whole in the wall video store and and watched this film late one night and fortunately I found the uncut version. I loved this film because it was blantantly sexual. I was wondering while watching this film what other films would be like if they had sex scenes in them. For example if Jason's Lyric would have had actual penetration scenes with Jada Pinkett, I would own that film because it adds on to the sexuality of the topic. However Caligula was about open uncivilized sex acts like orgies, homo sex, and sodomy. And that was only because it was produced by Penthouse. The story is sick, Malcolm Mcdowell portrayed an undercover sissy with Caligula, and the final scene focusing on Caligula's face was very disturbing but overall the sex scenes were great! I'm almost surprised this film was not in the x-rated section. Now that I've seen it I must own, long live american cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caligula is a sickening, sexually explicit, erotic, and yet strangely watchable historical drama. However, after fifteen-minutes of the film, I became well aware that the emphasis of the film would be in the direction of sex and violence. The film is supposedly a portrait of Gaius Caligula's four year reign as ruler of Rome. In this "uncut" version, the film focuses on his EXTREME disregard for human life. The film (notable for it's many decapitations, disembowelments, eviscerations, and graphic sex) is nothing short of pornography, although the violence had a more severe impact on me. Malcolm McDowell is convincing in the role, but his performace reaches high camp. Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, and Peter O'Toole are more effective in their briefer roles. In the end, however, violence and sex rule over plot. My advice: try the r-version or 143 minute one, which are both graphic but toned down.NOTE: This version is not completely hardcore. The 156 minute version is even more graphic, although this is still pretty sick stuff!</fullReview>

Roman public life was very separated from private life and this film mixes both with a deliberate purpose of showing trash.I recommend that Mr.Guccione learns Latin and reads Plutarc, Cicero and Satiricon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not ENOUGH sex!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not so much about Caligula, the man and his time, but about contemporary society's reaction to it. Let's face it, a film with twice the sex and violence would still be a toned down version of reality. Ten years after it's release I appeared in a stage version of Caligula (different script). In the stage version several actors had nude scenes (including myself). It was a new, exciting. and frightening experience for most of us, but the nudity brought honesty to the performances. I saw the movie version for the first time a year after the stage production and noticed only one problem. There was not ENOUGH sex or nudity, even in the X-rated version. There was not enough chances taken by the stars (the hottest scenes were actually added later using extras.) If the actors were going to appear in this film they should have made a higher level of commitment. Many film actors are willing to push the envelope all the way, however they will only push as far as the market will allow them. Caligula was such a perfect vehicle for mainstream actors to legitimately move into relations and emotions reserved only for X-rated films. But how can they when critics react as if they've just witnessed the devil on earth! The stage version's sex scenes were limited to what was legal on stage (not much). This made it somewhat unreal for the actors involved. The film's limitations were set by the actors and director. Tsk tsk. Maybe the critics didn't like it because it seemed all to forced. They might have as well made Caligula Goes To Camp and added a trailer from some cheap porno (which in essence is what the producer did). I hope someone films a remake of Caligula with some of the hot brave actors of today. Maybe the critics and audience will still hate it. But it would still be a better film. Give 'em hell Caligula, not heck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Caligula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was violent, pornographic, insulting, disturbing, disgusting, shocking, and offensive in a multitude of ways. NEVERTHELESS....it wasn't bad.The era that it depicts was brutal and dangerous, with a system of conduct, morality and laws very different from those of today, and for those reasons, one cannot appreciate this film by seeing it through 20th century standards. Instead, you've got to view it, as best you can, with some awareness of the historical period that it depicts, and I think that it manages to do a good job of creating a realistic picture of that era, certainly better than many other films did about Ancient Rome.Needless to say, back in 1980, the critics absolutely trashed this film, most of whom I imagine were offended by the porn. I will admit that at least some of the sex and violence can be regarded as gratuitous. But if you can get past that, you'll realize that this is really a story about power, and how it can corrupt.McDowell is an excellent actor and quite convincing in the title role. By the end of the film, you wind up both hating and fearing him, become overjoyed and relieved at his fate, and have to remind yourself that it's only a movie. That, of course, is the sign of a good performance (i.e., the ability to generate those types of feelings in the audience). O'Toole and Gielgud are also very good and do justice to this film. The use of the Spartacus Ballet in the musical score works well, and some of the film's situations and lines are quite amusing - for instance, I love the scene in which Caligula intimidates the entire Senate into bleating like goats.I wonder if this film would have been received differently if it had been made 20 years later. In other words, perhaps it was a bit ahead of its time. I honestly don't believe it deserved the trashing it received, and I wouldn't be surprised if a similar film emerges in the near future that gets better acclaim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Caligula" has to be one of the most bizarre, disgusting, vile, depraved, yet, beneath the muck, entertaining. Tinto Brass, I believe, began directing it, but in post-production, none other than Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse Magazine, got his hands on it, and added about six minutes of hard-core footage, and some very, very, very explicit violence. This caused Tinto Brass, and Gore Vidal, who supposedly wrote the screenplay, to remove their names from the credits.Well, anyway, the film starts with that infamous quote from Mark about a man losing his soul and gaining the whole world, but I can't help but think it opens on the wrong note, with Caligula and Druisilla, his sister, a dreadful Teresa Ann Savoy, screwing around in a field. Anyway, the acting is good, but two of the characters, John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, whose names were used to attract attention, probably, are knocked off early. Malcolm McDowell is the insane Emperor, organizing orgies and torture, and even a man gets castrated and his genitals are fed to a hungry dog (in a very close-up shot, mind you). But somehow, beneath all the muck, and that silly hardcore footage, there are some very good performances to be found.***Note***It's hardly possible to come across the original version of this film, unless your local video rental or store carries hardcore stuff. An edited R-version, more like the one Tinto Brass directed, at 105 min. is more commonly found. And, too, if you are the least bit squeamish, do not see this movie!! (at least the X-rated version!!)**********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is power if man must give up his soul to acquire it?What would you do if you had control over an entire Roman empire?This movie asks just these question and even more so shows you what did happen at the extreme when a man named Caligula loses his soul to power. With a trilogy of orgies and foul and strange bizzare incest that Caligula shows one tends to ask why? Caligula does not glamorize any of the foul things it displays but simply puts them there for you to see and make your own decision. Perhaps it's a moral story? Perhaps it's porn for thought?The acting is very good for both Peter O'Toole who plays Tiberious and Malcom Mcdowell who plays Caligula. If you liked Mcdowell in "A Clockwork Orange" you will definitely enjoy this movie. Something about Mcdowell playing crazed lunatics that makes his movies he is in all the more interesting.So let the kiddies go to bed and rent this with a close friend or with your husband or wife. If any of you are squirmish. I would recommend not watching this film. Watch Caligula with an open mind and I promise you will not be disappointed. For the story of Caligula is a true one and asks a lot of moral questions and gives a lot of Porn for thought.The TRUTH is a VERY un-censored thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turned it on but got turned off !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed the full-length, uncut version of this film and it struck me as merely an attempt to make a porno version of the Ten Commandments with a bit of Night of the Living Dead thrown in. Guccione's idea seems to have been to portray the perverse and sick side of the Roman era and at the same time, to destroy the Hollywood perception of Biblical movies (given the cast of some well-established actors and actresses). The result was an absolutely disgusting film whose only merit was in its shock value. As many of my fellow IMDb reviewers have pointed out, there is actually a scene early in the film where a group of individuals are buried up to their necks in the ground and are decapitated by a lawn-mower type machine wielding a very large blade. And the scene is very graphic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think engines existed in this era ! As for the remainder, the script is just plain awful and speaking quite frankly, the "adult" scenes (if we can refer to them that way) are not very stimulating or exciting at all. Also, there are many scenes of orgies, bestiality, incest, and just about any other perversion you can think of. To me, this movie was an expensive attempt to create a pornographic film set to the backdrop of Ancient Rome and throwing in extreme violence and established actors just to lend it some credibility. I'm sure there are many historical errors here as well but in short, this is just an awful attempt at cinema. At a length of a little over 2 and 1/2 hours, it really becomes boring and pointless. Also, if we check the history books, this movie isn't even close to the facts. For one, the emperor's name was not even Caligula. That was a nickname given to him by the Roman soldiers when he was a little boy. It literally means "little boots". He would parade around in front of the soldiers in a soldiers uniform that his mother made for him, which included a tiny set of army boots. And, his reign as emperor only lasted 4 years and was, by far, more violent than sexually perverse. He wound up being assassinated by 2 soldiers whom he insulted. So, this movie technically fails on 2 fronts. Terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pile of unsaleable tat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a glorified pimp steals control of a masterpiece, and when the moral compasses of all involves withers away, then worlds of cinemas collapse. Logical, no? Once, several years before Star Wars, Gore Vidal wrote a screenplay about possibly the most depraved Roman emperor of Ancient times. It's probably safe to say that his mistake was in asking a porn magazine to fund this movie's production. Throw in the involvement of Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione and you have Caligula, one of the most notorious failures of 70s cinema. While it's not quite as vicious as Cannibal Holocaust, it's still excessively exploitative; while Holocaust used real killings, Caligula used real sex - so as to try to boost sales of Penthouse magazine, apparently. So what grabbed my attention for this film so strongly, especially when I initially thought it'd give me nightmares? I mean it's not like it's entirely historically accurate, is it? Well... it's got Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren, among others. And the musical score is recognisable, at least among classical music aficionados.Well, I took one for the team when I went to pick up a copy of the Imperial Edition DVD set. This included the uncut release... which SHOULD warrant an R18 where I live but somehow doesn't... the 1999 "Rated Version", misrepresented as the "Theatrical Version"... and there's the one I chanced at, the Alternative "Pre-Release" Edition, a new edit created from an earlier cut which re-arranges a few scenes back into their original context, and most of the explicit sexual inserts added by Guccione are removed, filled in by a handful of 16mm behind-the-scenes footage. So, fair enough, it's not so much of a sex film as it was before. But not even that could save Caligula from being one of the most miserable films I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing.From start to finish this turkey blows (in more ways than one!), and it's not hard to see why: you have three conflicting artistic differences duking it out, and while sometimes it works, it can't really be excused that sometimes you can forget you're watching a film with explicit sex, and then a helping of genitalia brings you back to earth with an unpleasant thump. Not to mention the violence, as well - in one early scene, a soldier has several gallons of wine poured down his gullet, and Tiberius personally pokes a hole in him... just to prove to us that neither the Ancient Romans nor the Modern Writers have limits when it comes to pointless and senseless violence. Still... I guess it's fair game if, historically, Tiberius ordered to have the scales of a fish rub off a victim's face...And as for the explicit porn - how did this get into public cinemas again? It's clear proof that Bob was a sex tycoon who sneaked back onto the set to film a hardcore porno movie for which - though as I recall, most of the acts are legal - the authorities could shut down the set and sentence everyone to jail. It almost happened anyway - in several theatres the movie was shut down and seized by police! I'm just saying that this is the sort of thing that doesn't bear watching if you aren't in the mood. I'm not going to say anything about them, for obvious reasons. Even if I did, perhaps my arguments would be invalid - except for the fact that they replaced some of the more important scenes.This excessive sex and violence aside, the point is this: Caligula in general is a major dud - a long, drawn-out (seriously it drags on well over two hours!!) piece of work of which not one bit is historically accurate, nor assembled in a historically accurate order. If Bob was holding out for artistic freedom, then he'd failed in that respect because really, even ART has standards! Of course, it's not all bad news... Malcolm, Helen, Peter, John and co. did a fairly good job in their acting, and the music, like I said, is a splendid compilation to listen to. The sets aren't bad either, even if they do represent a nightmarish version of Ancient Rome. Also on the Imperial Edition DVD, there are a few deleted scenes which SHOULD have stayed in the film, as they surely would make it less of a disgrace than it is now. A complete and detailed history of the production of the film is also being written by James Ellis Chaffin and Ranjit Sandhu, with research from Thomas Ryerson, called 200 Degrees of Failure: The Unmaking of Caligula, slated for a release sometime this year, or possibly the next. You can find a lot of their research at their site (caligula.ws). I'm sure that the story behind how Gore Vidal's work fell apart would be a much interesting read, and I'm looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters show flesh, but never flesh out in another attempt to bring history to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his sister's tragic death, Caligula (played by Malcolm McDowell), after declaring a month's mourning, surreptitiously walks through the streets disguised as a beggar and witnesses the lawlessness and decadence of his people. When, in a show, two people dressed as Caligula and his dead sister Drusilla enact vaudeville, an outraged Caligula disrupts the event and is later thrown into a dingy underground cell where many other offenders of both sexes perform depraved acts of fondling openly. A greasy bearded man comes to him and asks for money but Caligula outwits the man and in turn wins his respect. When free, he finds the senate to be a corrupt quagmire swimming with offenders of all kinds, and extracts his revenge on them, also appointing criminals at the prison as Senate members. At this moment did I really was able to appraise how far this film would have gone had it been told by a competent director and written by a capable writer. Unfortunately, Gore Vidal has written this film and Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione have directed it, and therefore Caligula, a biopic of one of the most notorious rulers in the Middle Ages, became Caligula, the most controversial film of the 20th century, now the most controversial film of the 21st century. Its fate is similar to Mommie Dearest's and The Room ? the makers themselves fear that they wouldn't recover their money and therefore advertise the film in a different, crude way.Caligula, as mentioned above, intended to show the rise and fall of the Emperor most known for his brutal executions, salacious and extravagant life and eventual madness. Thank god the filmmakers refrained from showing the 'sawing' method of execution otherwise it would've caused even more outrage. They however did pay particular attention to the 'sex' and the 'violence', and we do see Caligula giving orders, mostly irrational and bizarre, but that is all we get in the 156 minutes of the film. A quick read through Wikipedia should be more resourceful ? it is believed that after Caligula's accession, the first two years was marked with development. Caligula had passed many laws for the benefit of the people and therefore was respected by his countrymen. His mental debilitation was gradual, and many stories about his cruelty were debatable. Gore Vidal and the directors of the film aren't interested in most of the facts, all they want is to depict an infinitely evil and barbarous Caligula and an equally filthy Rome.The most unforgiving part about the film is that it always wants to reach the extremes of everything ? sex, violence and corruption, and in the process, obliterates any space for true human feelings among the characters. Compare this with A Clockwork Orange and we find that Alex resided in a radical, dystopian society that resembled, in a metaphysical way, our modern, changing society. Caligula does not give this feeling at all, because it was written without much thinking by Vidal possibly while he was hating the world or feeling aroused. Sex in Caligula includes incest, fondling, rape, fisting, deep throats, oral sex, anal sex, ejaculations etc by straight, gays, lesbians and some weird humans. The nudity is so high, if the movie were released in India its runtime would be four minutes or even less. In fact, the movie makes you want to see more clothed people rather than the opposite! Most of it is exaggerated and depicts a pornographic version of ancient Rome, except that many of the models look hideous. The violence is offensive because it mostly includes genital mutilations rather than stabbing or poisoning. The Roman lifestyle feels highly exaggerated and the directors seem to have read the 'excessive sex' part only.The movie also fails to have any dramatic element, unless sex is drama, which is very unlikely. Dialogues are asinine, and they make Caligula seem like a mad immoral teenager who doesn't think of anything but sex. In fact, there are reviews that praise the part where he is about to die and a senator tells that he would give up his life for Caligula instead; hearing which the emperor eagerly accepts his proposition. I feel that such scenes make the drama reductive rather than ingenious; the only part that slightly impressed me is the one that I mentioned in the first paragraph. Helen, Toole, Teresa and Gielgud only present shadows or rather fleshes of their characters, and keep their speech to the minimum. The rest do mere skin show, though I do admire their guts for doing it for such a big budget, mainstream film.While watching Caligula, my mind suddenly thought of Cleopatra, the movie that I had watched some time back. Both films depict fall of an emperor, two in the case of Cleopatra, and both are badly made. While Cleopatra is glossed up with extravagant costumes and over-the-top, affected performances, Caligula is replete with sex and very thin characters. In both I sensed an absence of human element and feelings that are required to hold the integrity of a film. Both the films required fictional aspects that were however built on reality, and better chemistry between the characters. But I would choose Cleopatra over Caligula solely because it stuck true to facts and tried not to rely on cheap tactics.In a word, Caligula can be described as: Scrotum.My Rating: 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of film King Ludwig of Bavaria would have made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really porno, not really an epic, not really a drama, Caligula is just a kind of Mulligan's Stew of a movie that exists in various messy versions, none satisfying. Gore Vidal's original intention was to make a more historically accurate and defiantly pagan Roman epic outside the studio system without the restrictions of a PG rating. Malcolm McDowell wanted to play Caligula as an anarchist destroying Rome from within rather than just another madman ? a potentially intriguing interpretation - but pointedly didn't want to do any gay scenes despite playing a bisexual. The producer was more interested in the box-office potential of an X-rated epic. It was never going to end happily for anyone...It's not exactly historically accurate, but then with Caligula - actually one of the most popular Caesars with the public in his lifetime - running a close second to Nero as cinema's favorite mad emperor and most surviving accounts of his reign highly partisan, that's perhaps not too surprising. It does have a car-crash fascination, though, and you can see the film it once wanted to be from time to time, as well as why it went so wrong. You'll have McDowell, Peter O'Toole (made up like a lecherous Albert Steptoe ogling his 'little fishes') and John Gielgud speaking elegant Gore Vidal dialogue while extras beat off in the background, often in shots taken from completely different parts of the movie. It's shot on huge stages that are part Las Vegas (you almost expect Siegfried and Roy to turn up doing the floor show), part grand opera, with proscenium arch staging to match. Part Fellini-wannabe, part Visconti-wannabe, the over-riding impression at times is that it's the kind of film King Ludwig of Bavaria would have made.Despite all the excess the $17.5m budget could buy back in 1976 and the odd grand image like a giant mourning cloth slowly floating down on the whipped and cowering senators, it's not exactly a grand spectacle ? the film rarely leaves the Palace, though there is one vivid street scene where play actors depict the Roman class system as a human pyramid with the people sandwiched between the army and the slaves at the bottom and Caligula angrily trying to bring the whole edifice crashing down. As the film progresses, he becomes more dedicated to chaos, reducing the senate to baaing like sheep after they make him a god, using their wives as whores, all the while thinking they are mad for approving everything he does. "I don't know what else to do to provoke them," he laments at one point. Yet the film never seems to have an especially clear idea of what it wants to do or where it's going, the several years it spent in the editing room and the uncredited rewrites during the nightmarish shoot all too apparent as it lurches along like a slightly distracted drunk caught somewhere between having drunk too much but still not quite enough.The 'best' version available is described on the DVD special edition as a 'pre-release version,' an attempt to reconstruct something similar to Tinto Brass' original intentions that puts scenes back in their proper chronological order and drops some of the more gratuitous sexual footage. The worst is a peculiar 102-minute R-rated cut from 1999 that isn't so much edited as hacked ruthlessly as if someone took it upon themselves to whip the uppity film into submission once and for all. It's not just the jarring and clumsy removal of most of the violence and the softcore as well as hardcore sex, it's the sheer nonsensical nature of the editing that strikes you. Cutting far more than the censors required - nearly an entire hour - it loses many of the film's most memorable and important moments (the humiliation of the newlywed couple, the fever that causes Caligula to believe himself a god and causes his sister's death), leaving the remnants often laughably bizarre nonsequiters or just plain confusing.The US DVD contains 48 minutes of deleted unassembled raw footage, but more interesting is the 31 minutes of deleted material taken from worn work prints only on the UK DVD, including an additional 11 scenes in rough cut form, most of them cut from the latter section of the film after Drusilla's death that would have given the film a wider view of Caligula's reign and do show the much more ambitious but no more successful picture intended ? much of the film's last third hit the cutting room floor on all versions, as did much of Helen Mirren's role. Unfortunately many of them simply aren't very good or don't quite work, such as Caligula avoiding raising taxes by theatrically setting himself above Jupiter and liberating the god's treasury (a scene not helped by awkward sped-up moments), Caligula replacing the heads of statues of the gods with his own and rehearsing the camp march he makes the legionaries do at the imperial brothel. McDowell's interest in making the character more of an anarchist comes over in a scene where he playfully plans famines and sea battles to liven things up while nimbly walking over desktops, makes his horse a senator to undermine the ruling class and appeal to the people and a lengthy bedroom scene with Helen Mirren about the dangers of goading and humiliating the senate. Without them, there's less of a sense of his continual emasculation of the old ruling class by piling on outrage after outrage building up to the point where his assassination becomes inevitable. There's also striking footage of his horse being chased by slaves as he dies twitching in the film's final scene, as well as the conclusion of the 'Death Machine' sequence where he has his guards throw Proculus into its path only for him to survive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The early screenplay written by Gore Vidal was intended as a unique lavish big-budget epic based on the history of the controversial reign of Gaius Germanicus Caligula. By the time directors Bob Guccione of Penthouse magazine fame and Tinto Brass contributed to the project, CALIGULA became an over-the-top porn/gore extravaganza. Vidal has been said to no longer lay claim to the picture. A star-studded cast may have given the movie some needed credibility. The acting is rather good. Of course the best being Malcolm McDowell as sex-driven Caligula and Peter O'Toole as the dying Tiberius. Graphic and shocking as it may be, this movie should not me mistaken for even the least bit of history to found on a trip to a good library.

		<fullReview>'Caligula' is a strange film, first extended with soft-porn scenes, and then reduced again to a 'normal' film, it still managed to remain a mess which didn't really have any focus or know where it was going.Malcolm McDowell is an interesting choice for the lead. Building on his performance in the earlier 'A Clockwork Orange', he invests the character of Caligula with wit, sarcasm, and psychosis. His portrayal is pure evil. In support are such luminaries as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who are both memorable.But the story meanders around, and other than a few pieces which remain in the mind - the prisoners and the cutting machine being one (I think I've remembered that correctly), it doesn't really go anywhere and leaves a bit of a nasty taste in the mouth.Worth watching once, but even that is a bit of a chore. Not deserving of all the fuss that's been heaped upon it in the most recent DVD edition.</fullReview>

One could have left them out, but they don't diminish the overall quality of the movie in my opinion. After all Caligula has been portrayed in history as a sexual pervert and a madman and the view on sexuality was a totally different one in ancient Greece or Rome.

		<shortDescription>Must have something.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many movies with a rating of 4.7, from nearly 30 years ago, have such robust commentary and message boarding? Right there the movie's got something very few, if any, movies have.I saw it (the uncut version) for the first time last night, and it's not that bad. Of course Guccione did some mangling of the continuity, but really, who watches it for continuity? And I'm not just talking about the nasty bits, it's just surreal all around. Now setting aside debates of just how promiscuous ancient Rome would have been, it certainly captures realistically how it would have been if those who decry the times as decadent were right. IF there were huge orgies taking place, wouldn't they looked mostly like it was portrayed in the film? Granted it was staged, and true reality likely would have had much more awkwardness and less grace in the execution, it stands that various thrustings and what not would have been the order of the day.I have not seen any of the commentary included with the disks, so perhaps some of the conjectures I have are answered, but one has to wonder if those who ultimately distanced themselves from the film felt that they had to in order to stay respectable (and employable). One also would like to know if Guccione was simply trying to be a peddler of his wares or was he REALLY trying to make an artistic statement and wasn't going to let "the suits" detract him from his goal. Who could really know, even with commentary. Did Guccione ruin an artistic creation to make it high class porn, or did he really have a unique vision and dared to do what no one else would dare? Regardless, the output it singular, and that in itself goes a long way toward making art Art.IF Rome was like this and not just some revisionists puritan views of the time as a cautionary tale for their modern era, this is how I imagine it looked and sounded. It's like you are there, and if groups of people were getting busy, this is how you'd expect it to look. As someone else commented, it was much more realistic than what safely filmed "depravity" looked like in films up to that point.Also, one would need to put the movie in a modern context too. The movie came out well before the internet became fixed in most people's lives. One can surf the net and pretty much see whatever they want in a minute's time (to a point where it quickly becomes dull). The hardcore elements of the movie are therefore much less shocking to modern sensibilities. Softcore sexuality permeates the airwaves every day. Anything hardcore is available at the snap of the fingers on the internet. Seeing such scenes in a modern, and the relatively near future, seem almost TAME and have more artistic merit than the average smut out on the internet. I can see a time in the not too distant future, as the younger set become the middle age set, and barriers fall, that the uncut version will be broadcasted. People are simply becoming much less inhibited and the paradigms will shift enough where the uncut version will not be seen as horrific.In the end, I can see that many of the name people involved had some rarefied sensibility about what the movie should be. Meanwhile Guccione made an earthier epic that sucks the viewer in (no pun intended) versus previous Historical Epics that have great costumes and blowing horns and big sets and clattering horses etc etc, that are staged and bereft realism of any kind. This was a unique experience without a doubt. The viewer had a human's eye view of antiquity versus the bird's eye view common to most movies.I gave it a 5 simply so as not to skew the existing rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be real frank and come out and say that this movie is very, very hard to watch. It is certainly one of the more "disturbing" (I hate to use that term as it get thrown around lightly around here) films out there as it depicts rape and incest. However the movie, in the end, just is not very good.The story follows the emperor Caligula from his beginnings to his rise to power and then his fall from grace. That's where the easy part ends, nothing else about this movie is clear. The legends behind it are very well known, from Peter O'tool's proclamation that he "did not know there were hardcore sex scenes being filmed" despite the fact that he is in said scenes or that the director has disowned the film, nothing about this film lends itself to logic. Scenes are out of order, ideas are half worked out, characters under/over used without reason, dialog that makes no sense or has no context, just real rubbish. If you want an example of poor editing that resembles this movie go watch Vampires vs Zombies.However for all its faults this movie does have some things going for it. Caligula is an obviously interesting character that deserves to be explored in a film. His position of power, how he arrived there, his relationship with his sister, and his eventual death could make for a great movie. Even the sex is not in any way arousing, but rather it fits to the tale of a society gone wrong. Morals and virtue have been thrown out the window in favor of decadence and violence. The fact that Penthouse funded this film should not cause one to think that it is in any way porn.If all of this had come together with editing that had made sense then it could have been a decent film. But instead the powers to be flinched and abandoned this film causing it to be released as a shell of what it could have been. Watch it, there is some merit to it, but don't expect a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, to me, seemed like a wasted opportunity. Sure, Malcolm McDowell does fine, as does Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole(especially), and John Gielgud, but the film feels unfinished and unpolished. It almost feels like two films. On one hand, it's a film about the rise and fall of the Roman leader Caligula and all the decadence and debauchery he took part in and how decadent and sleazy Rome was back then, but then at other times it feels like an artistic porno film. Neither parts work. The actual biopic segments of the film feel hollow and dumbed down. The scenes lack a general confidence in the screenplay and focus in the plot. There are numerous scenes where there's just a bunch of stuff happening, but there's never any reason to care about anything that's going on. The pornographic sex scenes, both simulated and unsimulated, lack eroticism. They don't have the appeal of pornography, nor do they have any purpose. The audience doesn't feel any sort of genuine human pleasure. It all feels completely forced and unnatural, almost in a rushed manner. It's just people performing sex acts, no more no less. This is no a good film in the slightest. It is obvious that this end result was not what was intended to be shown. The behind the scenes details are far more fascinating than the end result of a film. Basically, the film started out as a screenplay by acclaimed writer Gore Vidal. Originally it was set to be directed by Paul Morrissey. The film was set to be produced by Penthouse promoter Bob Guccione, keeping in mind that it could have been like another Roman Polanski's MACBETH, which was funded by PLAYBOY. The director was soon replaced by Tinto Brass shortly afterward. Eventually Tinto Brass, along with actor Malcolm McDowell, decided for the film to be a satire rather than a reflection of the Roman empire, so Gore Vidal left and tried to get his name taken off of it. Soon after, things fell apart. Guccione brought in a bunch of PENTHOUSE women and the filming and funding for the film basically fell apart. Once the filming was finished, Tinto Brass was editing while feuding with Guccione about the way the film could be presented to the audience. Guccione went back into the editing room and tossed Tinto Brass's editing equipment into the snow and proceeded to edit the film himself, even going so far as to film pornographic scenes for the film and inserting a bunch of hardcore porno footage into the film. Once this was discovered, the film was handed over to someone else to edit. The new editor, Nino Baragli, was a huge fan of the original Gore Vidal screenplay and was hellbent on editing the film more in the style of that screenplay, therefore removing as much comedy as he could, re-dubbing new dialogue, reinserting B-roll footage, and emphasizing the later scenes in which the character of Caligula goes insane. As a result, we now have been graced by CALIGULA, directed by Tinto Brass and presented by PENTHOUSE. Nobody during the making of the film was making the same film, and it shows. The film is over two hours and thirty minutes, but a lot of those minutes are ruined by pointlessness. As a result, the film is severely disjointed and fragmented. At times it's really quite boring. There is no sense of historical understanding or attention to detail. The film is poorly lit, poorly dubbed, and the music feels so cheap and so recycled at times, as if it came from other lesser sources. The film just feels like it costs so much less than it actually did. With an approximate budget of $17,500,000, it's obvious that it was money that wasn't well spent. It doesn't work as a film or a porno. Yet, there are moments of pure brilliance. There's a wonderful scene in which a character cuts his wrists and proceeds to bleed to death, with another character running to him and asking him how it feels to be dying and what the experience is like. There's a beautifully vicious scene in which the Caligula character goes to a wedding and rapes the bride and anally fists the groom. There are some fantastic sequences with Peter O' Toole, who plays one of the most disgusting villains I have ever laid my eyes on. Overall, it's a bad movie. So what are we left with? Well, we are left with nothing more than a campy guilty pleasure piece. At times, this film is so outrageous and unbelievably over-the-top that it's actually worth seeing in a way. While I can't recommend this film, I will give it five out of ten stars for the effort and for the many scenes that work. It's a guilty pleasure film, much like SHOWGIRLS, and it should be taken as so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like porn and I like art movies and I like history, but unfortunately this movie is really none of those things...its got perverted sex, elaborate sets &amp; has an historical topic, but frankly it is the worst of all worlds. No wonder why some of the stars tried to get their names removed from it! Its boring and a waste of time. One would do better to watch the history channel, rent a porn movie and see something on Turner Classic Movies rather than buy this worthless film. I do believe the makers of this movie believed they were making great art and that the acting was great and that's what makes this movie unbearable because it does take itself seriously and miserably fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not as bad as people say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this film and reading some of the comments, it's clear the so-called intellectuals have been offended.Caligula takes several liberties with historical facts, which is well known. The funny thing is it takes fewer liberties than most historically-based films these days, but no one seems to have a problem with those films. How about Pocahontas? None of the actors turn in exceptional performances but they aren't terrible, although Peter O'Toole is the standout of the bunch and Malcolm McDowell isn't doing any worse than he did with Clockwork Orange. Even at their "worst" these actors turn in acceptable performances. Yet this film is always considered to have horrific acting. None of the technical aspects of the film are especially noteworthy, either, except when you consider the sets and costumes are particularly good for an adult film. Again, they aren't particularly bad either but they get an awful rap.For good old shock and awe, Caligula definately delivers over and above pornography. Why can't the intellectuals just be honest and say they don't like pornography instead of overscrutinizing technical aspects of the film in an attempt to disparage it? This film is genuinely disturbing but its appeal is that there is nothing else out there quite like it. There's tons of sex but for the most part the only lingering or close shots are of oral sex. If you know anything of the history of this film you know that the sex was shot seperately, however, the editing of it into the film could have been a lot worse and for the most part is seemless.As a curiosity and a shocker, Caligula delivers the goods. If you don't take it too seriously it's a fun film. If you think that pornography and "film" are too distinctly seperate things that should never, ever overlap, you should pass on this one.Oh, and there are a lot of very good looking naked women in this film. Did I forget to mention that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care what the other person said about it being a really good movie once you get past the gore. Its not even really that gory. But it is most definitely porn. I know that he was supposed to be nuts and that all the sex was supposed to be part of that, but unlike most movies it went above and beyond showing this point. I'm not a prude by any means, but trying to watch a supposedly good movie is a little hard when there are 15 minute sex scenes. I'm not talking about the sex scenes that are in most movies, I mean stuff you'd actually see in porn. Like close up shots of oral sex that leaves nothing and I mean nothing to the imagination and well close up shots of everything you could possibly imagine. Now I know that this is part of his madness, like where he made all the senators wives part of his brothel, but to get this point across you really don't need to show the sex scenes for 15, 20 or more minutes. So I rate this move as just porn, not a misunderstood classic. I don't care if it is to prove a point, its just ridiculous and then redundant after 20 minutes. So if you like porn, it is a pretty good show, lol, lots of variety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me Malcolm McDowell is an ingenious, massively gifted, devoted and spectacular actor but he has unfortunately wasted his incredible talents in dozens of awful b-movies. Stanley Kubrick's praised classic "A Clockwork orange" is the another one of McDowell's larger than life performances. Other one is naturally "Caligula". It starts with a verse from the bible. Mark 8:36 says "What shall it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul." What a great opening words to this movie! If you want to see the whole accurate, sinful truth about so-called "pagan Rome" you can forget "Ben Hur" and "Quo Vadis?" and go for "Caligula".McDowell is phenomenal as the insane emperor and the other actors like for example Peter O'Toole as Tiberius, Guido Mannari as Macro and Bruno Brive in his only movie role as Gemellus are brilliant. This startling film is so nauseous that watching it really makes me sick to my stomach but in the same time something makes this feast of filth irresistible. Truth isn't always pretty and I guess we're going to have to live with that. Uncensored version of "Caligula" is shocking, ultra-violent, indecent, appalling, perverse, upsetting, outrageous, shattering and obscene experience and definitely one of the most impressive movies I've ever dared to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not beneath contempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching approximately three-fifths of this film I switched it off and thought, "Its beneath contempt". Upon reflection I see I was wrong - its eminently worthy of contempt, if only to inform would-be viewers. I should point out that I can't help but compare it with the superb "I, Claudius" TV series and, also, I tend to see things in black or white, so if you want an objective review of this film you are advised to go elsewhere please.Well I don't quite know where to...this movie is historically inaccurate for starters, which wouldn't be so bad if the dramatisation wasn't so poor. The script is woeful. No wonder Gore Vidal dropped it like a rather molten kartoffel. The storyline is difficult to follow; if I weren't already fairly well acquainted with the events portrayed I'd be left with the impression that ancient Rome was to be viewed (on cut-rate pyschadelics) as some sort of palacial brothel peopled by thespians with pretensions to meglomania, fawned upon by a wearying succession of mincing yet determined dung-beetles and, surprisingly (well) fed, harlots. Well it was at times I guess but surely never with such a crude...limpness.The acting is hammy in the worst sense as if somehow it were being earnestly, even courageously, performed by a mental asylum's (oh so) amateur players. Caligula in particular, butchered by Malcolm MacDowell, flits about like a seasoned ponce presenting a tense spasticism where gravitas would be more appropriate and an impish schoolgirl facade in favour of genuine levity. John Hurt's portrayal (in I, Claudius) shows what a well-directed genius can do with such a character. Alas its no wonder the late lamented Sir(?)John Guilgud expressed a keen regret in having an, albeit truncated, association with this movie.I s'pose for forms sake I should mention the 'notorious' sex scenes. Well got that out of the way...At the end of the proverbial this movies' one success can be drawn from its similarity to its subject - all that wealth and talent in the hands of a select few...gormless shagnasties. At least you don't have to wait five centuries for the Huns to hove into view, just sack it with the remote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad, even the porn wasn't good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Caligula" is simply not a good movie. In fact, it's a really bad movie, and that's the God's honest truth. If it weren't for the pornography, this piece of garbage would have been long forgotten. As with most bad movies, the problems start with the writing. The dialogue is corny, the history is poorly told and the transitions from scene to scene feel disjointed and out of place (for the record, I saw the complete and unedited version). The direction, set design and cinematography are also horrendous. The cameraman seemed capable of only two views: close, and far. There was no movement to the camera, as if it were firmly planted on the set. Speaking of the sets, they were also pretty nasty and poorly done. Instead of conveying a period feel, they screamed "we just threw this together in a few minutes". The lighting didn't help much, either; it was either way to bright, way to dark or way to red. Then there were the costumes (or lack thereof). The Romans did not wear black togas with gold trim; they wore white togas with purple trim. And there were a few moments where we really didn't need to see nude bodies. The best example is in the beginning of the movie, where naked slaves are engaged in some kind of road project. Slaves may not have lived well, but they at least had a tunic or a loincloth. Finally, the porn scenes. I'll admit, I was shocked the first time I saw masturbating men and women, group orgies and couples engaged in various acts of intercourse, but I suppose that the intent was to get some shock value, and compared to what's out there this was relatively tame. Nevertheless, the sex added nothing to the movie, and wasn't exciting or stimulating. It felt as though it were thrown in simply as a gimmick, a way of attracting movie goers with the allure of a large scale porn movie. In conclusion, if you're looking for exciting Roman history, or pornography, or a combination of the two, don't look to "Caligula". For Roman history, see "Spartacus" or the upcoming "Gladiator". If you want porn, type "Pamela Lee and Tommy" into your search engine, or visit an adult video store. But whatever you do, stay away from "Caligula"; the movie, in more ways than one, sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's better to read Caligula's biography in Wikipedia. He wasn't evil in his first years of reign. He was wise and people loved him. But after some time he became insane and he did some unrighteous deeds. But this movie is too exaggerative. Excessive insist on sex (which most of them were not based on truth) harmed the drama and lowered it to a B-movie, in spite of famous actors. For me, it was a waste of time. I don't recommend it to anyone. But be careful! The sex scenes are really done and explicitly shown. Porn offenders must not watch this. Instead they can watch the R-rated 90-min version and you miss nothing, because sexual scenes have nothing to do with the main plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A $17.5 million dollar abomination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this is what the Burt Reynolds character from Boogie Nights had in mind when he wanted to make a large scale porno film with real actors and an actual plot. Bob Guccione's Caligula might have been something truly memorable and noteworthy, but it ends up being nothing more than simply "notorius". It isn't just the eye-opening hard core sex and violence that mars this film. The film is hurt every bit as much by the terrible editing, lack of cohesive plot, and the general ugliness of its tone. The film is still viewed regularly, and has more than made a profit. Mostly because of the curiosity factor. Once the viewer gets used to the copious amounts of gratuitous nudity, torture, and explicit sex, they quickly notice that there isn't much else to this project.A very entertaining project could certainly be made about the pagan ruler Caligula of early A.D. Rome. And Malcolm McDowell is certainly a great choice for the title role. As Caligula, McDowell basically gets to extend his lusty fantasy he has mid way through A Clockwork Orange. Imagine Alex from that film as emperor of the known world, and that's the perspective this film takes. There really isn't much of a linear story here. Gore Vidal wrote the original script but who knows how much of the finished product is his idea. Likely not much since he would later disown the film. Director Tinto Brass did likewise after producer Guccione insisted on editing the film himself. He is apparently the one to blame for all the incessant zooming in and out throughout the film. It seems like they rarely even knew the right perspective in which to shoot most of these scenes. The post dubbing of voices is all too apparent, and the running length is ultimately just too long. Some of the sets look impressive, and it must be noted that the acting is often very convincing. There are some big named actors here like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole that should be ashamed for appearing in this. McDowell has always been a daring performer who brings such effort to his character that he can be forgiven. Incredibly, Bob Guccione was originally trying to get John Huston and Jack Nicholson. At least they had the good sense to pass.Overall, it was the mean and cynical tone of the film that put me off the most. The technical problems were also too much to overlook. Another problem was the lack of historical perspective. The film never really defines Caligula, or the times in which he ruled. And there really aren't enough actual porn scenes to satisfy the horny voyeur who might only be looking to get off. The film is pretty much a failure at every level. It made Guccione a good chunk of change, though. 2 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut and uncut versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is available in the UK ? often in bargain bins ? a heavily cut version, though still rated 18, coming in at just under 100 minutes, losing an hour from the "cinema release" listed here at 156.That cut version I saw years ago on British television (where it may have had further seconds shaved off). But now, with the wonders of international mail order and multi-region DVD players, I've seen it uncut. How does it compare? First reaction; astonishment that they rescued 98 minutes of material both broadcast-able yet retaining some narrative coherence. The sex and nudity is so pervasive. Even where characters are explaining critical plot developments ? as with the young Caligula's talk with Tiberius ? there's things going on behind them. And though the sex generally has some point, some of the nudity is hilariously irrelevant. Where increasingly deranged Caligula launches a play-acting invasion on an imaginary Britain, the attacking troops are bafflingly nude (and splendid chaps they all seem to be too, hundreds of them). Earlier in the film, as Caligula makes his way to his audience with Tiberius, we pass a road-mending gang also in the nude. Why? This isn't a matter of prudery, just prudence. I know the Roman Empire was more casual than we are nowadays about health and safety in the workplace, but with all those pickaxes and shards of rock flying around, a little bit of elementary protection for a worker's dangly bits would have been just commonsense.What about the sex? I don't watch porn films as such, but I've got access to the internet and I've seen modern films like Empire of the Senses, Nine Songs, and Baise-moi. I was all ready to adopt a bored indifference. But by the end, I have to admit I was a bit shaken. There's just so much of it, both relentlessly through the film, and simultaneously. It's that last point more than anything that counts. Alright, you can tell I've never been invited to an orgy. But while no single act portrayed represents anything that hasn't been seen on screen before, I wasn't expecting quite so much of it, all in the same room and at the same time. I can't pretend I wasn't impressed.But what was the point of it? Some people here compare it to Pasolini's Salo, and I think that's instructive. I'm not sure Salo is a good film, but its moral and political purpose is clear, which is to chart the corruption of fascism. It achieves its effects by a gradual escalation of depravity reaching a shattering conclusion. Whether successful or not, it certainly disturbs and haunts the imagination. The defence of Caligula, presumably, works similarly; it is a portrayal of decadence and corruption and the political forms accompanying it. But if so, it simply doesn't work; for two reasons, I think.Firstly (a fault it shares with Salo) it is too hermetic, and doesn't explain enough about the social and political background against which this depravity takes place. Secondly, it is just too relentless. For example, towards the end, we see Caligula deliberately insulting and humiliating the senators by prostituting their wives in a specially built state brothel, which is a key event in crystallising the coup against Caligula. But the outrage is unconvincing. The wives themselves don't seem to mind, approaching their duties, largely oral on this occasion, with no more nor less enthusiasm than anything else they've done. "Oh, come on", the viewer protests, "you're all at it all the time anyway; how does this make it any worse?". And sure enough, the senators on hand seem merely peeved rather than outraged.The film fails too as a personal portrayal of the corruption of Caligula. Here Caligula is corrupt from the outset, despised and suspected by the honourable Nerva, and admiringly described by the dying Tiberius as a "viper nurtured in the bosom of Rome". There is no sense of any process of undermining early ideals or even innocence; his behaviour just gradually gets even more and more transgressive. It isn't helped by a performance by Malcolm McDowell (who I've frequently admired elsewhere) that seems to come straight from "Carry On Caligula". His humiliation of Proculus and his bride-to-be ought to be seriously disturbing, but instead just comes on like a pantomime villain.Is the film a spectacle (other than as an orgy)? Allegedly it cost some $15 million dollars but one can only imagine that most of that was spent on persuading enormous numbers of extras to "do it" on camera. The sets are astonishingly stage-bound, many scenes opening with the same establishing shot with a flat ornate backdrop (niches, marble panels etc.) and the furniture and props laid out left-to-right in front of it. You can almost see the imaginary proscenium arch framing it. Most of the film takes place indoors, yet there is no sense of space or layout in the buildings involved; just a succession of stage sets. When the characters started to enter and leave rooms by ducking behind curtains, I laughed out loud, as I was simply reminded of an Ed Wood spaceship. The outdoor shots fail to open the film out in any way either. The arena of the grisly beheading machine is particularly claustrophobic, bound by the same four-square geometry that ties so many other scenes to the strict dimensions of the screen.Am I glad I saw the full length version? Yes, but then I'm always interested in seeing the extremes of film-making. Is this film successful? No; a monstrous folly. Is it porn? Of course; just because it represents a failed genre ? attempting to import porn into mainstream cinema ? doesn't mean it isn't porn. Good porn? You'll have to ask the man in the dirty mac; I'd guess only intermittently.But it deserves a few stars just for the sheer bravado of its folly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened? It had so much promise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligula is an example of a film that was trying to go in too many different directions and ended up tearing itself apart. Anyone who looks at it on paper should realize that it does have some very strong points. The basic story was written by Gore Vidal. The cast is superb (Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren, just to name a few). The scenery, sets, and costumes are excellent and may be as close to authentic as one will find. However, this film fails because it had too many clashing personalities working on it behind the scenes. Gore Vidal left because he didn't like the way Tinto Brass (director) was going with the script. Brass left because he was not allowed to edit the film. O'Toole and Gielgud were unaware that hardcore sex was going to be in the film (otherwise they wouldn't have done it) and McDowell has since commented on what a mess it is. It seems that producer Bob Guccione was more concerned with filming hardcore sex scenes to show the debauchery of ancient Rome than with making an accurate or entertaining film.The plot is basically that of the life of Emperor Gaius Julius Caeser Augustus Germanicus (Caligula was his nickname). It starts at the end of the reign of Tiberius, who ended up giving Caligula half of his estate to be shared with Tiberius' grandson Gemellus. Caligula either goes power mad, or actually insane, history isn't quite sure which, and begins behaving in very bizarre ways. Caligula slept with his sister Drusilla, married a prostitute, had numerous senators executed for questionable reasons, declared himself a god, and had his army pick up sea shells as spoils of war.Most of Caligula's "legacy" is conveyed in the film, but the film itself seems to be more of an excuse to make a high class porn film than an actual study into the life of the emperor. In addition, the film makers made some large historical errors.First, they have everyone calling him Caligula. Caligula hated his nickname and was not afraid to get rid of anyone who he didn't like, so anyone calling him this to his face probably would have been executed.Second, they have some kind of large machine that looks like a house but moves slowly to decapitate its victims. There's no evidence anywhere in history that such a machine was developed in ancient Rome.Third, Praetorain Cassius Chaerea did strike the first blow in the assassination of Caligula. However, it was not done in the palace but rather a tunnel leading from the stadium where he was watching gladiatorial games. Chaerea also had several accomplices who were of the senatorial class, and the assassins fled shortly there after because Caligula's guards were going to either kill or arrest them for the slaying. Similarly, Chaerea took no part in the crowning of Claudius as emperor, Chaerea wanted to kill him.These are just a few errors, I'm sure I could find more if I sat down and watched the film again. I really have no urge to because it is a mess. This film could have been great, but it ended up being extremely disappointing.If you want to learn about the early Roman emperors watch "I, Claudius." If you want to see hardcore sex, rent a porn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen "Caligula" in my life until the "Director's Cut" version was first broadcast six years ago on Channel 4. I found the film strangely compelling. I was immediately taken in by the highly atmospheric settings and production design, plus the highly emotive classical soundtrack.In all fairness to "Caligula", it is nothing like the disgusting great steaming pile of garbage that its detractors have made it out to be. True, it is by no means whatsoever a perfect film, but what most people fail to realise is that the writer and the director of "Caligula" had originally set out to make an allegorical story about life in the corridors of power in Ancient Rome, as opposed to a hard-core pornographic peepshow, The visceral scenes of violence are alarmingly compelling. The sheer savagery of the dark underbelly of Roman life is vividly, and quite accurately captured (though not quite historically accurate).Malcolm McDowell gives his all and all as the deranged Roman emperor, Caligula. He could certainly give Charlton Heston and Victor Mature a run for their money.Give me "Caligula" over all the stuffy, over-earnest 50's/60's "sword-and-sandal" epics any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his review of Caligula, Roger Ebert called it sickening, utterly worthless and shameful trash. His review hit the nail right on the head. That's what this movie is. What's even worse is that talented actors such as Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren allowed themselves to participate in it.The sets look as if they were lifted out of a really bad sci-fi film. Also, the costumes are poorly designed and we are forced to look at some very freaky-looking people (a three-faced woman) and devices (a decapitation machine). The movie degrades women so much that you'd think that Larry Flynt, not Bob Guccione, helped produce it, given that Larry's magazine, Hustler, prides itself on being the most woman-degrading porno magazine in the world.I bought the R-rated version, which has much of the hardcore sex and violence edited out, but there's still enough flesh and gore to make this version more worthy of an NC-17 rating.After watching this once, I have decided to throw it in the trash.If you really want to see a movie about the decadence of ancient Rome, rent Spartacus (1960) or Julius Caesar (1953) instead.Rating: BOMB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst movie I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...But far from being any good nonetheless. Despite being basically a big-budget porno, this film actually had a lot of potential. Great cast, beautifully elaborate sets, and a Gore Vidal screenplay are the parts of the movie that could have made it a classic historical epic. Instead we get piss-poor directing and cinematography, and Bob Guccione adding mucho gratuitous sex and nudity. Not that I have any problem with sex, but if I want porn, I'll watch porn. Malcolm McDowell gives a good, not great, performance, and this is basically the only highlight of the movie. Maybe the R-rated version is better in terms of conciseness and flow, but even the removal of all the hardcore scenes (which add nothing of value, but then again that was the whole point wasn't it?) still only makes this a below average movie. As it is, the film gets a 3.5/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is based on the pan and scan R rated version of Caligula, but I can't imagine seeing the film in its original aspect ratio would make the slightest bit of difference. With the credits letterboxed at what looks to be 1.85:1 at best, it's hard to imagine another film photographed as poorly as Caligula. Even with the image only slightly compressed whole scenes focus on billowing curtains, people in the background, or action that is entirely unimportant to the advancement of the plot. Major characters speak off camera, and the camera doesn't seem to care. Extreme closeups are the order of the day, alternating with the cinematographer's one trick--zoom in, zoom out--to create an unsatisfying viewing experience. Considering the apparent opulence of the sets, and the obvious large investment in same, it is maddening to see such inept photography. I'll seek out the uncut fullscreen version for comparison's sake, but technically Caligula is a disaster.The cast, especially Peter O'Toole is fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's more good drama behind the scenes of CALIGULA than there is on screen. Bob Guccione should have stayed in the background as Executive Producer and let the professional filmmakers and editors do their jobs. He couldn't do that and the end result is a confusing hodge-podge of drama, horror, attempted humor, and well-shot but totally unnecessary pornography.The real story of Caligula is fascinating. He was an inept leader who set new standards of depravity and madness that shocked even the bloodthirsty and jaded Romans. He was probably insane and yet he ruled a mighty empire, if only for a few years. If you want more than a picture of his depravity and mental instability you will have to look elsewhere. May I suggest the very excellent "I, Claudius" as a good place to start?If you want history or good drama, look elsewhere. If you want good porn, you won't find it here, either. CALIGULA really has no reason for existence other than as a vanity piece for Bob Guccione. As a film, it's not even as good as junk like "Dude, Where's My Car?".Were it not for the presence of some notable actors, all of whom have disavowed CALIGULA, this film would have scored a 1, and that would have been just a pity point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so I hear) or the R-rated version released into theaters? Both are terribly awful, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film (the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!), and I can see why. Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot.Not much of anything here, other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: "It was like one moment I'd be staring, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it."How true.What an awful movie.1/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was made on the heels of BBC's "I Claudius" which featured the life and reign of the emperor Caligula. It is a historically rich and frightening tale. John Hurt's Caligula in "I Claudus" is among the most memorable performances on the screen.On it's own, this "Caligula" is not a bad film. Just because the horrors and excesses of the Caesars were obscene does not make them unfit subjects for cinema. But to me, the gratuitous sex poisons this film. Please note that I am NOT a prude AT ALL. I have not the tiniest complaint with porn. I consider "The Gangbang Girl #33" to be a superior film to "Caligula" because it is true to its purpose. Caligula tries to be historical epic and porn flick, and succeeds at neither.Consider the brothel scene. It is true that Caligula held a brothel in the palace. Film-making is the art of interpretation, imagery, and inflection. The BBC's version shows the brothel, with no explicit sex, and no diminution of the historical significance. Do we really need to see a woman performing oral sex on a man and see the man ejaculating to get the idea? While we're at it, why not show people actually being killed to demonstrate Caligula's capricious cruelty - a real decapitation, for example? Just as important as a real blow job, if you ask me.If you want Peter O'Toole in a historical epic, I recommend "The Lion In Winter." If you want stories of the Roman Empire, "I Claudius" and "Ben-Hur" stand out. If you want oral sex, try the "Down The Hatch" series. But not all genres are meant to mix in one film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie at my local video store and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard about the explicit sex scenes, gruesome violence, and the notorious debauchery. I sat and watched and I began laughing! The set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake; the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his serenely beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can't be taken seriously...it's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. The cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! The book of Mark no less. If you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for camp cult value, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was. I have seen shocking and this is two hours of your life you will never have back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Textbook Example of Bad Movie-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were far too many people involved in this movie, each one wanting something different. Every one of them failed due to lack of vision and storytelling. The finished product is just as warped as the man it is about, which is the only praise it deserves. There seems to be nothing going on other than sex, violence, and overacting. While this may be an accurate portrait of a time in the Roman Empire, it is purely by accident. Yes, there was a lot of sex and death in Rome, but to put that in a movie and expect everyone to lap it up was a delusion of grandeur. The problem is, when you remove the excessive sex and violence, you are left with very little. The editing is scattered, the sets and costumes cheap, and the big names are underperforming. MacDowell scowls with wide eyes and is generally what everyone thinks a madman should be. O'Toole borders on annoying with his "look at my mad contorted face" acting while Gielgud sleeps through his part. Helen Mirren is sufficiently nasty, as is MacDowell, but that is all we get from them. They were all mad, murderous, sex starved sadists. A point that you don't have to watch this 150 minute movie for more than ten minutes to get.P.S. It should be shown, along with a complete making of, to film students to show them that even professionals take dumps.</fullReview>

In "Caligula" she flawlessly betrayed Drusilla as the rock behind the insanity of Caligula's rule and when she was no longer in the film it was an obvious loss for both the film and Caligula.

		<fullReview>Heard a lot about the film, and decided to see it after finding out Peter O'Toole and a few credible actors were in it. After watching this movie, I couldn't believe someone actually committed this screenplay to film. Storywise, let's just say it's Alex from "A Clockwork Orange" living out his life in Roman times. For those who haven't seen "Clockwork", basically a spoiled brat interested in perversities. Yes, a lot of the scenes are just plain gross and shocking, but not necessarily in a good way. If you consider Let's just say that half of the movie is a combo of a S&amp;M and porn director's movie with a colossal budget. This would have been a better movie if it explored Caligula's mind and at least tried to analyze why he performed the atrocities he did. Any person who has read or seen documentaries on Caligula could see that the director chose the most depraved acts and committed it to film, yet nothing is mentioned about his megalomaniac thoughts on being one of the gods and how this really lead to his subsequent demise. To think that actors of O'Toole's and McDowell's caliber actually appeared in this film is unthinkable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caligula is a paining watch to sit through. Not cause of it's sex and violence, which I'm truly grateful for, especially the head decapitation, and too the performances, which I loved, which never slacked (a young Mirren, a looker in her day) but mostly it's a straining bore of nothing happeningness or tediousness, long in the tooth sort of stuff. It feels as though we've watched it as if we were at a theatre show, the actors speaking out as if to an audience. Prince Caligula, played expertly by the versatile, Mcdowell, was a mythical evil figure, sort of like Macbeth, except here he was born evil, but the two have the same remorselessness. Steiner was wonderful, so was O toole, but it was all such a bore, as if there were all these dead moments, where the actors were just secretly conversing to us. Mcdowell was intriguing to watch, encompassing all the nasty attributes of this notorious and hated figure. To be brutally honest, I'd opt more for Querelle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a sense of sadness that I felt as I was watching this. Sadness, because Caligula is, in fact, a fascinating historical character (even if, in truth, there's not much known about him) about whom a truly good movie could be made, and sadness because producer Bob Guccione clearly went the extra mile and actually put together a pretty decent cast featuring the likes of a young Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, supported by a young Helen Mirren as his wife, and backed up by solid veteran actors Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud - all of whom, with talents pooled, could have done a pretty good job with a serious production. Ah - but the clear warning sign is that this movie was indeed produced by Bob Guccione, better known as the publisher of Penthouse Magazine. Guccione manages to take some snippets from history (admittedly not necessarily true, because much about Caligula is unknown, and much of what is "known" may well be legends and propaganda spread by his enemies) such as Caligula trying to make his horse a priest, and Caligula's supposedly incestuous relationship with his sister, up to and including Caligula's assassination but then he does little more than use the barebones historical record as a backdrop for what this was really about - a chance to give a degree of credibility to a movie that was about nudity and sex. I wouldn't call it porn - not even soft-core - because there was nothing particularly explicit depicted, but the nudity was everywhere. I'm sure this served as an opportunity to highlight a few "Penthouse Pets" of the era.I went into this with my eyes open. I knew it was produced by Guccione and Penthouse Films. I watched it out of curiosity mostly, and for a while it's interesting in a bizarre and even comedic sort of way. But I have to say that at a certain point - certainly by the halfway point, if not sooner - this literally became painful to watch. I suppose Guccione deserves some credit for the audacity involved in putting this out and assembling the cast he put together (although one wonders why well known actors such as Gielgud and O'Toole would be bothered with this) but audacity does not make a good movie. At least, it certainly didn't in this case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caligula was, without question, one of the single most insane emperors (along with Nero and Commodus) to have ever ruled the Roman Empire. This movie, at it's heart, intends to capture the full extent of his insanity and just how much debauchery, sexual deviancy, and all round nuttiness of his brief, yet notable reign.The good sides to this film that is it's setting, costume, and realism in a lot of situations. But on the down side, there ARE a lot of historic errors. For example, in some cases they show Caligula's insanity as it was, but in others they seem far off the mark. The real Caligula didn't start out a complete nutjob, and during the first two years of his reign, he was actually quite popular, having removed a lot of unpopular laws that were set up by Tiberius, and people described him as a noble and good ruler... but it was in the last two years (he only ruled four years total) is when all the crazy stuff started to happen in the film.For one thing, Macro was not executed by having his head chopped off in a dramatic manner (as cool as it looked), he committed suicide. Caligula's famous 'I wish all Rome had just one neck' quote resulted from when he got ticked off by the complaining of the people when he couldn't constantly outperform his performance at showing off chariot and gladiator games every single day, not a random thing he said after having a lot of people put to death. Also Caligula really did try to conquer Britain (though his successor was the one who fully pulled it off), and annexed Mauritania. The battle shown of him attacking a river to simulate an invasion of Britain was really simply an act of 'revenge' against Neptune (he once built a giant 'bridge' from Italy to Sicily that was made in faux city style with fake taverns and such, and it was destroyed by a hurricane, so Caligula swore revenge against Neptune). And finally, the password he spoke to Cassius Chaerea before being killed by him was not 'scrotum', some sources say it was 'old man's petticoat' or such. During his final days, Caligula gave stupid and humiliating words to be used as passwords such as 'kiss me soldier' and the like.I understand the intention of the filmmakers to really show off his insanity by exaggerating some of the issues involved. Overall, the film was not really that much of movie. It's no epic, and definitely not a documentary. The story really wasn't all too captivating, the characters aren't spectacularly done, and other than seeing the costumes, architecture, and other interesting and thought provoking sets and concepts being put up (not to mention the fact that they didn't hide the Roman's pro-homosexual/bisexual tendencies or even tone them down. Points for that!), this movie has no real redeeming factor other than seeing the depravity of some of Ancient Rome's most insane and whacked out emperors.</fullReview>

I guess that Mr. Vidal knew that even if they spell your name correct, there is still bad publicity. The movie starts with some promise. And if you enjoy the acting talents of Malcolm McDowell, then it is a good way to kill a few hours. McDowell does portray the insanity of Caligula quite well. As the movie progresses his acting talents are stronger as he shows the depravity that Caligula sank to. He does a great job in carrying the film. And his performance is as dark as ever.

		<shortDescription>Interesting if you like the Caligula story or dig depraved porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film a seven. How can I defend this, when any other comment will mention its tastelessness, depravity, etc.?Well, I defend it based purely on the fact that it's historically accurate. Some liberties are taken, but for the most part, this movie captures Caligula's story. However, this also means that Caligula's sadistic, bestial nature, and that of the Roman era as a whole, are also very disturbingly rendered.For those who don't know, Caius Caligula was one of the Caesars of Rome, its highest official. Caligula was widely believed to have ascended to the position by murdering the previous Caesar, his own uncle. Once in control, he went on a sad, cruel and twisted rule that saw mass beheadings, permissible sexual depravity, and flat out cruelty to even those close to the man himself. Caligula had an incestuous relationship with his own sister, had murdered his own friends and co-conspirators, and I believe he willed all his possessions to be given to his horse.So, Caligula the film stays true to the facts. That alone would make this a disturbing film. What compounds the issue is the fact that it was co-financed by Bob Guccione of Penthouse magazine, and as a result every effort to show lewd and tasteless behavior is taken. In the uncut version, you will see hundreds of completely nude men and women involved in sexual acts with each other, and with themselves. You'll see men on men, women on women. A slain man is urinated on by 2 women, onscreen. A man has his vital organ sliced off and fed to dogs (onscreen, but fake this time). There is suggested rape, item-oriented sexual assault, and things even more disturbing such as twitching, apparent mutants engaging in said behavior as well.Therein lies the problem. The line of genuine reproduction and smut for smut's sake was crossed, and crossed fast. There are actually only a handful of sex scenes in the movie (all of them very graphic and equal to any of today's pornos). But the bulk of the tasteless stuff is arbitrarily shown in between regular scenes. So, you don't just get a bunch of story followed by bizarre sex, but instead you watch as main characters discuss regular topics and are then disturbed when the camera randomly cuts to an image of extreme sexual behavior. Much of it is irrelevant, and that's where the intent of the film is blurred by its porno roots.Although I'm not a regular watcher, I've seen porn before. And if you are curious about this movie to see if it has any comparably sexy scenes, there is certainly stuff to catch your interest. But for th0e casual viewer, it's wise to stay away from this one because so much of it IS genuine porn, and much of the random cuts show stuff that are in the most specific of weird porn genres. That's a shame to me, because I was interested in the Caligula story and wanted to see a good rendition of it. I did get it, and I was also surprised to some very alluring imagery. But that was offput by all the random, disturbing stuff that I would have preferred not to see.The acting is fine, McDowell does an admirable job just being a nutcase throughout most of the film. The set design is great, as are the costumes. It's clear that a lot of money went into this, but it's hard to speak too highly of the end result.So why do I give the film a 7? Well, plainly put, it is what it says it is. It is Rome at its sleaziest, with its most depraved of operators at the helm. I didn't rent it expecting a porno, and was pleasantly surprised by some of what I saw. But then the rest of it, the overabundance of juxtaposed weird stuff, was off-putting and unwanted, and unfortunately does take up a significant chunk of screen time. My advice is to see it if you're curious to see just how much weird sexual stuff is in there, or to see an unashamedly graphic portrayal of the subject. Everyone else is urged to steer clear, because this is not a typical Hollywood docu-drama, and you'll be made uncomfortable if you're not prepared for what it contains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy sex-flick that shows how far we've come since '80.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absurd, campy fun. I found it very funny to watch actual movie stars trying to say their silly lines surrounded by dozens of nude extras (men &amp; women) miming bizarre sexual acts. An amazingly staged play filmed with very little sense of reality set in a time a long time ago. Not much story but an interesting time capsule if you're into that sort of thing. Worth a look just to see where the world was going sexually before the worldwide outbreak of aids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can Call It "Provocative"... "Controversial"... "Daring"...But Don't Forget That It's Just A Porno</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people and critics classify "Caligula" as a regular motion picture when it's nothing more than a big-budget porno flick. Just because it has famous actors such as Malcolm McDowell and Sir John Geilgud in it does not make it a genuine "motion picture". I saw the 156 minute version, not the R Rated 105 minute version because I wanted the full-effect of the film. I heard about it's notoriety and the controversy behind the film and that made me interested in seeing it. I was totally disappointed when I was finished watching it because I was not expecting to see a porno film. The 1995 film "Showgirls", which got an NC-17 rating by the MPAA, was a standard motion picture and not a big-budget porn flick as some have called it. This movie, on the other hand, is strictly pornography because some of the explicit sexual activities shown here are only seen in porno films. I'm not speaking out against the movie. I am not saying that "Caligula" shouldn't have been made or that it is sickening and shameless filth, I'm simply stating that it is a porno film and to have any sponsor or critic try to pass this film off as a standard motion picture is a phony publicity stunt to get you to go and see the movie yourself. If this is a standard motion picture, then "Caligula" is trash! Sickening and down-right filthy! But it's not, because it's not a regular movie. It's a porno movie, pure and simple. The first $15 million porno flick. That's all it is known for. And if anyone tries to tell you otherwise by saying things like "It's not just that, it's because of it's graphic violence and sex scenes", they're only fooling themselves. "Dawn Of The Dead" is a regular movie with graphic violence. " Eyes Wide Shut" is a regular movie with graphic sex scenes. "Caligula" is a porno movie with graphic violence thrown into it (the graphic sex is obvious). It's still a movie, but it's a "porno" movie. It's perfect for someone who likes to watch porno movies and doesn't mind explicit violence. But for anyone who's looking to watch a regular "movie", "Caligula" is not the movie for you. Just a warning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CALIGULA {Unrated Edition} (Tinto Brass, Giancarlo Lui and Bob Guccione, 1979) *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched this on late-night TV while on a visit to London in September 2002; it transpired to have not been the full-length version, since I don&#x2019;t recall the hardcore footage found here. Anyway, the film is still perhaps mainstream cinema&#x2019;s biggest folly: while Gore Vidal&#x2019;s original screenplay may have been interesting, the end result lumbers on for 2? hours for no particular reason except to wallow in its repellent excesses but proves to be extremely dull, even annoying, into the bargain! Despite some imposing credentials, it&#x2019;s little more than an extended home movie from the people at &#x201c;Penthouse&#x201d; magazine: director Brass was only credited with &#x201c;Principal Photography&#x201d; since he objected to Lui and Guccione&#x2019;s &#x201c;additional footage&#x201d; &#x2013; which, apparently, boils down to little more than six minutes of no-holds-barred hardcore stuff! Danilo Donati (famed for his equally garish and overblown collaborations with Federico Fellini) serves as art director/costume designer &#x2013; the film itself recalls the vilified later work of Pier Paolo Pasolini (with editing by Nino Baragli, no less) and, of course, anticipates the recent controversy caused by the ultra-realistic ROME TV series. The music, at least, includes judicious excerpts from the classical work of Aram Khachaturyan and Sergei Prokofiev; incidentally, according to the IMDb, the Paul Clemente listed as the film&#x2019;s composer is a pseudonym for Bruno Nicolai&#x2026;which is a quite fitting credit, given that he often worked for another notorious purveyor of sex &#x2013; Jesus Franco! As for the cast, Malcolm McDowell re-affirms his tendency towards hamminess when not guided by master film-makers such as Lindsay Anderson and Stanley Kubrick (another notorious contemporaneous effort I had watched and should re-acquaint myself with in the near-future is the star-studded war drama THE PASSAGE [1979]) &#x2013; he&#x2019;s got the right intensity for the title role but is visibly ill-at-ease with the sex scenes (intending to stress the era&#x2019;s utter decadence, more often than not these prove a distraction from the main plot) and particularly embarrassing when breaking into an inane dance routine. Perhaps mercifully, the thespian skills of Peter O&#x2019;Toole (as a demented and sore-riddled Tiberius, appearing much older than his 47 years) and John Gielgud (as the latter&#x2019;s counselor who opts for the easy way out rather than serve Caligula) are on display for only the first 40 minutes or so of this debacle. Also on hand are a number of notable regulars of Italian cinema &#x2013; namely Leopoldo Trieste, Paolo Bonacelli (another Pasolini alumnus) and a campy bald-headed John Steiner. The ladies &#x2013; led by Teresa Ann Savoy (sharing an incestuous relationship with her brother the Emperor) and Helen Mirren (as Caligula&#x2019;s wife, dubbed &#x201c;the most promiscuous woman in Rome&#x201d;) and including several &#x201c;Penthouse&#x201d; starlets doing their thing &#x2013; provide the expected glamor and titillation, though male nudity is just as much in continual evidence.Another sensationalistic aspect to the film is its level of gore, occasionally demonstrated in inventive fashion &#x2013; none more so than in the solitary arena sequence where prisoners are buried in sand apart from their head, which is summarily lopped off by a cumbersome machine fitted with deadly blades! Following the bloodthirsty assassination of Caligula and his entire family by his closest associates, his obese and effeminate uncle Claudius is made Emperor; incidentally, I should be acquiring the celebrated I, CLAUDIUS (1976) TV series &#x2013; with Derek Jacobi in the title role and John Hurt as Caligula &#x2013; soon enough&#x2026;and, eventually, I&#x2019;ll presently be getting to Peter O&#x2019;Toole&#x2019;s other epic about the Roman Empire &#x2013; MASADA (1981), itself a TV mini-series!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Porn for the snob?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I want to precise I have no problem with nudity, sexuality or gore. Believe me, it's not necessary to be a puritan to hate "Caligola".This awful movie, which is artistically poor and technically ridiculously amateurish, would have been soon forgotten wouldn't it be for the numerous sex images and, sadly, the presence of some good actors. How they got involved, I have no idea.What is it? Basically, a porn movie, with an unbelievable sophomoric pretention at making "art". Ah! Art? My God! Poor direction, amateurish and laughable cinematography (so dull I first thought it was on purpose!), contrived scenography, inexistant sense of unity... no art whatsoever. Not even competence. Only bombastic pretention and the desire to shock the audience... so immature.It tries to compete with Fellini's "Satyricon", Ken Russel's "The Devils", Pasolini's "Salo"... but all of these movies, wether one likes them or not, have inherent artistic and technical qualities that "Caligola" totally lacks. Showing more sex and violence doesn't make up for the emptiness of the project.But maybe, the snobbish have here an opportunity to openly watch a porn flick, with the excuse of "art". I feel sorry for them, not only because they need this kind of excuse to assume their libido, but also because defending this movie is revealing such a bad taste that in the end, it's worse than openly looking at porn movies. My opinion, though.Anyway this must be one of the most ridiculous films I've came across, and because of its incredible pretention, I'd say it's maybe the worse movie I ever saw. I can't be tolerant towards incompetence and mediocrity when it's pretending to be art. No mercy for the phoney!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>art vs. porn - who wins? who knows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that announces how bad it is is something of a kind of luxury for us film buffs who are almost expecting it. Sometimes a movie's awfulness will creep up on a viewer after a while, or one will be worked up by the possibility of it being decent or memorable. Caligula may be memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. It's the prime example of what happens when someone mistakes artistic merit (or lack thereof) with a porno. There were, perhaps, some good intentions going into it: make the most vile, exposed account of the rule of Caligula, one of the most notorious "Gods" in history. Show the sex, show the violence, show the rampant horror of an emperor/Caesar gone awry. And cast some good actors- real actors- in the chief roles, actors like Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, and, um, others I guess. And get a director whose directed some stuff (not sure what, but who cares, he can direct, kind of) to helm the production.But the conflict came not even so much when the producer, Bob Guccione of Penthouse, didn't go up to the director Tinto Brass and ask "why aren't you directing with more competency? This "epic" looks like an exploitation flick, and not in a good way", but in Guccione's own profit motive. He was confused, and so was the film - how does one sell a film with such prestige actors and a notorious character, but ALSO sell it to the company that one works for? What happened was the footage that Brass shot was taken away from him and the producer and his editors took lots and lots of footage of explicit nature (cunnilingus, fellatio, orgy, regular and anal sex), and spliced in footage where it either wasn't needed or became extraneous. As if to further dig it to Brass, they used the *bad* takes, ones that weren't supposed to be used, for the majority of the action.Having the sexual footage wouldn't have been so bad if a) the explicit sex wasn't so dull and repetitive (as, say, a typical porno turns up to be), and b) the rest of the movie around it wasn't so excruciating. It's also distracting at certain points that have some promise to be better than it is, for example a morose three-some between Caligula, Drusilla and Caesonia that has the potential to be erotic... but the Guccione cuts away constantly to a female orgy behind the curtains. It's a stupid call to make, untrusting, in fact, of either the audience there to see the actors, or those handful of folks watching it simply to get off. If Guccione really was cutting the film together for the latter, he also failed because someone watching it just to get off would turn off the film before it ends.The dialog, written by a distanced-from-the-production Gore Vidal, is turgid most often, and other times is just barely passable as being able to be spoken. And for all of the extravagance of the sets and costumes, the production feels cluttered and excessive. And the extreme acts shown in the film, and believe me, there are many (some with McDowell like the "deflowering" of the virgins, or the cutting off of the man's crotch, or the giant saw-machine cutting off heads), are done in a slack exploitation style that doesn't even excite on the basis of blood and guts and things. It's one thing to muck up usual things like acting and dialog, but another, if one is a exploitation director, to muck up visceral pleasures. It's too self-serious to be campy, and too graphic to make it in an art-house for too long.So why the four-out-of-ten rating? Malcolm McDowell, really. He knows he's taking a p***, so to speak, but he does have fun with a role that requires that much. His other contemporaries- O'Toole and Gielgud- barely have enough screen time to show much, though they look bored or just befuddled to even be on the production, and Helen Mirren, while attractive and competent in the role, doesn't add much to the production. But McDowell seems to get it, of how to go over the top (or even in the struggle to find a top to over this case), and there are some scenes where he's very funny, like when he gets his senators to bah like sheep, or when he shuffles through papers to sign with his seal. If nothing else, McDowell makes this mess watchable, and, sporadically, very entertaining.But even he can't save a troubled production. It's troubled from the first scene on, and it rarely gets to a point that the makers thought they would achieve. It's not good art, it's not good porn, it's not even good exploitaton. It's just... a fascinating blob of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was greatly disappointed watching this film. I wanted to watch a movie on Caligula and got a porno instead. I am aware that there were Greek orgies and that this sort of thing may have went on however I was very appalled to see such great talented actors acting in such horrendous rubbish.Many of the scenes though possibly viewed by the some as interesting and entertaining such as the oral scene on the boat and the penetration scenes could have been left out. A good director can bring the idea to the minds eye without the eyes having to see the acts in full color.I would not recommend this film to anyone who has any desire to keep a good impression of the actors involved or not wishing to watch an expensively made adult type film. This title should not be sold in regular stores, it should be available only in adult stores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 for the Sex and Gore, 2 for the Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to check out this film as I heard so many rumors about it from various people. Also, being a scholar of history I was curious about the historical portrayals in the film. However, I was pretty much disappointed in both fronts.To me this film looks almost like a total splice job, as Bob Guccione, puts in as much random scenes of sex as possible to fill the film up. A lot of times it seemed like they just filmed that stuff separately and randomly spliced it in when there was a reason (doubtful for it). Granted I am not complaining about the sex, after all its great when some films just push it to the limit, but at times it was getting redundant and seeming to be a total gross out factor, as it passed titilation by the first hour.The gore was pretty good, I have to give them credit for the scenes of decapitation with the semi realistic head rolling down the floor. The executions were also quite gory and semi-realistic. To be honest, I think some horror directors could improve their movies by studying some of the scenes of gore in this film.As for the plot, man it was just plain monotonous and LONG LONG LONG. The unrated version of this film which I saw was over 2 and a half hours, and could have been trimmed down to 90 mins to 2 hours if the editors actually had a brain. Once Peter O'Toole's syphilitic character is murdered early in the film, how the plot proceeds is quite predictable. Caligula takes over and creates a rein of terror BLAH BLAH BLAH. Recommendation to avoid, but if you like sex and gore you can always fast forward to those particular scenes as they are the only saving grace of this dull film.</fullReview>

Everything about this "film" is miscalculated, unpleasant and so completely wrong! A soft-core porn disguised as a biography of the mad Roman emperor Caligola, everything about it, from the acting to the indescribably awful direction, from the inane cinematography to the screenplay that seems to have been written by a horny donkey (sorry, I know Gore Vidal was involved but the writing is awful); everything is as awful as it gets, and it still gets worse.Release us from things like CALIGOLA!

		<shortDescription>The remains of what could have been... buried beneath so much porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The things I remember most about this film are probably the same things everyone else remembers: homosexual finger rape, beastiality, a head-chopping machine, hardcore nudity, and semen being used as lotion. I, however noticed one more thing, and it makes the picture even more painful: small fragments of a good movie. From what I can tell Tinto Brass delivered a good version of CALIGULA before the studio got its claws into it. The scene with a dying John Gielgud being questioned by Malcolm McDowell about immortality is too good to be in the picture. The wedding scene is also excessive, but it still looks like it was shot for a movie and not a porno. The scene where Caligula is ill and a senator says he'll give his life if Caligula may be well again, not expecting the fatal results, is the best in the film. What's wrong? Bob Guccione thought it would be a good idea to gut a movie and then fill in the empty space with random sex. There's so much damned sex that after a while stops being shocking or arousing; it just gets boring. I'd love to see the original film, but the final cut is still a piece of s**t. Perhaps it's still a movie to see, but not a movie you'd admit you'd seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scandalous attempt to combine film art with pornography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. Yet, the negative feelings raised in me quite soon, particularly at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not that horrific to the middle. During the second half of the film, I felt as if I watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself "This is one of the movies that one may really hate" ... I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste. I hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one.CALIGULA does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and the founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims at combining film art with porn. That is, I think, the most serious matter the film may be accused of. Movie is an art that should be reigned by taste, by message, by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them. Some say that the Rome under Caligula's reign was so brutal. Yes, it is true. Corruption bloomed at that time, various sexual deviances were preferable to Roman citizens. Yet, I do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic. I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies... HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES: The screenplay by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. It is noticeable, for instance, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. Yet, the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes. Moreover, Livia was not Proculus wife raped by Caesar on her wedding. What lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife together with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister. The sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts. TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. The cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding. Yet, the only strong point of the movie are the performances, particularly the one by Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall raises the value of the film. If everything bothers you in CALIGULA, you may at least admire his performance. I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love to his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole does his finest piece of acting in the Capri Grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that THE ONLY THING I like about CALIGULA are the performances. Therefore, I don't rate the movie 1/10.LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity. Let us analyze just the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed constitutes a bad omen. And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying...? All in all, I don't recommend to see CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read Robert Graves' gorgeous novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise's mini series with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. It is, in its most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic.There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty,there are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer,there are movies that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some moral,there are, however, movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people's minds,CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the latest group</fullReview>

I have heard the argument "this is what it must have been like, it only shows the reality" quite often in connection with this movie, but this... First of all, the movie is full of hardcore sex scenes. Second, it's soaked with graphic violence, up to a point where I just wanted to turn it off. I can't understand all the positive reviews I read, it seems unimaginable to me that a person with a normal sense for moral and beauty could actually enjoy this piece of crap, even if you like nudity/erotic! This movie is full of everything I don't want to see: too graphic violence, sick characters, disgusting hardcore sex (incest,sadomaso),and an overall appearence of total darkness and evil!

		<fullReview>I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves' picture of Claudius. The climactic (?) assassination of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch Passolini's "Salo", but by all means stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

Castration, disembowelment, mutilation, beheadings, bestiality, necrophilia are all shoved in your face. I could care less if it's historically accurate or not...whatever it is, it's revolting! This theatre was packed when I went. During the movie many people walked out...in disgust I'm assuming. I had to leave after the two hour mark. There was a bad taste in my movie (from the movie!), my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. That should tell you something.The only saving grace in this is that they got some respected actors who, despite the material, give good performances The late John Gielgud is in the first 10 minutes and then killed off (a wise choice), Peter O'Toole is killed off after 40 minutes (another wise choice). Poor Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren (who admits she did it just for the money) suffer through the entire film. They give two great performances...much better than the film deserves.A total piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cleopatra's Whores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a period there, in the late 70s, we came very close to having real life in films. More real than ever. Oh, we had blood and tears, and an occasional breast, but the state of affairs was little different than that Disney TeeVee world where no bathrooms had toilets and sex was something oddly remote from the eye, always around the corner.Partly, its that odd, odd American prudishness, that tut tut notion that invisible things are managed things. But partly there's the simple fact that no good case could be made for "watching." So a simple balance is maintained. Since sex sells, we'll have wet lips and vamping and wild joining of invisible parts. But we won't have life the way it really is, with all sorts of skin, intimacies and gentle touches. And smells.Into this space you'll find various intrusions. I really thought "9 Songs" was immensely clever, justifiably cinematic. I also find from time to time clever ideas in ordinary porn. "Private Teacher" by an Orson Welles associate had some neat ideas sneaked in, as did "La Foire aux sexes" which was every bit a good new wave film.And then you'll have something like this, which perhaps by itself set back the whole notion of intimacy in film three decades.Its big, its loud, its stupid. Fortunately, this was before that insane silicone and shaved craze hit the girlie watcher's world. But its of the same ilk in a way. Just think: Peter O'Toole, Hellen Mirren, John Geilgud for chrissakes! Not bad set design, in that Italian monstrosity tradition of Zefferelli. A script by Gore Vidal ? who knows nothing about how to flesh out a film (ouch, sorry), but whose larger arcs are solid. And Tinto Brass is not a bad filmmaker in the small, meaning he knows how to make a good image if not craft things as a project.It could have worked, because by the late seventies, audiences had plenty of examples of performances that referenced and encapsulated other performances, so we could have what this could have been: a (film) performance of a (porn) performance of a (historical, voyeuristic-in-its-time) performance. And the projection of genital reality across those layers could have been intelligent as well as whatever else you may want.For decades after Kinsey botched things with flawed science, Playboy was the vanguard of the sexual revolution. I'm not making this up; there really was a "Playboy philosophy" which boiled down to: "sex is natural and pleasant and if it doesn't hurt anyone, why not?" With hippies as a sort of mascot, this seemed intelligent, especially since the girlie pictures were surrounded with some of the best writing in print. Those centerfolds mattered.Then along came a sort of second generation magazine which exploited the fact that Palyboy's girls had no body hair or genitals and were too linked to a set of obsolete fantasies. Penthouse girls had hair and fluids and were aggressive. Fewer coy blonds; more adventure. It was an equally vapid set of fantasies which as these things go went obsolete as quickly. But in the period of 76-80, that magazine was in the forefront of vaginal honesty in life. A forefront, such as society would allow.And there was the Playboy tradition of wrapping things in intellectual goo. Which meant that this film could have been something that mattered, that changed things. It could have cast itself in the same useless space as the Romans it portrayed. But it made a strange bargain: the story has these acts as perverted, distorted life. Where ordinary films went way out of their way to not show certain things in sex, this went as far the other way to show them. Its a strange world where sexual positions and acts are arranged precisely so that you CAN see.So I think like all great turning points in film, this film is important. Its not good, its ghastly. But its important because its mistakes hurt us in places that matter and missed an opportunity to make film better, richer.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ought to be a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography is gorgeous, along with the scoring. The production captures both the glory and barbarity of mankind in Rome. MacDowell's portrayal of the mad Emperor is convincing and O'Toole never disappoints. For a movie so controversial to be made in it's time, only Penthouse would have supplied the budget, and, so there was gratuitous sex. So what? Truthfully, it was a small price to pay for such funding. The nudity was certainly well within reason in the costuming. The dialogue covering the orgy scenes was very insightful into the dramatic viewpoints of the characters. Bizarre, but true. Much of the movie is to tear either at your stomach or your heart. No. It is not bad. It makes everyone who watches it feel too much and think too many things to be bad. I agree, it is difficult to take. I do, however, highly recommend this film to anyone who has a strong stomach for mankind and likes a challenge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people will find this movie shocking and disgusting because of the hardcore sex scenes and the violent behavior in this movie. Thou who do that will probably despite the movie, and it's them who have given this movie this bad rumors. But for them who can handle the truth about the perverted and violent Romans, can actually see that Caligula isn't a bad movie at all. Well, it's not great, but you'll sit through the entire two and half hours of it just out of morbid curiosity and bewilderment.So if your going to see Caligula, be sure to see the unrated version. I'm not just saying that so you should see more hardcore scenes, I'm saying that because this version is more artistic right. A 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 for the Sex and Gore, 2 for the Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember there are a few spoilers located inside this review so you are forewarned.I just had to check out this film as I heard so many rumors about it from various people. Also, being a scholar of history I was curious about the historical portrayals in the film. However, I was pretty much disappointed in both fronts.To me this film looks almost like a total splice job, as Bob Guccione, puts in as much random scenes of sex as possible to fill the film up. A lot of times it seemed like they just filmed that stuff separately and randomly spliced it in when there was a reason (doubtful for it). Granted I am not complaining about the sex, after all its great when some films just push it to the limit, but at times it was getting redundant and seeming to be a total gross out factor, as it passed titilation by the first hour.The gore was pretty good, I have to give them credit for the scenes of decapitation with the semi realistic head rolling down the floor. The executions were also quite gory and semi-realistic. To be honest, I think some horror directors could improve their movies by studying some of the scenes of gore in this film.As for the plot, man it was just plain monotonous and LONG LONG LONG. The unrated version of this film which I saw was over 2 and a half hours, and could have been trimmed down to 90 mins to 2 hours if the editors actually had a brain. Once Peter O'Toole's syphilitic character is murdered early in the film, how the plot proceeds is quite predictable. Caligula takes over and creates a rein of terror BLAH BLAH BLAH. Recommendation to avoid, but if you like sex and gore you can always fast forward to those particular scenes as they are the only saving grace of this dull film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever a distributor has refused to screen a film for critics before it's release, it's usually a sure sign that it's going to be a megaton disaster (see The Scarlet Letter, the remake of Island of Dr. Moreau, and the Avengers).Caligula was also not shown to critics before it's release and it's easy to see why. this film is horrible. it looks cheap, the talented cast wasted in underdeveloped roles, and the film goes on way too long (the uncut version runs 156 min.!!)the plot revolves around the last emporer, Caligula Caesar and his acsension and fall from power.the ONLY reason to sit through this film is around 7 or so minutes of pretty good hard core sex scenes. (the lesbian scene in particular is the best one i have seen in ANY film, adult or mainstream.) so, if you can make through the rest, there is a little reward for the courageous.a very bad movie that will test your patience.rating:1 (though the hard core scenes get a 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this I was intellectually and experientially disadvantaged and for those reasons (but mostly because I scarcely remembered it) I decided to see it again, nearly 30 years later.On a set copied sedulously from a down-at-heel Chinese brothel populated by people gathered from the Strip on any 70's Saturday night in LA, Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) with fragments of post-it's stuck all over his withered face, mouths fatuous plasticine dialogue as Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) looks on in starry-eyed adoration. Later Caligula gets to play a much hackneyed role from a San Francisco bath house in the 80's (perhaps even the 1880's). If Caligula were indeed the dissipated creature he has oftentimes been portrayed (a _very_ early devotee of carnality with his sister for example) it's hardly likely that he would find Tiberius' unsustainable Brothelicon a shining beacon of desire.Leaving aside the underplayed (and mostly redundant) carnal component of this cornucopia of calamitous cinematic crap, one wonders if any of the people involved consulted even a single (sober or soused) historian prior to writing. Rome, like victorian England, had its twisted sides but such things were never secret for long and, for all the Praetorian Guard's prowess, the people would not have taken this kind of thing ... um ... lying down, for long. But that's to poke a hole in a swiss cheese the size of Switzerland.The thing about cinematic catastrophes such as this is that the director gets his cake either way. He can always claim it was a genius challenge for which the jaded establishment public were inadequately prepared, else he can claim it was a sensitive and humorous parody, which the dim-witted public could not appreciate and thereby missed the inverted/reflected brilliance of his double-bluff to their parodied middle-class bourgeois values.It's not a terrible film; there are many worse. It is a notorious film, and for all the wrong reasons. The sets are dark enough to take our minds off their paucity. The dialogue is sparse enough to take our minds off it's painfully skeletal composition fleshed out with fatuousness. The acting is scarce enough to take our minds off. Gielgud was so completely discomfited by his role, he seemed to be speed-reading his lines off his mental teleprompter so he could get off the set and wrap his tortured soul around a warm amontillado and call his agent for a rant and recompense.I'd say, if you're /really/ bored and this is sitting by the player, load it up and flop into a beanbag. You may fall asleep, but if you don't, then at worst you'll only wish you had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Expensive Porn Flick of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one should write or read a long review of this movie. To do that would be to waste time as much as watching this movie is. I laugh at the reviewers who try to analyze this movie like it is anything but porn. Yes, the original idea was brazenly R material that was supposed to be a realistic expose of the life of Caligula. However, the owner of Penthouse put the final product together, and the result is an obvious attempt to make porn more "mainstream" by connecting it to big screen actors. I laugh at reviewers defending it when the very actors that starred in it and the writer of the screenplay want nothing to do with it, seeing the final product for what it is- the most expensive porn flick of all time. I had to forward through much of the movie; frankly, I don't know how non-depraved people can actually sit and watch the whole thing. There is a tremendous blow job scene at 2:10. That is the only part of this movie worth watching in my opinion. The rest is complete crap. And that is actually putting it mildly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fractured, Lazy, Meretricious, Uneven Mess of a Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Caligula" is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is pure garbage. I would use different words to describe how awful it is, but IMDb does not permit the use of such words that I would give to this atrocious piece of junk. The film reel that holds this film would be better used spinning in a toilet bowl than on a movie projector.So why is this film that bad? You can tell right in the first scene. It shows Malcolm McDowell playfully chasing a very pretty girl through a forest. Not only is the shot out of focus, but the editor somehow felt it appropriate to intersperse this scene with footage of sheep running through a crowded street. Why? What do these sheep even have to do with this scene? It's not even metaphoric. It would be if it showed McDowell speaking to a large crowd of people who are influenced by his words. This way, the metaphor would be that the Romans are like sheep blindly following their leader. However, that is not at all what happens at any point in the film.In fact, no one in this film seems to take McDowell's character of Caligula seriously. McDowell, who I loved in "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) and other films, plays the Roman Emperor in a one-note performance that seems to undermine his acting ability. Caligula in this movie is a whiny brat of an emperor who seems to do four things: fornicate, flout about wearing no pants, send people to be executed at random, or elevate his status from Emperor to God. I don't know much about Roman history myself, or at least not about Emperors after Marcus Aurelius. However, the real Caligula must have had more complexity than this.There are other great thespians in this movie who, according to what I've read, played their parts while not knowing the mess they were getting into. Peter O'Toole did what he could playing Tiberius, but just seeing the ugly makeup he wore made me want to take a shower and use rubber gloves. That's why I cringed when McDowell and others kissed him on the cheek.Helen Mirren was also wasted in this movie as Caesonia, Caligula's wife who, according to his sister and lover (yes, that's right) Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. Not only do you not see her with other men in this movie, but she also goes through the entire movie looking bored and just going through the motions. I actually don't blame Mirren for feeling that way if she actually did. Fortunately, better roles would come her way in the next 30 years.But again, the biggest weakness of this film comes in the editing. I have not seen a movie before which has sloppier editing, and the flow of the story is completely thrown off because of it. The scene where Caligula first gazes upon Caesonia is followed too abruptly by a man getting his head cut off in a stadium. It goes right from harp-like music playing to a scream and the sound of a sharp knife slicing through bone in a second. Any sane moviegoer would react by saying, "Woah! What the hell happened!?!" in that second alone. I found myself saying that phrase through the whole movie.Many films have strengths and weaknesses, but this is the first film I've seen where I can't think of any strengths whatsoever. It's sloppy in its editing and storytelling, less than mediocre in its character portrayals, and even the settings and backdrops look too much like movie sets. In fact, the scene where Caesonia is giving birth looks like it was filmed in a high school gymnasium.If someone who actually knew what they were doing would have made this film, it would have been a lot better. What is most surprising is that the film is gaining an audience with the most recent DVD release. It may be because of its notorious hardcore sex scenes, but to me, those parts of the film aren't even sexy or erotic in the slightest. This film just should not have been made, period, and I don't say that about many other films.</fullReview>

The sets are mildly interesting knock offs of Fellinis Satyricon and Pasolini's Trilogy of Life, the classical score is fair, if pretentious. The script reflects the refined sensibility of Vidal( BTW, that was a joke), while the acting.. Wait a minute, I now hear an objection.."the acting was good!", shout the defenders of this indefensible sludge, in chorus..Well, that objection doesn't hold water.

I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min' one that I watched - but I can't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck!I'd heard for long about the alleged "shocking" content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn't much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: Everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! Camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is, or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this?

		<fullReview>'Caligula' is a thoroughly unpleasant experience. It is depraved and disgusting, and it captures the unlimited excesses of ancient Rome very well. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the film is that it attracted such acting heavyweights as John Gielgud (Nerva), Peter O'Toole (Tiberius), and Helen Mirren (Caesonia); who are all excellent. As is Malcom McDowell in the title role; his wide-eyed, utterly deranged performance is spot on, and his madness seems to grow as every minute of the running time ticks by.Virtually every perversion one can think of is represented here, and is performed against massive, stunning sets which are lavish and amazing in their construction and attention to detail. There is casual sadism aplenty; people are put to death at Caligula's slightest whim, and sex is never far from the frame. The film has been called the most expensive porno ever made, but directors Tinto Brass, Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione, and Giancarlo Lui, deserve praise for not taking the easy way out and making some awful 'I've come to repair the cable' kind of affair. Instead, they have attempted a much more ambitious project: the story of the rise and fall of the most notorious Roman emperor in history.If you can stomach all the sex and violence, then you can certainly watch 'Caligula' for its acting. But you are definitely going to need a shower afterwards! You might do better watching the superb HBO cable television series 'Rome'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh, the wait is over. I finally got my hands on the Uncut Director's Edition of "Caligula." I can only assume that some of the folks on here saying that this movie is not that pornographic have only seen some chopped up, edited version. It is most definitely porn. We see lots of BJ's and tons of straight up sex. Lots of it appears to have been spliced in after the fact and does nothing for the movie at all.The costumes and the sets here are atrocious. It's something like "Planet of the Apes" meets "Clash of the Titans" meets "Masters of the Universe" (the one with Dolph Lundgren) meets some random, off-Broadway play. Too many scenes are filmed on what is just a plain, black stage with cheesy backdrops. The props are awful and embarrassing.There are a few good gore scenes, but nothing that will impress an Italian horror buff or a gorehound. It's mostly just naked men and women lounging around and getting each other off. It was all very disgusting and certainly not a turn on. Couldn't see beatin' it to this flick, call me crazy!Malcolm McDowell delivers a great performance but he basically does little Alex from "A Clockwork Orange" again here. It's not hard to see how he went down the 'straight to sci-fi channel' road after this one. Helen Mirren is non-existent really and Peter O'Toole is not in it very long, so these comments about the 'big name stars' are a little silly.Overall, I expected a lot more gore and disturbing scenes. They just aren't there. The ending was pretty cool though, I like how they hoist up the halfwit to be the new Ceasar.I'd have to recommend a ton of films before this one if you want disturbing. I struggled to stay awake to tell you the truth.3 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took it upon myself to watch Caligula (the unrated version) last night, mostly because I'm a Malcolm McDowell fan. I'd been excited to see it all day, kept mentioning random trivia about it I had read to anyone who would listen, but I knew this movie had not been well received. However, being 19, a girl, and usually of a pretty open mind, I figured it would be right up my alley anyway, but about twenty-two minutes in I had to accept that this may very well be one of the worst movies of all time. I think what earns it this title is not the useless nudity and violence (I'm a huge Tarantino fan and on occasion enjoy some actual porn, so I don't think this is biased because I 'can't handle the reality of sex and gore'), but really it's that this COULD have been a GREAT film. A screenplay by Gore Vidal, great actors, and I mean, who doesn't love hearing about the decadence of the roman empire at the hands of an insane despot? I now wish I could have those two and a half hours of my life back, but I also wish I could go back in time and help make this movie the masterpiece it could have been. At first I thought the worst part of the movie would be that McDowell might slip too easily into a reprise of his role as Alexander De Large (except with a toga), but no. The decapitator wall, the freaks of nature in Tiberius' cave, Teresa Ann Savoy, that girl who peed on Proculus' corpse, and that lesbian sex scene are what stand out as I write this. I had a gum graft earlier this morning, and it's harder to recover from this film than from the procedure. Don't watch this movie if you want to retain any kind of respect for the real talent involved in this production, but if you do anyway, it helps to read about how most of them were as disappointed with the movie as I was. I give it a five out of ten for potential, McDowell in those short togas, and kick-ass opening credits music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, not for nothing, but yes for little. "Caligula" is one of the most polemic movies of all time.I love movies with social sense. Movies that makes you think, and the topic of "Caligula" can make a great movie. But this adaptation... well, don't full the cup. Of course "Caligula" has good as bad points. Is not so meaning and powerful as "Sal? o le 120 giornate di Sodoma" but is not so awful, unnecessary and inhuman as "Cannibal Holocaust". So this is a movie that i hate, but i to appreciate.As much of us know, "Caligula" was not all of Tinto Brass. Much of the shots are from people (Who produce too the movie) of "Penthouse". Althoug, the movie is not porn."Caligula" shows how the power can be bad managed. This topic is goo handled is some scenes... for example, when Caligula (Malcom Mc Dowell surprise again with his sarcastic voice like Kubrick's "Clockwork orange") act good with people who going to die for orders of him. Or, for example too, when the town makes a kind of social pyramid that critic the political system of they emperor. The bad thing... unnecessary porn."Caligula" always going to be a polemic movie, with people who loves it and hates it. And...well, this is my opinion. You have it, you love it or you hate it.*Sorry for the mistakes...well,if there any</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adultery wasn't exactly punishable by death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the review on the main page, it is noted that, "adultery was an offense punishable by death." This is mainly misleading, but also wrong.Adultery really was an offense punishable by death but certain conditions needed to be met. First, though not a condition, was that adultery was an argument by a citizen used as a defense of murder, not to bring someone to trial. The most important condition that was that adultery was defined as sexual relations between a married woman and a man not her husband. The marriage had to be recognized by the state, which required citizenship. Women were rarely granted full citizenship, almost never to any woman born outside the highest levels of the nobility. Finally (not actually finally but enough to make the point) full citizenship was pretty uncommon in ancient Rome--Rome is estimated to have had at it's height a population of over 1 million people (around 450,000 by some estimates) but no more than 60,000 citizens (by any estimate). Foreigners and slaves had no citizenship, and residents of allied cities could be granted various rights below full citizenship with marriages that weren't always recognized.So, you might ask, what does all this mean? Adulterers weren't put to trial, they were killed on the spot, which provided both vengeance to the one whose rights were violated (the spouse of the adulterer) and proof of the crime. It was nearly impossible for women to charge for adultery since they were granted full citizenship so rarely. It was almost as difficult for male Roman citizens to be charged with adultery since no more than 60,000 of 600,000 women in Rome could be married to Roman citizens (military service and a frequent state of war created a tremendous imbalance in population balance between the sexes, and while the 60,000 is a fair estimate, the 600,000 could be quite low). Last (again not last, just the same as above) is that there was a massive women's population available for the act of adultery where the crime didn't apply.If you were a female in Rome the crime only mattered to you, except in rare cases, if you married to a citizen and you were guilty of the crime. If you were a male and noble-born, it was a defense for the murder of your wife and her lover, except in rare cases. If you were male and not noble-born, it was a crime that you could be involved in and for which you would be killed on the spot (again, except in rare cases).It's more accurate to say that 'adultery was an offense against noble-born males which gave them an excuse to kill their wives and lovers.'Oh yeah-the only reason to watch Caligula is to see what all the fuss was about. Without the fuss it would have been forgotten long ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, Ebert was right...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never care about what critics say about a film, but in this case I must admit Roger Ebert was right: a zero should be included in the rating for this piece of rubbish called "Caligula". This is, without a doubt, the most malignant and repulsive film i've ever seen; a sadistic blend of hardcore pornography -both straight and gay- and extreme violence. It's really a visual attack, and the only thing I find ironic is that highly respected actors like O'Toole and Gielgud accepted to have a role in this monstrosity. This film has nothing: no plot, no story, nor good acting; it's just a series of vignettes showing the most shocking images you could ever imagine. Some people get thrilled by watching gore movies, but one can tell the difference when a film is made just for entertainment, and when it's made to offend the viewer. There are limits. And it seems to me that Brass and Guccione surpassed those limits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humorless hardcore? Why not? Someone had to make sex boring, and it looks like Bob Guccione was the man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anything could give a bad name to Caligula -- a boyish emperor whose only sins were to love his sisters too well, to have too ironic a sense of humor, to exercise justice too emphatically and to have too optimistic a view of his future -- it would be this sodden pile of oozing lasagna. I, Claudius it ain't. The cast consists of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, Peter O'Toole as Tiberius, John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and the flopping, furry bits and pieces of a lot of naked Italian extras. It is stunning and amusing to see the likes of Gielgud and Mirren recite their lines with serious intent and then watch a quick cut-away to hardcore fellatio at a Bob Guccione version of an orgy. It has to be said: The orgies are the most boring part of this movie. Guccione cuts in hardcore sex with all the timing of a metronome. Extras do so much genital fingering I'm surprised they didn't come down with carpel tunnel syndrome. Peter O'Toole, as a seriously degenerate Tiberius, has been known to give ripe and awful performances in his career. Here, he outdoes himself. It's not that the man is shameless, it's that he appears embarrassingly to be trying to give a performance. Malcolm McDowell is the only one who seems to be amused at the awful role he agreed to play for what, I hope, was a lot of money. McDowell is a fascinating, sly, humorous and serious actor. Even when he's humping around enjoying both the bride and the groom at a wedding party, or doing a lascivious dance to please Peter O'Toole, or ordering his legions to attack the papyrus, or playing the sneering host at a long, long orgy (with all those close-up cut-aways), I still like him. He carries what acting weight there is in this tank of rancid Penthouse rejects. Guccione, the editor and publisher of Penthouse who produced Caligula (and directed the hardcore parts), seems to have no more an erotic imagination here than he had in his magazine. The movie is so humorless, so hypocritical and so cheesy it not only will put you off Caligula, it probably will put you off genitals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caligula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard quite a lot about this controversial historical film, admittedly because of the mention of a lot of sex featuring, I just didn't know how much it would have. Basically it traces the rise and fall of the most notorious Roman Emperor, Gaius Caesar Germanicus, better known as Caligula (Malcolm McDowell). Caligula (meaning Little Boots) started as the Prince with his father Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) ruling Rome, with a little guidance from men like Nerva (Sir John Gielgud). Caligula is very rebellious trying to get the crown, and takes drastic action when his father becomes very ill, he gets Macro (Guido Mannari) to strangle the Emporer to death, with Gemellus (Bruno Brive) witnessing. After Caligula is made the new Emporer, he immediately has Macro executed when Gemellus says he witnessed it, and then he starts forming his new government. The insane Emporer has many of his servants wearing no clothing, and he has a very sick incestuous relationship with his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy). We hear that he fruitlessly invades England, he kills anyone who displeases him, and he is made to marry the woman he finds most attractive, the most infamous prostitute in Rome, Caesonia (Dame Helen Mirren). But it was his love for sex that is the most frequent site in the film, as he arranges mass orgies in his palace for money, and there are no holds barred for what you will see. The tragic death of Caligula's sister is a big blow and he orders everyone to join in the day of remembrance, but he goes back to normal not long after and enjoys a little passion for his wife. In the end though, his terrible reign comes to an end when the men he trusted decide to murder him and his wife on the steps of his kingdom, and they declare Claudius (Giancarlo Badessi) as the new Emporer of Rome. Being made with the help of founder of Penthouse magazine, Bob Guccione, I think it obvious what the film makers were going to end up with. Obviously lovers of hardcore pornography and violence will love seeing women performing all unprotected oral, anal and intercourse, and some blood being spilt during. But me, I do not want to see almost the entire film featuring it, as well as some gay and masturbation action, especially not in a mainstream kind of film like this. If you are going to make a hardcore pornography film set in the Roman times, you don't use great British stars like McDowell, Mirren, Guilegud and O'Toole! It is like the British equivalent for Showgirls, and it is easily the worst British film I have ever seen in my life, right up there with Freddy Got Fingered as worst in my life! It was number 60 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very, very poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather than blathering on about how bad this film is, let me try to give it some credit.Guccione has produced a genuinely first rate trashy film. A deliberate effort to corrupt and degrade whichever profession participated in this shabby extravaganza.Mirren looks good with nothing on and obviously enjoys it. McDowell portrays himself as a first rate nutter, yet again. Guccione had the vision to cast the pair of them in roles they would never again rise above.I was fortunate enough to have only seen the short version of this dreary DVD.It now resides in a landfill site.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Version Have I Seen ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and " Big " John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely awful film. You could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . Yes you read that right , a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !Trivia point. Many years ago a pirate copy of THE THING ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my Island and it been copied onto a rental tape of CALIGULA meaning the pirate version of THE THING starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of THE THING starts . This led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. Well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . But having seen the whole of CALIGULA I don`t know what it meant either</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mean-Spirited, Ugly Piece of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to Penthouse to produce a movie about Caligula, one of history's most evil men. They dumped money into the project to turn ancient history into a boring, sickening, and vile sexploitation porn film. It is pitiful how an important time period was used to sell audiences disgusting filth. On top of that, the movie manipulated some of the finest actors of our time and embarrasses them on screen. I do not tell people to go see or avoid movies because they have a choice of their own that is beyond my grasp. I only tell them what I saw and what I thought of it.As I watched "Caligula", I became confused, bored, offended, and disgusted towards the material. All my eyes beheld were fully naked bodies, pointless close-ups of genitalia, acts of oral sex, orgies, hardcore sex scenes, mutilation, self-mutilation, urination, some form of necrophilia, castration, rape, and senseless violence and torture (sometimes sexually). I do not feel proud telling anybody what I saw in "Caligula". It is true that the real Caligula committed such senseless acts but I felt most of these sights were completely unnecessary.If that's not sick enough for you, there were actors and actresses who pleasured themselves as they saw people tortured or killed. Was it a way to depict the sadistic atmosphere of Rome? I know there are much classier ways to reflect the horrible society of the Roman Empire. I simply watch "Spartacus: Blood and Sand". Yes, there was an extreme amount of blood, sex, and brutality but there were also great stories with emotions and feelings that kept the series' heart beating. "Spartacus" reflected both ugliness and beauty but "Caligula" could only show me ugliness. Speaking of ugliness, I will share a couple of examples in "Caligula". In one scene, Emperor Caligula raped a newly-wed couple in a kitchen as a "wedding gift." First, he had intercourse with the virgin bride and then he (be prepared) stuck his fist up the groom's rectum. Why on God's good green earth did I have to see it?! What's even worse is that the movie gave us no emotion out of the travesty, not even an emotional flurry of music to give me a cathartic chill.The other scene was one of the torture sequences. Caligula tortured a guard by slashing him to death and a couple of random girls sexually urinated on his corpse. Seriously, this was garbage. But that didn't stop there. No, the guard's genitals were cut off and fed to dogs. This is referenced in Eli Roth's "Hostel Part II" but the big difference is that Roth did it to shock and horrify people. "Caligula" did it just to get some attention because it wanted to be the most controversial movie ever. And they polished a nuclear bomb to reach that target by going with the orgy of the senators' wives. It was a waste of time and utterly disgusting. As I look back at his role of Alex DeLarge, I could see Malcolm McDowell as Caligula but he was in the wrong production at the wrong time. The man himself said he hated the movie. Overall, his performance was satisfying yet it had terrible moments. When McDowell acted paranoid or screamed, I was disappointed how unconvincing he was. Helen Mirren had the role of Caesonia, the wife of Caligula, and she did a decent job but I was devastated to see her wearing a leash around her neck like a subservient dog. She deserved more respect than that. Giancarlo Badessi portrayed the uncle of Caligula, Claudius, and he annoyed me. He made Claudius look like an overweight, idiotic buffoon; according to history, the real Claudius did not have such attributes. It was unfathomable how Peter O'Toole could be involved in "Caligula" as the Emperor Tiberius and be below-average in the role as well. All O'Toole did was awkwardly pronounce sentences and burst out exclamations as if he had Tourette's syndrome. O'Toole and his co-star John Gielgud claim they never knew hardcore sex scenes were being filmed. How could they not?! I saw O'Toole caressing fully nude girls, kissing their bodies while sitting next to fully nude men in the movie! I suppose he was in denial. There were scraps of the movie I did admire. Some of the dialogue worked well in the movie and I enjoyed some of McDowell's comedic parts. Some important moments of Caligula's reign were covered but not enough to outweigh the ugliness in the rest of the film. The ending was the only scene I liked in the movie even though it is shot and executed sluggishly. The movie needed to end the way it did, no matter how horrible it looked. "Caligula" is an ugly, boring porn film which aims to exploit history in favor of cheap hardcore sex footage and gross-out shots. If there is any sort of reason to view it, see it to understand how I felt. As I stated before, I only share my thoughts to people and the decision to see a movie lies with them. For those who are brave enough to sit through "Caligula", I commend you all for your courage. My Rating: 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"As if there ever could be an antidote to Caesar"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a movie that begins auspiciously - after a few shots of Teresa Ann Savoy's anus, we head to Capri. Tiberius' palace lives up to Suetonius' account, and is as good a representation of hell as those in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY and CONSTANTINE. Actually the whole movie looks like a Penthouse layout, which is a cross between a Persian's living room and a Frenchwoman's toilet. And a toilet is where this movie belongs, briefly, before it is flushed. Afterward, use the bidet for a couple of hours, then have the house burned, and move to a new town.An undying exaltation of bad taste, CALIGULA is one of the truest examples I know of the axiom about absolute power corrupting absolutely - in the case not of Gaius Germanicus but Bob Guccione. Here is a man with great tools at his disposal: actors like Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud, and a script by Gore Vidal; and he manages to kill off the first two in the second reel and rape the third beyond recognition even of its author. A man who takes a movie away from a professional (if a mediocrity) like Tinto Brass in order to insert his own favorite fetishes, like water sports and bad zoom photography. A man who, let's face it, styled himself the tasteful alternative to Larry Flynt, because his magazine featured women urinating instead of defecating.What he made is a movie that fails to arouse, titillate, shock, or even interest, despite its heavy content of penetration, ejaculation, and at least on the part of O'Toole and Gielgud, mortification. It is an incoherent and tawdry epic, at two and a half hours too long by three, a spectacle so ugly as to defeat the term. For an entertaining and enjoyable telling of the Caligula tale, I recommend John Hurt's turn in I, CLAUDIUS.Oh - there is one important historical question raised by this opus: where, in ancient Rome, did they find all those circumcised penises?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historical accuracy be damned...as well as lighting, sound, continuity, acting and directing! I watched this debacle, all the time thinking that somebody had sneaked some booby and bush shots into a junior high rendition of Julius Caesar. The acting (if you can call it that) was embarrassing. How they managed to get the likes of John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole and Helen Mirren to appear in this monstrosity is anybody's guess. Watch if you must...but I doubt anyone who loves great acting will be able to sit all the way through. I really can't find anything about this production to praise. The costumes were cheesy, the nudity gratuitous, the sound production nonexistent, and on and on. I watched this out of curiosity, having avoided it for 31 years because of the bad reviews. Now I only wished I had waited another three decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-Christian and just flat out bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do I see a film with such blatant anti-Christian moments. This theme is progressed with contrasts between the hero Caligola and references to the non-heroic / emasculated actions of Christians. Specifically, Macro (Guido Mannari) is contrasted against Caligola throughout the film. Macro is a coward who flees from the monsters terrorizing his village, whereas Caligola is the hero who conquers the beasts. At the conclusion of the work Macro has become a slave owning/beating Christian priest who is still just as cowardly as ever, yet Caligola is the heroic king whose well deserved fame has spread throughout the land. This contrast summarizes the heroic idolization and the not-so-subtle anti-Christian theme apparent throughout the film.Additionally, the plot is relatively absent. The film erred on the side of crowd pleasing with a presentation in 3D and spectacular special effects. But, such special effects are only expected by the current eight dollar paying movie-goer, so all the film really has going for it is a presentation in 3D. Regarding character depth, Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his queen (Teresa Ann Savoy) seemed to demonstrate some towards the end of the movie, but all other characters lacked depth completely.The film has no redeeming qualities. The market for the movie is unmistakably teenage boys with no desire to critically think about what they view. Just imagine what that does to a film.</fullReview>
