		<shortDescription>Meh, a real review... a few spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains a few spoilers.I looked forward to this movie and saw Range 15 in the theater. My friend who came with me and myself are both Army veterans. The movie was disappointing though and while there were a few funny parts, the audience and ourselves were not laughing through-out the film as claimed by some other people.All the cussing was funny at first but then it just grew old and seemed to be used more as a script filler for lack of anything better.Dark humor and violence has its place in a movie like this, but it just got weird and awkward at times, as if the writers were trying too hard for material.Indeed, there were loads of inappropriate jokes - which a lot of veterans enjoy, but too many of these jokes were extremely disrespectful and hateful - well past the point of being funny and beyond most of the audience's comfort zone. The audience was nearly 100% veteran or active duty as we live near a major Army post and other military assets.SPOILER ALERT. I agree with other reviews that nothing was left untouched - women, cleavage, sex scenes, sex toys, penises, amputations, killing children, butts, spewing blood, and so on. I know a subset of the veteran community likes this humor, but it certainly does not represent ALL of the veteran community, not by a long shot. My friend left the theater for a while because the movie had just become so lame.SPOILER ALERT. I might add that there were very few zombies. If a group's going to make a film about zombies then have zombies! Don't just throw a handful of folks into make-up and give the main actors a script that claims the whole world is in danger. Where was the real danger ever? I gave the film only 2 stars as an average between the script/plot and the acting/cast. I gave 0 stars for the script/plot - it was distasteful and lame: just too weird or too hateful and reaching for laughs but way too far past the point of being funny. I gave the acting/cast 4 stars because it was OK.Aside from rating the movie, all the efforts and length these folks went to in order to get the movie made - well, that deserves 10 stars and congratulations to them. All these other reviews giving the actual movie 10 stars, though, seem to be coming from the film makers and their friends. The clout that veterans carry can go very far, but truth be told, this movie's just not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False ratings, movie is one of the worst I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I don't really care for rating movies on IMDb I only care for looking at the ratings to determine the "quality" of the movie... to determine whether it's worth watching or not.8.5/10... That's the worst rating I've ever seen, it's so far from what the actual rating should be and honestly this is one of the biggest false ratings I've seen on IMDb and hence rating this movie 1 out of 10 to make the rating represent what the movie actual is rather than a big lie, but had the rating not been so off I'd given it 3/10 on a generous day.The movie...It tries to be comedic, but it fails. I actually can't see how somebody could think that the "funny" acts in this movie would be funny...I would give myself a medal of honor for enduring this movie.Let's be honest, even if people had a weird and twisted sense of humor, at best the rating would be 4-5 out of 10, but 8.5 out of 10?I understand people like to falsely rate movies when the crappy movie has their favorite actors in them and all that but I actually truly don't understand 8.5/10 with over 2k+ ratings...EDIT: Going through the "reviews" I had to come back and edit my "review"... I don't actually know what to say other than that this pisses me off, crappy movie gets good ratings because of idiots meanwhile really good movies get crappy ratings because of idiots.I... got... no... words... to... explain... what... this... is...This was more of a rant than a review but rating a movie for any other reason than rating the movie angers me, that's not what the rating system is for...EDIT2: Would be nice if IMDb had a mass "block/ignore" option that you can use to ignore future ratings by people who voted a certain movie above 5, that way in the future you wouldn't watch another movie rated 8+/10 that sucks and confuses you for a whole hour and makes you question What The Actual Fu...dge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the only real review since I don't believe others are. A lot of first time reviewers, making the rating seem fishy... This movie is a piece of crap - literally! I walked away after 40 minutes. The acting is probably the worst I've seen in years. Those people can't act at all. I mean, there are people who can't act and then there are these "actors" who make people who can't act look like movie stars...The story is old and pretty stupid. Just boring. camera work is bad. Seem very amateurish. Seems like it's made by people who used to make b-rated music videos for no-name actorsCGI is from 1992. I get that it's low budget,but I've seen better cgi effects on "HOW TO videos on YouTube". Don't believe me, check those out. They aren't that hard!Dialogs and scrips is beyond horrible. Jokes are not funny though they are trying hard. hey, if you really liked this movie, try "tree of life" I watched that one in 2011 and this is comparable to the nonsense, though I managed to sit through 1 hours of that movie and only 40 minutes of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Movie. Not worth the bandwidth to pirate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a zombie movie written by the crack writing team behind Sharknado 4 (with Ann Coulter and a couple of drunk marines consulting) and you won't be too far off from what you get in this movie. There are some almost-fun raunchy moments and a few things that come close to crossing over into 'so bad it's good territory', but it never manages to clear that threshold because all the fun is sucked out by military in-jokes and "hurr durr libtards, amirite?" meta-commentary. This movie stays laser focused on a very small target audience. If you're a military vet that owns a MAGA hat and listens to conservative talk radio, this movie is for you (and only you). I can't really recommend it to anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ratings are misleading - awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first spotted this movie, I took a look at its score here on IMDb, and found it to be a 8/10. Thinking that I had finally found a horror comedy movie that could match (or even exceed) some of my all- time favorite movies, zombieland or Shaun of the dead, I was excited to go see it. I was very wrong. This movie has the worst acting I have ever seen filled with cheesy jokes and an awkward feel throughout, average sets and props with items and locations I could find myself, and a straight forward plot. The reviews given are false, and are not truthful to the quality of this movie. I am not certain, but I believe these reviews are from a screening where they were told to rate it highly, or possible these were simply people working on the movie itself. Either way, not worth watching what-so-ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond bad, and not in a funny way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies can be bad in a funny way, we all get that. But then there's the odd few that are just so painfully bad, you have to ask yourself what the hell just happened. Putting aside the fact who made it and why, a movie still has to carry itself to the end. I find it hard to grasp how anything like this is even worth the time and money spent. There's no real acting, jokes are exceptionally bad, to the point I had to skip-watch more than half of the movie. How this abortion gets anything above a 1-2 star is really beyond me. No doubt IMDb's rating system is flawed to the point it's no longer even half-functioning. I've seen better films made by 8:th graders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to preface this that I am an active duty soldier with 7 years in special operations. I thought that being in the military this comedy would resonate with me. This was absolutely terrible. Nothing about this movie was funny. I thought there would be a good amount of team room humor in this movie. It failed to live up to expectations. I related to absolutely nothing this movie tried to play up as comedy.I gave it a 3 because it was just barely enough to keep my attention. this was more in part bc i wanted to see how the fucktardery was going to end. The sponsor plugs were absolutely annoying and definitely added to the poor quality of the film.i would watch Sharknado again over this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's actually getting a -10. Its so terrible I find myself laughing every now and then, but in a nervous tick kinda way...like its somehow changing me into a lesser human being whilst sucking my will to live! I got real excited when I saw the rating...and some of the cast like the lone survivor (the actual guy...not Mark Wahlberg) and Ron Jeremy but these are just crappy cameos and the rating has clearly been cooked by the indigogo crowdfunders along with patriotic ex-military vets who think they are funny.Bad writing, bad acting, infantile plot and incredibly poor production quality...the kids in super8 where doing a better job. This looks like something I made for fun with my mates and my moms camcorder when I was 12.It worries me to think at some point these guys where actually marines making life and death decisions on other peoples behalf but perhaps they should have stuck to that.Do not watch...you have been warned...and I'm only 51minutes in. It's supercrap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I will begin by stating that I was fooled by the high rating for this movie, so decided to watch it with my fiancé at the weekend. At first, I thought it was some sort of joke, I love horror comedies and zombie movies but this has to be the unfunniest thing I have ever seen in my life. Tommy Wiseau's "The Room" is like a masterpiece compared to this! It is not funny in the slightest, the acting is horrendous and it is just unwatchable. I switched off after 30 minutes, I just couldn't waste any more of my time, and I've watched some terrible movies in my time that I was at least able to sit through.In short, this movie is UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE in every conceivable way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER :p For those of you that wrote all the negative reviews about how terrible the movie was, guess what the movie probably wasn't written for you. For those of you that talk about how this move was only written for a particular sect of military veterans and it's focus is just for those guys that are combat arms, guess what, you're right. How about those of you that complain about all the non-politically correct things they say and do in the movie and how they've "alienated" a large portion of their audience, guess what, they didn't intend for that "audience" to watch the movie anyway.This movie is about a camaraderie that you only find between brothers and sisters that have been through some pretty FUBAR situations and come back to talk about it. This movie was someone's dream and guess what, veterans like me not only felt a part of it but helped make it a reality. This movie is for folks like us that get each other because we've been in the same situations and we've told the same disgusting jokes and done the same disgusting things and although you may not find it funny, it's our way of communicating to each other that we've got each other's backs.So yeah, the humor is off and definitely not politically correct, but hey nobody forced you to watch it. I would have liked to have seen some more zombie interaction but hey, when you make a movie you can only cram so much stuff into 2 hrs so I get it... Thanks Matt Best and Nick Palmisciano for all the hard work and putting a smile on my face!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently We're Not In On The Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Range 15 Review. I sat down to watch Range 15 expecting a good laugh. I mean who could resist an action comedy with zombies. That's a sure winner right? The film just starts immediately, with the main character (a Sean William Scott clone) and his lawyer (William Shatner, what are you doing in this?) telling him why he ended up in jail. We are immediately shown a string of funny and insane jokes in a bar from shooting fellow pals to making out with a Keisha transvestite. OK we're getting the tone now. The film then goes on to introduce the heroes friends, a bunch of army misfits that constantly slag each other and tell non- stop homophobic jokes. One of them has a blow up doll attached to him, why? never explained. Actually nothing is explained, after a few jokes that you don't get you start to think that maybe this is a sequel, I missed something. So after checking IMDb to see if the star of the film was related to Sean Scott Williams I discovered that he makes a Youtube show and you have to have been watching the Youtube show to get most of the jokes in this film. Then the bizarre happens and keeps happening. People pop up every now and then that you have no idea who they are and they're all pals with the gang of zombie killers. They crack jokes we don't get and have conversations we don't understand. Then you realize they are all army veterans and that this is a film made for army veterans, by army veterans and you have to be an American army veteran or enthusiast to get most of the jokes. So they just alienated 90% of the audience right there. Another problem with this film is the constant homophobic jokes, one goes so far as to simulate a gay threesome and the gang fall around laughing because gay sex is hilarious and being gay makes you less than human and a laughing stock according to this film. One female character actually asks one of the team (who she constantly calls fat when he is not fat at all) does he know that 90% of what he says are infantile homophobic jokes to which he proudly responds yes and that's all you're gonna get from us, and the whole film. We can all laugh at things and ourselves every now and then but my god this film never lets up with the homophobic jokes, it's like Don't Ask Don't Tell is still in place and it's 1955. After a bizarre scene where the team enter a town and kill some cartoon caricature gay people that are peeing on the American flag, some hipsters(?) and fitness enthusiasts, they enter a house where everyone has committed suicide with knives and house hold objects The joke here is that whiny liberal ant-gun people needed guns to kill themselves during the zombie apocalypse, no sleeping pills or other meds in the house then. So that's basically the theme and message from the film, it's made for right wing, conservative army people and no one else. The film did have potential and some really funny scenes but was ruined by an overkill of crude offensive humour and army in jokes. The rivalry between the hero and his nemesis, a golden boy soldier that everyone loves and admires but is a complete jerk had lots of potential but only lasted a few scenes, then dissipated into nothing. This could have been the main focus of the film, his rivalry with this guy during the zombie apocalypse. There's also a very funny scene with Sean Austin flying a helicopter. One of the team is too honest when he discovers he has been bitten by a zombie. The third act of the film dissolves into a surreal wrestling match with lots of gay and 'in' army jokes, it drags on for about fifteen minutes and Danny Trejo turns up to fight as well, but I was bored to death at that stage. Range 15 is a bit like going out for the night and meeting your friend's drunk old buddies that tell lots of 'in' jokes and tell old stories that you know nothing about. You laugh along at first, but then they get a lot more drunk and start insulting people. You get uncomfortable and worried while they carry on the abusing people, and you have to apologize for their behavior. You can't wait for the night to end. When it does you avoid your friend like the plague and change your number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BYE US, F YOU. Finally a movie for VETS (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all. When I read the negative reviews it is quite obvious that: 1. Most didn't watch the entire movie 2. None of you lames know a vet personally (pogs maybe) 3. You're trying to compare it to either high budget military movies and/or zombie movies. This movie is not either of those. You missed the joke entirely and that's OK. BECAUSE IT WASN'T MEANT FOR YOU From the start it was great. Everyone knows that the hardest part of the zombie apocalypse is going to be trying to hide how excited you are. Every joke was on point to anyone that speaks that language. I probably haven't smiled as much during a movie in my entire life. There may have been a few jokes I missed but I'll watch it again and catch them. The challenge coins and pt belt scene was absolutely fantastic. Kudos to Fighter and the Kid for that. This is an absolute must own film. It is great to see this kind of movie get made and I hope people take notice. I'm tired of the essence of Veterans being missed in movies. Thank you for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had hopes for this. Danny Trejo is enjoyable even in his worst movies, and laughing at William Shatners acting ability is always great fun, making almost any movie tolerable. Not this time. The only funny thing in this 'comedy' was this: I watched for a bit not knowing anything about this, and noticed how awful these guys were acting as soldiers. I wondered 'Did they even bother hiring a consultant? No soldier would EVER say that or hold themselves in this and that manner.' So I come to IMDb to see how low it's score really is, and find it's rating 8+ and made almost entirely of/by veterans. I'd rather watch a Kirk Cameron flick instead of finishing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Id like to start off by saying this movie was created by veterans with a very limited budget. So I can agree with some of the other reviews about how the CGI wasn't great but it really is a funny movie. I personally enjoyed it mainly because of the humor which isn't for some people (like the reviewer confirmeddeath who's points where "the rating system is stupid so im going to bitch about it but not explain why there was any issue with the movie"). That's off topic though I just wished too address it. Anyways the movies plot was the average zombie movie plot with a small twist that helps make it interesting. Also they make fun of the plot itself a bit and how cliché it is which was also funny. What is probably the movies thriving factor its comedy which is NOT for everyone. If you are the type of person who is easily triggered then just watch another movie. If you don't mind some dirty humor and have a few hours to spare then I would defiantly recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is to not be taken seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you watch this movie realize it's a satire of the Hollywood industry and the current political situation. It's supposed to be a bad movie. It's made entirely from donated funds. It's supposed to have bad acting and awful effects, it's a solid movie once you realize that it's suppose to be awful. It's made for the jokes and laughs. Don't take it seriously or you won't like it. Come into the movie with the attitude of a spoof movies and it's not bad at all. I could compare it to a combination of a vulgar scary movie and a spoof movie. The plot isn't completely coherent, as it has some holes; therefore the 9 star rating, but like previously stated its not meant to be a multi-million dollar movie it's a bad movie and it's supposed to be that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The only thing this movie and it's current reviews, was confirm that American's have to many dumb ex military people with an awful taste." - Previous reviewer. I'm a veteran and served overseas. I am now also a medical professional. I mustn't be that 'dumb', but I digress.. These types of reactions are EXACTLY why they made this video. I mean, if they had the fortitude to stay through the entire show they would have heard Nick, who quite literally said this movie is NOT for, and will not be understood, by the vast majority of the public. In fact, he has said that they created this movie specifically for veterans. For all intents and purposes, I would assume that most people do not know who these actors/veterans are, aside from the star-studded cast. I'll leave this point here and you can make your own assumptions: you don't get people like William Shatner for "1/10"-type films...Sure, the acting isn't professional. But you know what? This is the first film that 90% of these people have been involved in. So, give them a break if your elitist mindset cannot fathom any respectable acknowledgment of their performance. For the naysayers: if you find yourself not understanding the 'in-jokes', then turn around and thank someone behind you who's bearded and laughing his ass off. Chances are you probably don't understand this film as much as you don't understand why sitting in a muddy hole on the top of some cold mountain while dodging 7.62mm was some of the best times of his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of article 15 and Mat Best's videos pretty much since they started. So naturally I was excited for the movie. However, I'm not going to bs you guys, and say it was the best movie ever. I felt like the movie was over-hyped for a few reasons. First of all I didn't see anything that was disturbing, or offensive. So I don't see why it couldn't get a R eating. Second if I were to look at this as a serious movie then it would probably get a lower rating. The story was felt rushed and was all over the place. It didn't really go deeper into any back stories, explaining why certain things were the way they were, etc. However, i think the movie was not meant to be taken seriously. It's like Sharknado, but for veterans. So looking at it from that perspective is why I gave it a six with a five being average. Most of the action was already shown in the trailer so there really wasn't anything new in the film. I'm also an Air Force vet so most of the military specific jokes were lost to me. I think they were just things that applied to the Army, which is fine (most of the cast and audience is army). I just didn't find the humor in them. With that being said I would gladly donate to their second movie and buy a ticket to see it.</fullReview>

If you're a liberal with no sense of humor that hates America, bacon, guns, women, freedom, whiskey and bacon you should probably ignore this one and pretend it never happened. I heard more audience laughter at this than in any other movie I've ever seen in a theater by far. If you're not sure just go find any of the mBest youtube videos. If you enjoy the humor in those it's basically the same stuff in a movie format. BTW Stay after the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a movie for us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this in Lincoln, NE. F**KING AMAZING!!!!! I don't always laugh out loud (or as my son pointed out on the way home, "lol") during movies I find funny, but I literally roared with laughter throughout the whole movie. It has been hailed as THE "Movie By Vets for Vets". It lives up to this in every way imaginable. Forget the Hollywood versions of what civilians think we are or the tamed down versions of us with our extended families... This movie is us, hanging out with us, in ALL our uncensored glory! Make sure you stay past the credits for an additional scene and a "making of". Thank you Ranger Up Military and MMA Apparel and Article 15 Clothing for making this movie. I am hoping for a blu ray to buy for my collection; it will have THE honored place amongst the other blu ray/dvds I own as well as in my heart. I am also waiting for their next adventure; may it be soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The theater was supposed to have a line just for this showing. There was NO Mistake from the parking lot, who was coming to see the movie. I have never been able to walk on up to a line of folks and feel right at home.As a veteran, I have never felt more comfortable in a crowd of people at the movie theater. 90% Vets. Men, Women, Young, Old.This movie is made for Vets. They pull gags that only Vets will get. They even have service specific gags. I enjoyed the heck out of it.Oh. Stay for the entire credits!!!!Great job guysAnd thank you for making a movie FOR ME.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By veterans, for veterans... You've been warned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this clothing company coming up with another movie about the zombie apocalypse, I rolled my eyes. But my hubby was very interested, so I figured why not.As things got rolling, I found myself more drawn to the sick, twisted humor that permeates the military. And so, last night, I found myself in a theater for the special screening. I was one of about 5 females in the audience.And then all of my expectations were stomped on and stuffed inside a Velcro blow-up doll. The references to real life, the blatant showing of sponsors' gear, the larger-than-life personalities all coming together and perfectly meshing. And that over-the-top humor I've come to know and love.There were a lot of references that the average person might not get, like PT belts and challenge coins. All in all, though, I'd say that this movie is going to have a massive cult following!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother of God! This movie is not only amazing it should be an Oscar contender. Mat Best and Nick Palmisciano took this movie by the balls and made sure they had you from beginning to end. This is such a huge and well put together cast. Keep in mind this is no cookie cutter movie, when they came up with this idea they broke the mold. Ross Patterson was nothing short of G.I. Joe in this movie and not only did he try and steal the show but he directed the damn thing! I will be going back for more because once is never enough!If you have a chance to see this movie and you were in the military you will feel right at home, if you haven't had a chance to accomplish anything with you life other then trying to cure cancer then this movie just may offend you? But guess what? This movie doesn't give a damn about your precious little feelings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely what the veteran community needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I created an account on here for the sole purpose of reviewing this movie. I ventured into the nearby city (which doesn't happen often) and saw Range 15 last night with a couple of good friends. Myself and my SO are military veterans, our friends are not. I don't go to the movies often, but I've been following this one since it was announced, and it did not disappoint. Was it a blockbuster? Absolutely not. Was it something the veteran community needed? Definitely. It was like South Park and the Walking Dead had a love child. Range 15 is one of those movies where you can turn your brain off for a while and just laugh. The movie even makes fun of itself. It was made by veterans for veterans, so if you need "safe spaces", "trigger warnings", "a safety blanket", believe in political correctness, can't handle lots of cussing, have never really been around military, are under 18, can't handle dark humor, don't like violence, can't handle extremely inappropriate jokes, are a cross-fitting vegan or a hipster, then this movie is not for you.Nothing is left untouched and I laughed so much! I'm going to have to watch it again because I missed some lines from all the laughter and clapping from the audience. This is definitely going in my media collection when it comes out on streaming or DVD. They turned Hollywood on its head and showed that crowd funded entertainment can work.Our friends actually gained an understanding of our dark humor and they enjoyed the film even though some of the in-jokes went over their heads. It was fine though because for the most part, they were laughing as hard as us. As Adam Lineman from Maxim wrote, "If you've ever attended a PETA protest and/or enjoy the smell of patchouli, prepare to hate the *beep* out of this film."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is unfiltered unapologetic and unrefined. Just like me. I gladly helped fund this piece of veteran shenanigans. The idea behind this movie is unreal. The movie itself is unbelievable. I'm biased because I'm a retired Marine. But my civilian friends that watched it with me loved it. It's so over the top it's in the outer atmosphere. The crew that made this movie are unbelievably talented. The film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the screen goes dark at the end. If you are a veteran you need to see this movie. If you are not go take a vet to see this movie. They will explain most of the jokes. I sincerely hope we spread this movie to the civilian world to show what vets can do. See this movie! And to quote Mat Best. Freedom the f&amp;@k on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie America's Military Needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilarious, irreverent, and ridiculous - I loved this movie! The central characters perfectly capture the feelings I've seen in all of my military friends: frustration with rampant inefficiency, discomfort at being called a hero, rage at people who disrespect the flag, and a fierce, unwavering loyalty to our country. It's not every dark comedy that has a patriotic sing along in the middle of the zombie apocalypse.Range 15 is full of inside military jokes that the average citizen probably won't understand, but that veterans and their families will love. My personal favorite one-liners were, "Challenge coins are like POG kryptonite," and, "It's spreading faster than herpes in a Fort Bragg barracks!" There were quite a few times in the theater when witty one-liners sparked spontaneous applause and Leadslingers toasts.You don't have to have served time to appreciate this movie, but it certainly helps. And seriously, stop thanking veterans for their service - they hate that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the year!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movie last night in Eau Claire, and I can honestly say it was the best movie this year. Yeah it's dark and gritty, but I laughed so goddamn hard I thought I might die. The characters and their antics in this movie are extremely exaggerated, but that only added to the gutbusting comedy. On top of that, it was awesome to see all these vets come together and turn this crazy idea into a flesh-and-blood film (especially one where the uniforms, medals, and other minor details are actually accurate). Aside from the comedy, this film was stuffed to the rafters with big name stars who love this country and wanted to see that a movie made for veterans by veterans got it's chance to reach audiences Big thanks to all the guys and gals at Ranger Up and Article 15 who made this kickass movie possible. The post-credits scenes were also a great addition, and as someone who is going to boot camp next week, it made me proud to be joining the family. Thanks for the awesome movie, guys! HOOYAH!!!</fullReview>

It will reach down into your soul and drag out every little piece of Merican spirit it can find. You'll spend the whole god damn time with a raging freedom boner hard enough to fight back insurgents (or zombies) and you will laugh until you explode red, white and, blue.Post-apocalyptic zombie action/comedy... what more can I say. While there are certainly other zombie movies out there, Range 15 manages to reach a level all of it's own. There's nothing else quite like this that's for sure.</fullReview>

From meeting people on the street, and just "knowing" who they were, and then actually seeing the movie, was very special. I was in hysterics, as was the whole theater. This is one of those movies that you will watch 5x and see something that you may have missed the 1-4th time, LOL. I had an absolute blast, and to see how the veterans, and current serviceman and women made light of themselves, was fantastic. This is an INSTANT CULT CLASSIC. I loved it, and i am sure that most people with some sort of sense of humor will enjoy it. Thank You to all the people involved in this movie. You all did a great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will set the bar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that will set the bar for many movies to come. As an indie movie, it contains a level of professional polish that will be hard to meet by other indie movies. As a movie written by veterans and acted by veterans, you get humor that will never be reproduced accurately by Hollywood. There were scenes that resonate with the military community that would absolutely mystify the civilian world, but we just laughed and enjoyed it. (ie any scene involving an LT who thinks he is running things or the overpowering need that ring-knockers have for giving motivational speeches) As a zombie movie, there was a level of realism that most zombie movies shy away from. Did that zombie have nos legs? As a matter of fact it didn't. Did that zombie look like it had been caught in a fire? As a matter of fact it did. Using wounded military veterans in scenes like these was genius! I look forward to ANYTHING this group puts out in the future.</fullReview>

There were parts in this movie that had the audience laughing hard enough that we missed lines so I may have to go back and see it again (although I probably will be laughing through the same lines again). No one and nothing was off limits and that made it even more enjoyable. The terrible acting just added to the hilarity, but there were a few scenes where the acting was almost... good. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because there were a few lines that were spoken so quickly I couldn't understand what was being said, but I'd see it again.

Even though the theater was as hot as an armpit in Fallujah, I felt a camaraderie that I haven't had since I left the military 5-years ago. Not only did I wake up the following morning with a freedom boner, but my beard had grown 3 inches and I banged my GF in her "safe space". The acting was horrible, the plot was thin and the jokes were raunchy. Everything I am looking for in a low budget horror movie. Thanks guys for giving us vets something that reminds us of how it was to be in the military. Hollywood had better be careful, vets are ready to take over the film industry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The vets at Art15 and Ranger Up have made what will be a cult classic. They have taken on and mocked and satirized every overplayed and corny aspect of most every military themed movie ever put out by Hollywood. Their ability to make excellent use of breaking the 4th wall, usually to take a shot at themselves, was always worth a laugh. Especially side-splitting is their constant aversion to political correctness and valiant use of terms and statements only heard in the military, most especially in "the man village" while deployed. With no apologies ever indicated or necessary to their target audience. (Light go out, room goes dark.."NOW WE CAN PLAY GUESS WHO'S IN MY MOUTH!"-something not heard since I left the sandbox.) The performances and willingness to take a shot at themselves or belittle each other by Medal OF Honor recipients and vets who have lost limbs was awesome to see as those of us who may know these types of veterans know, they have a sense of humor regarding this and will run with it. In the end it was an incredible feeling to know how quickly this project was supported and to see the reactions of men and women who have been waiting enthusiastically for this release. I could go on, but it would be giving the whole damn thing away. Everyone in the theater walked out happy and proud.</fullReview>

However, lets just say that one scene with that one thing OMG HILARIOUS! Final thoughts, those in and out of uniform will bust a gut.

You may feel bad laughing at some of the jokes, but it's actually okay to laugh at them. Nothing is spared in making you feel uncomfortably funny. It was so awesome to see it with a huge crowd of veterans. Is it gory? Yes, but it's over the top gore and violence not something that makes you feel bad. Its like hanging out with your buds. You know that some of the things you joke about are wrong but you still do it. This is the same thing only on a wider scale.

Outstanding film that isn't your regular "Hollywood-thriving-for-awards-appease-everyone" run of the mill movie.

		<shortDescription>A movie that is brilliant on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations. After months and months of build up and hype, I expected the movie to be amazing. I did not expect it to be such an exceptionally epic piece of comedic, heart-felt storytelling that grabs you by your ball strings and doesn't let go. I was expecting a lot of comedy with some commentary on how Hollywood-produced military movies inaccurately portray the military. While that was all there, the movie goes even further to have a spectacular plot which isn't furthered by the standard Hollywood tropes for moving plot along. The film drops several insightful and hilarious truth bombs about military and post-military life. It has a lot of commentary on how veterans and the military are perceived/portrayed. But more than just commentary, the film has a very strong message about the strength of the bond of the veteran community seen by the interaction between every one of the characters. The great thing about these characters is that while Mat Best is somewhat the main character of the story, he doesn't outshine the rest of the cast. Everyone had a major contribution to the theme of the film. The individual parts of the movie are unbelievably hilarious, but when you step back and look at the overarching theme of the movie, it really is a well-told story about how veterans are so much more than what society labels them as. The featuring of so many well-known veterans, brilliant comedy, exceptional plot, strong message, and quotable lines make this movie the best military movie that I have/will ever see until the sequel.</fullReview>
