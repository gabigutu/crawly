		<shortDescription>Werner at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky to see this at Sundance with one of the best audiences. Somehow, even after Werner's extensive resume, this was his most immersive and informative documentary yet. The film doesn't just touch on the basic history and fundamentals of the Internet, but provides such a deep understanding of its past, present, and future. It dives into the wonders of what is possible while carefully reminding us about its dangers, all while Werner gives a very comedic voice-over. It's a shame that Roger Ebert isn't around to view this film. I know he would've been proud of his friend for creating such an accomplishment in documentary filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing survey of the best and the worst of the Internet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film at the SF Film Festival. I thought it was excellent. It was far better than I expected. I am not a tech person and assumed I would not really appreciate the subject matter. I only went to see it because I usually enjoy Herzog films and figured I would give it a chance. Wow, it kind of blew my mind to see the range of material that was covered. I was quite impressed that he managed to cover such a large canvas and each segment was fascinating. He created 10 segments, each focusing on a different perspective on tech. I really liked the fact that he started from the beginnings of the Internet and interviewed many of the earliest key people involved. This record of their experiences makes the film an invaluable document of history. I also really liked the fact that he confronted some of the very serious problems that the Internet has created in our world and didn't just focus on the wonderful aspects. Definitely check out this film, whether you love the Internet or hate it, there is great stuff here to ponder....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best documentaries I've seen in a while!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting how Werner Herzog doesn't even own a cell phone, but his examination of the Internet can be more smart, unique, terrifying, entertaining, weird, and funny than anyone else's."Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World" is Werner Herzog's latest documentary film, and it takes an extraordinary look at the Internet. There's plenty of screen time given to both how it affects humans, and the science behind it all. There's hackers and robots, as well as stories about Internet addiction and abuse. There's comedy, tragedy, horror-and it's all real, and it's really, really fascinating. Sometimes when a film covers a lot of material it becomes overwhelming, and tonally all over the place, but Herzog manages to balance everything just perfectly so the whole film works very well and never feels like too much.There's plenty of fun to be had watching "Lo and Behold". It's not just an average, boring science documentary, it's a genuinely entertaining movie. Some of the most fascinating people you'll ever see are interviewed, and they tell some of the most fascinating stories you'll ever hear, and it's all filled with humor and, at times, even absurdity. It's fun to watch, and it will make you think. There's plenty of questions raised that are amazing, and there's plenty raised that are scary. It's a movie unlike any other I've seen be released this year, and it will blow your mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lo And Nothing To Behold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May include spoilers. If you truly want to understand something of the history of the Internet and how it has influenced human civilization this documentary is not for you. I so wanted to be impressed...but this came off more like a Sarah Palin speech than a deep examination of the subject. Perhaps if each of the ten segments had been given an hour there would have been some meat to devour. As it's presented however, it's a huge fail. "Does the Internet dream?" Well, no. stupid question. Next? And what does A. I. or robotic technology have to do with the Internet? Altogether unrelated issues. Cyber security, a very significant topic was given a mere 15-20 min segment. Last, the segment about the California family who sued the Highway Patrol for posting photos of their daughters horrific car accident on line was just bizarre. The mother accused the Internet of being the anti Christ, while the living daughters acted like zombies in the interview. Yes, they were sent disgustingly insensitive emails by total strangers which is a very sorry happening, But the internet is a mere projection of humanity at large. There is good. There is bad. It's not the Internet that is responsible...it's people.I spent $7.99 to watch this on Amazon video. I suggest saving your money.Sent from my iPhone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining and thought provoking, but aimed at a general audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As another reviewer pointed out, this documentary lacked somewhat in depth, mostly due to the sheer number of topics covered (I believe there were 10). That's quite a few for a 98 minute work, so don't expect a terribly lengthy discussion on any one topic. Nonetheless, I thought it was highly entertaining with plenty of dry, computer nerdy humor while also managing to squeeze in enough serious commentary to make this overall a very thought provoking documentary. Each topic is (obviously) related to the internet and what has developed from and within it, and each topic is covered primarily through interviews with experts in various fields (for many of the experts interviewed, their enthusiasm for the subject is palpable and quite endearing), with a few breaks for personal interest stories related to a given topic. For the most part, the topics are covered in chronological order. To me, the early days of the internet, artificial intelligence, and the "internet of me" were the best sections, but all were worthwhile. The sections on AI and "the internet of me" in particular really make you wonder what the world will look like in 20 or 30 years. It's difficult to think of another invention or innovation that has changed society as pervasively or as quickly as the internet has. This film does a nice job of capturing that recent history and imaginatively foreshadowing what might be just around the corner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome documentary and a humorous tale of Science fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie.Werner Harzog created a humorous and insightful documentary, about the internet, from it's birthplace to the possibilities of were it will take human evolution.It's a very raw documentary on the subject. it feels like Harzog is not taking the more popular road with the story of the internet. Though he does interview key people in the growth of it, it's interesting that people like Mark Zukerberg are not interview. It's the basics of what the internet can do for man kind, which is possibly why he choose to interview a company that created a game that allows people to learn how to manipulate DNA and see those results be created in real life, to possibly better mankind's knowledge (the original purpose of the internet) Elon Musk is possibly the most mainstream name that appears in the film as Harzog uses him to take a look at the possibilities of using the internet on other planets, as the creator of PayPal uses his private space company to give insight.The film also goes over some people who the internet has not effected well, from a loved one's death going viral, to people who have become physically ill do how the use of the internet has change the world.Harzog masterfully takes the content seriously with positive and negative feed back on the internet going from the every day mundane to the rarely far fetch. I love how straight up the whole thing is and how Harzog's voice over makes it feel like a futuristic Science fiction tale about how the internet and robots fit into human evolution (which is what it its) I only seen two of Harzog's documentaries, the other being the Cave of Forgotten Dreams and from seeing these two I got to say he knows how to keep my interest in his recording of science.Excellent work!http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>
