		<fullReview>and I can say with some certainty that Jeff Nichols has a heck of a career ahead of him.To be frank, after your first 1000 or so IMDb reviews, you get a bit cynical. You start to understand that, in spite of the hype, movies are not as good as they used to be -- more like production-line white-bread, all mapped out and pre-sold into the appropriate distribution channels before the first viewer ever even gets a look -- and that in the same time period, TV has come to surpass film in terms of quality and entertainment value.And then every now and then you get a film like Midnight Special and for a brief moment you start to think this medium might someday recapture its glory days.I am not going to tell the story or do anything which will diminish your experience, should you choose to see this film.I will simply say that, if you believe the primary goal of a movie is to hold your interest and entertain, this one does the job from the first frame to the closing credits.Boy is that refreshing! The actors -- not name actors -- were excellent.The special effects were mind-boggling, especially for an indie.The script breaks (or bends) some rules of conventional narrative but otherwise is so tight you could use it for a drum solo.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Disappointing SF Film Mashup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's partially the casting, partially the direction sinking this film. Mostly it's a script cobbed together from "ET," "Starman," a dash of "CE3K," the Superman legend, "Village of the Damned," and generic child-in-jeopardy tale. That's the most amazing, and disappointing, aspect of "Midnight Special" - that the creative and original Jeff Nichols wrote a shamefully derivative script filled with plot holes large enough to fly a mothership through.After a compelling first act, "Midnight Special" turns into a boring chase/race-against-time story of an extraordinary, luminous boy with 'powers and abilities far beyond that of mortal men' sought by the Feds and a cultish church who venerate him because he speaks coordinates in tongues. This boy comes from "a world-on-world" whose inhabitants watch over us. (Given the state of the world, they're doing a crappy job.) The explanation tracks more like angels from another dimension than aliens.The boy, played by Jaeden Lieberher, fails to create sympathy through all the chaos. The wonderful Kirsten Dunst has never been more wasted in a placeholder role as the boy's mom. Shannon is his hulking father. Edgerton only serviceable as a tag along State Trooper. They dodge bullets on a lumbering path to specific Florida coordinates where the boy has a date with destiny; the merging of dimension X and our pitiful dimension. Other luminous beings spirit the boy away and POOF - the convergence disappears. Big deal! A most unsatisfying and anticlimactic end that does not inspire the wonder the special effects technicians hoped it would despite Mom's mugging at the otherworldly architecture.It might occur this is a Jesus allegory with a 'birth' of a messiah from common parents. There's not a glimmer of that (save some 'fire from Heaven'). Early on, there was promise of social commentary about our over-surveilled lives. Nope. That's not present either. Also lacking, commentary about people steeping in religious fervor to fill absences in themselves. The church members, including Sam Shepherd, are caricatures. "Midnight Special" adds neither subtext nor exposition to a story begging for some. Even the title derived from the song doesn't track. "Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me." Okay, he did shine light, but the Feds - after everyone within a hundred mile radius sees the other world - still prosecute and jail Dad and the Trooper. That we're deaf, dumb and blind in a mysterious Universe is not a lot to be left with after two hours.Too much mystery ruins a film - the slight flash of light in Dad's eyes at fade out an example. Without context, too much mystery makes "Midnight Special" an uncooked, epic misfire in this dimension or any other. Give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully filmed movie, with outstanding photography and good acting. The way the story is delivered is also very smart: the start creates quite a lot of intrigue and mystery as you don't really understand what is happening, and where the whole thing will go. Then the ending solves beautifully these tensions, it is quite an inspiring and even almost poetic finale, with very sleek shots of the extra world. So I enjoyed quite a lot this movie, though at the end I thought the story was a bit too light, I walked away with the feeling that there were quite a few questions left open and that I would have wanted to know more....like when you finish a dinner and you're still hungry....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Special is definitely Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Midnight Special, Jeff Nichols enters the pantheon of those nostalgic American filmmakers armed with their lens flares, Pandora's boxes and deeply sentimental reasons, driven by a protective father figure and a maternal relationship to the plot itself.Lately, Christopher Nolan's Interstellar walked on the same path, and in many ways Midnight Special strangely looks like Interstellar. There's always the same contrast between gigantic and local stakes/issues that can already be found in Spielberg's filmography : on one side, humanity's fate is at stake, supervised by an omnipotent government, and on the other side it is (and perhaps only) a "family affair". David Wingo's soundtrack is electrifying, the script is intelligent enough for not telling us the whole plot and characters' background in a few lines of dialogue, and despite a half-hearted performance by Michael Shannon, who still shines in its restraint, and some facilities in scriptwriting approaching the end of the film, Midnight Special is so perfectly controlled that it would be difficult to get out of the theater unscathed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unearthly Drama with an Emotional Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really came out of nowhere for me, as a comment by a stranger I overheard in a bar drew me to this, and thank you nameless stranger with impeccable taste! This is one of those sci-fi flicks that comes along every once in a while that actually has something to say without overuse of CGI and genre tropes.I knew almost nothing about Midnight Special going in other than said comment, and I highly recommend you try to do the same. Therefore I will be as brief as possible to avoid spoilers.Roy (Michael Shannon) is on the run with his 8 year old son Alden (Jaeden Lieberher) from a religious cult that worships the boy as some sort of messiah. Also in pursuit are the FBI and NSA, who are investigating several strange phenomena connected with the child. Roy enlists childhood friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) to help them get to a specific location on a specific date, the reasons for which are unclear but may involve some sort of otherworldly or cataclysmic event.The comparisons with Starman (1984) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) are apt, but this is very definitely a different movie altogether.The actors are uniformly excellent, especially Michael Shannon, who gives another intense and believable performance as a man who would do anything for his son. A bit has been made out of how the movie ends, but personally I found it a powerful emotional pay-off that I could feel in my chest, possibly due to the nostalgic feeling this film evokes.In conclusion, go see it. A thought provoking sci-fi drama with a story to tell. A good one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahoy. A solid movie, good casting good acting and the premise of a good story, some lovely shots and interesting ideas.However it sits on the line of Jesus this is becoming boring and i'll wait and see how it pans out.Pans out I should have left, not much story for the audience to stick with and so many subtle gestures and nods between cast members the tread is very very thin.The idea is interesting enough a boy with unknown special powers that the US Gov thinks they can capture him and use him as a weapon, but no reason as to why they think this.The decoding of Gov transmissions via satellites to find a location is neither explained or has any real tangible reason to be in such a location as others had been shown parts of the layered on civilization before and not at the special location.Two hours of not really knowing what the kids power or purpose was all he does some nodding/longing and barley 2 paragraphs of dialogue, stares and vanishes off into this other world he is part of.There is some average CGI to show off this world for about 60 seconds and SLAM the end.No reason as to why he needs to go / why he was afraid of day light / why the US wanted him as a weapon.An E.T idea in principle for the modern day but not very exciting and leaves all questions unanswered, if there is to be a sequel I won't be spending my money on it again. . . Average movie for a rainy day on rental, worth the cinema price NO, worth the price of a DVD possibly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Took itself way too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the earlier reviews, I almost wonder if I saw a different version of this movie! The story line was overly grandiose, took way too long to develop, and the movie would have redeemed itself in my mind only with a super profound ending ... which it did not have.The plot touched all the hot buttons: supernatural abilities, check! government conspiracy, check! one "good guy" amongst the bad gov't guys, check! religious extremists who don't understand the profound nature of the supernatural skill, check! But the narrative couldn't credibly tie it all together.I agree with some of the prior comments on beautiful photography and great special effects, but way too much was left unexplained and what was explained was not, in my mind, very special at all. I left the theatre really disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is a modern day science fiction film with a very old school feel running through its veins. Jeff Nichols has made it no secret that classic sci-fi films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind are inspirations for his film however, I find the fact that his relationship with his own son was used as an inspiration too, much more intriguing.Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) is an eight-year-old boy who possesses otherworldly powers. When his father, Roy (Michael Shannon), takes his son and flees from a religious cult, they must travel across the country to an undisclosed location on a specific date, during which a celestial and possibly world-changing event may occur.Mystery is a strong point for Midnight Special, the entire mystery surrounding Alton's powers, what will happen on that specific date and the reason a religious cult want him back, all playing a part in making the story such a captivating one. Then comes the film's climactic moment. We get answers, but they end up ruining some of the mystery that made what came before so good. Less is more definitely sprung to mind as it all unfolded.The story, written by Jeff Nichols, is a very good one and at the heart of that story is a rather beautiful relationship between a father and son. It adds another layer to the film rather than it just being a standard story about people on the run, and as mentioned earlier, it really feels like a personal film from Nichols. Not saying that his son has special powers though, so don't think that.In a rather short directorial career, Nichols has made quite a name for himself and Midnight Special should further his reputation. It's a very well made film but if there was one thing that stopped it from being great, it was the pacing. Unfortunately, this film dragged itself out through a few scenes and it really bugged me.I cannot fault the film for its performances mind. Michael Shannon possesses such a magnetic screen presence, you just can't take your eyes off him and Joel Edgerton certainly makes his presence felt, even if his role remains a little unexplained. Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver offer good support and Jaeden Lieberher is rather good as Alton. It may be that, in time, I appreciate Midnight Special more however, my initial experience warrants me to say that it's not the special film I was hoping for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With elements of Close Encounters, ET, Knowing, X-Men, The Abyss and Firestarter we have a near 2 hour bore fest with co-ordinates to nowhere and nothing to do when we get there. Who was the little boy? Who were the magic people in the sky who have no TV so watch us all the time?That is the creepiest part of it the idea that some light eyed weirdo is watching you as you attend to toilet functions and such as they have their morning honeydew and lettuce leaf.The authorities are utterly stupid as even when confronted by the blindingly obvious the best question they can come up with is about how the kid disappeared?I like Michael Shannon and Kirsten Dunst and the early scenes with them were interesting until we began to reveal what this tripe was about.So the religious set are satisfied as it's proof Jesus exist, the science boffins now know we are not alone however THEY are a bit TOO close for comfort and who knows what bit of Earth they are watching that affects your night time activity and Internet nut cases can ponder what it means until MS2 appears.Either we have to figure out a plan to destroy them or they might send another group of pointless kids for us to chase after to absolutely no purpose.Like that Cloverfield 2 rubbish a waste of 2 valuable hours and months of expectation. I said I would not fall for it again after that Cloverfield lane crap but they know you always will and I indeed did.They might have nice houses but I did not see any tanks. I recommend immediate invasion and steal their stuff especially any tapes marked 'Animals do the strangest things SE144 Blindfold Edition'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie, given it's odd title, but what a pleasant surprise. Well written, excellent acting performances all round. I couldn't fault the movie, it's well worth seeing and I hope it gets the plaudits it richly deserves. Jaeden Lieberher is going to be a star, judging by his excellent performance as Alton. I think the message is definitely about the power of parental love and the lengths we go to in order to protect our children, even in the face of insurmountable odds. This is a genre that not everyone likes, including myself, but I loved it. It definitely has a retro feel about it, whilst having an original twist. There are strong acting performances from the rest of the cast and I thoroughly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Didn't Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My spoilers are necessary to make my point.This movie leaves a heck of a lot of information out.Firstly, the movie seems to start in the middle of an ongoing story. You're left confused for at least the first fifteen minutes.Once you get enough information to realize finally what's going on, the rest of it doesn't work.Yeah. It's a kid with special powers. Mind boggling powers. Not of this Earth powers.His biological mother and father Roy and Sarah, go on the run with him being chased by a crazy fanatical religious group and of course the government. The kid tells his parents he is from another planet and he does not belong here. He has to be at a certain place at a certain time. We, being a smart audience, figure the kid needs to be there, cause his race of alien relatives, will be picking him up at this location.Unfortunately, the government figures out where the location is too and is only one step behind them at each and every turn.This is why the movie did not work (I mean if the lack of answers and information didn't already do you in).If the kid is from another planet, has powers and while looks human, isn't, HOW are those two his biological parents?How do two people from Earth, give birth to an alien kid from another planet?No. We are not supposed to come to our conclusions and figure it out in our heads. It's OK if some movies leave a smidge to the imagination, but when you make a scenario completely impossible, it doesn't mesh. If there's a big story about how two human from Earth gave birth to an alien kid, you cannot leave all of that out of a story. It's too much.The way they did this makes it sound like aliens messed with human creation and implanted their own DNA into the womb of a human here on Earth.In the movie the kid says "they've been watching us for a long time."Viewers like a beginning, a middle and an end.Bringing people into a story where you feel like you missed the first half hour, isn't pleasant. Confusion is no fun.Having dad's, mom's and alien kids who couldn't possibly be related, but are, doesn't work.Sorry. While this flick was somewhat interesting, I did not like the format, or the lack of information. Way too much was missing.Did. Not. Work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really is one of the most stupid films I have seen in a while. If you're not snooze busting after an hour you will at the least be questioning all the mistakes and attention to detail that takes place this rather dull and not very interesting movie.1) Explosion at the petrol station, the windows are blown out in the van. Next scene, the windows are fine 2) A man is on the run, its now gone national. Yet man manages to drive through a police convoy, and not only that, he has blood all over his face and top! 3) Very same man has been shot, but oh no, that very same man is fine now 4) Man in car break through barrier, bearing in mind, this is an FBI operation, barrier has 2 only two cars. These cops are so dumb that don't they think to shoot the tires, oh no, in a typical scooby fashion, they get back in the cars and chase the car. 5) So these very same dumb cops are following car with damaged steering it must be said, all the while an unknown world appears, growing bigger in front of our very eyes, but these dumb cops are so committed to solving the crime they fail to notice this happening, instead, when the car finally crashes they point guns at the car, not even looking at the miracle scenes that have just happened. 6) Almost missed this one, 1st 30 mins are focused on a cult, then you don't hear or see them again.This really is a dumb movie! I went in not knowing anything about it. I shouldn't have bothered. Its total garbage. 4 is a bit too generous of a score. But I did like some of the cinematography</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Special starts with what I though were some fairly good opening scenes, which set up the film nicely for a decent Sci Fi. However, they didn't build upon this and it quickly dwindled. They could easily have cut half an hour from this and it would be better for it. As it is, it's nearly 2 hours long and about half of that is filled with silence that adds nothing to the film. It seemed like they were just trying to fill time and the film went unbearable slowly as a result. I have to add that Michael Shannon provided one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen. I'm almost certain that his face didn't move all movie. All that and a plot that never really went anywhere, with numerous holes in it made for an incredibly painful watch. One of the most boring films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a film review guy, people often ask me what my favourite film of all time is, and it's a difficult question to answer. I have a 'head' film list and a 'heart' film list, and depending on my mood the lists can shift. However, always near the top of the 'heart' list without fail is Spielberg's 1977 original cut of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" - a film that just blew me away at the cinema on first release. Here in "Midnight Special" we have the nearest thing I've seen to a loving tribute to that classic.Our hero Roy (obviously!) played by Michael Shannon (Zod from the recent "Superman" reboots), and with help from childhood friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton), kidnap a strange light-sensitive child with strange powers from the Texan HQ of a doomsday-focused religious cult led by Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard). The child - Alden - is played really well by 9 year-old Jaeden Lieberher.Triggering a state and then nationwide manhunt, the trio meet friend and foe on their journey into an uncertain future.While most strikingly resembling "Close Encounters", the film drops in - either knowingly or unintentionally - parallels to a host of other Sci- Fi films including "Cocoon", "ET", "Tomorrowland" and "Village of the Damned". You might conclude from this comment that this is just a Sci- Fi by numbers quilt: but - while there are probably few truly original Sci-Fi stories left to define - the writer/director Jeff Nichols does succeed in ploughing his own narrative furrow in this well worked field by throwing in a road-movie smattering of "The Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" into the pot.What's refreshing in a Sci-fi movie (as was the case in the recent "10 Cloverfield Lane") is that Nichol's screnplay is intelligent enough to treat the audience with an IQ north of 100 by letting the story reveal itself. Some elements of the story (no spoilers) treat you as absurd: and then 30 minutes later there is an "Ah!" moment.The key Performances by Jackson and Kirsten Dunst are good and very touching in places. Playing the "where have I seen him before" card is Sevier, the lead scientist (why didn't he have jangling keys on his belt though?). If you give up, the answer is that he's played by Adam Driver, Kylo Ren from "Star Wars". For me though Joel Egerton particularly stands out. I've been critical of some of his performances in the past, but here he really nails it with a quiet and unassuming supporting role.David Wingo's score worked well in places, but - sorry Mr Wingo - I was hankering at some points for swelling John Williams strings!I could also be mildly critical of the cinematography by Adam Stone. Although very atmospheric, it takes the "Midnight" from the title rather literally in places: something that I can see causing difficulties for TV viewers in working out what the hell is going on in places.This is a slower paced film than many might like, but for me it perfectly balances character with mystery and action. As such it grabs at least a draft slot in my films of the year. By the way, following on from my previous review, Midnight Special has a BvS-quotient of 7.2% .... that's the percentage of this movie's budget to the budget of Batman vs Superman!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lack of imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually go to the cinema without knowing anything about the film, but this time I did. My husband said the movie is well rated so it should be worth the time and money.It was not, but let's say it helps to see what it does to a film when form/style is more important than the story. The first half of the movie gives you hope for something really original to follow. That is not the case.The timing in the movie where we get to asking ourselves "what exactly are we watching" was so obvious in the cinema, cause everybody seemed to be quietly whispering to each other: is the boy an angel?, is he Jesus? :D is he from Krypton?? The point where the father worries about what a superman comics will do to his son's imagination is quite promising. So, he is not the savior he was taught he is, he is not from another planet (presumably because his parents are sure they did not adopt him), and he needs to learn what is real. What is real? please please don't let him be from another dimension, not one right on top of this world (Earth, not the entire universe), not one where beings made of light and walking (walking!) in a most uncomfortable way are watching us and have been doing so for a long while... not a world that looks like tomorrow-land! But that is what you get, after painstakingly watching supernatural powers being described as radio powers, blue light coming from the child's eyes and giving a sense of peace to the ones he is sharing that with, kinetic powers, and only being able to go (back?) to the other dimension at a particular time and place. And a mother cutting her blonde hair but smiling because she knows she will always be special, because she conceived a child who is from another dimension and is always watching his father, through blue light shining in his eyes.An exercise in style who is supposed to be a tribute to past good sci-fi movies and ends up being a moronic parody of them. But even without being aware of any other sci-fi movie, isn't it better to have a story in a movie than merely style? If you can live with the lack of originality you might enjoy the movie. But it cleverly tricks you into high expectations and delivers so very little in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing sci-fi that treats its audience with respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, Jeff Nichols is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors working today, and I honestly believe that his movies have increasingly become better.Midnight Special starts off in the middle of the plot, and does not rely on exposition. This movie treats its audience with respect and allows them to piece together the reasons and events throughout the progression of the film. It gives just enough detail in order to understand but not too little to have no idea what is going on. We are put in the same position as the characters in this movie - where we know just as much as they do about the origin and extent of the child's powers. Although the ending is a twist that many probably do not understand, it feels deserved and does not feel out of place in the context of the movie; however, the characters probably think it is out of place, but that is because they do not have the outsider perspective that the audience does. In terms of the characters, Michael Shannon's character does feel like a father who would genuinely do this for his son (especially because he may feel as though he is making up for lost time) and the other characters are very enjoyable and feel necessary to the movie. The atmosphere and feel of the movie is amazing, and even though the plot itself sounds absurd - a father and son are on the run from religious extremists because the son possesses special powers - but it is much more than that and feels believable in its execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is trash.I'll just tell you what its about.A boy is not a boy but an alien who is inside a boy's body.That alien needs to get home and he has "super-powers".. so that's why he needs to take a car to go to the place where he can open a portal home.I mean he can literally open a portal into another world, he can start cars and shot down generators in like 1 mile radius.And he needs help.Yeah right..Such cheap bullshit.Plus they don't tell anything about the aliens, they almost don't even talk in this movie.It's just a one long shot of the boy, his father and his friends in a car driving to the "portal" spot.And then he opens a portal, which is like 500 miles wide and through the portal you can see a part of an alien world, which is basically a couple of bio-design buildings.WTF is this movie about?? I don't know.The boy left. The movie ended.OK.It would be cheaper for him to take a helicopter though. I mean the boy has such awesome powers. Just doesn't use them.Coz i think it costs like 100 000 US dollars for 1 minute of CGI.That's why they only had like 1 minute of CGI through out the movie.And the rest of the movie is just a boring ride in the car.I think such movies shouldn't exist. It's almost two hours long. It could have easily been a 5 minute short film.I insist - Don't see it. Avoid it.</fullReview>

My wife even went to bed early and told me what she figured that the ending would be, and she hit the nail right on the head. Nothing new, nothing different, except for it being a complete yawn fest.

		<shortDescription>What a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having highly regarded "Shelter", I was very much looking forward to this film. What a disappointment! A sci-fi film doesn't have to make sense to be successful, but this film seems to have no idea where it's going, and when it gets there, it's nearly laughable. And the pacing: slow, slower, slowest. This leads to the direction. First, the central character, played by an eight-year-old boy, can (understandably) not act, so the approach seems to be to have someone read each line to the boy and have him repeat the line in a deadpan close-up. And this approach is also used to hinder the performances of a wasted group of fine actors. Long close ups of faces are shot in a silent-film style. They almost scream: 'OK Kirsten, look down sadly for two beats and then look up slowly with a dawning notion that something important has just happened'. And these 'reaction' shots are dropped between live action scenes in a way that the 'reaction' takes far longer than it ever could have believably. And this happens over and over again, creating a pacing that is hard to endure. (No competent editor could have created this mess of a montage unless it was required, for some reason, by the director.) In sum, a bunch of characters do things that make no sense (slowly), then reach a 'payoff' worthy of a low-budget SyFy TV movie. Yeesh, what a dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the wit? Where's the wonder?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reminded me of a couple of films, namely Close Encounters and Starman, but with everything good about them ripped out, thrown on the floor and stamped on.What remained was an overall joyless experience as two sullen, largely monosyllabic mumbling men drove a kid with glowing eyes home for two hours. Of course they had a couple of hurdles to overcome but at no point do you think "Oh no, they're not going to get the glowing eyed kid home". Where previously films of this oeuvre have employed wit, humanity and a sense of wonder to fabulous effect the director of this sullen dross did little other than smash you repeatedly in the face shouting "I AM SERIOUS, I AM IMPORTANT" by making the repetitive turgid soundtrack blare progressively louder and louder. It was bombastic pseudo-intellectual rubbish masquerading as serious cinema.Just because everyone looks miserable and hardly anyone says anything doesn't automatically make something good. You have to have talent to pull that off and make people care about your morose protagonists despite themselves. Whereas the only comparable thing this nonsense succeeded in doing was making me like a guy from the NSA, basically because he was the only one who seemed capable of speaking in entire sentences and looking slightly interested in what was going on.I'd rather be forced to sit and watch E.T over and over again Clockwork Orange style for a week than expose myself to this inane garbage again. And I hate E.T.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write movie reviews but felt people need to be warned about this. As other people have written, on the plot and story level this movie is ridiculously stupid. A couple of examples are things like the windows being blown out of a car and in the next scene them being in tact again. An invisible city appearing and then disappearing, being witnessed by people across the entire Southwest United States (including hundreds of federal agents) then in the next scene the very same federal agents questioning one of the stars of the movie if he expects them to believe the boy woman just vanished? Then in the next scene you see the other character in a prison yard. If the film had been extraordinarily entertaining this things would be forgivable (Several David Lynch films come to mind) but it isn't. The film is slow and convoluted and you think the things that are not explained will be explained in the end. They aren't. This movie is a joke...this film will never see a theater nor should it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts all wrong,ends all wrong and in the middle just boring filler to move along the silly story that does not make much sense.It plays to much on "the mystery"and has to many sideways that are really never resolved. It looses meaning at the end because you still don't know who this kid/alien was.The performances felt made or forced but that probably has a lot to do with the way the roles were written.A lot of the actors felt type casted but especially the roles for Joel Edgerton and Reese Witherspoon felt really poor.I also think the marketing targeted the wrong group of people or fooled them into go seeing this movie. I was disappointed by it and it didn't engage me and therefor it didn't entertain me.I found the ending to be very anti climatic and it just left you with a bunch of riddles you don't wanna know the answers to.I think it's fair to say I did not like and I don't recommend it.It has some more production value than an indie movie but that's not enough if you have such a bad script or execution of it.If someone can make sense out of this movie...Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind " meets "Village of the Damned".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Special", USA, Competition.at Berlin 66: Festival Reviews by Alex Deleon: Photo: Midnight Special press conference at Berlin, with Jaeden Lieberher, child star. "Midnight Special" by Jeff Nichols, 37, his fourth feature, featuring Sam Shepard and Kirsten Dunst, Starring Nichols' regular Michael Shannon, and introducing charismatic child actor Jaeden Lieberher, 11. This is high style sci-fi kitch set in the American south with lots of nightime car chases and spooky set pieces like the bombardment from space of a gas station to demonstrate the extraordinary powers of the kid in the back seat with the shining eyes. Extraterrestial children with radiating eyes were first employed in the British sci-fi thriller "Village of the Damned", 1960, and this has since become a standard Scifi cliché to notify audiences that children who radiate optically are not Of This World. The reference to Close Encounters comes at the end when we are treated to a view of extragalactic Space City to which child with glowing eyes will return. This set which looks like a giant tangle of Mobius Strips extending to infinity was pooh-poohed by many hard nosed critics who claimed it was too kitchy. I personally liked it because it added the perfect kitch icing to what is essentially a high-kitch layer cake with style to burn. Everybody wants a piece of this kid with glowing eyeballs and amazing kinetic powers which escalate as the film proceeds. A religious cult headed by Sam Shepard, (who has the Right Stuff as a self-assured religious cult fanatic) --to connect them with God; the CIA, to use him as a Secret Weapon; and the local police on general principles, not to mention his mother, Kirsten Dunst, who just wants her child back after he is kidnapped by his feckless biological father. One tricky question: How did Kirsten Dunst (still looking good at 35) give birth Here on Earth to an Alien from a different world? -- but you don't let such trivia bother you when you're enjoying the ride, and this film is one Heckuva ride! PS: "Midnight Special" is the perfect title for a flick that is probably destined to become a cult favorite at the Midnite Movies. Alex, Hotel Alper, Berlin, Monday, Feb. 22.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's far from awful. Just... you could've (and should've) gotten more out of it, and you don't. So you're just disappointed in the end.The premise is good. This kid with strange powers/abilities that lots of people are after, with extreme prejudice if necessary. Strong performance by Shannon and Edgerton especially, and good performance by Driver. While Dunst is... well, Dunst, that's all she can deliver, I suppose.But then two problems occurred. First: the pace. It's VERY slow. I'm sure I could edit this into a one hour TV episode and deliver the same story.Second, and I hope this is not considered spoiler, because this is kind of like my opinion and everyone else could think differently: the ending only revealed the what, not the why and the implications. Okay, so you don't have to tell us EVERYTHING in details so that we can contemplate afterwards, but this is nothing. There's no hint whatsoever as to why it happened and the implications to our life and the world now that we know about it. So yeah, it ends, and that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film put together by different people whose only connection was to read the same original script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to viewing this film on DVD; but what a huge let down it is. The acting is cumbersome, really poor and wooden, worst of all the cast ? which was a tough choice - is Joel Edgerton, he played a character who I assume was meant to be a dark, solemn, but solid friend of the main character, instead he acted out (poorly) a slow, dim witted heavy, seemingly only on camera just to add some fisticuffs, stupid one liners and some cheesy emotional glances to camera as the boy, Alton was in poor health.The lead actor, the child, Alton (played by Jaeden Lieberher) was actually head and shoulders above the adult actors, he did a really good job and just about kept the viewer interested. Kirtsten Dunst did her best to keep the average level of acting above amateur dramatic standards, just. I do wonder if she must have fallen upon hard times to appear in junk like this.Sorry to seem harsh on the cast, but they really are dire.The plot; Well it wanders and wanders and basically just peters out to a wholly predicable staid and boring conclusion. No part of the story carries any weight or depth, on several occasions we flit from one scene to another neither have a link or bearing to each other or interest or relativity to the story.It appears like the film was put together by several people in different parts of the world whose only connection was to read the same original script, never communicate with each other then get the chapters edited together to make feature length film. It is so disjointed.The plot and story line are never developed to any length and the preposterous ways in which the events unfold are ridiculous. For one example; the FBI and NSA confirm to each other that they can follow the child's "heatmap" with some device or another to track him, however they never deploy that advantage again and go on a Keystone cops adventure using some kind of riddle about map co-ordinates. Why not set up the heatmap trace to keep tabs on the child - Job Done! That is just one example of many plot holes and inconsistencies that make this film a total load of rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director took this film way too seriously .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special was intriguing for a while. A sinister religious cult. Two men on the run with a weird looking kid. Potentially spooky government agents on their trail. But after a point it just fell apart completely. The serious and conflicted characters came across as phony. The film had an overtly serious vibe. I wish the director had a little more fun with the movie. I have seen another one of his films called Take Shelter, which was quite good. But like in his most famous film, Mud, Jeff Nichols needlessly elongates the narrative until we are bored to death. Midnight Special is like Stephen King's book Firestarter without any of the sinister and spooky characters.But I liked the fact that the director was trying to make a film of place - all those deserted American highways, gas stations, cafes and the small towns. He had his heart in the right place. But if only the treatment had not been so heavy handed like a Shyamalan film. The thrills and scares (apart from the attack by the satellites) were also nothing to write home about. The ending was a bit of a let down.Joel Edgerton and Michael Shannon were pretty good as the leading men. Adam Driver's character was a complete failure - it was so underdeveloped. I did not even know why the kid decided to talk to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Midnight Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actors/actresses speak in annoying monotones, the musical score is ominous, everything in frame takes itself way too seriously, and Mud's Jeff Nichols creates such a dark atmosphere making it hard to tell what's exactly going on. That's the vibe I got from 2016's Midnight Special (my latest review). In truth, "Special" is an overrated swipe of slight, sci-fi mumbo jumbo. The critics have seemed to embrace it. This one can't. Give me the less cynical, less violent E.T. or 1984's Starman as an acceptable opposition.For kicks-and-giggles, CCR's beloved tune of the same name doesn't make "Special" any more satisfying. The song is redone in the closing credits, made to be more solemn and made to be a laughable wink wink for the last hour and 51 minutes.Slow-moving yet edited prematurely with a decent enough cast (Michael Shannon, Adam Driver, and an unrecognizable Kirsten Dunst), Midnight Special doesn't exactly move you. It's a cold film, deemed strictly for the military front. Yeah there is some admirable storytelling and reasonable direction, but there's literally no background on the characters and their bellicose motivations.Here's the gist: I used "Special's" wiki page to figure out the true plot workings and discovered that this movie takes place in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. It's about a boy (or I guess alien) who has some special, unworldly powers. His dad (Roy Tomlin played by Michael Shannon) is part of a religious cult and when the people there find out about the light coming from his son's eyes (Alton played effectively by The Confirmation's Jaeden Lieberher), well Roy escapes said cult with Alton and his friend, Lucas (played by Joel Edgerton who seems to be in everything these days). An amber alert is in effect as all kinds of authorities want to arrest the two men while capturing Alton to find out what really makes him tick. Ultimately, Alton has to get to a place where he can confront other extraterrestrial hosts and be the subject of a tumulus world event to occur. If it all sounds familiar, it is. If you think this thing trades decent production values with ho-hum, appreciable momentum, well it does. "Special" was released in March with its box office take being pretty weak (6.2 million worldwide). I don't blame the average moviegoer whose word of mouth was obviously voiced.Stylish yet silly, well-intentioned yet overly dramatic, you can call Midnight Special Close Encounters of the "irrelevant" Kind. It didn't quite "shine a light on me." Rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

And, they've been watching us. And, of course, there's a religious cult tossed in and what would it be without the sneaky government also lurking about. But, we have the usual sneaky government nerdy to help out our on- the-run little alien surrogate. Doesn't require any acting; thoughtful dialogue, props, plot, effects, etc. All the studio needed were a few cheap special effects - eyes turn strange and every so often emit light - help! Finally toss out any real world elementary school science when this physically impossible alien world suddenly appears (well you could see they still use concrete construction far into alien future) and just as suddenly disappears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tough Movie to Sum Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, this is a tough movie to review. Midnight Special is the new movie from writer/director Jeff Nichols, who wowed with Take Shelter and Mud. Nichols' favorite muse, Michael Shannon, stars yet again as a father who is trying to protect his dying son from a religious cult and the government. They are traveling across the Southeastern United States in an effort to reach a location where Shannon believes something will happen that will save his son. Of course I failed to mention that his son has special powers. His eyes often glow, he can hear radio frequencies, and he can even glimpse other dimensions. All of this sounds cool, but the movie never quite takes lift off.We are about an hour into the movie before any of it makes any sense. I know Nichols was inspired by movies from the Seventies and Eighties like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Starman, but Midnight Special could have used a little more traditional exposition. While the way the movie unfolds was clearly an artistic choice, it was one that did not jive with me. On top of it all, the movie never has any fun with its premise. The aforementioned movies that Nichols was trying to emulate all had flashes of humor here and there to keep the movies engaging, and this is, for the most part, a deadly serious affair. Now this is not to say that I hated Midnight Special, I just wanted to like it a whole lot more.Every element of Midnight Special is well done. The cinematography, the music, the visual effects, the acting, it's all top notch, even the story keeps you wanting to know more even in its more languid stretches. Jeff Nichols truly is one of the more fascinating writer/directors currently working in the movie industry, and he continues to prove it here. While I had my issues with the movie, I did enjoy it, just not enough to want to see it again or to really even recommend it to a whole lot of people.As I said at the start, this is a tough movie to review, and I truly mean that. Midnight Special is the kind of movie that tries to be both art and entertainment, and I think it only succeeds on one of those levels (three guesses which one). This is not a movie that is for the casual moviegoer, but if you're a fan of art-house movies, and in particular, if you're a fan of Nichols' previous work, you will find enough in Midnight Special to justify seeing it.I give Midnight Special a 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looked to be right up my alley. Decent ratings. Sci-Fi that flew under the radar. Edgerton, Shannon... And the film really hits some super-high notes to start. Great intrigue. Great thrilling bass music just add to the tense nature of the first half of this film. 30 minutes-in, I thought this was going to be an early contender for top 2-3 of 2016... Deadpool and Zootopia sitting 1-2 right now, but I had only seen 7 films from '16."Midnight Special" is a tough film for me to review and rate. The first half is soooo strong and interesting. Real care going into the shots, the look, and the sound. And like I said it's so right up my alley. Has an 80's pace and feel, and really all the potential in the world to be a fantastic film.BUT, it fails to cover many bases in the second half. Lots of goofs, continuation issues, just huge plot holes, and too much that really doesn't make sense down the stretch. So much can be brushed-off do to the divine/supernatural arguments, but after so many plot holes open-up - you start to get tired of dismissing them with the anything's possible with this kids' abilities argument, and it all starts to weigh more and more on the viewer as the film goes on. I wanted sooo bad to love this. And I still think the film has just an amazing start. There's a Dennis Villaneuve type vibe that Nichols has going here with tense situations, sound, and effective action sequences in small doses. Many moments where I couldn't turn away, and couldn't wait to see what happened next. Still, you can't just freeze-reality this much without taking a hit in the ratings/review department.I think 7 is fair, but only a soft 7. Half-way through, I thought this was going to be a little masterpiece.Close.But no cigar.71/100the ONLY thing wrong is the plot holes... but there are many.. everything else is aces... shame.You'd like this if you liked:Starman(even), Near Dark(a touch better), ET(better), Miracle Mile(better), Invaders From Mars(just a touch below), and Firestarter(about even).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well... it's a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can hardly know where to begin with this movie, and unfortunately that doesn't mean it's interesting in any way.It starts you off cold open with a small kernel of conflict, a child abduction case and the main character is the "abductor", but all is obviously not as it seems. We are left to guess as to the exact nature of the characters and their relationship and their goal as a heap of conflict falls on their heads. And initially at least it's an intriguing premise. Unfortunately from there the movie just kind of... goes on like that. There's a lot of mystery, and not a whole lot of explanation at any point. There's a lot of characters doing things and displaying emotions, but we never learn almost anything about these characters as people, and so are never attached enough to them to actually care.In the end it just feels rather boring, a movie more obsessed with throwing questions at you then ever answering any of them, or even caring what the answers are. It's also rather poorly edited and cut, there are entire scenes that could have been excised from this movie without affecting anything. To say that there's a slow pacing, editing, and redundant scenes of a movie that's already less than 2 hours long gives you an idea of just how little there is to this movie. I'd probably stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anticlimactic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(No spoilers)I went into this movie only having watched the trailers. The cast looked interesting -- Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Sam Shepard -- and so, for once, I didn't bother with reading reviews, and instead went into the movie with no preconceived notions of what to expect. What resulted was a fairly dull and anticlimactic experience with virtually no closure. I have nothing against open endings or cliffhangers, however Midnight Special does nothing to entice and interest the viewer throughout its 2 hour run time to make the ending worthwhile.The plot is as bare bones as it gets, and remains that way until the very end - boy needs to get somewhere, big bad government wants to stop him.There was just enough intrigue throughout the movie that I held on, hoping for something to happen, be it some kind of revelation, or at the very least, more information about the boy, however it never happened.There are far too many loose ends by the end, and too much is left to the viewer's imagination for the story to be considered coherent. The movie fails to respect the viewer, by allowing the protagonists to overcome virtually insurmountable odds, with no explanation or reasoning. One moment the main characters are trapped, next moment the camera cuts and main characters have successfully escaped a maximum security military base. No explanation, no suspense, no basis in reality, no nothing.Ultimately, the lack of closure resulted in me feeling robbed of my time and money. I was interested in finding out where the movie would take me, and what I ended up with was more unanswered questions (and not in a good way).3/10, would not recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made Slow-Burning Sci-Fi Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/screenwriter Jeff Nichols has made quite a nice niche for himself creating clever, thought-provoking and atmospheric films about seemingly ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances. Whether it be the quite intensity of Michael Shannon in Take Shelter (2011) or the rascally roguishness of Matthew McConaughey in Mud (2012), Nichols always manages to find the humanity underneath the story in ways few directors can. His common leitmotif is middle- class, rural Americana and the quiet dignity thereof, to which Midnight Special is no exception.Yet there's a little more at play here; another ball that's been thrown in the air for Nichols to juggle. The story takes place over the few days it takes for Alton Meyer (Lieberher) and father Roy (Shannon) to get from Texas to Florida. We're thrust into the middle of the action and forced to sift through visual cues and cryptic dialogue to discern the plot. What is obvious from the get go, is Alton, Roy and trusting partner in crime Lucas (Edgerton) are on the run from the FBI, the NSA and a religious cult who see Alton as a prophet and perhaps the second coming. The investigation of Alton's "abduction" is spearheaded by NSA lackey Paul Sevier (Driver) who sits uncomfortably with cult leader Calvin Meyer (Shepard) to find out how Alton has the ability to pickup encrypted satellite messages.If put in other hands, years in turnaround would have turned Midnight Special into a bombastic sci-fi action-thriller and a clone of something we've seen a hundred times before; in other words, nothing special. Nichols wisely takes the sci-fi high concept and grounds it in a slow-burning human drama. Such an accomplishment would have been impossible if not for the film's talented cast. Michael Shannon's intense grimace seems specifically suited for films of great drama and intensity. Every showcase of Alton's "powers" is made believable not by intricate special effects details but by Shannon's reactions. Edgerton likewise does a commendable job as an outsider turned protector. It's his ingenuity and forethought that gets the team past everything standing in their way. Then of course there's Kirsten Dunst playing Alton's biological mother Sarah. She shows up halfway through the film but nevertheless manages to top Shannon and Edgerton by the power of haggard but stalwart guardianship. She along with newcomer Jaeden Lieberher are easily the best things about Midnight Special.Yet despite stellar acting and some admittedly impressive CGI set- pieces, Midnight Special suffers from the contrivance of the main story and the mode in which it is delivered. Nichols tries oh so hard to shroud the story in mystery that the story dances recklessly into kitsch and sabotages itself from reaching its full potential. The cryptic dialogue and coy editing works for about an hour or so. Our mind swells with questions like: who are these people; what's up with this cult; what is the significance of the location their headed to; what are all the character's relationships with the cult? But after the tension builds up without questions being answered, I could feel the dissatisfaction of the audience bubbling to the surface.I give the collaborators on this film a lot of credit for refusing to talk down to it's audience with tortured exposition dumps and goofy sci-fi jargon. Only Adam Driver's character gets the closest to being a narrative conduit. But just when you think his NSA operative job is merely connective tissue, the film manages to sneak in a character arc that, while coming out of left field, feels natural. Still, some background wouldn't hurt given the fact that the film delves into theology, ontological philosophy, quantum physics and other concepts only expanded on in modern sci-fi literature. This movie feels engineered for the internet age, where Buzzfeed articles and comment section philosophizers can pick apart every detail to search of deeper meaning.Midnight Special is a good film. It's well shot, well directed and fantastically acted by a cast that takes a convoluted script and turns it into a story loaded with subtext and chances to show honest human emotion. Jeff Nichols whom by all accounts is a talent with a bright future, as an acumen for building tension out of simple moments between characters and well timed sequences of intense action. Yet when the audience reaches a frenzy, Nichols struggles to deliver the catharsis we crave. Still you can't blame a movie for being ambitious which Midnight Special certainly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly written characters and plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has many intriguing elements, but it ultimately feels undercooked. That's been my problem with Jeff Nichols all along. Mud is probably my favorite, because it's his most straightforward. His other three films have great concepts, but never amount to much. Midnight Special is his worst so far. It's so vague in its sci-fi concepts - honestly, it's more of a fantasy than a sci-fi, just because it's so vague and more magical than sciency - that I quickly stopped caring. And its characters are even more shallow than its story. To me, it almost feels like all the characters were filmed separately and then combined digitally later on. They all seemed to be reading Nichols' blank dialogue past each others' heads. The lead kid is awful, Michael Shannon gives the exact same performance he gives in all of Nichols' films, and Edgerton and Dunst feel about the same. Only Adam Driver felt like he somewhat resembled a human being, but only resembled. There's some particularly neat looking stuff to see in the finale, but, since neither the story nor the characters had any depth, my whole feeling was, "Who the heck cares?" Well, some people obviously do, but not me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You have no clue what you're dealing with do you?" Alton Meyer (Lieberher) has been taken from "The Ranch" by his father Roy (Shannon) and they are on the run from them and the FBI. Alton is a very special kid and Roy knows this. He is trying to bring Alton where he wants to go, but must find ways to hide from everyone in order to protect Alton, and his power. This is a very good and very decent family movie. There are parts that may be a little intense for younger kids but nothing too bad. The best way to describe this is a type of human E.T. The movie is essentially one long chase sequence but hold your interest and really keep you wondering and engrossed. The movie is a little bizarre but worth seeing. This is one that I think people will either love or hate, and really one that must be seen to understand what I am trying to say. I did like this enough and do recommend it but isn't really a movie for everyone. Overall, E.T. with a real kid and not an alien. Worth seeing, but must be in the mood for. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is all about the build-up to a mystery-clarifying ending that should (it is implied) blow everyone's mind. That's a tall order for any story to fill. The ending of Midnight Special has the conceptual oomph to knock our socks halfway off--but not completely off. That would still be OK if by then we are so engaged in the characters that seeing them reach a conclusion or an epiphany is enough to satisfy our hopes or fears for them.Unfortunately, the understated story withholds so much information-- so many logical and emotional details--that I didn't receive enough return on my investment. To succeed, this film needs you to walk out saying "Wow, that movie had a point that I will not soon forget." Well, the movie was certainly not dull, but I have to say that its point was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes based on the cast. I have always been a fan of the thought that a good actor can make a bad movie great. This movie was either the exception to that or proof that such a view is limited in scopeWithout going into detail, the movie leaves far too much up to assumption or "What do you think was meant/happened" and I am not speaking of the ending. There are 3 parts of the movie where you are to assume the intent/feeling of the character based on a nod or a look. Children lack the ability to act with intensity. When you character is supposed to be a child with greater understanding than those around him, but fails to give emotional queues based on his age...well, a lot can be left hanging.I add the above on the fact that several parts are " fill it in yourself" parts relating to several characters. Less time spent with concept development and more actually put into the plot would have seen a far better film.In the end you are left with a "That's it?" feeling. I am unsure where the 7+ star ratings and higher come from and I can only assume they are people who enjoyed the acting of Edgerton, Shannon and Driver. Dunst may as well have been listed as a drawn out cameo for what she contributed to the storyThe movie, to me, is no different than a bad night's sleep. You would have liked more but will deal with what you have and try to make it to the next night.I gave it a 4 based on how much it lacked, how incomplete it feels and while I did like the special effects, I still find the movie one of those "Pick it up at Red Box" flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had recently mentioned to a friend that I was really looking forward to viewing this film. The marketing, or lack thereof, made it smell like a fun and seemingly enigmatic science fiction indie flick. I had very much enjoyed not so indie but nevertheless notable Super 8, District 9, and yes, Chappie.In recent memory, within the sphere of contemporary science fiction cinema there have been several refreshing and bold narratives , albeit probably way more stinkers, but I was positively 'beaming' for Midnight Special...Here we go. Lights off. I even made special snacks...all seemed groovy in the universe, shades of 'Stranger in a Strange Land' dancing before my eyes. I was so ready to grok this.Then suddenly, blindingly, like the visible spectrum from the eyes of the physically challenged mute child actor in bad makeup, the words came to me....'what the what'? First there was the initial denial period. Don't worry, it will pick up, give it a chance man! But then a growing irritation set in, illuminating a cold reality. After brief moments of anger I was left with an overall sense of pity for those who were involved in the making of this (expletive). The special snacks were left untouched, as was the directing, plot, narrative, writing, editing, care, thought, or common sense.After the first hour I was utterly and hopelessly exhausted, and left feeling slightly anxious by the apparent non disclosure agreement the director and screenwriter had forced upon the viewing audience.Utterly disappointing. Move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My impression after watching this movie is that a lot of good doors were opened, but few were actually walked through. I find I'm not disappointed with what the writer did and where we went, so much as with what he didn't do and where we didn't go. Sparse is a good descriptor of the story-line. A lot of things picked up and then just dropped. What some reviewers call "mysterious" I would tend to call "unfinished": story elements just thrown in but not developed to any kind of meaningful conclusion. Midnight Special is not a bad movie. But after a movie like Mud, this one just seems sort of thrown together without a lot of development. Perhaps its biggest downfall is that for me at least, it did not live up to the hype its ads presented. The acting and production was quite good. But I found myself glad that I only paid "early-bird" rates for it's premier showing. I get the feeling that the other 4 people at the premier showing might have agreed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Special... not so special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this movie because Michael Shannon is a great actor and Jeff Nichols' previous movies 'Take Shelter' and 'Mud' were excellent in my mind. The premise of 'Midnight Special' sounded good to me, like something in the vein of 'Firestarter.' Man, I was so wrong. 'Midnight Special' is 112 minutes of pure boredom. You don't care about any of the characters in this movie because you never get to know them. You have no idea why they act the way they do because they have no backstories to them. Nothing. This mysterious boy with glowing eyes and some kind of superpower is just annoying. His parents are running around with him, fleeing from the military and some cult members, going to some mysterious place and whatnot. It's all so unbelievably stupid and pointless. The military, FBI, NSA or whatever people in this movie act so weird and idiotic and absolutely unrealistic that it's almost hilarious. 'Midnight Special' is a huge mess of a movie and I have no idea why it has gotten such good reviews. This movie has nothing to offer. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I'm not exaggerating. I hardly ever rate movies so low but this one doesn't deserve any more than two stars. It's a shame really and I hope that I can enjoy Jeff Nichols' next project as much as I did 'Mud' and 'Take Shelter.'</fullReview>

If you are making a "guess whats happening" movie you need to keep the bums on the seats between clues. Bums got off seats in droves in the cinema I was in.

		<shortDescription>Well-intentioned, mildly good-looking slog of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special proves to be the most frustrating movie to think about all year, let alone the most frustrating to enjoy. It's clearly inspired by the Spielberg-inspired sci-fi drama with family dynamics and paranoia commentary, but either fails or chooses not to have us invested in any of it. Now I know I should appreciate Jeff Nichols attempt to utilize experimental sensibilities with the blockbuster scene, and for the most part, he does excel in most parts of this movie. But what we have here is an unfocused hybrid of both, with heartfelt moments pulled back for subtlety, and subtlety being absent with a few minutes of special effects. The premise: a child who shoots lasers out of his eyes is on the run with his father and uncle from the government who wish to experiment with him. Clearly inspired by E.T. or Close Encounters (with the family dynamics, the nifty special effects, and the sci-fi sensibilities within the fish out of water storyline) but it seriously feels it needs to pull out at the least appropriate time in some vain attempt to be different. Are the awkward pauses within the dialogue supposed to be elevated by the actors facial emoting or is Nichols unaware for how long and awkward they are? Is the paranoia of the experimental government and the religious community supposed to fill in the commentary, or is it just background noise? Is the ending intended to be interpreted or did they just run out of time? It's a shame because everyone involved in this movie really tries to pull this off. Joel Egerton, Michael Shannon, Kirsten Dunst, and child actor Jaeden Lieberher express their abilities well enough to smooth out the complicated script (to say nothing of Adam Driver still proving to be quite a surprise) and Jeff Nichols does all he can to fulfill his vision, even though he doesn't seem to know what that sort of vision is. However, as it stands, Midnight Special all amounts to a well-intentioned, mildly good- looking slog that either doesn't feel the need to or just can't connect to the subtle experimental audience or the not-so-subtle Hollywood audience. I'm not going to pretend this movie doesn't have its own audience, but it just didn't work for me. For more reviews, check out my blog! https://itachisan125.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Why did he drop one satellite that was following him but not the many others that do the same thing, and why did he drop it in the same place he was standing, and why didn't it burn up completely like most satellites do? Apparently the movie was lacking explosions... And so there are many many questions left open.

		<fullReview>Midnight Special takes you on a suspenseful ride, and keeps you guessing until the end. The characters are at the mercy of their precious cargo Alton (Jaeden Lieberher). There is an ever present sense of tense affection. Michael Shannon and Kirsten Dunst show their ability to exude worry, dread, and parental love for their child. Adam Driver (Paul Sevier), fits his role well, and although the character is fairly unbelievable for an NSA analyst, he brings a wit and dry humor that leaves you chuckling in an otherwise tense and suspenseful story progression.Jaeden Lieberer delivers a good performance, but his character is very one dimensional. No real human emotion comes through when Alton goes through this gut wrenching adventure with his parents. This is bitter sweet. It allows for sustained suspense in the movie, but leaves the ending cold and emotionally empty. Within the context of the ending you can feel the enlightened goodness; however, it would have been nice to see some human warmth shine through from Alton.Overall Midnight Special delivers a unique twist on an existing Sci-Fi narrative. The film offers very good acting, tremendous musical score, and superb directing. It should be on your list of movies to watch.</fullReview>

Really fell apart in the third act as the "big reveal" that was supposed to be the payoff for all the earlier intrigue was totally lame. Felt a bit Shymalanny, in fact. It starts out tense and engaging, but the more you learn about the ultimately unimpressive premise, the less immersive the experience becomes.In terms of acting, Michael Shannon, Kirsten Dunst and Kylo Ren all did a fine job as always. However, the plot revolved entirely around the young boy: child actors can very often make the movie sink or swim, and unfortunately this was the former. Perhaps it was bad dialogue, but for me, I couldn't take the kid seriously and that left the final third dead in the water.Good start, jumped the shark about half way through. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Special is the new science fiction movie from director Jeff Nichols, and it follows the story of a young boy who is being taken by his father (Michael Shannon) and a state trooper (Joel Edgerton) to a place. We don't know why they are going there and we never really do. This movies biggest fault is that it isn't that well written. There are so many points in the film that have no explanation. How did they know they needed to go their? How did Adam Drivers character find something out? The movie doesn't explain things well.The sub plots in the film are that a church/cult are trying to get the boy back to Ranch and the FBI are trying to get the boy. But both these stories are rather lacklustre. They fade away. I would have preferred to see a style of film much like The Fugitive. Where it goes back and forth between the FBI trying to catch him and the boy running away. But it doesn't do that. At times exciting things happen with the boy. Strange things happen with him and there are attempts at capture but in between those tense and exciting scenes is a slow story that could have worked if the characters were more well written.The father character, the mom and the state trooper are all the same. They are depressing, they never seem to have any other emotion. And I didn't feel that invested in their goal. If the movie was more well written and exciting this could have been a fantastic science fiction movie. But it isn't, it's close, but it's not quite there.However there are some excellent parts of this movie. The cinematography is very good. It's very basic. Just a stationary camera and some fluid movements. The editing is also very good. But the best part of the movie is the score. This score is incredible. Its a mix of electronic bassy music that ramps up the tension, and then a classical piano. It creates a very mysterious atmosphere. Its sounds very much like John Carpenters album 'Lost Themes', which is great.Overall its an intriguing, tense, mysterious, well acted, well shot, occasionally exciting movie with a great score a great atmosphere and it does have some pretty fantastic twists and turns. But it falls flat on its character development and pacing. Its so close to greatness that its rather annoying that it isn't. Also the ending is pretty fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I drove 2 hours to see this film. After enjoying Mud and Take Shelter I had high hopes going in. Sadly, the film didn't live up to the hype. There wasn't much of a story and basically zero character development. After about 30 minutes of not knowing anything about these people I found myself not caring what happened to them. The end was underwhelming and there were extremely violent scenes which did not match the tone of the film. An early violent scene in particular seems to only serve as a device to raise the stakes. The music wasn't anything to write home about and the quirky humor barely got a laugh. Visual literacy was absent for the most part. Sometimes not following the rules makes a film suffer and this is a great example of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see Midnight special at a midnight screening, and it fit into that whole atmosphere. Micheal Shannon once again makes a mole hill into a mountain. He's a great actor to watch.It's interesting how the whole movie is an awkward quiet so Shannon is really setting a tone. Shannon plays a father who takes his son, who has special abilities on a dangerous journey to discover the purpose of his powers.Kirsten Dunst is in the movie as well as this special kid's caring mom. It's been a while since I've seen her in anything so it was cool to see her in this one. It was touching watching the bond between a mother ans her son Alton who was played by mature beyond his years, Jaeden Lieberher.Adam Driver also has a small part in the movie, as a expert working with the federal government on hunting down this kid. Driver himself brings an awkwardness to his acting but it's not quiet.I don't know if the title is some sort of play of the midnight movie style it reminds me of. It almost asks like a weird version of version of E.T, but it's really quirky. It has all the elements of a adventure film for the whole family, but it's two played down for that and more adult in tone for a movie to take your kids to.Overall, despite the strange slow pace of it all it was definitely a fantastic adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific opening scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Austin-based filmmaker Jeff Nichols serves up some of the familiar themes of spiritualism and parenting seen in his first three films: Mud (2012), Take Shelter (2011), Shotgun Stories (2007), but this time he goes a bit heavier on the science fiction ? while maintaining his focus on the individual.An exceptional opening scene kicks off the story, and Nichols makes sure we are alert by forcing us to absorb and assemble the slew of clues flying at us ? an Amber alert, cardboard on the windows of a cheap motel, a news report tying us to San Angelo, Texas, duct tape on the peep hole, a duffel bag of weapons, two anxiety-filled men, and a goggled-boy under a white sheet who seems extremely calm in an otherwise hectic environment. We learn a lot, yet many questions remain.As the boy and the two men speed off down the backroads, the setting switches to an eerily calm Calvin Meyer (the always great Sam Shepard), who is the leader of a religious cult similar to the Branch Davidians. "The Ranch" is desperate to get the boy back, and we learn they worship the numbers and words the boy has "received" from above. An FBI agent (Paul Sparks) leads the raid on the compound and takes us to an interrogation of Calvin by NSA analyst Paul Sevier (Adam Driver).Alternating between sci-fi special effects and an "on the run" story line, we slowly pick up more details about the boy Alton (Jaeden Lieberther), as well as the men with him ? his father Roy (Michael Shannon) and Roy's childhood friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton). It's not long before they reunite with Alton's mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) and we really start to comprehend just how different and special Alton is.It's easy to see the influence of such films as Starman, E.T.: The ExtraTerrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and The Day the Earth Stood Still. We are reminded that our society inevitably assumes the worst when something we don't understand appears right in front of us. The Ranch sees the boy as a savior, and the government labels him a weapon. But it's Shannon who captures the protective determination of a father trying to do the right thing for his son. Shannon again flashes the best 'pained' expression in the business, but it's young Lieberther (so terrific in St. Vincent) who allows us to accept the father/son story in spite of the bright white lasers shooting from his eyeballs.There are plenty of unanswered questions ? not the least of which is, how did two "normal" parents end up with this "special" son? The visuals near the end are impressive to see on screen, but don't appear to have much impact on the final questioning of Lucas or our understanding of how it all happened. It should also be noted that the piano score is especially impactful during both the quiet and thrilling moments. Director Nichols is a talented idea man, but he does leave us wanting more details. (That's his brother singing the song over the closing credits.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking and spares the details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Special" focuses on a father (Michael Shannon) who goes on the run with his son, Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) who seems to be a conduit channeling earthly and celestial information, as well as being the chosen prophet of a religious cult in rural Texas, from which his wife (Kirsten Dunst) formerly fled. The bulk of the film entails the family's mission to bring Alton to a specific geographical location (for purposes that remain relatively undisclosed until the end) while the FBI, CIA, and US military relentlessly pursue them.To put it straight, I am not typically a sci-fi fan, but Jeff Nichols's "Midnight Special" almost defies the category itself in many ways. The film starts out with a starkly ambiguous premise, and revels in its own ambiguity for the majority of its duration; Nichols keeps a steady hand on the trigger from the opening scene to the visually astounding conclusion, and the audience is kept in a state of contemplation and wonder that never really closes in on itself.In many ways, it's a road film, and in others it is full-blown science fiction-meets-the horror aspects of "Village of the Damned" with shades of David Lynch. The rural backwoods of the south and its rundown gas stations and forlorn meadows and wetlands stand as the backdrop against which the action is set?mostly at night?and Nichols has a keen eye for visuals; it's an aesthetically beautiful movie, artfully shot and eye-catching. Michael Shannon plays a role that is tailored for him in all of his contemplative and quiet idiosyncrasies, while Joel Edgerton is incredibly believable as his Texas state trooper friend helping the mission. Kirsten Dunst turns in a fine performance as his estranged wife, and is emotive and revels in what is a relatively unglamorous but substantive role. Jaeden Lieberher is also fantastic and fittingly precocious at the film's center.I've read some reviews in which audiences have taken issue with the film's conclusion, but I felt it was a thought-provoking and poignant ending to a remarkably enigmatic story. The special effects do become increasingly ambitious as the film's heavier sci-fi elements rear their head, but the effects are well-done, and the visuals that the film ends itself on are truly breathtaking.Overall, "Midnight Special" is a visionary film from a visionary filmmaker through and through. It draws inspiration from a confluence of sources, melding Spielberg-like science fiction with the uncanny nightmarishness of a David Lynch picture. It's visually phenomenal, but, aesthetics aside, is simply an engaging and thought-provoking story that is as otherworldly as it is human. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey that starts magically gets stagnant quickly and loses its way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The saying - 'Its not the destination but the journey that matters' doesn't sound more profound than in context to watching 'Midnight Special'. Starts off beautifully by drawing the audience into its mysterious world setting up a tense atmosphere which is well supported by its talented cast. Well that's just the first 40 minutes runtime after which it derails spectacularly spiralling into an abyss and diffusing the pent-up mystery along the way.An 8 year old kid Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) is kidnapped. A religious cult and the FBI are on the lookout for the kid using all their available resources each for their own agenda. His kidnappers Roy (Michael Shannon) who is also his biological father and Lucas (Joel Edgerton) are well prepared and committed to take the kid to the prophesied time and place. What happens when he reaches the destination with cult on hot pursuit, FBI, NSA and Homeland security on their tail and whether his mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) unable to let him go.There have been many movies in the past based on a similar premise with varying levels of box office success and critical acclaim, so 'Midnight Special' is neither new nor innovative there. What sets it apart from the others is how brilliantly the first half of the movie was handled - the pacing, superb acting, the tense background score, the information released in perfect sequence to further elevate the suspense; a lot was going for it. With all these elements working so beautifully together, the hype and expectations of what is to come also gets elevated. But what transpires from here was such a big let down which is a complete contrast to where it was originally going. The story gets stagnant, the only form of mystery they could accomplish are the over lengthy pauses before the characters utter their words which also turn out to be duds. The final payoff, though not entirely subpar just wasn't handled well and one starts to wonder rather helplessly how it all fell apart.There is still a lot of good that holds some things together like sensible and realistic performances by all their leads, the kid in the central role played by Jaeden is likable and aptly suited for the character. There is a methodical haste and the sudden influx of information stimulates your brain to watch out for something spectacular (at least it did succeed in raising expectations), the dark background and a tense background score suits the theme perfectly. Another notable performance is from Kirsten Dunst who is rather content with a limited role both in terms of screen presence or the impact the character makes on the story. Last but no way the least is the terrific cinematography that captures the moments beautifully and at the same time escalates the necessary tension.A journey that starts magically gets stagnant quickly and loses its way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rewatcheable Thriller that is Fun to Decipher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to properly appreciate this movie, I will put my concluding paragraph on top for those who do not wish to read spoilers. I recommend this film as a smart science fiction thriller in the spirit of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", but try as much as possible to not learn any details of the plot before seeing it. Beware, the rest of this review has many spoilers.There is a lot going on with the screenplay that makes watching the story details being slowly revealed exciting. A lower budget movie, this movie reminds me of "Sicario", another thriller that wins you over with a plot that keeps revealing deeper details that create terrific momentum. Both movies wisely avoid plot sandtraps that cause the story to fall into cliché or predictability. They also feature top notch acting and sharp editing. I never saw the trailer for this film, but there are moments both in visual and story form that are eye catching and somewhat jaw-dropping. I needed a second viewing, because I didn't pay close enough attention to the dialogue the first time to really catch all the details of the plot. It turns out these details are pretty important, meaning that this film has a very lean script that packs information into every piece of dialogue throughout the picture. It is this breadcrumb style of backstory that keeps you rockin' toward the big third act.First, much must be commended to the director and the performances from everyone. You will recognise some faces from some big TV series "House of Cards" and "The Night Of". The two male leads create an interesting dynamic. Michael Shannon, a familiar face from "Boardwalk Empire", is the father of a boy with special "X Men" like abilities. Joel Edgerton is for me an unfamiliar face, and the movie does not fully spell out his relationship with the father. We as the audience need to wait until later in the movie to learn about them. Until then, there are some striking scenes in the first act that are shot with a sense of realism that betrays the science fiction element of the film. This also hearkens the fresh approach that Bryan Singer had with "X Men" almost two decades ago.Other familiar faces are Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver, both veterans of movies featuring people with super powers. Dunst is the boy's mother. Driver is the slightly unbalanced expert that most resembles Francois Truffaut's character in "Close Encounters". What is so fun about this movie is putting together the breadcrumbs it first entices you with in the first act. You may deduce the first scene as two men holding a small boy hostage. When the father shows no sign of force when talking to the boy, and with a few subsequent scenes, we conclude that the two men are the protagonists of the movie, and they are actually protecting the boy. From what, we don't know.Then comes a disturbing scene where FBI agents detain an entire church congregation. Hints of David Koresh, or another type of cult, are interpreted from the details the film gives us. The church scene tosses the audience's interpretation of what is going on into another interesting direction. In the first chase scene, our protagonists flee the authorities. When they are confronted by a State Trooper, Edgerton shoots the trooper twice. I was shocked, these were no longer the good guys. I kind of rejected real sympathy for our heroes after that in the first viewing, because I missed a snippet of dialogue between them mentioning the trooper was wearing a bullet-proof vest. In the second viewing, the dialogue explaining their actions helped, but was not comforting. However, this edgy rift between the two men became another dynamic that factors in later. When the science fiction elements are introduced, they begin without any buildup or fanfare. The boy's abilities feel like a comic book superhero like Superman. This is another point where the audience is challenged into going into this direction. Here is where I realised that this film is essentially a variation of "Close Encounters", including coordinates that are prevalent in the story that lead to the place of rendezvous with the aliens.Thankfully, the film does not try to go overboard with the special effects, tossing them in the film more as a teaser to the big third act. Just like "Close Encounters", the entire film builds up to this big rendezvous in the third act. Some film reviews I read had a mixed reaction to the big reveal. I approve of the finale, again not going too extreme with the effects. One problem that Spielberg had at the ending of his film was how to reveal the aliens. He ended up bathing them in light and soft focus, along with no close-ups. In this film, we don't see any signs of life anywhere in the 'sky city'. No UFOs buzzing around, nobody looking from a balcony. No father figure meeting up with the boy. This leaves the impression the large concrete structures we see are no more than gigantic sculptures. Perhaps we are supposed to feel like this is the futuristic city like in "Tomorrowland", or even the floating city in "Star Trek Beyond".It could be from lack of budget, or the screenwriter's inability to come up with a more satisfying ending. This unfortunately leaves the film's resolution feeling a little incomplete. However, the terrific exciting ride to the finale I found upon second viewing to be well worth it. Also, no sequel bait.I found this intelligently written, expertly acted, directed, and edited thriller hybrid one of the best hidden treasures of 2016. The lack of big name stars actually helps with the realism, and the low budget also keeps the film grounded. I expect great things in the future from director Jeff Nichols.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff Nichols Dreams Like I Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the synopsis for the movie when I was picking out a Redbox rental, and intrigued, chose it. It wasn't until I looked into the details later that I saw it was by the same writer/director as "Take Shelter", another movie I really enjoyed, and for the same reason: I dream like that, all of my life. In color, otherworldly, meaningful in an extraordinary way. Michael Shannon always delivers a fabulous performance. Joel Edgerton was wonderful, so I forgive him for "Exodus". It was nice to see Kirsten, and she was perfect. Of course Master Lieberher delivered. Love Adam Driver. It had some glaring blank spots, but I still really, really enjoyed this. The scene in the FBI interrogation room (and how did we get there?), was good. Choosing Paul Sevier, the only person in the room with light left in him, was perfect. It was a little predictable, and the "Starman" adjacent story line was too too, but the dialogue wasn't stupid, the acting was good, and the effects enhanced, without obliterating, the scenes. Thanks for the entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A interesting dark sci fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is one of those smaller movies that came out that actually caught my eye quite a bit. It is a small and closed film that feels very intimate as well. It is a very well done story as well that doesn't feel too big as well. It has a nice and interesting narrative as well with a lot of mystery surrounding it. And slowly does the film show its true self. This is a story of a young boy who has these strange powers that only work when it is at night. He had a family as well who had taken care of him too, but when the boy's powers are unleashed the family quickly starts to realize that there young boy doesn't really belong with them and rather should help him find his home, but as they try to get him home the government soon is after him and wants to take him away and lock him up.The entire cast of this film is great with people like Micheal Shannon, Joel Egerton, and a big applause to Adam Driver who I loved in this movie. After Star Wars and this I can defiantly say Adam Driver is a awesome actor. He can do the big budget movie and be all loud and boisterous, but he can also be really intimate as well. He is defiantly a strong performer in this film and should be noted as that. Overall I came out of this film really enjoying myself. It was a nice intimate ride I would defiantly want to take again,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is one of those movies which work better the least the spectator knows about its screenplay. On the other hand, the main point of Midnight Special isn't its intentionally ambiguous mystery, but the gradual flourishing of the relationship between the characters, as well as the sacrifices a father is willing to do for his son. And when the father is played by such a good actor as Michael Shannon, we have quite a solid emotional content guaranteed, and that is enough reason to recommend this film, independently from its dramatic tricks. The screenplay of Midnight Special has similarities with various movies I prefer not to mention; however, what makes it different is its realistic focus, efficient structure and total trust on the spectator, who will have to fill in various holes. Besides of Shannon, the rest of the cast also makes an excellent work, highlighting Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst and the great Adam Driver, while director Jeff Nichols (whose previous movie was the brilliant Mud) drives the film with precision and good rhythm. And even though the screenplay offers sporadic explanations, they don't feel like mere "exposition", but natural conversations which flow organically and connect the multiple levels of the story. In conclusion, I wouldn't consider Midnight Special an excellent movie, but I liked it pretty much mainly because it refuses to bring all the answers. And even though that might be frustrating for some spectators, I felt that the incomplete puzzle increments the interest, because it invites us to speculate and imagine under the frame of a human story about family unit under unusual circumstances. In that regard, Midnight Special might be "Spielbergian"; but its intrinsic quality makes it worthy to be appreciated on its own merits, instead of trying to find out what it's similar to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing adult version of Tomorrowland.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy movies I've seen in a long time. Dunst, Shannon, Driver and Edgerton and do a great job. Their acting had to be strong in this picture because the director relies heavily on performance to relay things that are not said. The way the movies starts with zero exposition right in the middle of things was a huge treat. I'm not going to go into plot here, because I knew nothing going in and it added a lot to my experience of the film. This is a movie that respects the intelligence of it's viewers. It doesn't spell everything out. The end (and the story itself) contains ambiguity. It is also amazing in the way it economically suggests backstory with minimal dialog. It is also quite moving. The low IMDb score is a disappointment created by people looking to be spoon-fed. Watch it for yourself. As of 8/13/16 this movie has a score of 6.7 IMDb points. Don't use that as your basis for viewing or you'll miss a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total spoilers ahead.I enjoyed this movie all the way through, but when I saw the final shot, my appreciation expanded like a supernova. I was definitely hooked from the first scene, and I enjoyed how the story unfolded. However, as someone who doesn't usually mind movies using a slow, gradual build, I actually thought there were moments when they went beyond deliberate pacing and just lingered on something to stall for time. That was my only criticism. The entire movie shows us a family transporting a boy with powers to some unknown destination while the government tracks them down. When the characters depart to take to the road, the movie starts. When they get to where they're going, the movie ends. In that sense, it was very economical. I liked that because it made everything feel very coherent and on-theme. After the three adults help the child to get "home," they are questioned and imprisoned. The final moment is the father looking at the sky from a jail hallway and smiling. We see a glimmer in his eyes that is similar to the blue light the boy's eyes gave off when he used his powers. My immediate thought was that the boy was off in this other place, but could still communicate with the father and let him know something about his life there--maybe how happy and peaceful life is there, or maybe some noble purpose that the people there are able to pursue. In the same moment that I made that assumption, I felt like that last image also summed up everything the film was trying to say. Even though the father had given up his freedom, he was happy to make the sacrifice because it led to the boy achieving something so wonderful--in this case, returning to where he belonged--that he didn't regret his choice at all. To me, it is about any time we forfeit something we value for a loved one, or really, any unselfish act. It might be a parent who gives up something else they enjoy to spend time with their child, or it might be anyone who enlists in the military. I love the fact that I enjoyed this movie all the way through, but that the ending took it to another level. I wish more filmmakers would start with the ending in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grounded and interesting Sci-Fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is simple. A father and his son with mysterious powers are pursued by a cult and the CIA. At a glance such a plot and poster could make you think of any generic Science fiction thriller. However, it's the unique presentation and tone that make this movie worthwhile. The presentation and directing for the most part were very well- done. The performances were good with no real stand-outs, noting however that the actor playing Alton (Jaden Leberher) was never unconvincing in his performance despite being a child and having a large portion of the screen time. The special effects ranged from good to great depending on the scene and what's being shown. The camera-work and lighting was great for the most part, with a few scenes standing out as fantastic. No way to describe what they are without spoiling, but they are tough to miss. The soundtrack, while not spectacular, did a good job of setting the tone and increasing the emotions in some key scenes.Midnight Special is no flawless masterpiece. The character's are exceptionally talented at recovering and fighting after getting shot. Even though the character's aren't blank slates, don't go in expecting complex or deep characters. All (with the exclusion of maybe Alton) are defined by their background and one or two personality traits. Despite the movie's borderline silly premise, Midnight Special always keeps itself both grounded and serious. It's a movie that takes a common and silly premise, and asks what if it were real. Now this can be a good thing or a bad thing, but in this case I would say it's the biggest thing that makes Midnight Special standout and be well-worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You all have no clue of what you're dealing with, do you?"Fascinating. Intriguing. Mysterious. Captivating. These are words that crossed my mind after watching this quirky SF. "Midnight Special" seemed to be nothing special. But at the same time it contains something special. The atmosphere of secrecy that is noticeably present from the beginning, creates an intensely long trip full of mystery and intrigue. That underlying tension will resonate for a long time until the final offensive deploys and all questions are being answered. But believe me, most of the time you'll be sitting perplexed in front of your screen, while wondering what the hell is going on.The strength of the film is the way in which they reveal as little as possible. The story unfolds itself painfully slow. Roy (Michael "The Iceman" Shannon) and Lucas (Joel "Exodus: Gods and Kings" Edgerton) behave like thieves in the night while they drag the young boy Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) from motel to motel. Apparently this is a kidnapping, as said on all the news channels. However, when you see how relaxed Alton undergoes all of this, it doesn't look like a kidnapping. And certainly not as Roy appears to be the father of this strange boy, who's reading his comics with a flashlight under his sheets and who's wearing goggles constantly. The fact that the motel room is made completely sealed of from light by means of cardboard, will make you scratch your head for the first time already. Clearly those two adult guys would do anything to protect Alton and make sure he doesn't fall into the hands of those who are following them.Seems like a whole group of people are interested in the boy. First, there's a religious sect. They've constructed an entire religion around the boy with his special gifts. He's a kind of savior for them who'd be handy during a future apocalypse. The FBI is also looking for Alton and deports the entire sect to a secluded sport-hall to interrogate them about him. Even the NSA sends an expert (Adam "Kylo Ren" Driver) because apparently the prophecies of Alton, which were used for sermons used by the cult leader (Sam Shepard), contain top secret government information. So you have a lot of enigmatic narratives that coalesce in an ingenious way into a combined endpoint.The positive side of "Midnight Special" is its purity. SF without too many glitzy technological marvels. A mix of sentimentality and no-nonsense fiction. Roy's willingness to sacrifice himself for his son feels genuine. Roy and Luke are much like those apostles who were hanging out with Jezus. An irrefutable belief in Alton and a total submission to achieve a greater goal. The first part is also a display of the self-sacrifice and perseverance during their flight. Some magnificent acting and a touching father-son relationship. There's a limited use of CGI. The characters of the key figures tell the story. I wouldn't call it low budget entirely. Especially when seeing some well-known actors show up like Bill Camp, Paul Sparks and Kirsten Dunst. The end was a bit of a letdown. The quirky feeling of the movie is a bit ruined by the less successful "Tomorrowland"-like denouement. The peerless content and intriguing mystery that was created patiently, was instantly reduced to something superficial. A meaningless slip-up. All in all this was a whopper of a science-fiction that'll be difficult to surpass. And certainly one that I'll re-watch someday.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Immaculate Conception of "Midnight Special"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Special" concerns the special gifts of a boy conceived by ordinary parents. The lad has such a powerful intellect and intuitive abilities that the gaze of his eyes will instantly transform people with the spiritual "high" of their lives! The boy has gained the attention of a religious cult in Texas, who interpret his presence as a sign of the Second Coming. But his gifts have also alerted the national security network that he may be an enemy of the state. That is the backdrop for the two parents, who, with the aid of a kind state trooper, seek to rescue the boy from the religious and national security authorities and deliver him to a higher power.The film combines science fiction with elements of the action film, including daring chase scenes and constant life-and-death situations for the boy and his parents. But the true strength of the film lies in the sparse dialogue of screenwriter Jeff Nichols. There is a deft touch to the understated phrases and lines that raise more questions than they answer. A fine cast of actors, led by the always engaging Michael Shannon, create a truly creepy, yet engaging set of characters.While "Midnight Special" may not be a film with a clear or even deeply emotional message, it is nonetheless compelling drama. The cinematography is superb with interesting locations, camera angles, and compositional choices. We may never know the full details of the immaculate conception of little Alton. But "Midnight Special" leaves the viewer with some striking images and quirky moments in a film that was done with imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers) One of the better movies of 2016, director Mike Nichols has put together Midnight Special, a wonderful story with an absolutely stunning ending. The ending alone lifts the movie another star at least. Young Jaeden Leiberher does a nicely grounded job in the central role, and is accompanied by a younger all-star cast of Shannon, Edgerton, and Dunst. Nichols script, though not as good as his story is serviceable. This is the kind of great storytelling and vision that movies nowadays often lack - simple and effective. I thought a little longer runtime and earlier explanations could've done the movie better. Give it a strong 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just not a very interesting movie. It's a Roger Cormanesque film with low budget exterior shots, a supposedly spooky plot that doles out tidbits and clues to "what's really going on" every 15 min or so. And of course at the end you get to see "it", and the special effects are thoughtful. But the majority of the movie is super close up shots of people's faces, looking very concerned, while they travel to a house and a gas station and a hotel running from the bad men of the FBI. Unfortunately it lacks the campy humorous (intended or not) qualities many Corman movies had. In fact, it is completely lacking in any humor. Overall, the acting is okay, the concepts and dialog are recycled and ordinary. The movie is not bad, it's just not very good either.</fullReview>

But even if part 1 was here, it is still not that good a movie.The boy Alton was very special and a number of people are trying to catch him. Strangely, at one point his dad Roy and partner Lucas decided to leave the boy alone in a car to go grocery shopping. That just doesn't make sense.In an earlier instance, the partner Lucas decided to stop on a road to help a motorist in a car accident, which end up attracting a cop and then he had to pull a gun on the cop. A more normal person would not stop to help the motorist when a more urgent matter is at hand, i.e. protecting the boy from being tracked down.Another scene that doesn't make sense is at the hotel. When the fugitives are ready to leave, they didn't spend one second to look outside to see if it is safe. And when Lucas went outside and was attacked, Roy couldn't wait to be shot himself and ran outside right away.In the end there is no explanation how the boy came to be or why he needs to leave. The plot can be summarized as "dad helps boy run from pursuer".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MIDNIGHT SPECIAL': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new sci-fi flick from writer/director Jeff Nichols (who also helmed 'MUD' and 'TAKE SHELTER'). It tells the story of a young boy, with special powers, who's on the run from the federal government; with his dad, and his dad's best friend, helping him. The movie stars Michael Shannon, Jaeden Lieberher, Joel Edgeron, Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver (who's also famous for a major role in another little sci-fi flick, called 'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS'). The film got decent reviews from critics (like all of Nichols' films) and performed adequately in indie theaters. I just caught it on Amazon Instant Video, and I really enjoyed it.The movie begins with Roy Tomlin (Shannon), his son Alton (Lieberher), and his friend Lucas (Edgerton) all fleeing a religious cult together. They're pursued by local, and federal, officers; which believe the boy is a national security threat. Alton has mysterious special powers, which involve the knowledge of classified government information. Roy and Lucas are trying to get him to an unknown location, where something of great importance is supposed to take place. I really like the way the film begins right in the middle of the action, it feels like you're walking into a movie that's halfway over already. It's always interesting, and always involving. The film also really has a strong Spielbergesqe like feel to it (it's a lot like his 80s sci-fi classics actually). I think Nichols is a very talented filmmaker (I absolutely love 'MUD') and I really like Michael Shannon (who's starred, or costarred, in all of Nichols' movies) and Joel Edgerton. I'm a little disappointed in the film overall though; for all of the great buildup, I was just expecting a little better payoff.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nichols film that does not invite you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another intriguing film by now well established director Jeff Nichols!Just as with his other films Midnight Special drags the viewer in to an intimate story surrounding its main characters. The pace and tone is beautifully crafted by Nichols that it would persuade anyone that walks past the film-screen to sit down and grab the nearest popcorn bucket. My initial worries that the film could fall flat around the acting of a child-actor in the central of the film turned out to be false, the kid (Jaeden Lieberher) stays focused and does not seem to be intimidated by the great talent around him. As for the others, they perform just as well as you would expect in a Nichols-film, special shout out to Joel Edgerton.What keeps the film from reaching the same status as Nichols other works is that it constantly keeps you at arm's length. It does not explore the relationships between the main characters enough in my opinion and neither does it reflect enough on broader themes that certainly is present in the story. Imagine being a child on a road-trip with your father. You never know where you are going when traveling with your father but it is always somewhere amazing. You are driving on a highway and you see the first exit, "Six flags, Amusement Park". You start jumping up and down in excitement, but your father keeps on driving. Later you drive past Seaworld, and then Disneyland. As you look back through the rear window at all the amazing adventures you could have had the car stops and your father tells you "we're here!" You look outside and see a standard grocery store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters are so dull in this movie. Thought Kirsten Dunst will redeem herself in this movie, but unfortunately was just another disappointing performance. I believe I've seen at last 7 more movies like this with the same story line. And all including this one is absolute rubbish and waste of time. Really struggled to stay awake during this, the movie drags on the story line so slowly and it's not even an interesting one.Very. Disappointing. Oh well, At least I didn't pay to watch this.Good luck next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to be pleasantly surprised by a movie. Too often have I regretted spending money to see one, and the law of averages being what it is, I thought something has to give.Renting this title on Amazon was $4.99 well spent. It tells the journey of a boy, his father and his father's boyhood friend starting off as a seemingly run-of-the-mill kidnapping. We are led to believe the men were dangerous but the slow reveal is they had reason to be.The performances were steady, the action reserved and believable, the suspense palpable, and no sex or profanity to be found. The steady pace of the story is a tribute to Director Jeff Nichols and all the actors delivered believable performances. Aside from the science fiction elements, the entire story is plausible.A very, very good job by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on a simple concept, taken right from E.T. itself: take the child to the place before the government and religious crazies can get to him. Every actor in the film acted really well and carried the concept forward. The problem is, beyond this idea, there is nothing.It's not even a spoiler, because the plot is clear from the get go. The only things keeping the viewer interested are predictable little drama points and the way to movie was shot and acted. This puts me in a strange position: I liked the film, but at the same time I wasn't satisfied with it. Michael Shannon, Adam Driver, Sam Sheppard, Kirsten Dunst, Joel Edgerton and the little boy who didn't have a lot of scenes, but carried them well made this film worth watchingBottom line: the great cast filled the void that was left in the plot. The pace is almost too slow and the ending is both predictable and vague. You watch the film in order to see what will happen in the end, even if you know the broad strokes, only to get to an ending made with broad strokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rewarding experience if you stick through the slow pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as writer/director Jeff Nichols' first venture into mainstream film-making and his first stab at a genre piece, Midnight Special still manages to keep things grounded and rugged despite its sci-fi credentials. Clearly a throw-back to the alien-among-us movies of the 1980's, such as E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982) and Starman (1984) - movies Nichols no doubt grew up watching - there are shady government officials, a suspicious cult, a sympathetic young investigator, a protective father, and a young boy with some astonishing, otherworldly abilities. Yet there's also the Southern setting, an unhurried pace and the presence of Michael Shannon, all key ingredients in the film-maker's oeuvre that help Midnight Special avoid being yet another homage to a bygone era.The film begins rather frantically as two men, Roy (Shannon) and his old friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton), escape some unknown threat in the middle of the night with a young boy, adorned with UV-blocking goggles, in the back seat. Their intentions are shady, and we soon learn that the FBI are hunting the men in the hope of rescuing the child, Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), who is clearly special in some unique way. Alton is Roy's son, and it's revealed that his father took him away from a shady cult led by the enigmatic Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard), whose nightly sermons would consist of seemingly random numbers that were once spoken by prophetic Alton. As the curious investigator Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) tries to unravel the mystery of the boy and the reasons for his abduction, Roy and Lucas must dodge state troopers and gun-wielding cult members to deliver Alton to his excommunicated mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) and prepare for the huge event that has been prophesied.For what is essentially a chase movie, Midnight Special moves incredibly slow at times. While the bursts of action or sudden violence that pepper the film are all the more exciting because of the shuffling pace, it can be a bit of slog at times, especially when the movie keeps you in the dark about a lot of which is going on. It very much reminded me of Nichols's second film, Take Shelter (2011), in which Shannon's troubled father's possible descent into madness manifests itself in his obsession over building a bunker that would shield his family from whatever catastrophic event he foresees. While the mystery was one of the main aspects that helped make that movie incredibly memorable, it does somewhat take away some of the sense of wonder in Midnight Special, even though it would seem that Nichols chose to reveal little until the end to do just the opposite.Despite its pacing flaws, the film is still incredibly absorbing. The Southern setting is one I find oddly romantic, and Nichols is a master at immersing you in the world, something he did astonishingly well in the land of swamps and charismatic outlaws in 2012's Matthew McConaughey-starring Mud. The world of fleapit motels, empty, neon- lit gas stations and tough, righteous men is the perfect fit for a story rooted in science-fiction. There's something timeless about the setting, and this helps Midnight Special achieve its hat-tipping to the works of Spielberg, Carpenter et al. Nichols also does wonders with the film's humble budget, creating a few standout set- pieces that work better than most CGI-overkill blockbusters. Yet at its heart, the film remains a family drama with the fatherly bond between Roy and Alton always front and centre, and Nichols has stated that it is very much his reaction to becoming a father. It may not be everyone's cup of tea - I'm sure mainstream audiences will be put of by its leisurely pace - but Midnight Special is a rewarding experience if you stick with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional film, intelligently presented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many disappointments lately, it was a nice treat to see a film that gave everything I was hoping it would, and more.Midnight Special is a film that thankfully doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience. It allows the story to unfold, and allows viewers to draw their own conclusions about what's happening. This is SO RARE and SO REFRESHING, you have no idea. It is such a precious and appreciated treat for those who want something to stimulate the mind, rather than to simply 'entertain'. In that sense, the film is almost literary in its presentation, and draws the viewer into an experience of the story, rather than corralling viewers around as passive spectators.I came to IMDb and was shocked at the poor rating. I shouldn't have been. I suspect this type of fine, smart storytelling is rare for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent road-movie, a bad sci-fi/supernatural film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is quite disappointing, despite a promising cast and an excellent start. For the first half, the narration is dense and the story keeps you glued to the screen; the idea of fusing a road movie with science fiction themes is, in itself, absolutely genial and, at the beginning, the movie can boast an effective directory and a solid writing. We are given some information on the backstory: past and present are skillfully woven to raise questions we expect to see answered at the end of the movie and, somehow, we identify with the awkward "expert"Paul Sevier (Adam Driver), who tries to figure out what is actually going on with Alton, the enigmatic protagonist, and the cult settled in a mysterious "Ranch", whose adepts regard at the strange child as their savior. On the other hand, we witness the odyssey of a father, Roy Tomlin (Michael Shannon) prepared for anything in order to save his son from the persecution of the fanatics, whose effective relationship with both father and son will remain a mystery, despite how intriguingly set to persuade us of the danger "The Ranch" represents. As the story goes on, we are presented with Roy's wife, Sarah, a melancholic, lovely Kirsten Dunst imprisoned in a character whose potential has been clearly wasted, reducing it to a mere archetype- "The Mother"- and, definitely, a Marie Sue. From now on, Midnight Special reveals the inconsistency of its plot: all the interrogatives we collected so far remain without solid explanation, the backstory looks flat since no clarification is offered to justify the actions of each protagonist and we have to be content with the mere fact that "things are as they are". In the end, the whole construction shows off in a quite predictable reinterpretation of notorious alien sci-fi tropes, an evident tribute to Spielberg's cinema, without either narrative strength or evocative power of, say, J. J. Abram's Super 8. I would like to spend some words on the cast. Some have argued Michael Shannon's interpretation is "shallow, monotone": it is, but it is exactly what we expect from the character and, in the end, I found it convincing, since Roy is probably the only character give us glimpse of a more complex background behind his actions. To be honest, I'd dare say that, if the movie retains any value, it is mainly due to to him and to the talented Jaeden Lieberher (Alton), whose recitation appears plain, measured and, yet, totally fitting for the subject. As said before, I reckon Kirsten Dunst gave her better, but the character did not allow her much more room for interpretation: despite the actress' s declaration about Sarah being a strong woman, we are left with the impression that every effort she makes for her son is completely mechanic and not supported by anything more elaborated than an a-logic, rough "maternal love"- a theme which has its own dignity, but that would have required more than 40 minutes or so of flat exposition. Now, let's come to Adam Driver. Again, he does his best, and, in some scenes, he is truly effective; despite his talent, however, one cannot come to understand the sense of Paul Sevier's character, who looks rather like the embodiment of a modern Saint Thomas, the paradigm of the wondering scientist (well, actually rather a goofy science-nerd, as it appears, since we are never given any clue about which is the specific field of research he is employed in) who eventually abandons his skepticism to embrace a mystical truth as easily as he would stumble into a table.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies that provide little detail and ask that you pay attention and use your own intuition and imagination to answer any questions. Lights out, x-ray goggles on, the opening title scene is a nice metaphor connecting the title with the plot. Jeff Nichols's Sci-Fi thriller is fascinating as you follow along with a father, his son, and his childhood friend on the run. Along the way, you rekindle one relationship and build on others. Michael Shannon does an immense job of mixing up the emotions. He brilliantly conveys seeing a lost love again; dutifully protecting his son; and, finally, saying goodbye without saying anything at all. The sound jumps up massively to underscore the action, and I love it; the bass is booming and really gives you a sense to the largeness of what is going on. Aside from one scene, the violence is implied and off-screen. Parents will understand the feelings and motivations for Roy Tomlin and Sarah Tomlin. It's an entertaining and fun movie that any family can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nichols' mainstream skewing attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols has a one-two punch in 2016, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL competes in Berlin and his latest LOVING has been selected in Cannes for main competition and will open domestically in the awards season, although both go home empty-handed.MIDNIGHT SPECIAL originally is slated for a late 2015 release, is Nichol' s first studio production which signifies his attempt to appeal a more mainstream audience, emulates Steven Spielberg's leap to ultra-popularity from the likes of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) and E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982), where, Nichol's picture takes a similar Sci-Fi/Family approach and visual splendor, but plot-wise, a more pertinent predecessor should be John Carpenter's STARMAN (1984), instead of pairing an alien who materializes in the human form of a woman's deceased husband with the said woman, together they embark on a life-altering excursion to reach a specified location convenient for the alien's departure, here, the romantic bond is supplanted by a stronger and more unswerving familial involvement, Alton (Lieberher), an eight-year-older, is kidnapped by his birth father Roy (Shannon) and Roy's long-lost friend Lucas (Edgerton), from the ranch where he grows up under the aegis of Calvin Meyer (Shepard), the pastor of a religious cult in rural Texas. Alton is not a normal kid, he is another species from above, highly intelligent but also has his Achilles heel, Roy and Lucas, later Sarah (Dunst), Alton's mother, also joins them, must escort him to the appointed place where Alton will safely be reunited with his own world.The kidnapping case also occasions the attention of FBI, because Alton's supernatural ability unwittingly and frequently intercepts US government's confidential information, which Meyer and his believers consecrate as hallowed message from God. A special agent Paul Sevier (Driver) is designated to investigate the mystery, meanwhile Meyer also sends his two acolytes Doak (Camp) and Levi (Haze) to snatch Alton back, it is a three-horse race, but Nichols ascertains that this is no place for tear-jerking schmaltzy, he skilfully underpins the suspense of impending danger throughout Roy's escaping route, partly through his economical but well-dispensed distribution of special effects, partly by parsimoniously teasing out the back-stories of Alton and his parents (at the end of the day, we still have no answer to the gnawing question, how come two humans can breed an alien son in the first place?), which conforms to his indie-filmmaking vein to let emotions speak for the characters instead of lines and dialogues - Shannon's reticent southern drawl, Dunst's doe-eyed wonderment and her awkwardly overlong reaction shots, all betray a feeling of ill-placement or unwieldy concoction, eventually the plot will duly lead us to a spectacular revelation looks suspiciously like Brad Bird's TOMORROWLAND (2015), maybe the same VFX company is hired.Admittedly, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL broaches a daring premise to integrate God-like intelligence with religious maniacs, but this intriguing subplot prematurely hits the cul-de-sac and is skipped entirely in the third act, it is just like that, a scene-chewing Sam Shepard, unfortunately again exits the show too early as in John Wells' AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY (2013), this time, it is not even a plot default, he could appear more if Nichols would be mettlesome enough to enrich his part. Newcomer Jaeden Lieberher, takes the mantle from other earthbound aliens, embodies a dash of detachment onto his earthly appearance and confidently eclipses his adult co-stars.Apparently, Nichols' stab into big studio system doesn't pay off as we had expected (which shouldn't be a surprise as there are many precedents galore), let's hope MIDNIGHT SPECIAL, like its name indicates, is merely an amuse-gueule, LOVING, where he is back in his strongest suit, an intimate character examination of a true story, a married interracial couple is sentenced to prison in Virginia in 1958, yes, that's something sounds passé and anachronistic, but actually happened, only less than six decades ago, will be the main course and secure his reputation as one of the most prominent young talents in the US soils.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Doesn't really know what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Midnight Special' is probably the "superhero" movie I was looking forward to most this year. It was directed the director of 'Mud' which was a film that I really enjoyed. Add in it's spectacular cast and it's spin on the superhero type movies and I was really excited to see this. The film opens on a TV screen where a local anchorman is stating that a child had gone missing. And a man by the name of Roy (Micheal Shannon) was the most likely suspect in the child's abduction. Immediately after this you can see that the kid is indeed with this man in question but something isn't quite right. The kid doesn't seem afraid of him. In fact, they seem to know each other.Right away the film is surrounded in mystery. What do these people mean to each other? What can this kid do? What is this ranch place everyone talks about? With in the first few minutes the film had me hooked. Very few movies have set themselves up in such an intelligent, mysterious way. &#x200b; Even fewer films have looked and felt as good as this does. The directing and cinematography is pretty great. Aside from a few dialogue heavy scenes, every shot is composed, lit, and visually interesting. You almost feel like you are in the room with these people.You can tell what kind of people they are just by looking at their clothes and the houses they live in. While I didn't find any of them particularly complex or interesting, I have to give credit to the actors here. Because holy crap is every single person fantastic. Micheal Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, and Jaeden Lieberher are all superb. Even child actor Jaeden is great. In fact he was the only one that took me off guard with his performance. Normally child actors are the butts of movies. Most are laughably bad while others, you can of just feel sorry for because they seem like they just don't want to be there at all. But not this kid. He was believable and interesting to watch.But, like everyone else, his character was seriously lacking. He was the most interesting, unique part of the movie but he didn't have any traits that defined him at all. Everyone else was just an over used troupe. The clingy mother, cop friend, and over protective father. Characters that have been done a million times in the exact same way.This aspect didn't take me out of the movie as much as other parts did though. Much of this movie made no sense whatsoever. Remember those questions that I said it brought up at the beginning of the film? Well, most of them where either not answered, or glazed over.The religious commentary it tries for is forgotten with in ten minutes and the child's powers are completely unexplained. I did not understand what he was doing when he shot lasers out of his eyes and into another persons. The person said they just had to "see" again but that was it. Why didn't that hurt the person? Why did the house start falling apart during that? Why did his father flip out when that happened? How could the kid bring down satellites? How did he know peoples names and job titles with out ever meeting them?There were so many questions that the film just does not answer. It basically says, "He is super human or something so just don't think about it." I was honestly trying to decipher what on earth was going on more than I was actually watching the film. It's uneven pace and bland characters certainly don't help though. 'Midnight Special' is a film that is so incredibly mediocre with the way it takes it's awesome concept that I can't say this is anything more than average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having abducted his young son from the clutches of a religious cult, a devoted father tries to evade police pursuit, but there is more than meets the eye in this striking thriller from 'Take Shelter' director Jeff Nichols. 'Midnight Special' is best entered into with as a few expectations as possible. The exposition is deliberately light to challenge our in-built preconceptions. At first, we are led to believe that the boy is being kidnapped by strangers; then, we think he is being rescued from an abusive cult; then, we realise that there is something supernatural about him, and the list goes on. There is much to like about this approach as Nichols spins a passionate story of fatherly devotion by leaving all science fiction elements hazy; attention is always directed at the father-son bond since so little time is given to elucidating the supernatural edge. The film also works well as a riveting thriller. As per 'Take Shelter', Nichols pays magnificent attention to sound and all the nighttime photography combined with David Wingo's moody score renders the experience quite chilling. The film raises far more questions than answers though, and while a solution is provided near the end, it can hardly be termed an explanation since so many plot points are shied over. The result is a film that never quite feels as satisfying as its build-up, but the build-up cannot be discounted altogether. Sure, the film has tons of loose ends, but it still provides a great tale of fatherly devotion with the son's supernatural abilities very much symbolic of the way of every parent believes that their child is special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compellingly character-driven and magnificent journey even on familiar road.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while there will come a movie which gives incredibly eerie yet involving adventure, "Midnight Special" might not have grand special effect and at its heart it resembles E.T, but the presentation and cast give such darkly inviting experience. It's the same theme of special power, done in authentic, almost disturbing manner as it happens to a boy. Occasionally chilling, it's ultimately an uplifting tale.One can't hope for a better father figure than Michael Shannon. He has a powerful expression as well as stoic mannerism for just this type of role, he's set even in silence. Also, with many exceptional actors such as Joel Edgerton and Adam Driver, this is worthy cast for any the sci-fi mystery. Props to Jaeden Lieberher for handling himself really well, he can appear enigmatically frail or mysteriously controlling when needs be.The perpetual dark tone gives a realistic touch to the ordeal, and even a bit of cultist ambiance as well. It has the same effect Looper had a few years back, definitely not he direction of X-Men. This type of production delivers a gripping more serious atmosphere, although it's not all doom and gloom here.Its best appeal is the drama, which having a great cast is a boon for such objective. This translates well for the audience without being overly melodramatic, it also has the kind of majestic vibe found in Tommorowland without being too preachy. A few drawbacks are apparent though, for example the cult aspect is not fully flashed out, the past is slightly obscured, which may further the puzzle pieces, although it can become jarring later on.In the end the mystery and drama aspect maintain a magnificent journey one would enjoy even on familiar road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Special isn't your typical sci-fi movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is truly a unique and special sci-fi flick. It is a different movie from what we'd usually get in our theaters nowadays and I found the entire experience to be memorable. The movie begins deep in the story and it's up to us to catch up on what's happening. The plot is quite linear and simple and it doesn't stray away from that simplicity. It doesn't go off tangent to explain unnecessary back stories and the like; the plot advances every minute in a slow yet intriguing manner. I had my eyes hooked up to the very last minute; some in interest while others in shock and awe of the beauty of it. As for the sci-fi aspect, it is done very well. The film holds back from giving scientific explanations, it lets our minds go wild. It is like magical realism and we just have to accept the otherworldly supernatural ideas that this film had it going for. It is remarkable; although this is not a huge blockbuster, it keeps things to a small scale and to an intimate level. The handling of emotions within these characters is done superbly; it blends in the action and the emotion really well.It's hard to deny the fact but personally I wished this film held things up to a certain point. It didn't exactly have the resources to pull off certain elements through CGI and I wished it kept things to a certain standpoint so it would be up to us to imagine how things would look like. This film is understandably beautiful but some of the CGI kind of ruined my imagination of certain elements of the story. It could've been done with less of the CGI and I personally would've enjoyed it more.Midnight Special is excellent at its originality. That's what I like most about it, taking certain sci-fi aspects and molding it into something completely new and poignant. The plot is straightforward and the absence of justification within the plot makes everything much more imaginative. Although the CGI wasn't for me, it's hard to deny how intimate this film is within the general spectrum of what's happening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Midnight Special last night and I didn't quite know what to expect. I was a big fan of Jeff Nichols Mud and it had Micheal Shannon once again so I knew I really wanted to see it. Let me just go ahead and say I was blown away by this film in every since of the word. Jeff Nichols has once done it again. This film is absolutely marvelous. It has amazing performances from Micheal Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, and even the kid is fantastic. The movie is a slow paces suspenseful ride and it has a very intriguing plot. I was mainly blown away by some of the suspenseful scenes in the movie where you don't know what is going to happen and it throws something at you that you probably didn't expect. I cant also mention enough the score in this movie is fantastic. It helped set the tone of this film and when those suspenseful scenes went down 75% of it was because of the great music. The one flaw is at times it tries a lot to be like other film like ET and Close Encounters and you can really notice that but it was kind of like a love letter to those film but I would of liked more if it tried to be its own thing which is was for like it first hour. I can highly recommend this film to everyone though as long as you don't mind slower films. 9/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was kinda thrown-off a bit by the films title,to be honest,which is why I openly say that in my summary.I will say that the film does have me wonder if its based off of a book,if so,I would love to see the differences or changes in the overall storyline told and seen in the film!!I also would say that there is almost a whole possibility of maybe at least a second film done that explores this in so many ways,especially from the ending part of the movie.I think either way,this movie held my attention beginning to end,overall pretty well.I know that there's some scenes that seemed like they could have "summed them up' to less scenes since watching the movie and looking back,you get the gist of the scenario,to where when I look back,seems drawn out typa thing in the movies first half or so.Not to give any spoilers away,it doesn't steal away or anything from the entirety of the film.I will say that it would be kinda interesting to have a sequel done,though :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight SpecialThe new film by Jeff Nichols is his best one to date. I caught it at the Silverspot today in Chapel Hill, having viewed it the first time at the Regal in Cary. Both theaters have enormous screens that are so effective in a science fiction thriller. With that said, I'll try not to say one word about the plot or the ending.Midnight Special draws the viewer in even before the first scene appears. We hear an Amber Alert on the radio and that sets the stage for the next 90 minutes of intensity.Roy, played by Michael Shannon in his fourth Nichols film, is on a mission. But is he an abductor or a rescuer? It's not clear at first, and the intricate plot keeps viewers guessing, just as Nichols would like. Roy looks throughout the film like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders. As one of the most expressive actors in films today, he can capture a feeling with just a sideways turn of the head or a furrowed brow. He is magnificent in this film.Joel Egerton (who will also star in the next Nichols film due out next year), is perfect as Roy's accomplice, Lucas. The interplay between the two characters never abates during the film and much of their dialog consists of dramatic one-liners: "it's national," "he's dying," "he's more important." Such simple words, laden with meaning and foreboding.A dark night, a lonely road, a gas station, a phone booth. Darkness lays over the movie like another character. It's eerie, haunting, and effective. One of my favorite night scenes shows a hill, over which the lights of a bus appear. Breathtaking and mysterious.With Adam Stone's sensitive cinematography, simple things become powerful: an empty swing set, the soft glow of a lamp, an early morning sky. One of the most beautiful scenes in the film shows a child playing in the living room. It's as though the camera is eavesdropping while the shot is captured through the framework of the child's parents holding hands.Kirstin Dunst plays Roy's wife and is believable sympathetic in the role of a mother. Her anguish at the film's end brought tears to the eyes of many in the audience and her performance has all the depth of a much older actress.Adam Driver is appealing in his role as an FBI agent who easily inserts himself into the action and takes command in several scenes.Sam Shepherd with his steady gaze and razor sharp eyes, is appropriately cast as the leader of a cult who can speak volumes with just a sideways glance. The music by David Wingo is another strong character in the film. Whether foreshadowing or celebrating, the music is stunning, right up to the end song, Midnight Special, which is sung by Ben Nichols, Jeff's brother. I loved the gritty, lonesome quality of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Special (2016) was not the movie expected to see, in fact it was extremely slow and it never really had that big band at any point in the film. Midnight Special followed the "E.T." format with just a little dark feeling behind it, the movie was generic leaving nothing hidden; you could see what was going to happen well before it happen. The only fairly remote portion of the film was the few minutes at the end.Midnight Special (2016) had a fair cast though it seemed that the script was so short or not enough to be worked with that the acting wasn't so good. You'd think that a little more went into this film but to put it pretty well and clear if you saw the trailer then you only missed the last 5 minutes of the film to know the whole story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the director Jeff Nichol's since I first saw his film Shotgun Stories back in 2008. That film also starred the always great and dependable Michael Shannon. He gives a solid performance here. Joel Edgerton steals every scene he's in. I've never been a big fan of Kirsten Dunsts but she is good here. Adam Driver is good as usual. Many critics are calling the film a modern day Close Encounters and indeed it does give off that vibe but Nichol's makes this film his own personal film. A on the run road trip sic fi movie. It is one of the better sci fi indies I've seen. I cannot wait to see what Nichols next project may be. This may be my least favorite out of the 4 he's directed but its still better than most Hollywood movies that are released these days. MIdnight Special is special in its own kind of way. **** out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and Emotional but Certainly Not for General Audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's indeed a special science fiction thriller inspired by director/writer Jeff Nichols' own life experience who enjoys telling a story at his own vision that's not intently made for general audiences. The film revolves around a kid with supernatural abilities that has similarities to Spielberg's E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind and a little bit of Tomorrowland; its thin plot progresses slowly, less family friendly and humorless but it manages to engage audiences by triggering the eagerness to crack for all secrets behind the mystery. The entire journey is dangerous and emotional thanks to the outstanding performance by Michael Shannon as a caring father and well supported by the charming performance of the son by Jaeden Lieberher. It has limited but powerful scores, it does not reveal all secrets and end ambiguously, rather most importantly the science fiction acts as a metaphor to the beauty of parenthood - faith and sacrifice of parents to ensure the happiness of their children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you do after Spielberg? You do... Midnight Special. You breathe a bit of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a bit of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, a bit of Duel, in other words you take something of what you liked and you scored more or less subliminally, and you make a kind of stew and manage somehow to keep the viewer tense for nearly 2 hours. Not bad, especially when you got help from some very good actors, like those in the film. Music is not bad neither but it's far from what ought to be, we are in... 2016! An honest effort and nothing more. Very predictable for hardcore audience, those from old service station. The character played by Adam Driver (Paul Sevier) is, in my opinion, direct relative with Claude Lacombe (François Truffaut) in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. A 7 with goodwill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer and the cast for this film so I thought I would see this film and I did so by myself in an empty screen. The premise of this film sees a man attempt to run away with his special son from the government and a group of fanatical worshippers. Michael shannon plays roy in this film and he is really good. He had allot of emotion behind his character and you did feel for his character because you really believe that he has nothing but his son to live for. Joel Edgerton pkays his friend and once again he gives a great performance, his more stoic character works for this film ans he works well with shannon in this film. I have never been a big fan of Kirsten dunst but she really works in this film as the kids mother really showing real love for this kid which makes you care more. The main kid also gives a great performance which helps carry the film. Adam driver fresh of of star wars also gives a good performance I just wish his character had a bit more depth and screen time because it feel like he was underutilized. The story has some good drama and you do feel the family dynamic throughout these characters and you are rooting for them. However, there is just too much going on in this film with some characters being easily taken out of the film. The script has some decent drama in it but there isn't any big moment to think of, also not a huge negative but there is like no humour in this film at all. The style is interesting because allot of the film is inside a car and I like the claustrophobic feel of these scenes. However, I do feel like this film has a slight pacing issue and I wasn't a huge fan of the way the ending of this film happened. Overall though this is a decent sci fi that if your interested it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nichols continues his streak with this emotionally intelligent family drama dressed as a sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few under-the-radar writer/directors as hot as Jeff Nichols. The "Mud" and "Take Shelter" filmmaker is an extraordinary visual storyteller, and his streak continues in "Midnight Special," a family drama dressed as a sci-fi thriller.Like those previous films, "Midnight Special" takes place in the American South. The film opens and we see Roy (Michael Shannon, Nichols' muse) and Lucas (Joel Edgerton) on the run in Texas with a young boy, Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher), who we learn is Roy's biological son. Alton is gifted, and his "powers" were the basis of a religious cult led by Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard), Alton's adopted father. Although they are desperate to track down the boy, they aren't alone ? the federal government is looking for Alton because his powers have revealed top secret government information.Any summary of "Midnight Special" ? including that one ? is tough to put together. The story is shot out of a cannon and the audience has to piece together much of the context as it moves along, and wait patiently for Nichols to drop precious nuggets of clarity. Of course, only in the end do we have any semblance of a picture of the truth, and even then the image is far from crystal clear.For those familiar with Nichols' work, "Midnight Special" is most like "Take Shelter" with its intentionally vague and quietly suspenseful demeanor, punctuated by short but big dramatic moments. The plot relies heavily on audience curiosity as to what's going on with Alton and just how big in scope the whole thing could get. If you're new to Nichols, be patient and prepare for a payoff that's as intellectual as it is emotional. In fact, in "Midnight Special" the scales tip in favor of the intellectual.Like the plot, the performances are generally understated with a few moments that showcase the actors. Shannon can blow the roof off a scene, but Roy might the least chewy of any part he's played. Here he's a passionate father ready and willing to cross all moral lines for his son, but he never comes unhinged. Kirsten Dunst, who sneaks into the film well into the runtime as Alton's mother, has a similar part. These are the kinds of quality performances you're less likely to see honored come award season, but once you've seen the film and recognize its qualities, it becomes clear just how pivotal the acting is to its success. Honorable mention to Adam Driver as an NSA agent who undergoes his own transformation in the film.To what will likely be the chagrin of at least a chunk of people who see "Midnight Special," the sci-fi components are not among the best parts of the film. They don't hurt it by any means, but their purpose is to heighten the stakes of what really matters to Nichols ? the family drama and the themes and ideas around belief. So in and of themselves, the effects work and supernatural pieces are just okay, it's how they serve the story that matters. In this way, comparisons of the film to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" are most valid."Midnight Special" could definitely be a little more gripping. It would also be a stronger film if it resonated with the audience throughout its duration rather than sort of dawn on you following the credits and a period of reflection. But that's how Nichols works. He brings such a high level of emotional intelligence to his projects, but he makes you work. You have to trust your instincts and impressions of the film to find the meaning it offers. Luckily, he always makes that experience worth it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Answer Every Question, and Doesn't Need To.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is a movie that thrives on mystery and not knowing. So much so that it makes a conscious effort not to explain everything. We open up in what feels to be the middle of the story, with a child reported missing and the kidnappers face plastered all over the state. Thing is, the kidnapper is the child's own father as he attempts to get him to a set of co-ordinates on a certain date. We never see him break his child out of the religious cult that holds him, we never see him hook up with a childhood friend and persuade him to help, we never learn how the father got these co-ordinates or why he's so certain he needs to get his son to them. Above all, we don't need to know or see those things happen. The father and his son are pursued across the country by both the religious cult and the government.It can be a bit of a slow-burner, but I never once found it boring or dragging. I was constantly thinking my way through the movie's runtime, asking myself questions that may or may not get answered. Who, or what, is the boy? How did he get these powers? Where are they going, and why? What's at the end of the yellow brick road? If you start watching the movie (or just watch the trailer) and think "aliens", that's exactly what I did, and I was wrong...kind of, although of course I'm not going to spoil that.While the film is focused on giving us a tense sci-fi thriller, it does spend a little time trying to juggle some heavy themes and ideas as well. On the grander scale there's the theme of surveillance and government meddling as they seek to capture the boy to use as a weapon. There's also the religious cult who used him as their saviour, believing him to be their key to heaven at the end times. While neither of these weighty themes are explored to their full potential, they're certainly toyed around with. On the more intimate side there's the theme of family. There was something genuinely heartwarming about seeing the family re-united, but the real relationship lies between the father and son. It drives the narrative and, as a father myself, I couldn't help but relate.Michael Shannon plays Roy Tomlin, the boy's father. While I wouldn't call it his most engaging performance, it was certainly a performance I could empathise with. If there's one thing Shannon can do, it's suggest the inner workings of his character just with a look, and Roy was constantly stricken with worry for his son's wellbeing and making sure he got the care he needed. Kirsten Dunst as the mother Sarah was also a key part of making the family dynamic work. Her reuniting with her son for the first time in years felt so strong and real. Joel Edgerton did really well as the recently enlightened childhood friend of Roy's. In some ways he's the muscle and the facilitator that enables Roy and Sarah to concentrate on Alton, in others he's a mirror of the audience, just being dragged along for the ride, privy to unbelievable sights, and rooting for the family. Adam Driver also deserves a mention for his nerdy, curious NSA agent Paul Sevier. However I have to say, despite all these pros, it's Jaeden Lieberher who steals the show as the boy, Alton. He's not just a helpless kid taken for a ride, and his moment of enlightenment brings us a new side to him, but he struggles with his powers and his deteriorates as he goes. Fantastic performance for such a young actor.Midnight Special is a great indie sci-fi. It kept me on the edge of my seat almost constantly, and answered all the most important questions I had, while also not ruining my sense of wonder. Alton wasn't an alien, but I'm not entirely sure exactly what he was, and I love that. I love that the movie kept it's sense of mystery right up to the end credits. The effect work and soundtrack was also great, both to look at and to add to the suspense. I give Midnight Special a really enjoyable 8/10. Would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reaching to worlds beyond our power to grasp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Named after an old chain-gang work song about the light of a passing train being a symbol of redemption, Jeff Nichols ("Mud") Midnight Special is an enigmatic science-fiction thriller about a boy with special powers and his parents whose bridge of love between them knows no worldly boundaries. Set in the American South, the film pays homage to popular sci-fi movies of the late 70s and early 80s, but never reaches the heights of their enchantment. Opening in a dark motel room with windows boarded shut, an Amber Alert is announced on an old tube television, telling us that an eight-year-old boy has been kidnapped. In the room, the slight boy, Alton (Jaeden Lieberher, "St. Vincent's") sits between two beds wearing night-vision goggles but shows no emotion as he is abruptly put in the back seat of a 1972 Chevelle by two older men who look like kidnappers in a big hurry.We soon learn that the two men are Roy Tomlin (Michael Shannon, "Take Shelter"), Alton's biological father and Roy's close friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton, "Black Mass"), a State Trooper he has known since childhood. We shift to a Texas religious community known as the Third Heaven Ranch, where we learn that the boy was raised by the Ranch's charismatic leader, Calvin Meyer, (Sam Shepard, "August, Osage County"). Entranced by the streams of blue light that radiate from the boys' eyes, Meyer and his flock believe that Alton is a spiritual being, a savior who can lead the world to a spiritual renaissance.As the FBI suddenly storms into the church, asking everyone in attendance to submit to questioning because of a sudden large purchase of guns, it is clear that the FBI, the local police, and NSA operatives, because of his ability to read secret codes and coordinates, see the boy not as a savior but as a security threat. On the run, Roy and Lucas are soon joined by the boy's mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst, "The Two Faces of January") who is thrilled to see her son again. Looking at comic books in the back seat, Alton is wearing goggles to control the beams of blinding light that emanate from his eyes when he is upset and headphones to drown out the radio and satellite transmissions he hears in his head.Pursued by federal agents, as well as by NSA operative Sevier (Adam Driver), Roy will stop at nothing to deliver his son to his destination. Cinematographer Adam Stone fully captures the mood of the lonely back roads of the South where they drive, seeking a location known only to Alton. His health is failing and there is little time left to fulfill his destiny. According to Nichols, "They're on the run, they're being hunted and, at the same time, they're racing towards something important, though we don't immediately know what it is." It may also be that we are not supposed to know but must simply surrender to the unknown and unknowable nature of the world we find ourselves in.Assisted by a powerful original score by David Wingo, as the tension increases, our understanding expands little by little, but there are always more questions than answers. In a masterful set-piece, as they stop for gas, Alton gets out of the car against Roy's instructions beams of light from his eyes cause a satellite to explode doing massive damage to the gas station. Midnight Special is a chase movie, a family drama, and a story of reaching to worlds beyond our power to grasp. While it bravely suggests that we can evolve and be greater than we are now, questions come to mind about whether Alton's special powers could have been used to benefit people on Earth, end sickness, wars, and hatred or prepare people on Earth for the next step in evolution which he represents.Nichols respects his audience and does not spoon feed us with voice-overs or emotional cues, yet we never really get to know any of the characters to the point that we care about them and the film's deliberate obscurity keeps us more distracted than involved. Marred by a derivative and too literal ending, Midnight Special strives for profundity but lacks the emotional resonance that makes for a truly profound experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This type of film is one I would not normally visit the cinema to see. For my taste, cinema is for spectacle and Blu-Ray for intimacy. However, having read some very positive comments on the cinematography, acting and overall direction of the film I thought it was worth a big screen experience. In that sense, I was right to do so. The skill of the director and his team is outstanding. Intimate, yet sweeping, reserved and nuanced and with a few wonderfully sculpted scenes, this film certainly deserves accolades for the way it was made. The end product is a delight to behold.But, and this is one significant BUT, the screenplay is pretty poor.There's no other way to put it. I love a slow burner, I love high-concept movies and I love subtlety (Star Trek the Motion Picture is one of my all-time favourite movies, for example). What I do NOT love is getting to the mid-point of a film and realizing I know exactly where all the character arcs are going and exactly what's going to happen at the end. If you're a fan of sci-fi there is absolutely nothing here you haven't seen many times before. No new ground is broken whatsoever, even M Night Shyamalan's Signs has more novelty to it! This could quite easily have been an episode of The X-Files or Fringe, and not one of the more interesting ones.Not only that, but in this age of neo-noir TV I expect to be challenged. I thought that with the 12A (UK rating) and the comments of "some people say this is boring and slow but..." there may have been a little more going on for the mature audience. But there was no real emotion to the script, no real challenge, and no need for the audience to step outside their comfort zone. Considering the set-up - the premise of the boy's community, the nature of his family's sacrifices and the ending of the film - there was enough potential for at least one Matthew McConaugheys worth of emotional scripting. Not at all. The subtlety of the directing was matched by a lack of emotional depth of the characters. It wasn't that the director underplayed the emotional turmoil faced by the characters, the emotional turmoil simply wasn't in the script. Nuance is great, but the nuance has to be obscuring believably profound human experiences. In this case the nuance was a façade.Perhaps I've been round the block too many times - I'm older than the director after all. Youngsters, go enjoy yourselves and ignore the old fogey going on about how everything the "kids of today" love is just a rehashed version of what was brand-new when he was young. There really is a lot going for this film. However, if you know your onions as I do you'll find there is nothing imaginative or ground-breaking here. At all. Sorry Jeff, stick to the (brilliant) directing and leave the screenplay-writing to someone better. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year ago, I went to go see a little Independent sci-fi film called EX MACHINA and was rewarded with one of my favorite films of 2015. So, yesterday, when I went to go see a little independent sci-film called MIDNIGHT SPECIAL, I hoped history would repeat itself.It did.MIDNIGHT SPECIAL, like EX MACHINA before it, falls into a category of movies that I really, really like - SMART SCIENCE FICTION. Using the fantastic elements of Science Fiction, a SMART SCIENCE FICTION (not Sci-Fi) film uses the tropes of the fantastical to relate an allegorical story using intelligent conversation, smart plotting and good acting and does not rely (heavily) on special effects, explosions and big battles with aliens at the end.That is what this film is. Written and Directed by Independent Film stalwart, Jeff Nichols, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL tells the story of the search for Alton Meyer (a very good Jaeden Lieberher), a young boy with extraordinary powers who has been "kidnapped" by his birth father (Michael Shannon). Is he a military weapon? Is he misunderstood? Is he an alien? Is he a god? This film slowly unfolds those questions leading us to a very satisfying answer at the end.Director Nichols is new to me, but is not new to Independent films. He had been critically acclaimed for MUD and TAKE SHELTER (films that I now will have to check out). I really liked how he wrote/directed this film. We jump right in the middle of the action and he assumes that we, the audience are SMART ENOUGH to figure things out as we go along (as opposed to spoon-feeding us background and answers). The dialogue is sparse and sharp and the pictures he puts on the screen are interesting without being showy. This type of film would not work without strong acting at it's center, and it gets it in spades. Nichols' regular Michael Shannon is front and center as Alton's father who "kidnaps" Alton from the cult religious camp (led by the always watchable Sam Shepard) that see Alton as a god. He is assisted by his childhood buddy, Lucas (a silent and taciturn Joel Edgerton). Along the way, they pick up Lucas' mother (Kirsten Dunst) and are chased by the NSA (Adam Driver). All 4 of these actors are strong, and they need to be as the dialogue is (as I have stated earlier) sparse and they have to express feelings of anxiety and dread with a look or small gesture. They all do it well.At the center of it all is Jaeden Lieberher's Alton. He presents him as a "matter of fact" kid who just tells things like they are. I was impressed by this young actor and, when I looked him up, realized that he was the young kid in another small, independent film, ST. VINCENT (starring Bill Murray - if you haven't seen this, check it out). I am fearful that Lieberher is going to fall under the Maze Runner/Allegient spell, but looking at his IMDb page, he'll be in the Colin Trevorrow directed film, BOOK OF HENRY also starring Jacob Trembley (ROOM), so I am cautiously optimistic.MIDNIGHT SPECIAL is a deliberately paced film (some would look at that as code word for slow), so you'll need to be patient, but if you are, you will be rewarded.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Jeff Nichols has delivered to well received films in the forms of Take Shelter and Mud, Midnight Special marks the first time that the writer/director has helmed a studio production with a budget that exceeds $10million. In short, this may prove to be make or break for the talented young filmmaker and luckily, he's crafted one of the best films of 2016 that deserves all of your attention.Though the storyline within Midnight Special may be familiar (government seeks to capture an individual with extraordinary powers believing them to be a weapon) it's presentation is different to any previous incarnations seen on screen. While superhero films that feature a premise such as this usually utilise it as a side story amongst the action set pieces, Nichols makes it the entire focus of his film, creating a human drama that is driven by it's characters. At the centre of the film is father, Roy (Michael Shannon), and his son, Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), a boy that has the ability to intercept and verbally broadcast satellite signals, emit beams of light from his eyes, and manipulate objects with his mind.Both of the film's leads do a fantastic job throughout, with Michael Shannon in particular delivering a memorable performance. Having proved himself to be a powerhouse on screen in recent years with his commanding presence, Shannon's role in Midnight Special isn't as flashy as some of his other work, yet it's the delicate nature of it that makes him standout. With a glare that could stop a charging rhinoceros, he's able to balance his performance between desperation and ruthlessness perfectly, silently pondering his next move in one scene and urging his friend to shoot a police officer by the side of the road in the next. Jaeden Liberher also deserves his fair share of praise thanks to his extremely mature outing as Alton which shows the young actor's ability to hold his own against established character actors in any given scene as his character is tormented by his powers. Another prominent figure in the film is Lucas (Joel Edgerton), a state trooper and Roy's friend who agrees to help the two on their journey. Joel Edgerton continues to make interesting choices in his career after his own turn as a writer/director in The Gift and though his performance as Lucas requires more restraint than some of his previous roles, it remains just as impressive.In order for these performances to work, however, the story in which they feature has to be equally as strong and thankfully, Nichols has yet again showcased his talents as a filmmaker. Offering a mystery to audiences from the very start, he allows the story to unfold through the interactions of it's characters, revealing key plot points through dialogue that feels natural rather than being filled with exposition. Nichols's ability to create tension is also on show once again following the swamp shootout in Mud, this time, however, it's in a completely different environment as an innocent sunrise aims to get hearts racing and succeeds. Scenes such as this and a shower of satellite debris striking a petrol station make Midnight Special not just a human drama but also a thriller, while it's touching climax manages to incorporate elements of sci-fi that wouldn't feel out of place in some of Spielberg's best work. Blending genres together is never an easy task, yet Nichols manages to do it not only successfully here, but also better than most directors could ever hope to achieve.There are, unfortunately, several weak points within the film and while some of it's strongest aspects are it's three lead characters, it's the secondary ones that cause it to falter in places. Kirsten Dunst feels out of place, popping up in the latter half of the film as Alton's mother, and her character never receives full development after she is introduced with her reasons for being excommunicated from the cult being alluded to yet never fully explored. Similarly, Adam Driver is criminally underused as FBI specialist Paul Sevier following his scene stealing performance in The Force Awakens. Never able to fully delve into the character, Driver does his best with the material and manages to provide several moments of comic relief as an agent out of his depth.Elsewhere, some elements of the plot introduced at the beginning of the film are abandoned as the climax approaches, particularly those that revolve around Alton being seen as a 'saviour' by the cult he belonged to. Interesting concepts are mentioned by members during FBI interviews ? Alton's verbal broadcasts of satellite signals providing scripture for the cult being one of them ? yet during the latter half of the film, the group completely disappear, along with any beliefs that Alton was a Christ-like figure. Had these religious undertones featured prominently throughout the story and been offered a fitting conclusion, there may have been even more interesting material to find in the film, however, the focus is placed squarely upon the central characters as it draws to a close and in no way is that a disappointment.Despite a few minor flaws, Midnight Special proves to be one of the best films of 2016 so far thanks to strong performances from it's two leads and an engaging story that successfully blends genres. Jeff Nichols continues to grow as both a writer and a director and if this is anything to go by, his next feature Loving should be very special indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIDNIGHT SPECIAL (2016) **1/2 Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Jaeden Lieberher, Adam Driver, Sam Shepard. Filmmaker Jeff Nichols and muse Shannon reunite in this hit-and-miss collaboration about a father's love for his 'gifted' son's otherworldly powers that echoes John Carpenter's STARMAN. Shannon continues to be low-key with simmering moments of intelligence hidden under that foreboding presence and is key to this story involving his beleaguered yet endearing father to the young Lieberher (very good) as a child with presence and alarming capabilities in this road trip/sci-fi hybrid. Although the chase sequences are rote the underpinnings of bond between child and parent are the real juice here and delivered in spades. Dunst is particularly remarkable in a less-is-more less showy turn as the estranged mother and Edgerton also underscores loyalties beyond his realm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a straightforward and mainstream sci-fi story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Midnight Special" (2016) is not a traditional sci-fi story, albeit it's a good one. The narrative here isn't a very traditional or made for a mainstream audiences - it can be a bit draggy, but never ever boring.Performances were uniformly good by all involved. Writing and directing were very solid. I won't soil anything, but on it's core "Midnight Special" i think is a bit of a road movie, which sometimes plays like "E.T.", although in a very different mood. Yet i found myself intrigued during the whole ride, as i love sci-fi stories, this one had goods to offer along the way.Overall, "Midnight Special" isn't another Marvel story about superhero origins. Although it can play like a superhero origins, i liked the ending, and would like to see some sequel were they explore what we have seen at the end more closely. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so unique and masterfully presented; it's absolutely stunning. Nichols delivers a heart-felt story of a parent's worry with a mix of suspense and gorgeous alternate-world sci-fi. It's relatable on a human level, and engaging with a beautiful cinematic experience.Michael Shannon's performance is touching. For an generally very intense actor (but still consistently good), he shows a lot of heart and vulnerability in this which is great to see. Joel Edgerton in a great supporting role also delivers a quality performance that has become expected of such a great actor. Great all round casting.See this on the big screen where it is supposed to be seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols (Mud 2012, Take Shelter 2011?) is a gifted artist, provided with rich imagination and a particular talent for making up interesting situations.The present film is one of his best: the story revolves around a special family and it's full of catching ideas, well developed and entertaining.In the end you will find that some things are left untold, some questions unanswered and some words unspoken. But this, for me, only made things more intriguing.I hope that everybody who likes adventure and science fiction would agree that this is a nice film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful, compelling and beguiling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Jeff Nichols has made one of the most underrated motion pictures of this millennium, Take Shelter, a movie that I would comfortably place in my top 50 of all time. With his latest effort receiving a very limited release and a non-existent marketing campaign, it seems Nichols' work is destined to stay on the outer rim of cinema. Which is a travesty, because once again he has crafted a marvellous film. From the opening scene there is instant intrigue; the tone is quickly established as sitting slightly left of centre and dabbling in multiple genres, resulting in an unnerving (but exciting) sensation that the story could go in any direction. To mention almost anything about the plot would encroach into spoiler territory, but suffice to say there are various groups of people who want to get hold of 8-year-old Alton (the remarkably captivating Jaeden Lieberher), for reasons unknown at the onset. By drip-feeding information and character motivation methodically and intelligently, Nichols expertly builds tension until climaxing each act with an enthralling set piece, whilst the big (idea) finale is compelling and evocative. Underlying the emotional and intellectual power of the story is the unsettling and apprehensive atmosphere, generated by Adam Stone's stunning cinematography, David Wingo's deeply affecting score and Nichols' assured direction. Along with wonder kid Lieberher, the familiar-faced cast ? Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Adam Driver and Kirsten Dunst ? are all completely on point too, but it's a shame Sam Shepard's role was so small. Thought provoking, enigmatic and utterly mesmerising, Midnight Special is yet another masterful cinematic creation from the uber-talented Nichols, that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of "Take Shelter", I was eagerly anticipating Jeff Nichols' new feature, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. Take the story of a boy with special powers, a cult that worships him as a messiah, a government that believes him to be a weapon, and a father that will do anything to protect him, and you have one of the most interesting and intense films I have seen this year. The acting is superb all around, really sensational from all parties involved, and the SFX is used thoughtfully, without being overwhelming or scene stealing until the very end. Basically, this is an "Apocalyptic drama" where things might not be exactly what they seem, but towards the end, you will get goosebumps at how masterfully it was accomplished. If you like slow burn films like Take Shelter and The Signal (2014), and love movies that make great use of special effects without being overwhelming, this movie is for you. It is a testament to a film maker who has complete control of his craft, and understands how to build a story with nuance, skill, and tact. Overall, a thrilling experience from beginning to end, and a film that will have you thinking for days after you have watched it. Simply brilliant in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting blend of thrills, dazzle and mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special earns an uneasy recommendation from me. I love it, tremendously, but the missus hates it and said it is 112 minutes she can't get back. If ever there is a more divisive film, this is it. Which ever point of view one decides to take, this is a film that is truly unique and searingly unforgettable.IMHO it is best to go in not knowing the plot. I will just say it is a sci-fi-drama-chase genre film. Roy (Michael Shannon) and his biological son, Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher), are escaping various parties, after discovering that Alton has special powers. This is writer-director Jeff Nichols' fourth feature film and his most adventurous. His last two, Take Shelter and Mud, are evocative and provocative character-driven mood pieces. Midnight Special pulses in the same vein of inventiveness and risks, and it is a film that refuses to be like any other films out there. I can see inspiration drawn from Spielberg, Kubrick and Hitchcock, based on an unrealised idea from M. Night Shyamalan's work desk. But yet, Midnight Special manages to be special in its own way. It refuses to divulge details and context in typical avalanches and we are only given a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in each scene. He stages scenes with meticulous details, laden with enigmas caught in the webs of mystery. He coaxes empathy and anguished tension from his actors. The pace is deliberate but never prodding and always purposeful. He builds his scenes with the craft of an old hand, with cresting waves of dread, mystery and tension, pulled by a looming tempest. Questions of "why this why that" whiz across my mind continuously, but unlike most films I was totally immersed in the beguiling story as I prayed for a payoff that would reward my patience, and it certainly did. Midnight Special has plot-holes the size of craters but a slew of empathetic performances with nary a wrong note smooths it out for me. Sam Shepherd appears as the leader of a cult and his few minutes of screen time nails down what Alton Meyer could be. This also marks the fourth consecutive time Michael Shannon has worked with Jeff Nichols and he is a revelation. His dogged and driven character drives the story. For me, the uncanny and moving relationship between the father and the son is the glue that cements all the unevenness of the narrative. Joel Edgerton and Kirsten Dunst also give calibrated performances. Adam Driver is a casting choice from the left field and it totally worked. All this is also buoyed by the sublime cinematography and a music score which is a layering character itself. In the end, I still had many questions left unanswered but they never tarnished what is one of the most audacious chase genre film I have ever seen - riveting blend of thrills, dazzle and mystery. But I have to say these questions bothered my wifey to no end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Compact "FRINGE" Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special caught me by surprise as I had not heard of it prior to seeing it. I was immediately reminded of M. Night Shyamalan in a good way. It's not from Mr. Shyamaian however as it was written and directed by Jeff Nichols. Mr. Nichols has been involved with some well reviewed movies in his approximately ten-years of work. Add Midnight Special to his growing resume.If you liked the Fox Sci-Fi series "Fringe" then you should find Midnight Special to your liking, however many who never watched that TV series may like this more compact story as opposed to Fringe encompassing multiple stories over five years. The shared DNA present here is there are 2 parallel universes to which their is a "tear" involving a person from one world being out of place in the other world. This causes problems which the out of place person, an 8-year old boy, has a time and date in which he can return to his rightful world. Of course, if it was simple for him to do so it would be boring and no fun whatsoever. Not to worry as the journey will be fraught with those seeking to stop him.Nichols has placed Michael Shannon in several of his movies. In Midnight Special Shannon works as usual coolly portraying a complicated, and heavily burdened, father, Roy Tomlin, who is tasked with aiding his son Alton's journey to return to his rightful world. Instead of making Roy sympathetic, Shannon, and writer/director Nichols, conjure up a weary very resigned man who will stop at nothing to, in effect, to lose his son so that son will live - and two worlds will be righted. Roy is aided by an unlikely old friend named Lucas played by Joel Egerton. Lucas has more remarkably than even Roy also given up his former normal life. Roy and Lucas have seen something earth shattering through Alton Tomlin's eyes (you'll have to see this) and they've given up everything else in hopes of keeping two universes from unraveling. It's an all or nothing journey that simply must be completed.While there's nothing over the top about the cinematography it does it's job well and gets out of the way. As for the story itself, at first I thought the religious sect side-story was a bit silly, but then I realized, as I watched, it was a kind of parody about zealot nuts who many times get a few things right and end up being totally wrong as well as reverting to violence. This while the government, whose job is to protect us all, end up usually making an even worse mess before control is restored. It's hard to argue with this so it all gels as the race to fix the cosmic dilemma plays out.This is a solid Sci-Fi movie that while not entirely original stands as something different enough to keep you watching. I'd say it's pretty well done and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What if he doesn't belong with us?....."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always a relief when a lovely, unique, indie film swoops in under the radar and proves to possess more heart, and far more brains than other recent entries within its genre. Created and shot on an approximate budget of 18 million dollars, Jeff Nichols' 'Midnight Special' wonderfully pays homage to classic sci-fi films of the '70s, without ripping them off. Of course, it's got elements of Spielberg and Carpenter pumping through its veins, but at its core, we have Nichols expressing a story of parenthood. A touching bond between father and son, showcased via his ability handle genuine human emotions and indie sensibilities, in his first studio film.We're not deeply focused upon aliens and spaceships here. We are directed towards Alton Meyer (played by Jaeden Lieberher, wonderful in St. Vincent) who we first encounter underneath a white motel bed sheet, reading a comic book? through a pair of goggles. As we discover from a television news broadcast, he's been kidnapped by Roy, his biological father. Michael Shannon (who has appeared in all of Nichol's films up to this point) portrays Roy to brutally honest perfection, as you'd expect from his killer track record so far. Switching from his haunting presence in last year's '99 Homes', he's now the one who is terrified here. Terrified of the unknown, which we are too.As writer and director of the lovely slice of sci-fi, Nichols decides to drop us in right in the middle of action, with no back story, no spoon-feeding, no answers. Bitch about it all you want; I think it was the right choice. As an audience, 'Midnight Special' treats you as intelligent being, someone able to figure out the dot points without having them spelled out to you. It's a slow burner, and somewhat constrained in terms of story, but it's got a vivid imagination. Just as much as any other science fiction piece out there? maybe more.Along for the ride is Lucas (Joel Edgerton) and Sarah Tomlin (Kirsten Dunst), Alton's biological mother. Both are excellent.So what's the 411? Well, Alton is no ordinary child. He sleeps during the day, and is active during the night-time ? and "No, he's not a vampire!". When in contact with the sun, he expresses strange supernatural abilities involving beams of blue light shining from his eyes. This is merely the introduction of his strange, otherworldly powers. The FBI want him. A religious cult misses him. Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) is fascinated by him. Why? I'm not going to tell you. Nichols doesn't initially either. 'Midnight Special' is all about the mystery, the way it slowly unravels. Sit back and enjoy.In terms of score, David Wingo certainly doesn't opt for booming strings and brass sections. What he delivers is still exciting, but in a far different way. Slow building piano/synth pieces that climax just when the time is right, especially during the opening title appearance. If done right, these moments have the potential to send tingles down an audience's spine. They certainly went down mine.Some pieces threaten to crescendo, but never quite do. The same could be said about certain points in the film itself (one of the few minor criticisms I'd have with it). But not to worry, for the vast majority of its screen time, 'Midnight Special' is a unique ride. A quiet, contemplative science fiction piece expressed as a tribute to that wonderful bond, between parent and child. Seems rather fitting, considering Nichols was a relatively new father at the time he wrote the film's screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight special is a very interesting film with an incredibly small budget, compared to most films in its genre these days. This film shows what can be achieved even without having an enormous budget, the highlight achievements being character development and small uses of CGI. The start of the film gets you straight into the thick of the story, which I feel worked really well considering that most background information of the story is told throughout the film. Within 10 minutes I felt the emotional connection between Roy ( Michael Shannon ) and his son Alton ( Jaeden Lieberher ), the fear and love Roy has as well as the danger Alton poses, really shows. The same goes for the relationship between Roy and Lucas ( Joel Edgerton ) , and Roy with Alton's mother Sarah ( Kirsten Dunst ) the film does a really good job of setting up interesting relationships between characters which the I feel the audience can really gravitate towards. As for the performance's across the hole board we're strong, although nothing mind blowing which it didn't need to be, there was not one weak spot. Michael Shannon , Joel Edgerton , Sam Shepard and Adam Driver were all good but I feel that Kirsten Dunst and especially Jaeden Lieberher were marginally above the rest. As the for the CGI in the film, I thought was pulled off quite well. It was not over used and I believe that is the best decision that director Jeff Nichols did considering the type of film this is. Watching this film it doesn't show that there is a small budget , meaning lower quality of effects, which some films has problem with but this one doesn't. The final thing to take away from this film is its director Jeff Nichols, who I believe will become a house hold name from years to come. This film is a real achievement considering this is only his third full length feature film, I think he now deserves a shot at directing a bigger scale film, maybe even a franchise. Finally this film is good Sci-Fi drama with and number of suspense and thriller elements to it, however do not go into this film expecting a full on Sci-Fi action film because it is not that, this film at its core is about characters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Jeff Nichols' flair for creating great films on a smallish budget continues with this intriguing and visually arresting sci-fi chase movie about a boy who is not like us. Midnight Special is genuinely one of those films where it's best enjoyed if you know as little about it as possible, but the key question running through the film is: what makes the boy Aldon so special and why are the FBI and a Texas cult so interested in him? Midnight Special is multi-dimensional; touching on the themes of faith, family, and a Spielbergian style of science fiction not dissimilar to Close Encounters. Nichols tantalisingly drip-feeds you clues throughout the film in a compelling manner while David Wingo's excellent score adds a sense of eeriness to each of the scenes. The film's final act is the deal-breaker, for me it worked but you're either going to go with the flow or be put off by its sheer strangeness.Also here are great performances from Michael Shannon and in particular Adam Driver- demonstrating an impressive range as he's just as excellent as an NSA agent in this as he was as Kylo Ren. While the dialogue is not particularly punchy or memorable and the faith theme is left behind towards the end, its still likely to be one of the better constructed stories on film this year. Midnight Special leaves you with a thousand questions, but still feeling satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is about a boy who has strange powers. He is being saved by his birthparents, from the FBI. I appreciate this film very much because it broke two of barriers. I'm not talking about the actual filmmaking. These barriers are about when films can be released. This is a quality film in the technical aspects of filmmaking. Usually, we have a movie like Age of Adaline that comes out around this time that are utterly mediocre films. This seems like it could be an Oscar bait movie that would come out in December. I'm not saying its worthy of an Oscar, but it has the feel of an Oscar bait film. Also, it has good CINEMATOGRAPHY. I saw 10 cloverfield lane recently, and it was really good, but I could tell it was dumped in the spring because of the mediocre cinematography. Once again, I'm not saying this movie has great cinematography, but it is decent in that department. Also the movie builds up tension, unlike a lot of blockbusters (IM TALKING TO YOU SPECTRE) that makes the movie interesting. This is the thing that saves the film, because it is extremely slow. Not much happens in this film. In the end I say that on the Grizzly Scale of Quality, it is a 6.9: Wait for Redbox. I really didn't feel any different afterwords, but I do appreciate the quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Midnight Special", starring Michael Shannon-Boardwalk Empire_tv, Man of Steel; Joel Edgerton-The Gift, Star Wars:Episode 3-Revenge of the Sith; Kirsten Dunst-Fargo_tv, The Crow:Salvation; Adam Driver-Kylo Ren in Star Wars:Episode 7-The Force Awakens, This is Where I Leave You and Jaeden Lieberher-Aloha, St. Vincent.This is a sci-fi mystery that felt a little like it could have been an X-Files episode. It starts out with Michael and Joel packing their bags in a motel room, including firearms of varying calibers, and Jaeden is sitting on the floor, reading a comic book. On the TV screen is a report of an eight year old boy being kidnapped and a picture of Michael is flashed across the screen, as a person of interest. Then, a building is shown being raided by the police and you learn that it is a cult of some kind that has a connection to the fugitives. Adam shows up as some kind of government agent, leading an FBI team-Adam is not an FBI agent-asking the cult members questions about Jaeden. Kirsten is Jaeden's mother. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, Jaeden wears a pair of goggles and when he takes them off, he demonstrates some special powers that are straight out of the comic books he likes to read so much. Since Jaeden is light sensitive, they do most of their traveling at night and sleep during the day, so I'm guessing, that is what the title is referring to-Midnight Special. Even though it was a mystery at first about what was going on, things are eventually explained. It's rated "PG-13" for action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 51 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon leaving the theatre for the new film, Midnight Special, I could hear a young couple who had been in the theatre, saying to one another about how the critics had gotten this film completely wrong and ultimately displaying their distaste for it as well as bringing up the important point that the critics are not always right and in this case I wholeheartedly agree. As, I've said in reviews prior to this one, I tend to pick the films I see and review for this site very carefully. Either, I will go see something being a fan of the certain director, writer, or star of said film, or more often than not, I will go with what the critics are saying the majority of the time and if a film is reviewed well I will pay to go and see it and then review it here on this site. How could the critics have botched it so terribly with this film though? I was expecting based on the reviews I read, a film that was going to be the next groundbreaking science fiction film and overall a spectacular achievement and that is what the critics reviews will lead you to believe, but believe me the end product could not be further from the truth. This is a film where all plausibility and logic seem to have been clearly and almost intentionally avoided from everyone who made this film. Some of the dialogue and scenes in this film feel so incredibly goofy and like they belong in another movie altogether, but alas they are all edited in here. The film tries to play with it's subject matter as seriously as it can with no moments of calm, or lightness to brighten the mood, which is fine, but a film that is trying to be so deadpan serious with subject matter and plots and twists this ludicrous and almost embarrassingly bad, really has a problem with it. We also have some talented actors here who have all completely gone to waste. At times their performances feel completely wooden and at other times when they try to show the least bit of emotion, it ends up feeling so incredibly overdone that it borders on camp. This is a film that could write a book on how to be cold, distant and completely isolate an audience from it's subject matter by not allowing us the viewers to connect, or empathize with these characters in any way. The whole film just continues in front of our very eyes with us not giving one single ounce of interest, or curiosity as to where it will end up, or what will happen to the characters. The film doesn't seem to have any interest in developing these characters other than the fact that it wants them to appear vague and mysterious. They could have at least made them interesting, or given some depth to them because watching these lifeless and uninteresting characters is a real bore and this film is less than two hours for it's whole running time and yet it almost feels like an eternity watching these characters go through this plot less and very dull mess. It's too bad because in a sense I could see how given this film a complete tune up and rewrite, it could have perhaps in someone else's hands could have been a lot more interesting and a better film, but what we have here is complete gibberish that should never have been allowed to be made. Why the critics praised this film so much I will never know. Other than some very impressive cinematography and lighting the whole rest of the film feels amateurish in the worst way possible. Save your coins till something better comes your way. A total and inexcusable mess from start to finish and further proof that the critics do not always get it right and they should have been put out to the doghouse for this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A late night 80's road movie, but not that special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I was watching this at home, I'm not sure I'd have been able to watch it all in one go. Its such a slow, sleepy film, that you'd be hard pressed to stay awake. It has the vibes of Blood Simple. The 80s throwback aesthetics of Drive, The Guest, Cold in July, It Follows. Old cars, dark roads, motels, the occasional shotgun, synth score - check. All that sounds terrific and the kind of thing I love watching, but with Midnight Special it seemed to rely far too much on those things. They weren't the cherry on the cake - they WERE the cake. The two other positives are Shannon's ever-reliable intensity and acting, and the sense of mystery which is fairly well handled and effective. This proves to be a wasted opportunity though, because the mystery is pretty flat and pointless by the time it unravels, something you might find in a weak young-adult story. Everything else feels under-developed. Dunst, Edgerton, Driver, the boy and everyone else - they're so underwritten and dull as characters. The central gimmick of the boys powers is used so sparingly that when it happens, it feels like "oh good, another CGI moment to wake me up". My main issue is that whereas with Nichols' far superior Take Shelter, the few special effects shots were hugely supported by a layered story of mental illness, the strength of love and caring, and the tension of a relationship being torn apart by the strains. With Midnight Special, there's no layering, its just very flat and unsubstantial. It reminded me of the much better films that clearly influenced it - DARYL, Flight of the Navigator - and how much more watchable (and re-watchable) and fun those kinds of films are. Midnight Special goes to such lengths to repress itself for the sake of appearing to be better than it is, that it smothers itself to death. So I'm mixed - it was OK, some strong aspects, and at least its a little different. Sits nicely in the modern 80s throwback collection, but sad it wasn't better than it was, considering the interesting premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect World and Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is about a father (and friend) who "kidnaps" his son in order to protect him from the government and their own cult, whilst discovering that the boy is meant for something greater.The Acting was solid. Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton shine as Roy and Lucas, the father and his friend on the run to protect the super powered Alton. The two have this strong bond in the film mostly reinforced through Edgerton's Lucas, creating this sort of brotherly love between the two as they would kill, fight and/or die for one another (or at least Edgerton will).The bond between Roy and Alton is pivotal to the film and is the driving force of it. At the end of the day Midnight Special is about a fathers love for his son and the lengths that he will go to, to make sure his son survives, even if that means letting him go.The Film is very similar to that of Clint Eastwood's A Perfect World, only with a sci fi element applied. It's been stated that the film's influences have been 80's Sci Fi movies, most notably John Carpenters Starman. With this in mind the film uses the Tarantino method, picking from and copying other films along the way to make a film (not done as Tarantino would have might I add). The film to me feels unoriginal because of it, more specifically it's plot which is basically A Perfect World and E.T.At the start of the film we are thrown right into the mix, having to piece together the situation as it progresses. The film opens with questions and closes with even more, leaving you rather (un)satisfied as it doesn't answer some of its questions and instead seems to add more on top. Characters fizzle out as the plot progresses, more specifically the cult to which by the close of the film is nowhere in sight.Overall Midnight Special takes from the best. Its unoriginal plot is driven through the use of intriguing direction, strong acting and their on screen chemistry. Although having a lack of answers i'm not sure it needed to, creating a rather ambiguous film which can be seen in the films start, as well as its beautiful final frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to "Close Encounters" on the road to nowhere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is clearly a tribute to the classic Sci-Fi epic "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". There are numerous hints to this throughout the film, from the huge amounts of travelling to the unsettling habits and mannerisms of various different characters. However Midnight Special was a huge disappointment for me. While I followed everything going on in the film the way the plot was structured made no sense. Scenes and locations that were mere plot devices and held no actual relevance to the film were focused on for far too long, especially at the start of the film, which lulls you into thinking that these will play major parts in the film when in fact they are irrelevant. None of the characters were that interesting either. The only characters with unique personalities were the child, the focus of the movie, and Adam Driver's character - an NSA agent credited as Sevier. Kirsten Dunst's character, who is brought in midway through the film, contributed nothing to the film whatsoever and the film would not be any different if her character was written out altogether - the same being said for several other characters in the film, whose introductions seemed to serve only the purpose of bulking up the film. The final sequence, which I won't spoil as it does prove to be a somewhat spectacle of a scene (Similar to the moment the UFO arrives in "Close Encounters", although no UFOs are to be seen in this film) is a breath of fresh air from a rather stuffy bulk of the film however to me it seemed like the entire film was built to accommodate the spectacular, although completely random, finale. On a positive note the soundtrack was very effective and atmospheric and the directing was consistently creative and genuine - although dim lighting played maybe too much of a role in the directive process. While I didn't think much of the film I know others who have loved it and even thought it better than "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" so it would probably be worth going to see if you're a Sci-Fi fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going to watch Midnight Special with high hopes as it was fairly highly rated and I do enjoy good Sci-Fi film. What a disappointment it was when it turned out that this is basically poor (or even very poor) 2016 remake of E.T. The first half (or at least first 30 min.) seems quite intriguing, the plot is developing but then it's all going downhill. At the times I wasn't sure if I should cry or laugh. It almost seems as the crew/director lost their motivation half a way through the project. The acting is poor, the mood changes form serious to (what suppose to be funny?) with crappy one liners and even more of bad acting. The photography is good at times, but that is about it! Sci-Fi at its worse!</fullReview>

I thought it was so bad that I created an IMDb account just to tell others about it.The movie moves so slowly it becomes terribly boring. Too many things in the plot either don't make sense or are left unanswered. This is frustrating not because they are not realistic, as in the end it's a sci-fi movie, but because they just don't add anything to the movie and you get a feeling you are wasting your time trying to make sense out of it.3 stars because it must have been a challenge convincing so many people to get this movie done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Midnight Special" has a deceptively deep title, but not much else going for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie titles usually have a clear relationship with the film's plot or characters, but sometimes the title doesn't relate to the content at all, and, other times, the movie title may seem irrelevant, but actually has clever, less-than-obvious connections to what the film is about. The science fiction film "Midnight Special" (PG-13, 1:52) represents that last situation, and the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff has done the research, uncovered the connections and brings them to you below (without spoilers, of course).The name "Midnight Special" has multiple meanings in American history and popular culture ? and more than one of them relate to this movie. For starters, "Midnight Special" is a folk song, which has been around in one form or another for over 100 years. It was popularized by folk and blues musician Huddie William "Lead Belly" Ledbetter in the 1930s and made even more famous by Creedence Clearwater Revival with their 1969 cover. In the most widespread versions of the song, Midnight Special is a train and the chorus asks the train to "shine your ever-loving light on me" (or, "ever-living" in other versions).The main character in this movie shoots light from his eyes, and it's a light that could be understood as corresponding with the song's lyrics in several different ways. But before (and apart from) the train in the song, the name Midnight Special referred to a passenger train that used to run between Chicago and St. Louis, with one of its stops being in Alton, Illinois. In the film "Midnight Special", the main character's name is? Alton! So, now that you know the story of the title, let's set up the story of the? uh, story.Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) is a handsome, polite and intelligent 8-year-old boy, but he's also much more. His eyes sometimes emit strong beams of light and people who lock eyes with those beams feel as if they have had a spiritual revelation. He also has abilities that allow him to affect the functioning of mechanical and electronic systems and receive and reproduce radio transmissions and even encrypted digital communications. All of this means that Alton is a boy of great interest to many different people.Alton's parents are Roy and Sarah (Michael Shannon and Kirsten Dunst) who, at the time of the boy's birth, were living in a religious compound (which is called "the ranch" and is made to look like the rural central Texas Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints' YFZ Ranch, which was raided by Texas law enforcement in 2008). When Alton was six, the compound's leader, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) took Alton from his parents and legally adopted him. Heartbroken, Sarah left the organization, while Roy stayed at the ranch to keep an eye on Alton? until he felt that he had to escape ? with Alton.Calvin Meyer and his followers perceived young Alton's powers, especially his channeling of external communications, as prophesy. To the people at the ranch, the boy was a messiah figure and he became central to their community's religious life. To, the federal government, Alton is a threat to national security. The NSA sends Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) to the ranch to find out how a little boy gained access to classified information. To Roy, Alton is simply his son ? and a unique boy who needs protecting.With the help of Lucas (Joel Edgerton), Roy's former childhood friend and current state trooper, Roy and Alton take to the road, desperately trying to evade those other interested parties, which are in hot pursuit of the fugitive trio. Roy and Lucas are trying to reunite Alton with his mother and then get him to a very specific location at a specific date and time where something important is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, besides being hunted by some very determined cult leaders and the federal government, Alton seems as if he's being tortured by his powers ? while also apparently getting very, very sick.There are three things you should understand about the plot that I just described. (1) There are no spoilers here because I haven't said anything about why Alton is so different or what happens to the various characters as the plot develops and the story ultimately reaches a resolution. (2) Just getting to the level of the story that I've laid out takes the movie a long time. A lot is happening, but you don't understand much of what you're seeing until 20-30 minutes into the movie. (3) The movie never does its audience the courtesy of explaining why the h--- (heck) (or how) all this stuff happens ? even in the end! "Midnight Special" is one of the most frustrating movies I've seen in a long time. I really expected to like it, but Jeff Nichols' half-baked writing and directing made that impossible. From the first moments of the film, I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a story ? and left to fend for myself. When the story does finally come together (kind of), there are some good action scenes and the acting is strong throughout, but Nichols refuses to make clear why the story's developments are taking place, or why we should care.This film includes elements of movies like "Powder" (1995), "Phenomena" (1996), "Michael" (1996), "K-PAX" (2001) and "Tomorrowland" (2015), while trying to be a 21st century version of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977) or "E.T." (1982). This movie feels, at times, like it could have been directed by Steven Spielberg (who made those last two movies) ? if Spielberg were drunk. His sci-fi films actually make sense. There are some very special movies in that list I just gave. "Midnight Special"? isn't. "C-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the intrigue from the beginning, the pacing rapidly deteriorates, due largely to the intensification of cryptic clues that results in fewer and fewer answers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it's discovered that eight-year-old Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) possesses metaphysical powers, his adoptive parent Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) preaches to his commune, "The Ranch," that the young boy is their savior. But Alton's biological father, Roy Tomlin (Michael Shannon), who once belonged to the religious collective, believes differently. With the aid of state trooper Lucas (Joel Edgerton), Roy attempts to transport Alton to a specific place outlined in the boy's otherworldly visions. The Ranch's suspicious activities and Alton's abrupt removal from its premises quickly draw the attention of the FBI, aided by NSA analyst Paul Sevier (Adam Driver), who works tirelessly to predict the trio's next move. As the police and Calvin's devoted followers close in on them, Roy will stop at nothing to deliver his son to their monumental destination.In one of those rare opening sequences, it's immediately apparent that something profound is going to unfold. This is aided by a resonant motif by composer David Wingo, the severity with which the lead players approach their roles, and the unnerving setup, involving an Amber Alert and the uncertainty of the motives behind presumed kidnappers. Unfortunately, as the film progresses, that initial momentum is all but discarded, giving way to an unnecessary compounding of complex mysteries, for which writer/director Jeff Nichols has no intention of solving. In time, it becomes clearer that the filmmakers were so consumed with creating a sense of profundity that they completely forgot to inject genuine substance into the story.Of the various head-scratchers at work, it's the supernatural ones that are handled with the greatest care. They're more effective thanks to their establishment in seriousness and reality, allowing for a slow seeping into the science-based inquisitiveness of the FBI and NSA, before the picture becomes fully sci-fi/fantasy. Like a horror movie, the extraterrestrial elements are revealed suddenly, hoping to draw audiences in to what would otherwise be outrageous scenarios. In this way, it's a bit like "Knowing" or "The Sixth Sense," harboring a creepiness that can't be shaken off too quickly. It leads to an impressive moment in a hotel room, where predictable terror can be transformed into adventurous shock. With the film's efforts to put ordinary people into extraordinary events, these scenes are even more fascinating, especially as villains are shaped from the most unexpected sources while agitation (or suspense) is kept constant. And, of course, the setting really helps, creating a throwback to '80s sci-fi flicks (particularly "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") with a glimmer of "Escape to Witch Mountain" or "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (but without the morals).Despite the intrigue from the beginning, the pacing rapidly deteriorates, due largely to the intensification of cryptic clues that results in fewer and fewer answers. After nearly 90 minutes, an explanation is offered for Alton's predicament, but it's still unsuitably, almost comically vague. Some sharp editing, a few surprising minutes, and catchy music can't overcome the dryness of the dialogue and the obscurity of the plot. It's not so much a lack of detail as it is a deficiency in focus; there's too much meandering on interactions that ultimately go nowhere (such as with David Jensen, Sam Shepard, and even Adam Driver). If Nichols' intentions were to recreate the thrills of '80s science-fiction, he sorely missed the mark with tone, mood, humor, meaningful resolutions, and, most importantly, the fun.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another solid film by Jeff Nichols</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special, written and directed by Jeff Nichols, is in essence a story about a boy, his parents and the lengths they are willing to go to to keep him safe.Without a doubt Alton played by Jaeden Lieberher and Roy played by Michael Shannon are the stand out performers in this film. Their relationship is what really drives this movie and makes the audience truly care about these characters. Even Lucas played by Joel Edgerton and Alton's mother, played by Kirsten Dunst, deliver solid performances and make me feel as though they really care for Alton's safety despite them having very limited back stories. My only gripes with this movie are that I felt it could have been slightly shorter and that the FBI in this movie never really felt like they had a purpose for going after Alton other than them being intrigued by his abilities.Once again, Jeff Nichols has delivered a solid film. He continues to leave his own personal mark on all his work and is definitely a director whose future films I look forward to seeing.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow-burning ideas-driven sci-fi that is refreshing, entertaining and pays great homage to the sci-fi's of the late 70's and 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since finding out who was involved, I was definitely excited to see the trailer. I may have only seen one of Jeff Nichols' previous work (Mud), but that was enough for me to the potential in where he could go next.With a stellar cast also announced, this intriguing sci-fi showed me a trailer with a lot of potential.Nichols has yet to do sci-fi. But I felt this was a genre that I feel he could succeed in. But maybe not in the mainstream fashion.A striking opening definitely shows the look that Nichols is going for. We seem to have jumped right in the middle of the story and it is the job of the film-makers to give us subtle bits of info for us to catch-up with the history of why our characters have ended up at this point in time.As the film goes on there are moments of surrealism that is never over-blown and does not de-tract from the pacing and tone. Whilst trying to work everything out, there was a particular scene about two-thirds of the way through that got me completely hooked. Then we get a pleasing conclusion for every character involved that also leaves some questions opened to our interpretation.Firstly, it pays wonderful homage to those sci-fi's of the late 70's and 80's. You can see similarities from Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Starman and even FLight Of The Navigator and Cocoon. Nichols and his team even show moments of mixing in religion and sci-fi. When done well, it gives us very interesting ideas and theories and this done it in spades.Nichols regular leading man Michael Shannon captures his character so well and gives us powerfully subtle performance. Partnering with Joel Edgerton, it was a strong on-screen partnership and made me confident that we were in safe hands for these two to carry this film. A big bonus was the wonderful acting from Jaeden Liberher. The 12- year old child actor gave us great moments throughout and is certainly a big draw. It was also nice to see Kirsten Dunst. After being busy with TV work over the last couple of years, her solid supportive role keeps me interested in any of her future projects. The only other notable performance worth mention was Adam Driver. For the short time he was on screen, the fitted the tone perfectly and also gave nice moments of comedy relief.The general look of the film was gorgeous to look at. The use of lighting in the night scenes felt soothing and the cinematography made the most of those moments. The action scenes are well made, especially in the final act.It is an entertaining slow burning sci-fi that leaves us wanting to know more about it. Nichols gave us a great ideas driven story whilst still managing to feel like it is done on a small scale. I loved it that it began in the middle of the story, and that we're catching as the films goes a long, and most importantly they are not spoon feeding us the info along the way. I also liked the execution of mixing in religion with sci-fi that felt so real. The performances in every department were spot on, the score is wonderful and it really does take you back the 70's and 80's with those similarities to sci-fi's that were released back then.I was really unsure whether to give it a 7 or an 8. But I think the main reason why I eventually gave it a 7 was the pacing. It was too slow for my liking. I like a lot of slow burners. But there were too many moments that lingered too much in my opinion. I think this did not quite work enough for me in this type of film to give it an 8. However, this is an entertaining watch and goes into ideas that we do not see enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Burning, This Sci-Fi Drama/Actioner Wins You Over In The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into Midnight Special, I was excited. Jeff Nichols has made a name for himself crafting slow burn dramas with heart, mystery, and excellent acting. Having seen Mud and Take Shelter and enjoyed them immensely, I expected this one to be his best yet, with a plot that was right up my alley: A father protects his son, a seemingly supernaturally gifted young boy, as they go on the run from both the authorities and a cult. Low and behold, Nichols delivers once again, but not without a few bumps. But sure enough, this is his best film yet.Nichols seems to be moving on up in his career, going from low key dramas like his two previous films to something more genre invested. Midnight Special is a sci-fi film, but it's very a-typical. Whereas we have seen films with these kinds of elements before, they've never been shown quite like this. As I said, however, the film takes some time to get going. When we start out, we are already in the midst of our primary characters on the run. From what, we're not entirely sure. We see scenes involving a cult that seems to worship the boy and we see the FBI also giving chase, but the reasons are never entirely clear. Over the course of the film, however, Nichols begins to slowly peel back what is happening. This is the perfect slow burn of a film. Nothing ever seems unnatural in it's explanation or reveal. What seems confusing and ambiguous at first, begins to unravel and a clear picture of what is actually happening and what truths lie beneath is revealed.The film's true merit is it's heart. At the center of the story is Michael Shannon's Roy, a father who is willing to do anything for his son, Alton, a child who is seemingly gifted with powers, but at the same time seems to carry misfortune. Joining them is Joel Edgerton's Lucas, who we learn more about over the course of the film and why he is also sworn to protect the boy. Our antagonists don't fare quite as well, never really coming across as a great threat, but at the same time there's plenty of tension packed into scenes, and this is aided by truly excellent acting all the way around. Nichol's also has a way with his camera and editing, packing in gorgeous cinematography with editing that creates nail biting tension. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat, nearly ready to burst into tears. However, I will also say this movie isn't for everyone. You may check out half way through, as I nearly did, and never come back. You also have to dig the sci-fi aspects of the movie, which I did. But if you've enjoyed Nichols previous films and want something different, this is an excellent choice. I don't want to spoil the surprises here, and the less you know going in the better, but if you want to be surprised, stick with this one and you may end up walking away loving it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A father and son go on the run after the dad learns his child possesses special powers.Midnight Special or the buzziest title of this year's Berlin Film Festival. Still settled under a larger than life mysterious Southern sky, still lead by Michael Shannon, Jeff Nichols' cinematography welcomes sci-fi elements. Nichols new film is closer to Take Shelter as it went beyond the mysteries of the human heart and into a more cosmic enigma. Here Jeff Nichols pays transporting homage to the rich tradition, spanning the late 70s through the mid-80s, of intelligent sci-fi, emotionally grounded in relatable human dynamics. Midnight Special is the first movie of the director to be produced by a major studio (Warner Bros.); though this film is as stylish as all of his former pictures, even if this time around he must have been more aware of criticism and must have had to defend his ideas and choices to impose his point of view again and again. What if there were something new in the world? And what if it was your son? The main theme of this movie is a father and son journey, literally on the road, with a father trying to understand where his son has to be and helping him to go there. I've been immediately interested by the title of this film and after some googling, I found the reference to the folk song covered by Creedence Clearwater Revival, which featured memorably in the opening scene of the 1983 Steven Spielberg big screen spin off of The Twilight Zone. There's a wave of young filmmakers brought up in the 70s and 80s blockbusters that changed the Hollywood system, who are doing their best to replicate them. J.J. Abrams already managed to work alongside Steven Spielberg himself for throwback fantasy Super 8 before taking charge of the rebooted Star Wars franchise - and others such as Gareth Edwards, Rian Johnson or Joss Whedon are clear students of the multiplex masters who birthed the event movie. Characters are not superheroes, but looked upon as normal people. Once again, in constant collaborator Michael Shannon, Nichols finds the perfect engine to power this delicate story forward - was ever any actor so able to project an aura of utter conviction, even when faced with the impossibly wrenching eventuality that the only way to save his child might be to let him go? Alton embodies the never ending possibilities of the universe. No one ever experienced what comes after death (well, no one came back to tell us anyway), other dimensions or metaphysical appearances of God. None of these things are tangible, but men want them to exist. Alton is the personification of this need. Moreover, Jeff Nichols did not forget that we as an audience are smart people. We've grown up with movies, we've been taught to pay attention to what was happening on screen; as soon as a new character emerged, we began instinctively to make supposition and hypothesis on his link and relationship with other characters and his environment. He relies on the ability of an intelligent audience to make sense of what is happening. This film is made almost entirely of mysteries and none of which are resolved by the final scenes. The bigger the questions you ask are, the less likely it is you can answer them in any satisfying, definitive way and the human, existential, metaphysical questions that Midnight Special poses, if you care to look for them, are enormous. The visual effects heavy sequences raises more questions than it answers. Was Alton an alien, an angel, a more highly evolved human being? Was he going to heaven, or another dimension? The explanation is ultimately less important than what Alton's journey succeeds in illustrating about human nature - demonstrating just how desperately some people want to believe. In fact, the sci-fi elements of the film have an organic style, they look quite real, inspiration of movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial by Steven Spielberg or even Starman by John Carpenter with their opaque dark night. Religious themes aside, though, Nichols draws on both the paranoia of those 1980s films - the feeling that the government is a largely faceless, monolithic force, out to control and suppress all forms of wonder - and on Steven Spielberg's blockbusters filmmaking rhythms. Plus, family is a central theme in all Jeff Nichols' movies as well as couple relationships. Always a contradictory love or even an impossibly love, a love that has to fight in order to survive. A real tragic dimension as well as romantic is present in this vision of love And I like it, I grew up with &gt; More on my blog</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A secret road adventure during the dark hours!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the Jeff Nichols and Micahel Shannon saga continues. This is theirs 4th film together in the last nine years and all of them were well accepted. Now they are into sci-fi for this, which is kind of a road movie that resembles hundreds of other films. Only thematically, but in parts it looks different, especially for being too realistic as what the director is famous for. Finally, something is not a comedy or a full of CGI, yet still it is a wonderful sci-fi-drama with some thrill moments.It opened like the midway of the story. We obviously have to wait for a proper explanation to know what's going on, who is the child and where they're taking him. So it all begins with two armed men driving a young kid on the dark hours. Only we know is that they are protecting the boy from the government people, but the film took some time to give a clear picture of the condition. In the meantime, I started my prediction game, but I expected the film to clarify how it all began. It never cared about that part, only moved forward and that's how we're going to get some answers where a few might feel its a let down.The negative of the film is you won't fully understand it, but it is not an incomplete story, just designed that way that leaves for the viewer to add their own perspectives to where the writer left blank spaces. Like I said the people are comparing it with the similar films and I did not care about that, but I disappointed with the conclusion. It was neatly folded, I actually liked it, but it was not fresh, especially it totally mirrors 'Tomorrowland'. Now I know why Warner Bros moved it from last year to this year's release.It might be a coincident because the director who is also the writer has a good reputation, so I believe it is definitely not a steal, just a common creative that we've already seen many films like that. Overall, this film is worth, but might not satisfy the Jeff Nichols fans, because like I said plenty of times before in my reviews, now it the sci-fi era and every filmmaker and film-star want to board on that plane. So it did not spare Jeff Nichols as well.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) has special abilities and the Cult wants him back as they look at Alton as their Savior. The FBI wants him, too, as they believe he may be a threat to National Security. In the middle of the night, Alton's father Roy (Michael Shannon) takes him away from both the Cult and the FBI.We get frustrated when the story doesn't produce enough evidence to let us see where it is going. And in here, we are kept in the dark for too long a time. At the 3-Quarter mark, we are given a few crumbs and hope for more to come. Doesn't happen. Still this is a very intriguing story. We are told that a world lives above us and they watch us. The problem is that only watching and not helping doesn't help us at all. Actually, looking at the world now, I think we can say "this watching world" is doing a pretty bad job. (I see you are a Believer in this scenario)So what are we looking at? Sequels, of course. We don't get the answers we should get and maybe we'll get them in the next show. Roy, and bodyguard Lucas (Joel Edgerton), Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) the mother, and Alton race to a place where Alton will return to "his world." How does he know that? If he is not of this world who impregnated Sarah to produce him? Where was Roy in all this? Did he not know? If Alton leaves could Sarah and Roy produce another Alton? Was Roy a Cult Member and later decided Alton must leave this Cult? Will we get to see what this "world above us" is all about? See, we need answers and will only get them in sequels. (Or not at all. Could happen)But hey, there is some good news: the ending tells us THERE WILL BE SEQUELS because we see where Roy and Lucas end up. (That's good news?)The acting by all is very good and we are fully engaged to getting Alton to where he must go. Alton doesn't say much throughout, but we see he is more than what a small boy looks and acts like. Yeah, we kind of look at him as a little alien who looks human who has powers beyond any of us. (Hey, he reads Superman comics)Notables: Sam Shepherd as Calvin Meyer, the leader of the Cult; Adam Driver as Paul Sevier, NSA Agent.Yes, very intriguing, but being kept in the dark for the entire movie is not a good thing. Bring on the Sequels. We need to know more. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A boy with eyes that shoot light beams... chase scenes... that's what the trailer promised. Was looking forward to a roller coaster plot. Turns out it was difficult to stay awake. After the first 15 minutes it dragged on and on and on. Lots of slow driving... slow talking... slow story progression. By the time it finishes, it's pretty much a 'yeah -- whatever' type ending. A shame, as the story had potential -- just needed a quicker pace. Could've been worse, could've been a lot better. Maybe next time ;-)User reviews are required to have a minimum length, something difficult to achieve with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Packed with an all-star cast, a director with increasingly impressive credits, and a ton of hype, Midnight Special had an indie release that should be more impressive than others. I was glad to see it playing at the local Cinemark though I almost missed it showing in one of the smaller theaters. I did catch it the Jeff Nichols directed sci-fi thriller and have to say that there is plenty to enjoy about this film.The story revolves around a mysterious boy and a cult that raised him. Michael Shannon plays Roy Tomlin, the boy's father who has taken the boy from the cult and with the help of his friend Lucas, played by Joel Edgerton, they are on the run from the cult and the FBI. Shannon is charming and sentimental as the father, a change from the heartless and evil villains he often plays. Edgerton has a decent southern accent and is charming as always.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading other reviews I was really looking forward to this movie, but ultimately I came away disappointed, wondering if I had watched the same movie.It starts promisingly enough, with a really good opening scene but does not really progress from there. It has some great special effects and the photography is excellent but the story leaves a bit to be desired and I just did not really get it. I mean how do two mere mortal human beings give birth to a 'special' son? Many more unanswered questions remain which just made it frustrating rather than interesting.I am a fan of Michael Shannon and Adam Driver but even they could not lift this movie from it's moderate mark, so Special it is not, more average really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but the script was too lousy. Good acting. I admire Michael Shannon an I hope he will get a script one day to go for an Oscar. The script of this movie was weak. It managed to bring this movie to its halftime, but then started sucking and loosing suspension. I do not know why such a talented writer and director as Jeff Nichols could not see the obvious, that he is failing to give any meaning or longing to his characters. But wonderfully filmed and with excellent acting. Shown is all the selfless love that people only can give to children. Maybe Nichols should take some lessons watching 2001 by Kubrick. Sometimes it is better not to try to explain everything and to try to show everything,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Special - The waiting is the hardest part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIDNIGHT SPECIAL is another entry in the ever-growing 'Sci-Fi lite' category. Movies which have fantastic elements, yet seem much more concerned with 'real world' drama than science fiction - ANOTHER EARTH, MELANCHOLIA, SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, SOUND OF MY VOICE, COMPUTER CHESS etc.. More to the point here, the director is Jeff Nichols who made TAKE SHELTER.Like TAKE SHELTER, the star is the superb Michael Shannon -- although MIDNIGHT's main focus is on the character of the son Alton (Jaeden Lieberher). Alton is a kid with special powers who, of course, the government is hunting down. Shannon is joined by a cop buddy (Joel Edgerton) and his wife (Kirsten Dunst) as they try and protect the boy.There are other complications that take up the first half to two-thirds of the movie. And, that's one of the biggest difficulties in enjoying MIDNIGHT. Nichols seems to be a filmmaker who likes to draw things out and hide basic info from his audience as long as possible. Although there are more on-screen manifestations of the paranormal here than in TAKE SHELTER ($18M of Warner Brothers money helps), Nichols seems ever determined to keep his viewers guessing. Even his more mainstream MUD metered out basic details in dribs and drabs. That's fine as far as it goes. With all the lame hit you over the head blockbusters out there, a little subtlety is welcome. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL pays off decently in the end, but, like TAKE SHELTER, the conclusion seems out of proportion to the amount of build-up (MUD admirably succeeds all around).Odd thing, too, is that MIDNIGHT SPECIAL essentially uses the structure of John Carpenter's STARMAN (right down to the scientist who goes rogue, Adam Driver, filling in for Charles Martin Smith)*. But, whereas that movie is a model for get-to-the point pathos, MIDNIGHT often seems like abstraction for abstraction's sake. The acting is good. The movie works in the end. But, like TAKE SHELTER, I felt more frustrated than edified when it was over.* In interviews, Nichols acknowledges his debt to STARMAN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This plot took a long time to get going. We are a good 25 minutes into this before we have the most meager of clues what is happening.The boy has eyes that glow. Until then the boy, Alton Meyer, (played by Jaeden Lieberher) reads a comic book for the most part. Not exactly something that inspires interest or curiosity. Suspense and mystery is the intention. We begin to wonder about this boy... and we keep wondering. Once you have created that sense of curiosity, letting it go unfulfilled for too long can tend to frustrate the watcher. All in all, the character is a disappointment. Michael Shannon, from what I have seen is a pretty meat and potatoes actor. Not much emotional range. He's pretty much the same persona everywhere you see him. Now, on to Paul Sparks, (playing FBI Agent Miller) here is an actor with some surprises although he playes this character very straight but with good presence. Look at his excellent work in House Of Cards, (the Netflix series)and Boardwalk Empire, from HBO. His characters actually vary. Joel Edgerton, who plays Lucas,(the one who shoots the trooper) is interesting in anything I've seen him thus far. Black Mass and Zero Dark Thirty come to mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: major spoilers ahead! Here's the script of this film: a parent and his old friend try to move a boy with superhuman abilities from one location to another, because the latter is where something has to happen to the boy.Between the beginning and the end something totally uninteresting happens, like chases, NSA's boy capture, freeing of the boy, a satellite crash which the boy caused, etc.The problem is that there's no conclusion whatsoever. We don't get any meaningful information about the nature of the boy or the nature of his superhuman abilities. In some ways this film tries to appeal to Christians but it fails miserably at that, because the boy doesn't represent anything portrayed in the gospel.If you're a sci-fi fan you'll be solely disappointed as well, because there's no scientific background or substance in this movie.In short save your time and money and watch another movie.Music is the only redeeming quality of this movie. It's amazing and worth listening to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story and plot had a lot of holes in it, as though it was adapted from a book and they took out too much, so it no longer made as much sense. An explanation of the religious cult would have helped. Sam Shepherd was wasted in such a small part as the cult leader. It would have been nice to have the explanation about the fact that the boy's father had kidnapped him, and from where. It felt as though they were trying to save time, to shorten the movie, and would skip from ?ne thing to the next with little explanation. I liked the characters Kiersten Dunst, Joel Edgartown and especially Adam Driver played, and just wished the writers had done a better job. A few good special effects, good characters, but not enough story to make it work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Michael Shannon so it was a sure bet that I'd see Midnight Special. I had no idea what it was about, hadn't read any reviews and didn't hear any scoops. It's seemingly a "small movie".Well! What a nice surprise (again M.Shannon never disappoints) to see how this movie played out. Very much like an old-style movie (actually felt like a black &amp; white movie) with good characters, good acting, suspense and surprises. The whole look of the movie was solid and kept my attention from the beginning.Kirsten Dunst, never one of my fav actresses, has really come of age lately. She's picking or getting picked for good roles and she's surprisingly (to me) a good actress. I'm glad to see it.This movie is what M. Night Shyamalan started out doing...making good "sorta" si-fi movies with twists. Regular drama coupled with futuristic story lines with "alien-types" that is just sprung on you when you're not expecting it. Loved it. Entertaining and thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Alton is on the run with his father, General Zod, and Pharaoh Ramses (an old friend of his father's). He is being pursued by the religious cult they belonged to and also by the FBI, one of whom is Kylo Ren. They meet up with Alton's mother, Mary-Jane Watson-Parker, and head off for a pre-determined rendezvous which has something to do with Alton's strange otherworldly powers.This relatively straightforward pursuit story with strong sci-fi leanings is moderately satisfying as a chase movie, with decent performances from the principals, and convincing special effects. It does fall down somewhat in that I needed a bit more than just the events: I needed some explanation, some rationale, some reason why this was happening. The finale kind of offers you a partial resolution of this, but not enough to satisfy. And although we quite like the little lad and feel for his parents (despite Michael Shannon's character being written as so determinedly dour you have little natural sympathy for him), it is annoying to never know why or how this situation came to be.Ultimately, for me, this film failed even though it had some elements which were worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Midnight special"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of the film relies on the lack of long and boring details about the characters which, for many people, might be a little annoying. The fact is that the director is not concerned about that, but wants to portray a "journey" which can be interpreted by any viewer as he wants. This is the most interesting thing about the whole film. Although, as the film is about a boy who happens to be special, many viewers will interpret the journey as an inner one which is undertaken by the boy himself and his parents. The former has to accept that he will be separated from his parents while the latter have to accept to let their boy go. As Nichols said that he wrote this film thinking about what's like to realise you might lose your child, one cannot help but interpret the story as a symbolic portrayal of the parents losing the child and how to cope with that. The father is more in denial while the mother, as for a mother's instinct, is already aware that these are going to be the last days they are going to spend with their son. I found the message terribly moving and the film manages to transcend little details to become as objective as possible: everyone can read it as he wants. The film is also exciting in that it contains action and the right amount of suspense. The performances are truly wonderful with Michael Shannon, Kirsten Dunst and Jaeden Lieberher as the stand outs. Michael Shannon ("Take Shelter", "99 Homes", "Boardwalk Empire", "Revolutionary Road""The iceman", "Shotgun Stories") delivers a quite effective performance as a father who tries to avoid accepting that the child is going to leave. Kirsten Dunst ("Melancholia", "Marie Antoinette", "Fargo", "The Virgin Suicides", "The Cat's Meow", "All Good Things") is the emotional point of the story: a mother who already feels that her son is going to leave and, as hard as it is, accepts that while caring for him until the end.Both Shannon and Dunst give everything you would expect from actors of their calibre and the portrayal of these parents is very sad and moving. They are very minimalistic performances. Jaeden Lieberher ("St. Vincent") also gives a convincing performance as the child who tries to comfort the parents while avoiding to hide the fact that he is going to leave. Joel Edgerton ("The Great Gatsby", "Warriors", "Zero Dark Thirty", "Black Mass") is also good as the faithful and true friend. Nichols' direction is outstanding and he manages to make the viewers care and feel for the characters. My vote is 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff Nichols' best effort yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols has started his career off by making solid movie after solid movie. His movies wont be confused with a Tarantino or Inarritu film, but not every movie has to be as stylized as them. Nichols has a knack for telling human stories with solid writing and always a little bit of mystery, well in Midnight Special Nichols is on top of his game.As you can tell my favorite word to describe Jeff Nichols is simply solid. Midnight Special is the third Nichols film I have seen behind Take Shelter and Mud. I would certainly recommend any of these movies but I think Midnight Special is now at the top of that list. The theme is genuine the whole way through and the characters are perfectly crafted. Nichols gives just enough information about everyone so that you know what you need to about them, but still are wanting to know more.The movie moves well jumping from scenes of invigorating tension to slower moments of skillfully placed exposition. Speaking of the tension in the movie, Nichols expertly delivers tension that is not reliant on horror elements, which is hard to come by these days. Instead he uses the characters and the viewers relationship with them to make any dicey situation that much more seat clenching.Michael Shannon and Jeff Nichols have been attached at the hip with Shannon being in all of Nichols' features. Michael Shannon is easily one of the most underrated actors out there working today, and no one finds the humanity in him like Jeff Nichols. The relationship between father and son is so vital in this movie, and if it had not been pulled off so well the movie would certainly have tanked. Joel Edgerton has an impressive ability to be the second lead in movies and not attempt to take over. He gives a strong supporting performance and I know think the movie would have been as good without him.It is easy for a movie like Midnight Special to fall into the average category. It is a difficult movie to sell to people because you don't want to give away too much, but under the surface of the sci-fi chase drama tag, this movie has some real merit. If you have any interest or like anyone involved I am almost sure you will at least enjoy this movie. It's early in the year, but so far Midnight Special is the best movie of 2016 so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols continues to make some of the most compelling small budget films of the last several years. Midnight Special is another visually impressive and meticulously crafted stories to be put to film in 2016. Midnight Special tells the story of Alton Meyer, an 8-year-old boy, who is forced to go on the run with his father as the government desires to lock him up for his special and mysterious abilities. Jaeden Lieberher from St. Vincent fame, plays Alton, and he's joined by Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Adam Driver, and Jeff Nichols regular Michael Shannon who plays his father. The film depends on its cast to carry a story that may not appeal to a general audience. After all, it's not like the marketing showed much of anything (which I'm personally grateful for).But even so, the real hero here is Jeff Nichols. It's not a story that will necessarily blow anybody away as we seen similar stories with Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Looper, but the direction of Nichols really sucks you in. It's also nicely complemented by a score from David Wingo which sets the mood for the entirety of this dark story. And I guess that would be perhaps my only gripe with the film. There isn't much enjoyment within the story where I think they had an opportunity to implant some. The humor aspect of it is just preference on my part, but when it's so dark and grim, you sometimes need some relief.Overall, Jeff Nichols does a wonderful job of telling this small budget sci-fi film. Everyone in the cast is great and there are plenty of surprises along the way. Sure, there could have been some more fun here, but I would think any sci-fi fan would find Midnight Special one of the most compelling films of the year. For the best possible experience, I would recommend going in knowing little to nothing about the plot.+Nichols' style+Score+Sci-Fi elements/surprises-Could use some comic relief every now and then8.0/10</fullReview>

This Spell-Binding Critical Darling, is actually one of its kind &amp; The Performances are WOW.'Midnight Special' Synopsis: A father and son go on the run, pursued by the government and a cult drawn to the child's special powers.'Midnight Special' isn't your regular Sci-Fi flick. As I mentioned, this is as much a Human-Drama. Its engrossing to watch the father and son bond &amp; fight on their journey, that is often turbulent, but mesmerizing overall. 'Midnight Special' is also emotionally powerful, as this is also a story of Fatherhood &amp; how far one goes to protect their child.Jeff Nichols is the Man of the moment. His Screenplay definitely offers moments of Sci-Fi thrills, but the emotional undercurrent is the highpoint of the enterprise. His Direction, on the other-hand, is superlative at all times. His handling of this subject, is indeed note-worthy. Adam Stone's Cinematography is superb. Julie Monroe's Editing is super-crisp. David Wingo's Score is flawless.'Midnight Special' is a feast even in terms of Performances. Michael Shannon rips it up as the father, delivering a knockout performance from start to finish. As his special Son, Jaeden Lieberher is equally terrific, matching up-to Shannon &amp; others, without breaking into a sweat. Joel Edgerton aces as the trooper with them &amp; Kirsten Dunst is unmistakably earnest as the devastated mother. In Supporting Roles, Adam Driver &amp; Sam Shepard are in Top-Form! On the whole, 'Midnight Special' is Special. Watch It.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes less really is more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's been a couple of hours since I saw Midnight Special and it's still lingering at the back of my mind. This is usually a good thing.(this ended up longer than expected so skip to the last paragraph if you just want to know if you'll like it) I'm not going to go into any of the plot details as I genuinely believe the less you know about this film, the more you will enjoy it. There were times where I was almost apprehensive as I really did wonder "where ARE they going with this?". so I though I'd just sum up more my thoughts and feelings to help you decide if you want to see this film.Comparisons to late '70s early '80s sci-fi films are understandable and not a negative. With a (relatively) small budget reliance on special effects fall away and it becomes more about the performance, the atmosphere, the story and a trust in the viewer to take the clues scattered throughout the film and realise the scope of what is going on.Performances: Everyone does well here, Michael Shannon continues to impress in everything I see him in. He definitely has that "Edward James Olmos thing" where he can portray a whole sentence or range of emotions with just a twitch of an eye, or a glance. Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst and Adam driver also give equally understated but powerful performances. There's no showboating here and because of that it feels more authentic. There's a pleasant lack of cinema tropes here. Kudos to Jaeden Lieberher as well for giving a very strong showing in a role that underpins the whole film. If he hadn't worked the whole thing would have fallen apart.Atmosphere: Jeff Nichols does a really impressive job here of presenting everyday things in slightly odd or uncomfortable ways. That's the best way I can describe it, sometimes things just feel a little...off (in a good way.)For example, the film "feels" old. If it wasn't for a few date references and a couple of tech giveaways (flat screen monitors, modern cars) you could quite easily believe this film is set in 1975 going by the decor, the clothing and, as far as I can remember, there is only one mobile phone shown in the entire film.The scope of the story is reflected in the scope of some of the shots used, wide angle landscape shots, tracking shots filmed from high above, everything feels BIG(while,conversely,people feel small). Much like the early night scenes from "Close Encounters" cars are dots of light travelling through the vast plains of middle America, towns and cities are lakes of light in the darkness. The cinematography is solid with some truly stunning shots in there. Special effects are used sparingly but are beautifully done and because of that, when they do come, often unexpectedly, their impact is that much greater. There are a few moments in the film that had they been in today's CGI heavy "Transformers / Superhero" movies, they would have passed without notice. Here they really make you sit up. For a film with only an $18m budget what's on screen is impressive.The Script: As my title suggests this film is an example of less is more. We, the viewer, are not treated like idiots and, as the film progresses enough information is provided for us to understand what is going on. Often we are as clueless as the characters themselves and left to draw our own conclusions. Themes of Fatherhood (and Motherhood), friendship and atonement all are at play in the background. Things are often implied and not said.The score by David Wingo is excellent, at times really adding to the discomforting atmosphere in some scenes. I would liken it to Clint Mansell's work, particularly Moon.However,I do agree that at times "less is not enough" and you just wish a some of the characters would have a normal conversation. Likewise all the core story is resolved but you are left wondering about some of the more minor characters and, like Moon, you are left curious about "What happened next?...". It would be interesting for someone, or even Jeff Nichols, to delve into the world he has created and cover it in more detail. Maybe even in a book sequel.So, if you like older school "big idea" sci-fi films, that has pauses, slow build up and a lot going on under the surface give this a shot.If you're more a fan of explosion-ey, fx heavy big event films (which I do also like) still see it (it's a good film!) but know what you're going to see as per my notes above. Like I said at the start, 2 (now 3) hours later it's still lingering away and I am quite sure smarter people than I are already writing up their interpretations of some scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80's kids film written by someone with depression.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kid with special powers is taken by his father to go on the run from a shady government agency and a weird cult. The plot and the trailer for this movie put me in mind of several films I loved as a kid. Sheriff and the satellite kid and it's sequel Why did you pick on me? as well as D.A.R.Y.L.. Only this one is for "Grown ups" who don't care about plot or fun.The story picks up just after The father played brilliantly by Michael Shannon has already rescued the boy from the weird cult that was hailing him as some kind of messiah because he can repeat radio messages and shoot a calming light out of his eyes. I sort of feel like we missed out on one of the more interesting parts of the story by not seeing the rescue. The bulk of the movie is spent watching the father the fathers friend and the child try to make there way to coordinates the boy has spoken of during his radio chants. I'm usually quite fond of ambiguous plots but this one is far to light with so many threads left hanging you could make a cat of nine tails to whip the script writer with. When the expert they call in works out were they are headed because he stares at a white board and circles a few digits with no explanation how he worked out where they are headed we're just supposed to accept he's the expert and thats how he worked it out. The ending was also very reminiscent of the Abyss, With a fairly disappointing reveal. The movie is pretty much SCIFI light, light on SCI heavy on FI. I wanted to enjoy this film but because of the similar themes to those 80's kids films I mentioned I thought it was going to be more fun. It wasn't and the ending left me feeling hollow. This is one of those movies I won't be watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another cracker from the Director of Take Shelter &amp; Mud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very vague trailer, I was intrigued by what Midnight Special was actually going to turn out to be. The trailers were very reminiscent of 80's John Carpenter. Luckily the film lives up to what was shown in the trailers, and is definitely one of my favourites of the year so far.The excellent Michael Shannon, intense as ever, plays a devoted father, who kidnaps his own son from a religious cult. Along for the ride is the equally excellent Joel Edgerton, and later on in the film Kirsten Dunst. I won't go too much in to the plot, as it would surely spoil your initial viewing.All performances are great. As mentioned earlier Shannon and Edgerton are excellent, but the smaller roles played by Sam Sheperd and Adam Driver make an impression. Even Kirsten Dunst who I'm not really a fan off is great here in a limited role as the boys mother.This is by far Jeff Nicols best film so far, even surpassing the excellent Mud. Fans of Clsoe Encounters and Starman will love it, even though it is a bit more grounded than them, and is more of a thriller for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a small film, or maybe a personal film, in which the director collects a few 'idée fixe'(Could also be called 'The Back roads of the Southern States') and makes a nice movie from it. The personal feeling comes from the strong internal influence, that touches everything and gives stiffness to otherwise flabby ideas - remember It Follows?To be fair, this is effectively a very nice X-files episode. It is not conspicuously well shot, and does not have amazing dialogue. What it does do is use Sci Fi as a genre, but not the point of the experience. The result is a satisfying watch, that will undoubtedly spark the genre flame in other directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sci-fi is often associated with being a genre of grand spectacle, expensive special effects and big ideas and being the preserve of big budget movies. Well Midnight Special goes down a different route, being a family drama and a road movie with a sci-fi twist.Midnight Special sees writer/director Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon for the first time since working together on the drama Take Shelter. Shannon stars as Roy, a man who has taken his son away from a cult with his friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton). Roy's son Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) is sensitive to daylight and is getting sicker, but also exhibits powers like receiving radio signals and taking down satellites. Roy, along with Lucas and Alton's Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) try to take Alton to a location decoded from all the codes he has spoken: but they are hunted by members of the cult who see Alton as a messiah and the FBI who concerned a little boy who can receive special government communications.Midnight Special has three major strengths, it has a great cast, the family drama and makes the most of its $18 Million budget. The film is at its best when it is looking at the family dynamic with a particular focus on Roy and his son. Shannon gives a terrific performance as a man who willing to do anything to protect his son - Roy is a good man but Shannon plays to his strengths as an actor, his dark intensity. One of the great moments in the film is when Alton asks Roy to take him during the day and Roy holds his child as the sun rises. Are a good quiet moments where the film has to relies on the actor's expressions and reactions.Edgerton also gave a good performances as Roy's old friend, being the man who has the skills to avoid the authorities. Dunst was decent enough as Alton's mother and Roy's former partner, but Adam Driver as an NSA analyst was underwhelming. He is perfectly fine at playing someone nerdy but it is not the most interesting role he will ever do.They are special effects, mostly CGI but are used sparingly. It was a good quality and the idea is clearly to give the audience more bang for their buck. The effects are slowly built up to be bigger and grander, leading to a big climax. These are effects that could easily be at home in a bigger budgeted film.However Midnight Special is not as deserving of some of the critical praise it has received. The opening is great and there is no denying that Nichols has a great eye for the special effects. But as the film progresses it becomes more dull, moving along too slowly and becoming too dialogue driven. It drags in its second half and this was the type film that could have had 20 minutes cut or have an action sequence of sort to give the film so sort of drive. The cult subplot was an interesting idea but it disgarded and when the revealed what the sci-fi element was that gave Alton his powers it was really daft considering the film was aiming for a slightly more realistic look and darker tone. The screenplay was in need of refining - Nichols is capable of telling more concede, compelling stories and Midnight Special needed more of that approach.Midnight Special is a well acted film and its stars do deserve the credit, particularly Shannon, showing what does best. It is a good looking film and had a great start, but ends on a whimper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent sci-fi flick from Jeff Nichols</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Special is a movie I've been looking forward to for a while now, and just saw today (4/3/2016). It's the fourth film directed by Jeff Nichols, and if you haven't seen his first three movies, I'd recommend all of them as I enjoy them quite a bit. Michael Shannon, one of my favorite working actors, stars in the movie- alongside a solid supporting cast. While I found the movie to be above average, it wasn't as gripping or impressive to me as Nichols' other films. It's well-acted all around, and I enjoyed the pacing of the story. We are given a lot of time to get to know the characters, which I appreciate. It makes the exciting moments much more exciting, because we're given likable characters to care about (quite a contrast from my last trip to the movies- a certain superhero film that was PAINfully dull. I digress). A lot of questions are raised about one of the film's main characters. From the start, the plot has an element of mystery that benefits the movie, but for me fell a little flat when the questions raised are more or less answered. That brings me to my main criticism. I expected a more compelling resolution to the plot. In the end, Midnight Special felt like it borrowed from certain other sci-fi films (namely Starman, which I couldn't help but think about during a lot of the movie). Not to say that's entirely a bad thing, I just would have preferred if the movie stood out more as a unique work of sci-fi. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say more. All in all I'd recommend Midnight Special. I don't dole out 9s or 10s very often, so a 6/10 from me is a decent rating. If anything, I'd say the movie was a strong 6. I'm happy I saw it, and I eagerly await Jeff Nichols' next movie- Loving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like the concept, but chock full of small mistakes in the writing/directing - Lowest Level Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the overall story, but the film is surprisingly full of amateurish mistakes in the writing/directing.Some of the mistakes remind me of the notoriously corny stuff that M. Night Shyamalan throws into his films.If Church/Sect/Cult members are going to speak openly with the FBI, at least write a line of dialogue where the Church leader says its OK, otherwise give me a break.If you're going to expose yourself and put everyone at risk because you have to make a phone call, at least try to write a decent phone conversation commensurate with the risk. Not a call that's equivalent to "I think I'll wash my dirty clothes tomorrow". That's about how important this crucial phone call was.Adam driver is great, but in the end his role is just not quite meaty enough. It's missing something extra to propel the story.There's a number of things I'd like to expound on, but I don't want to write any real spoilers here.Overall I was disappointed by the lack of attention to detail in the small things taking place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would describe this film as combo of a sci-fi and road movie and while it is a good flick overall , I found it a little bit underwhelming compared to the magnificent Take Shelter and the captivating Mud. Great special effects,the acting is strong enough : Michael Shannon,Joel Edgerton, Adam Driver and the little kid who plays Alton were brilliant.Sam Sheperd was also good in a small but pivotal role.However, I was really disappointed in how underwritten was Kirsten Dunst's character.While delivering a solid performance, you can still feel that something's missing.She doesn't seem to find her footing and the movie could have worked just as well without her. The pace of the film was a little bit too slow at times and the final act was a little bit too simplistic considering how much tension and mystery there was through the whole feature.There are also some unanswered questions which leaves this film an ambiguous feel to it but not necessarily in a good way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Special is the 4th film from writer/director Jeff Nichols. That should honestly be enough to get people excited, for his films Take Shelter and Mud are both considered instant American classics, and Midnight Special has joined the list. Of course, though, the film and Nichols' previous entries aren't for everyone, but as films, they are true masterpieces. What I find hard to describe about Midnight Special, though, is how it's able to weave together multiple genres and sub-genres into one cohesive whole, from a sci-fi conspiracy thriller to a family drama, and a road film mixed with a chase-driven action movie. Midnight Special takes place over the course of a few days, but follows Roy Tomlin, Roy's best friend Lucas, Roy's wife Sarah Tomlin and their son, Alton Meyer, who Roy took back from Calvin Meyer, Alton's stepfather and religious cult leader who believes Alton will save them, all the while the government is also looking to seize Alton from Roy, believing him to be an inhuman weapon.What I found the most profound and phenomenal about the film wasn't the writing, the direction, the breath-taking visuals or the moody score from David Wingo, but the acting. Was it acting? Honestly, I felt every second of the film to be happening in real time. Even the second time I saw it, I thought that what happened in the movie was the most organic and natural acting of all time. I don't say that lightly, not even a little bit. But, the simple relationship between Alton and Roy was real, the relationship between Alton and Sarah was real, and even the one between Alton and Lucas, a man Alton didn't know until Roy pulled Lucas into their "situation," which is best described in a scene where Alton sees the sunrise for the first time, and Lucas, also feeling like a father figure/friend for Alton, is taken aback by Alton's experience, sadly to the point where Lucas is shot by one of Calvin Meyer's followers when he doesn't check his corners. This isn't just him being stupid, because later, Lucas apologizes to Roy that he "should have checked first." The other performance that made the film real was Adam Driver as Paul Sevier, an NSA analyst brought in to assist the FBI's investigation and apprehension of Alton. You can tell in his mannerisms and reactions to fieldwork that he doesn't get out much, and that the excitement is something he's coming to like. Quite a bit, in fact.There are a select amount of movies that have not just an immense emotional impact, but a real sense of urgency and reality. Movies are often tense and gripping, with suspense and action, but more times than not is the urgency from what happens in the film. Instead, with Midnight Special, we feel the urgency. We know, for a fact, the entire movie is riding on a father making sure his son is safe. That's profound in its own right, and beautiful. I want to give the movie a 10, but that would be by my strict, personal feelings. I give it a 9 because, again, not everyone will like it. Not all questions are answered, the movie is not fast-paced, and the sci-fi aspect is not full-blown, but is integral to the development of the characters and world they're in. But, in any case, this movie deserves to be seen, and I hope it gets a bigger audience when released on disc. I, for one, side with Mr. Chris Pratt when it comes to Midnight Special: "If you are like me, Midnight Special will be your new favorite film."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I tell you Midnight Special is derivative and formulaic sci-fi, please understand this film is of the highest quality, an allegorical mash-up of ET, Close Encounters, X Files, Tomorrowland, The Sixth Sense, and the Christ motif, to name a few. It's a retro take on the late 70's and early '80's when intelligent, humanistic sci-fi was the order of the day.Midnight Special (an allusion to Lead belly's 1934 ballad about a train's light shining into a prison and bringing hope?a motif of this film) works dramatically and believably like few other sci-fi's, or for that matter, the road movie and car chase.Roy's (Michael Shannon) birth son, Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher), is some kind of unearthly kid with powers that mainly affect the electric grid and blow up things. Fortunately, this is something that happens infrequently. His abduction by his father and a state trooper, Lucas (Joel Edgerton), is from a cult farm run in an ingratiatingly Jim-Jones way by charismatic Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard). He had adopted Alton, and the story slowly reveals a meeting the boy must attend that has portentous implications but no certainty.That distributed exposition is a strength of this film, relying as it does on the audience to supply the imaginative answers to plot points that don't always add up. For instance, why did Roy and then wife, Sarah, give Alton up to adoption? In some cases, fuzzy answers are not necessary because the allegorical elements, and there are many, need interpretation, not logic.Slow revelation fits this film: You don't know all right away, and that's okay because a kidnapping with the FBI following close on the heels of the kidnappers makes for thriller excitement without even touching the sci-fi component. Yet, non-sci-fi junkies will grouse about the highly-imaginative but Spielbergian-Tomorrowland-like literalness of the ending and the lack of back story for many elements. Soon, however, the film's allegories kick in and all is well.Is Alton the savior Calvin's flock believes he is or an alien who picks up government secrets, making him a danger to the world order? The answer can be both, and with Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton at the center of the action, it's believable and fun, a classic sci-fi of intelligence and humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Jeff Nichols' work no doubt. He's able to create really well-done, satisfying indie films with a lot of naturalism. I would first start off by saying that Midnight Special may be a really good film, but I also think there could have been potential for it to be a really great one. As it stands, the screenplay does have a few cracks in it that prevent me from going even further in my praise for it. The acting is uniformly good. It's always great to see Kirsten Dunst, and she does the most that she can with such a quiet, introspective role. The same goes for Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton really. The cinematography was, at times, a bit too dark. Intentional or not, still not that satisfying. Overall, this is an ambitious sci-fi flick that isn't reliant on twists, turns, or action and for that it is very recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie about a father trying to save his son with super powers. Sounds pretty cool, right? Yeah, I thought so, too. It's not that this movie is complete garbage, because it isn't. It's just misguided. And slow. Really really slow.In the beginning we see a boy, Alton, who has been kidnapped--or so we are lead to believe. We soon figure out that he's been taken by his biological father (Michael Shannon), away from a Branch Davidian-type cult that's exploiting Alton for his powers. This is, by far, the best point in the film. We're excited to see what's about to happen. Somebody's got a secret. There's going to be a cool twist somewhere! ?Don't hold your breath.Certain things always remain unclear. At times this feels intentional. Not using contrived means of letting us in on what's happening--instead, revealing it to us slowly throughout the movie. But what seems artistic at first, soon makes you realize that maybe it's just done as a means to fill up its runtime.The acting is very impressive. Everyone is perfectly believable in their own respective roles. But unfortunately, that technique--the ambiguous exposition one--also contributes to us feeling like we don't really know our characters very well. It's hard to get attached. It's even harder to care.We're also never really sure what Alton's super powers consist of. He can control electricity and stuff, but what's with his laser eyes?There's a lot wrong with Midnight Special. And honestly, I can live with those reasonably minor pitfalls. The main problem? This film should be way more fun than it is. It's nowhere near as cool as the concept leads us to believe. The most interesting part is the end, which is all too brief. The issue is this film commits way too much to the "realism" aspect of its "magic realism" label. We don't get enough of what sets it apart from other movies with similar story lines. We get mystery, but much of it goes unsolved. Even after the movie ends.But like I said, this film isn't a total wash. As slow as it is, the dialogue is engaging. And it keeps us in our seats waiting to see what happens. But then, at a particular point in the movie--I can't remember exactly when--we realize it's not going to resolve at all how we want it to. That's when we feel cheated.I'm still not quite sure why they decided to name it "Midnight Special". It makes me think of some sort of neo-western. But it's not. It's about a boy with unclear super powers.Twizard Rating: 68</fullReview>
