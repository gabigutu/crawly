		<shortDescription>See ISTL for Tom Hiddleston's great performance and for Hank's eternal songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that some of this film's structural flaws will keep many from seeing one of the best on screen performances I've seen in years. Hiddleston's Hank Williams is a masterful creation: haunting, driven and soulful with the added bonus of Hiddleston doing his own singing and playing (no lip-syncing) including Hank's famous yodel. While the film would have benefited with less marital squabbling and more music, it nonetheless takes one on an gripping journey of an American music icon's tragic life and short but amazing career.Elizabeth Olson as Audrey, William's headstrong wife, does a fine job but I could have done with less of their relationship story and more about Hank's musical process. Cherry Jones is also excellent as Hank's bossy mom.The stellar singing in the opening segment is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a reason this film was pulled from release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie last fall, just a few weeks prior to the original release date. I was happy with the choice of Tom Hiddleston as Hank Williams. He had the physical look to carry it off and I know he has the talent. I just wish I could say the same with the script.This story seems to focus on his first marriage and that relationship. Out of everything Hank Williams did, this is what they focus on? Other than the music, they barely touched on everything that made him such a colorful character. It didn't help that there was little chemistry between two lead characters. Lifetime movies have better stories and chemistry.Tom Hiddleston did a nice job with his singing but that isn't worth watching this movie. Hopefully, this will get buried and someone with more knowledge of Hank Williams can bring more deserving movie to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a big Hank fan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm only 25 years old, but I have almost all of Hank's music and have read multiple books in high school about him (including "Hank Williams: The Biography" by Colin Escott). So needless to say, I had high hopes for this movie.I feel like my high hopes were mostly met. I thought the movie did a very good job of laying out Hank's life and showing his stardom as well as struggles. I didn't like as much that it was rated R vs a PG-13 for "Walk the Line", but then again, anyone who has studied Hank knows that his life was rough and he wasn't candy-coated by any means. I think Tom Hiddleston does a very good job as Hank, though maybe not QUITE as spot on as I would've liked. But when a big movie comes out about probably my biggest musical artist of all-time, I won't complain. From what I've read, Mr. Hiddleston was basically trained to be as spot-on as possible, and when I saw the movie, he had me believing it was Hank. Elizabeth Olsen did a very good job as Audrey as well.Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie and am anticipating any special edition releases when it comes out on DVD in a few months. Of course, there were moments of sadness especially toward the end, but there were also moments of happiness and (at least for me) a few chuckles. Although I wouldn't rank this as high as "Walk the Line" in my list of biopics, it was definitely worth the price of admission to me and I would totally see it again if given the opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hiddleston does Hank admirably--the movie no so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" or "Your Cheatin' Heart" might have been better titles for the Hank Williams biopic, "I Saw the Light." The story written and directed by Marc Abraham has too much emphasis on his lonely, cheating persona that led to divorce and broken hearts along the arc of this film's 1944 to 1953, when he died of too much drugs and alcohol. After seeing Amy, about Amy Winehouse, I'm waiting currently for a softer biography, say of Perry Como.Anyway, Tom Hiddleston's turn as Williams is hypnotically spot on from tics and Southern drawl to hats and all the charm in between. Hiddleston is a good singer who seems to have captured Williams in a masterful interpretation of a manic depressive genius. That's my major concern with the story: I want more of the music, its creation and its challenges, and much less of the personal and domestic warfare, led by his wife, Audrey (Elizabeth Olsen).Olsen's Southern accent is impressively accurate without being too twangy although her singing is not up to Huddleston's level of smoothness. Audrey was apparently a strong woman who interjected herself into the studio as well as the home. Although she isn't as memorable as June Carter Cash, she is a force in Williams' life. At a point I was sympathetic to her and her children, who were small players in Williams' life.I guess if you really want to know Hank Williams, listen to his songs. If you want to see what Loki can do outside of science fiction, see him play Hank Williams in I Saw the Light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Portrayal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a movie critic, just an ordinary person who loves sitting in a dark theater and letting the magic take over. I Saw The Light was pure magic. Tom Huddleston, whom I'd never heard of before, was perfect for the role of Hank Williams. He took me back in time and let me see the pain and suffering the icon faced daily. Hank's was a tortured soul and maybe that contributed to his greatness. Huddleston captured that and pulled back the curtain, letting us see inside the man. I think Huddleston did an excellent job with not only the songs (his voice was flawless) but with the exact mannerisms and nuances of Hank Williams. I thank him for doing such an awesome job and for a short time whisked me back so I could once again enjoy the icon's music. It was difficult to keep my feet still because I wanted to get up and dance. This was a great movie and I hope to see Tom Huddleston in other roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Saw The Light: An intimate experience of Hank Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got to hand it to director Mark Abraham. All the things he got right in "I Saw The Light" were far more impactful than things he missed. After reading other reviews I thought I was going to come away from the movie unsatisfied, but instead it was the opposite. I really like that this movie was a more subdued and intimate look at Hank Williams. It's not fast paced or a high frequency drama. It's an intimate peak into the personal side of Hank during the last 5-6 years of his life with singing performances speckled throughout. The acting performances are fantastic especially Tom Hiddleston who transforms himself into Hank beautifully and does a fine job singing Hank's songs.Many of the complaints of the film were from people who wanted to see the historical Hank Williams film. The whole boilerplate biopic from childhood to all the milestones of his rise to stardom and the impact he had on American music. People wanted to know why Hank was the way he was and did the things he did. Yet conflicted, talented artists tend to always defy being wrapped up into nice, little 120 minute boxes with definitive explanations supplied. With that in mind Abraham did the next best thing and what was always his intention, created and showed a personal experience of Hank. To have the audience feel what it was like to be in his life. In that endeavor the director got it right many times over. By casting Hiddleston to play such a complex and conflicted person, it humanizes Hank and makes him relatable. Tom's performance allows people to have an endearing empathy and compassion for Hank and see this troubled cultural hero from a personal perspective.Although there's a lot the director left out or only made reference to, the main problem with the film is in the weaving of all the many relationships and chapters of Hank's tumultuous life into a cohesive harmony. Still "I Saw The Light" delivers an insightful and engaging experience of the great country star that we have never seen before and with a masterly produced soundtrack that sets the tone and carries you through this little beauty of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some outstanding performances make up for a flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part about going into a film with low expectations is being pleasantly surprised. "I Saw the Light" is Marc Abraham's biopic about country music legend, Hank Williams, starring Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen as Williams' first wife, Audrey. I am no fan of country music, but I'll be honest, I am a big fan of Tom Hiddleston.Despite living a very short life (Williams died when he was only 29), Williams managed to write and release dozens of hit singles and leave an everlasting mark on the history of music. "I Saw the Light" attempts to capture this short, but brightly burning star, in his entirety and in doing so, manages to miss on most everything. There is no denying that both Hiddleston and Olsen give remarkably nuanced performances and Hiddleston's transformation from English gentleman to smalltown Southern boy is nothing short of brilliant, but sadly not even their acting can make up for a poorly conceived and executed story. The story, while apparently linear, jumps from place to place, with little explanation, thus leaving the audience to try and fill in the missing pieces, which is an impossible task for those who do not know Hank Williams' life."I Saw the Light" is a flawed film from the structure, to the script, with some truly cringe worthy lines, to some terrible use of hand held cameras, yet I still enjoyed myself. Knowing that it was not a great film, I was able to just focus on what were Oscar worthy performances by both Hiddleston and Olsen. I left with little understanding of Hank Williams, but perhaps a better appreciation of his music. It was a fine way to spend a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. If you like Olsen or Hiddleston, it is worth seeing, otherwise wait for streaming or other media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done biography type picture that told the rise and fall of a country legend who went quick at a young age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up I was more familiar with Hank Williams Jr. and his music still I heard stories about the life and hard times of his legendary dad Hank Sr. and how that his life was short and tragic. With this film a biography typed called "I Saw the Light"(a hit Williams song)it's very informative and interesting as it shows the rise and complex life of a man who battled the bottle and women which all lead to his tragic young end.Tom Hiddleston is in top form as the country legend he plays Hank to near perfection from his accent to his posture and movements and actually does a pretty good job singing Hank Williams songs. The film just really is a chapter by chapter turn in the life of the country western music legend showing his rise to fame sadly the fame was mixed with man problems like failed marriages and many different lady friends and Hank had plenty of kids with different mothers as they gave birth to them out of wedlock. And his biggest inner personal demons was his battle with the bottle, it's clear the sorrow and sadness of Hank's short life was fueled by alcohol and whiskey. Overall well done film that shed light on the tragic life of a young legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised at the Negative Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Saw the Light" is the latest film about the much-troubled country music singer/song writer, Hank Williams. British actor Tom Hiddleston landed the lead role, and I thought he was fantastic. Yes, the script did not lend itself to being an autobiography, so if this is what the viewer wants, they need to look further. It is leaps and bounds better than the 1964 mess "Your Cheatin' Heart," starring George Hamilton. I am puzzled by the hammering of this movie by other critics. Many have said it only focused on a narrow part of Williams' life, i.e. he was an alcoholic, skirt-chasing hound dog. Well guys...like it or not, he WAS that. I guarantee you if the film had come across all s*its and giggles, the critics would have complained because the movie did not really tell what the real Hank Williams was like-- inevitably a no win situation.I have great admiration and respect for ANY actor who does his/her own singing, especially when they are portraying a legend in the music industry. I mean look what "Coal Miner's Daughter" did for Sissy Spacek. I won't go so far as to say Hiddleston's was as good as Sissy's, but it was pretty darn close. There were also some aspects of Williams' life that I never knew about. I did not know he had spina bifeda, nor how he discovered that particular ailment. "I Saw the Light" isn't a super movie, but it is better all way around than most other pieces of crap that are in release right now. It is a close call for me, but I do recommend it. The film is rated "R" for language, brief nudity, and scenes of hinted drug use. It's worth viewing for the great music, if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Most Hollywood musical biopics follow a similar and predictable structure, which is why Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story was so easily able to parody the genre. Of course, the legendary singer/songwriter Hank Williams deserves more than predictable storytelling ? but unfortunately, that's exactly what he gets here.Tom Hiddleston delivers a spot on physical impersonation of Hank ? right down to the slightly hunched over (due to Spina Bifida Occulta) posture and bouncy onstage waggle. Yes, the very British Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki in The Avengers and Thor movies, has managed to capture the presence of one of the all-time great Country and Western icons. Mr. Hiddleston worked on the beloved songs with Rodney Crowell and delivers some very nice singing - so nice in fact that the singing is distracting and misleading. Hank Williams sang his songs in angst ? a tortured soul seemingly without choice in his need to share his art. No one could be expected to perform with that emotion, and the void is obvious.As source material, director Marc Abraham (Flash of Genius, 2008) utilizes "Hank Williams: The Biography" co-written by George Merritt, Colin Escott, and William MacEwen. It may be the least creative title possible for a biography, and the movie correlates perfectly. We track Hank's early days as a struggling singer whose dream is to someday perform on the hallowed stage of The Grand Ole Opry, to his gas station marriage to Audrey May (Elizabeth Olsen), through his alcoholism, drug use, womanizing, superstardom, fall from grace, and ultimately tragic death at the age of 29.Despite the nature of Williams' short life, the film only skims the surface and rarely digs too deeply. The steady stream of women/wives is difficult to track ? perhaps that's the point. Audrey is the only one who gets much screen time and Ms. Olsen plays her as an ambitious shrew who comes across as impossible to like and as unwilling to work at the relationship. A staggering number of Hank Williams songs are embedded as merely interludes separating scenes of misery for all involved ? especially Hank, who seems to find little joy in life.We've all seen the destruction that fame often leads to, and when combined with Hank's painful back disorder and relentless alcoholism, it's little wonder his body simply surrendered at such an early age. The movie just seems a bit too high-gloss for such a tortured soul, and despite the best efforts of Tom Hiddleston, the film is not worthy of someone who left the musical legacy of Hank Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth watching for Hank fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. It is hard to turn your eyes away from the screen. I had to remind myself that I was not watching the real Hank Williams...Hiddleston is that good in the part. His movements as he sang were just like Hank. He sounded good, too. Hard to believe he was actually singing and talking like Hank...and Tom is a Brit. I also liked the slower pace of the movie...gave me a chance to feel Hank's back pain, love, loss, alcoholism. The 40s-50s time period was a treat to watch along with all the old recording equipment. I especially enjoyed seeing the vintage kitchen...even had the long sink/counter that people would take with them when they moved in those days. After I watched this movie, I got out my old Hank albums and listened again. So good and gone way too soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't need to like country western music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hank Williams was one of those talents who just seem to come along ever so often from "out of nowhere" and becomes a legend in his own time. Hank was a candle that burnt out quickly but only leaving behind great music, which was later recorded by just about every big name in the music business of the sixties and seventies, anyway.I am a sucker for true stories and "time pieces" so this was a film I wanted to see as soon as I saw an advert for it, even though I did not like country western in the days Mr Williams was still alive. Hank Williams is however a major reason I started listening to country western, and the lead actor Tim Hiddleston looks like Hank and portrays him as accurately as I suspect anybody could without making him look "cardboard".The music is played throughout the film and the scenery was well researched. (Don't look for any out of era vehicles, I don't think you will find any.)The film is best for an adult crowd for the language used in the film, but if you can see this for the great film I think it is, you will enjoy it.If this film is not Oscar material...nothing is of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wonder if I would have liked the real Hank Williams as much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Country singer and songwriter Hank Willims achieves success, but has ongoing battles with alcoholism, substance abuse, womanising, his wife, and disease.Tom Hiddleston stars as Williams, and in him lies the film's main strength and also weakness. It is a good performance, with Hiddleston showing considerable musical chops (the number against which the opening titles are shown is simply stunning), but at its heart is Hiddleston's innate likability. Willims had to be likable on stage and on radio, but I strongly suspect ? and the events of the film bear it out ? that he wasn't that likable when out of the public eye, yet he always seems likable here, whether drunk, womanising or generally being a bad husband. For that reason, I'm not sure that we saw a fair portrait of the artist.The period detail is good, the music is presented well, and Elizabeth Olsen as wife Audrey is (as usual) wonderful. There were times when the dialogue was either lost in the mix or incomprehensible to a non-Southerner, but not to the extent that I couldn't follow it.It's an enjoyable film (especially if you don't know much about Williams, as I didn't), but it may not be as true as one might wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting could not overcome the bad writing. Worth seeing, but temper your expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A man sings a sad song he knows is sad." Hank Williams (Hiddleston) is a country music legend. He has sung and written some of the best song in this and any genre. He also had some demons that destroyed him. Pain and hurt that he felt and caused led to his classic body of work, and ultimately his untimely death. This is a very hard movie to review. After the huge success of Ray and Walk The Line it is a tall order to live up to those two. I wondered why this didn't get a big release, especially considering the Avengers connection. After watching this I can see why. The acting is great. Hiddleston embodies Hank and even does his own singing. Olsen does a spot on job as Audrey and portraying the struggles she went through. The music and performances are a treat to watch. All that said, the movie itself came off as flat and a little uninspired. It was missing something that the other two had and it ultimately ended up hurting the movie and making this a huge disappointment, for me at least. Overall, great acting could not overcome the bad writing. Worth seeing, but temper your expectations. I sadly give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I had hoped...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think if you're going to create a bio-pic, even if you can't fit everything in it, you should include at least a story line that's poignant, or makes sense. I don't know much about Hank Williams, but I fear there was a lot more to him than was presented in this movie.What I really didn't like about the film was the lack of dramatic scenes between the characters. Most of the time, Hank, his wives and producers just sneer at each other and speak with venom of things we as an audience don't quite understand. It's not fully explained why a character is so angry, and they just come off as being really hateful. The writing was a bit lazy, focusing more on the domestic dramas of the main characters rather than the artistry of main character. On the other hand, the acting was splendid. Tom Hiddleston showed everyone that an Englishman could play an all out southern country singer - and he really knocks it out of the park. Elisabeth Olson is of course brilliant as Audrey Williams as well. Had the film gotten a better script and director, I think it would have been a lot more interesting and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grand Old Soap Opry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Saw The Light is a another attempt by Hollywood to exploit the legacy - sorry, dramatize the life of the iconic country singer. Thing is, Hank Williams' life was as full of drama, tragedy and redemption as anyone you could invent. So how is it they make yet another boring Hank Williams movie? Hank Williams - The Soap Opera.I'm a HW fan - not because he was a country star but because he was a great songwriter, as any songwriter worth their salt will tell you. I've seen all the HW movies and plays - not hard, there aren't many - and the ones that fail his musical legacy worst are the ones that show HW as a depressed, cantankerous, drunken hick from the sticks without having original, or close-to-original music that lets you forgive him all of that. It's because his music was so genuine, and a lot of it so good, that we see past the miserable, drunken hick to the sensitive man. Get the music wrong and you're left with a royal P.I.T.A.ISTL shows what drunks turn to in the end, but HW was more than that. A talented, intelligent, very insecure man - a Buddy Holly with issues - who was ruthlessly exploited by everyone - his mother, his managers, his wives, his doctors and now, the movie industry. And he let himself be exploited, past caring by the age of 29. That's what is interesting about him - not his decline, but the contrast of a man who could perfectly express common human feelings, but couldn't say 'no' to people (both sexes) who wanted to manage and manipulate him, and who medicated himself with the bottle on top of what his quack gave him for what's thought to be spina bifida. Keith Richards lifestyle, Billy Graham conscience.In a film about a musician, Tom Hiddleston delivers a just-about-competent musical performance. Not saying he can't act, this is just a Justin Timberlake version of one of the most soulful and expressive voices in a narrow genre. So unless you know HW's music in you head, it's another dud.If you're still interested in HW, keep an eye out for such by Simon W Donaldson, a fine (tall, thin) Scottish actor whose Hank Williams IS actually eerily accurate (apart from the yodel) and deeply perceptive. No doubt Simon does other stuff. Hiddleston as Bond? Don't make me laugh - maybe he'll sing the theme song too (let's hope not).PS In a way, the inability of Hollywood to turn Hank Williams into a merchandising franchise is a good thing - the authenticity of HW's life and unique sound - that transcends its time and genre - is incompatible with the complete falsity of the modern marketing system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All about the scandals, not enough about Hank being an artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie has its release date changed, that's almost never a good sign. It shows the studio has no faith in the movie. And so this happened with "I Saw the Light," which was supposed to be released in November to prime it for upcoming awards shows such as the Oscars and Golden Globes. After a tepid opening at the Toronto Film Festival in Sept. 2015, the film was moved out of the awards season and into the spring. That is because the movie is just not that good. It's all about the scandals of Hank Williams life and it barely skims who he was as an artist. We see him indulging in womanizing, drinking, and pill popping. We see his health problems and him showing up late or not all for shows and then being fired from the Opry. But how did he develop as a singer and song writer? What was it that drove his creative process? How did he inspire future generations of singers years after his death? I don't really know from watching this film. Hiddleston is convincing as a Southerner and does a good job doing his own singing. Cherry Jones gives a strong performance as his mother. But they can't save this slow paced, meandering film. A better film can be made about this great artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I Saw the Light" sheds precious little light on its fascinating and flawed subject.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many ways to make a biographical motion picture, or biopic, but most of the possibilities seem to line up with one of three basic approaches. (1) Go into depth regarding the subject's character by focusing on one or a very few key incidents in the person's life, which we saw in "Hitchcock" (2012), "Lincoln" (2012), "Selma" (2014), "Steve Jobs" (2015) and "The Revenant" (2015). (2) Tell the part of story that makes him or her most compelling by concentrating on a relatively narrow period in his or her life, as with "42" (2013) "American Sniper" (2014), "The Danish Girl" (2015), "Trumbo" (2015) and "Race" (2016). (3) Portray the individual's life story by carefully selecting a limited number of incidents or time periods that illustrate the entire arc of that person's life, as in "J. Edgar" (2011), "The Iron Lady" (2012), "Lee Daniel's The Butler" (2013), "The Imitation Game" (2014) and "Pawn Sacrifice" (2015). One 2016 biopic, "I Saw the Light" (R, 2:03), takes approach #2, telling the story of Hank Williams in his 20s.A slimmed-down Tom Hiddleston plays the legendary country singer during the period from December 15, 1944 until January 1, 1953. It's during these years that he attained major success, enjoyed it for a while and then squandered it. This particular stretch of time also matches almost exactly with his marriage to wannabe country singer, Audrey Williams (Elizabeth Olsen). As Hank was becoming more popular and more famous, Audrey insisted on singing duets with Hank, both on the radio and on stage, in spite of her lack of discernible talent. This ongoing problem caused stress between Hank and his band, "The Drifting Cowboys", and between Hank and Audrey. Hank's problems were also constantly exacerbated by his judgmental and meddling mother and erstwhile manager, Lilli (Cherry Jones). Other aspects of Williams' family life that we see include his relationship with his kids, especially Hank Jr.Of course, this movie is mainly about Hank Williams' success and influence as a musician. Part of that story is told through simulated interview clips with record producer Fred Rose (Bradley Whitford), who also appears in several scenes during Williams' rise to fame. The film gives indications of his increasing popularity and we hear at least part of Williams' most popular songs. Ongoing themes include his hard-won (and later, tumultuous) relationship with the Grand Ole Opry, along with the chronic back pain, drug abuse, alcoholism and womanizing which held him back from even greater heights within the country music community ? and greater peace and happiness in his life. The film shows Williams for who he was, warts and all, but sheds precious little light on the inspiration for his music, which should have been the film's main purpose. You would think that a movie called "I Saw the Light" would make some things clearer ? including William's deep Christian faith which led him to write the film's title song."I Saw the Light" feels incomplete, not because of the relatively narrow period of Williams' life that the filmmakers chose to highlight, but because what is shown is simply underdeveloped. Movie Fans who are only marginally familiar with Hank Williams will learn a lot and probably enjoy seeing the interesting story of his time as a famous country singer unfold on screen. Unfortunately, those people will probably end the movie frustrated with the questions the film raises, while Hank Williams fans will likely be dissatisfied by the obvious gaps in the story. Steven Spielberg could get away with that in "Lincoln", but Hank Williams' story isn't quite as well-known as that of our 16th President. Key events and references in writer-director Marc Abraham's script go unexplained ("Louisiana Stampede"?) and his direction doesn't let us see the full range of emotions that must have accompanied some of the situations in this film.In a biopic, quality performances are especially crucial. Hiddleston and Olsen both do strong work, but the favorable comparison between Hiddleston's Williams and Sissy Spacek's Loretta Lynn in 1980's "Coal Miner's Daughter" is a stretch. Hiddleston does his own singing, which is serviceable, but it has been publicly criticized by some, including Hank Williams III. Olsen's role fits her like a glove and Hiddleston seems very comfortable in his role, but can't quite muster the deep-seated southern sensibility which typified the real Hank Williams. Sadly, with an under-written script, inconsistent direction and solid, but unremarkable acting all Movie Fans have here is an average biopic of a flawed but exceptional man. "B-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie and was very moved by Tom Hiddleston's performance which I thought was brilliant. I have nothing against Shreveport, but I always prefer movies filmed in their actual locations. So I would have liked it better if the movie had been filmed in Alabama and Tennessee - but I can let that go. I thought the female roles were well done. My only real disappointment with this film is the truncated ending. We have Hank Williams leaving in his blue Cadillac convertible from Montgomery and then we skip to Canton, Ohio and his death announcement. I wish we could have seen something of those two days. I've always been suspicious of the cause of death - heart failure is very unusual for a 29-year-old. Still, this is a very see-able film and I think the IMDb rating of 5.7 is too low for such a good film. Dan Finley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tedious, slow, too much mumbling. I couldn't understand a word, to be honest, except when Tom H. sang. Only worth watching for him, the hats and the outfits. Subtitles would have helped. There were only about a dozen other punters watching and half of them fell asleep (including me at some point). There were a couple of very moving bits, especially when Hank's death was announced and I can't remember the other bit. I suppose the period detail was authentic but I wouldn't know anything about the grand ole opry, living in the UK as I do. I liked the songs though, as I knew the popular ones. Had a nice new forest ice cream, which is always good and only ?1.50 &#x1f601;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a great vehicle to prove what a great leading man Tom Hiddleston is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth may have gotten the lead in Thor but it was Mr. Hiddleston who became the movie star.I don't know much about Hank Williams other than his name is legendary in country music, but I do know Hiddleston and I loved his performance in this movie. He was charming,charismatic and very different from a lot of things I've seen him it (quite possibly due to his weight loss for the part). I Saw the Light if anything, is a testimony of his skills.Elisabeth Olsen was great in the film too in her supporting role as Hank's first wife. Olsen and Hiddleston show they were great together on screen. The movie takes some getting use to as it's not your typical biopic. It takes a low tone on how the story is told and somehow is all over the place without being all over the place. It relies greatly on Hiddleston's personality to tell you the story of Hank Williams the the movie itself is not saying much of.I saw that a few country music fans did not like the movie and what it says about Hank Williams, and I get that. If you are a fan of Tom Hiddleston however, it's not a bad watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wanted to Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie... I wanted it to be a huge breakout solo hit for Tom Hiddleston, but it just wasn't that great. The writing seemed a bit cheesy and it took a while to get moving and that didn't happen until pretty far in, about the time his back problem was finally explained. From there on out, his drinking becomes obvious, but there is still too much left unmentioned about his marriage and what lead him to such destructive behavior. Hank Williams has been gone for a long time... I think we needed more of a reminder about who he was and what he went through. The music is great... there is talent in the film and you can tell that Tom Hiddleston put a lot of work into it, but it just doesn't come together. I guess in the end there was just too much left unexplained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thin biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hank Williams (Tom Hiddleston) marries recently divorced single mom Audrey (Elizabeth Olsen) in 1944 in an Alabama gas station. He's a hard drinking country singer with some small success. She starts singing with him despite objections from the band and his mother (Cherry Jones). Audrey's constant calling gets Fred Rose (Bradley Whitford) to sign them. They stop Audrey's singing as Hank strives to perform in the Opry. His constant back pains leading to alcohol and pain killer use is finally diagnosed as chronic spina bifida occulta. After his divorce from Audrey, he has a brief affair with Bobbi Jett resulting in a daughter. He meets teenager Billie Jean Jones (Maddie Hasson) and later marries her. He would die on January 1, 1953.There is nothing substantive here. One would be better off to listen to Hank Williams music while watching a documentary about his life. It's very thin and I'm not talking about Hiddleston's physicality. One rarely gets a sense of the man or his marriage. There is no tension. There is no sense of his life or his work. His struggle with his back and alcohol is the obvious path but the movie doesn't elevate his pain. This is a waste of perfectly good talents. I laid all the blame on Marc Abraham who is more a producer than a writer or director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surely Hank Williams was more interesting than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away from this with the same reaction I have to so many biopics: the best way to know an artist his through his or her work.Tom Hiddleston gives a credible performance, but it seemed just that-- a performance. It lacked any spark of charisma to make me care for Williams with any emotional depth. Curious that an English actor would take on this role, even to the extent of singing. The fact of having Hiddleston sing instead of using actual Williams recordings was a gamble that did not pay off for me. When Hiddleston sings "Cold, Cold Heart" very early on his cover was off just enough to be jarring to me. You can teach a dog to walk on its hind legs, but what you still have is a dog walking on its hind legs.The movie spends a lot of time on Willims' stormy relationship with his first wife Audrey--the first scene with them has them being married. So, we jump in when Williams was 21, at a time that precluded any discussion of Willaims' youth. Seeing what the foundation was for the talent that was to come would have been of interest. Williams led a hectic life and I wish this movie could have been edited better to allow for guiding us through the maelstrom with better clarity.There was a dichotomy between what we see of Williams' life and the lyrics of his songs. Where did deeply sensitive lyrics like,----------I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dreamYet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?------------come from? On the up side, this movie reminded me of what a wonderful songwriter Williams was, how in such a short life he gave us so many memorable songs.Maybe what makes an artist tick must always remain a mystery, but I did not get too close to what made Williams' tick from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I Saw the Light" review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are all sorts of ways to tell someone's story. But by far, a by-the-numbers type biopic is the most boring. Far too plain to pay homage in any kind of impactful way, "I Saw the Light" is deserving of little more than a spot on the Lifetime Channel.Synopsis: The life and times of country-western singer, Hank Williams Sr.Problem is (aside from the vanilla handling of the live fast, die young material) for the most part this movie flies though certain aspects of the story without explanation or exposition. I really never got to know who Hank Williams Sr. truly was. And it is my opinion that no matter how famous the subject, if one has to be a die-hard fan or have read a book to grasp onto what they are watching, the director and/or screenwriter(s) (in this case, Marc Abraham) have failed their audience.The performances from Tom Hiddleston (Hank Williams Sr.) and Elizabeth Olsen (Audrey Williams, Hank's first wife) are more than serviceable, as these are two emerging powerhouses in their field. And at the end of the day, no matter how much I believe Abraham mishandled this story, "I Saw the Light" was always going to live and die on Hiddleston's singing abilities (as Hiddleston's actual singing voice is used in this film); an aspect which Abraham wasn't afraid to put into the forefront of his feature. And the results are?well, he's no Joaquin Phoenix.Final Thought: It is impossible not to draw comparisons to James Mangold's "Walk the Line", as the both are bios of legendary country-western singers set within a decade of one another. But when you realize that "I Saw the Light" shows its hand within the first 20 minutes (meaning: this film was all it was ever going to be within the first 20 minutes) you may find yourself sinking in your seat, as the comparison will become so distractingly overwhelming, that it should find a majority to perceive "I Saw the Light" as instantly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performance by Hiddleston in an otherwise superficial film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hiddleston provides a performance that is an uncanny depiction of Hank Williams, and was an excellent choice for this role (as there was the expected backlash against casting an English actor for this role, but this backlash was, in my opinion, without merit).The pity is that the movie is quite superficial - it is meant to be about the relationship between Hank and Aubrey, but it never truly uncovers the nature of their relationship. Quick scenes that aren't given time to develop make the movie a bit difficult to follow, and does not truly understand what made Williams such a big country star. The songs are great, of course, but what made Williams so special? The film does not quite answer this question.Still, though, when Hiddleston is on the screen the film is compelling, but otherwise the film is a bit mundane at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more about Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I SAW THE LIGHT is a performance-driven biopic. Tom Hiddleston transformed himself into the late great Hank Williams, and Elizabeth Olsen holds her ground, these two amazing talents burn the screen with such passion and ferocity. The film however is just textbook biopic, nothing that you haven't already seen before. It's well-intentioned but at the end of the day, Marc Abraham's adaption is uninspired.I SAW THE LIGHT essentially is the story of the legendary country western singer Hank Williams, one all-time greats in American music. Starring Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen, I SAW THE LIGHT chronicles Hank's rise to fame which has tragic effect on his health and personal life.Please keep in mind that I didn't grow up a fan of country music, I don't hate it, I appreciate it but I don't have huge country music encyclopedia to discern on whether or not Tom Hiddleston's performance as Hank Williams is accurate. Those of you who are fans of country and specifically fans of Hank Williams can make that comparison and can better judge Hiddleston in terms of his singing skills, if he talks and walks like Hank, so on and so forth. But when I said earlier that Hiddleston transformed is that you really don't see Hiddleston up there on the screen, at least I didn't. And for an outsider, a British to embody; to capture the essence of one of this country's legends, that's something that warrants some degree of respect. Part of what makes I SAW THE LIGHT interesting is the tumultuous and sometimes hostile relationship between Hank (Tom Hiddleston) and Audrey Williams (Elizabeth Olsen). When you have two people, each of whom thinks that they should be the bigger star, when two egos collide, it makes for a compelling drama.The story however is not well-structured, it constantly cuts way too quickly from one scene to the next, it comes across as impatient. And although it's not a from the cradle to the grave type biopic, it focuses only on a few years of Hank's life till his downfall, I SAW THE LIGHT is really nothing new, we've seen this before. Superstars drinking, doing drugs, cheating on their spouses, we've seen what fame does to characters on screen. We've seen "Walk The Line" and others like it, and so I SAW THE LIGHT is more about Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen, that's the big draw, the main attraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "I Saw the Light", starring Tom Hiddleston-Loki in the Avengers movies, War Horse; Elizabeth Olsen-The Scarlet Witch in the Avengers movies, Bradley Whitford-Saving Mr. Banks, The Cabin in the Woods_2012 and Cherry Jones-24_tv, The Village.This movie is about the short life of country-western singer/songwriter Hank Williams-he died at the age of 29. Before I go any further, I must confess, I am not a country music fan. I prefer rock, myself. So, I was not too fond of the music in this movie. It was good-Tom did his own singing, no lip-synching here-but it's just not my cup of tea. Having said that, the story was pretty good. Tom plays Hank Williams and Elizabeth is his wife-his first one anyway. Cherry plays Tom's mother and Bradley was the guy getting Tom his gigs-Tom's ultimate goal was to be on the Grand Ole Opry, which he did. I was familiar with the music- not a fan, but I was familiar with it-because my father used to play it when I was growing up. I was not familiar with the story, however. Tom actually ran a lot, to get his body into the thin shape and he does look a lot like Hank. Tom goes through alcohol and women like a hot knife thru butter. Problem was, it had an effect on his life. He had bad back problems-spinal bifidia-bad marriages and was a pill-popping alcoholic. He could write and sing though. If you are a country music fan, you will probably enjoy it even more than I did. It's rated "R" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 3 minutes. It's not one that I would buy but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can Hank be made so 1 dimensional?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hiddleston couldn't play a chord if His life depended on it, and the sound editors of this movie left the Auto Tune software on "11" for the entire flick! So if the actor playing Hank .. can't sing or play guitar - what is the point? I have read the Colin Escott book that the movie is "supposedly" based on! And every other biography of "Hank"! Hank had his issues, but "everyone" who came in contact with him became his friend! Why? Because Hank could charm the pants off anyone, and was a good friend! This movie shows none of that! Hank as portrayed in this biopic is someone who We don't even care about! Why care about Hank as Hiddleston plays him? This picture portrays Hank as a miserable, helpless person. Although Hank was in constant pain, everyone who met hank "in real life" loved him.No-one loves the Hank shown in this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Saw The LightThe number one threat to a country music star's career is their successful transition into pop music.Unfortunately, the cowboy crooner in this biopic didn't live long enough to employ auto-tune.Repetitively rejected from the Grand Ole Opry for his youthful inexperience, Hank Williams (Tom Hiddleston) wasn't able to strike a cord with promotes, fans, and later Hollywood, until he started composing ditties inspired by spats he had had with his singing partner and wife (Elizabeth Olsen).But just as those hit records were rolling in, Hank's dalliances, hard drinking and drug use derailed his meteoric rise. Although Hiddleston is able to embody the honky-tonk hero in appearance and essence, his vocal range is lacking that hillbilly twang. Meanwhile, the laborious script and ham-fisted director are more concerned with chastising him for his faults than celebrating his triumphs.Incidentally, sex with Minnie Pearl was not the cause of his death.

		<shortDescription>How not to make a music biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing which made this dreary movie bearable was Tom Hiddleston's singing. Why a great classical actor such as Hiddleston (Henry V in The Hollow Crown) found himself in this yawnfest is beyond comprehension. Where they should have had an exciting montage showing Hank Williams going from smoky sweaty honky tonks in the South to Grand ol' Oprey and beyond, performing one song after another, we got a dull flat cheating husband soap opera played out in tacky motel rooms. Compared with the Johnny Cash biopic I Walk the Line, this was a waste of money and the waste of time spent watching it. The film had a budget TV movie feel with the major sets being outside the front door of William's home and a budget hotel room, which appeared to be the same one throughout. Even the scenes of meetings consisted of a man sitting behind a desk face by one or two others and little movement. The long farewell to his wife before he drove away to his unexpected death was excruciatingly corny.The lone star is Tom Hiddleston's singing, of which we heard far too little. I hope his career survives.</fullReview>
