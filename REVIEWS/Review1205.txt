		<shortDescription>Much, much more than just a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken as a light comedy, this movie would rate perhaps eight stars out of ten. But it's much, much more than just a light comedy. It is, in fact, utterly unique. The character of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, is, quite literally, a man without a future.What do we gain from watching this movie? Different people will take away different things from it. I discovered two very important truths in Groundhog Day.One was the importance of concentrating on the things that last. Phil Connors must live the same day over and over again, and is forced to realize that the only real change that will ever be possible must happen within himself. (From this it is a short leap to the realization that this is the only kind of change that really matters; for in his case, it is literally true.) It is at this point that he takes up piano, begins reading, learns to ice-sculpt. But if it weren't for his unique predicament, he never would have realized this; in his routine at the TV studio back in Pittsburgh, we surmise, there was always something changing...and not changing. (It is interesting that Phil is a weatherman: the weather is a perfect metaphor for something that changes constantly...without, in the long term, changing at all.) We can be distracted by the superficial changes in the world around us, and forget that real change in our lives must come from within. This was the great gift of Groundhog Day for Phil Connors: the chance to discover this truth for himself.The other thing I noticed, while reflecting on this movie, is how uncertainty can keep us from charitable acts. We use our ignorance like a crutch: we don't give to charity because it may be a scam, we don't offer to help someone because they may not need help anyway, and so on. But Phil doesn't have the luxury of ignorance. He knows...he knows with absolute certainty that if he doesn't buy the old man a bowl of soup, that man will die in the streets within a few hours. He knows that if he isn't on hand at the right time, a boy will fall from a tree and break his neck. Faced with such knowledge, even Phil, self-absorbed as he is, cannot stand by idly. Nor could we, in his position. This is a powerful argument for knowledge as the most reliable foundation for generous behavior. What other movie can offer an insight half so profound?Many more truths can be mined from this movie. As others have said, this is a thought experiment that went very well indeed--better than anything I've ever seen on the Big Screen. As such, I'd vote for it as one of the greatest movies ever made, and very likely the most underrated movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect blend of comedy, clever plotting, and character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after I've watched them enough times that the humor no longer surprises me. A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as "Groundhog Day," which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.Superficially, this film belongs roughly in the same genre as "All of Me" and "Liar Liar," comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy, whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film, where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman, Murray's hard-edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is, "I may be having a problem." Uh, no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film, he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation, like "My years are not advancing as fast as you might think." It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully, but it reflects a well-conceived screenplay.In this comedy, the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough, but every time that alarm clock goes off, and the radio starts playing, "I Got You Babe," and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy ("Phiiiil?"), I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film (I've met one or two) emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint, since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. "Groundhog Day," however, works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.The film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hour-and-a-half showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that "Groundhog Day" avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities, since most high-concept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. "Groundhog Day" is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise, leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely: it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic, and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.It is in the middle, centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita, when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things (such as his exploits with Nancy) under ordinary circumstances, without the hocus pocus. In the end, his powers don't matter, because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing, but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god, but he isn't all-powerful.Phil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita, the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap, for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning, even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier, Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's "defining characteristic," and, indeed, he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end; he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.I have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth, but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film, the effect is intentional, for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.Though this film has a serious message, it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point. After the laughter has worn down, "Groundhog Day" turns out to be one of the richest and deepest films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.* * * * *ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. "When you hit it right, those things last."I found that quote in a story on Ramis' death. The story curiously did not mention "Groundhog Day." If there is any film to serve as a fitting memorial for Harold Ramis, it must be "Groundhog Day." A totally perfect script, perfectly executed. He hit it right, and when will he get the recognition he deserved decades ago?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the gods wish to punish us...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude. I love this movie ? not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away ? they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing? Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray's greatest movie and one of the greatest comedies, no, one of the great movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two clues to tell if a movie is great is how often it is copied and how it has become a part of American slang. Groundhog Day has had both happen to it. Warning: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Bill Murray played Phil Connors, a egocentric and grumpy weatherman in Pennsylvania who goes to Punxsutawny, Pa every year to see if the groundhog sees his shadow for the local television station with his producer, played by the wonderful Andie MacDowell, and his cameraman, played by a low keyed Chris Elliot.Everything goes as Phil expects on the first day, except he is caught in a blizzard and has to stay the night. The next morning he awakes and it's Groundhog Day again! This pattern happens over and over again until he realizes he cannot escape Groundhog Day. In time Phil realizes the advantages of knowing what's going to happen before it happens and Murray takes full comic advantage of it. However if this film was just that, it would be just a normal run of the mill comedy. Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person during the course of the film and learns to love the town in which he felt he was trapped in. The chemistry with MacDowell's character of Rita is wonderful. It's a great film and to my mind the best comedy, no perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious concept, enthusiastically presented.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).Pittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.It seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movies can change lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often you hear the adage, "It is just a film". Well, for most times it is true. But on rarest of rare occasions, it isn't. This was one of them. Like a great piece literature, painting, poetry, speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Waking Life, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the "intro" to the review might suggest. In fact it an extremely entertaining and funny film with one of the best performances ever by Bill Murray. The plot revolves around a weather man (Bill Murray) is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting "rat" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay, editing and performances. Bear in mind that, the "loops" Bill Murray's character goes through, might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play, who seem to introduce a "novelty" factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes, it is funny, but make no mistake about it, it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent. It tells you what it intends to on your terms. It deals with the questions that bother us for a better part of our lives i.e. meaning of life, purpose of life, existentialism, death, god but never preaches, nor propels any propaganda. But by the end of it, you know that something has changed, something you didn't see coming has happened. And then you watch it again only to realize the moment of Epiphany that eluded you the first time.Every time I am down or losing perspective this is the movie that eases everything and makes me ask a simple question, "What is important?". One of the absolute great films of the 90s, but more than just a film for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* May contain spoilers *Let's face it: everyone's a sucker for romantic comedies, but this one is something special. This movie has as much charm as it has bite, thanks to a fantastic script and Murray's excellent performance. Never dull or cheesy, this wonderful fantasy tale just hits all the right notes, and if anyone knows a better rom-com, please name it. I mean: what other romantic comedies are there where the protagonist commits suicide and you just have to laugh?I've watched 'Groundhog Day' countless times and, without a doubt, I will watch it again and again (or for as long as I keep waking up to that nerve-wrecking song by Sonny &amp; Cher).

		<fullReview>Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager :)--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes "Groundhog Day" so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale "A Christmas Story," which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called "Scrooged." Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, "I'm-smarter-than-you" face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis, director of "Analyze This," star of "Stripes," directed "Groundhog Day." Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.Another thing that is great about "Groundhog Day" is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but "Groundhog Day" does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of "Groundhog Day." I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named "Delirious." It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where "Groundhog Day" steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in "Groundhog Day." And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not counting Caddy shack, this is Bill Murray's best performance. While Christmas and Halloween have their annual holiday movies, who would have thought that Groundhog Day would have a movie of its own.A terrific (family) movie, Bill Murray stars as a sullen / sarcastic news reporter who is stuck living the same day over and over again....until he gets it right. This comedy stands alone as one of the funniest and most original movies of the 90's. Not many comedies can be funny and also end with a moral. Groundhog Day has both. Before the Farrelly Brothers or Wes Anderson found an audience, there was Groundhog Day. Pennsylvania never looked better or funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of hard to pinpoint what makes 'Groundhog Day' work just right- many movies have great premises, some even a bit more ambitious than this one (though not as heartfelt, maybe) but fail. I think that 'ratedness' may play a bigger role than people imagine. For example, this movie came out a bit before my time, and because of that I missed the trailers and stuff for when the film came out. Even so, people that were around when 'Groundhog' came out in the theatres, might've also thought it was underrated, as the title 'Groundog Day' doesn't necessarily *try* to draw in huge crowds.OK...all my above rambling means one thing: I loved 'Groundhog Day', but I'm embarrassed I didn't watch it sooner. Having the typical Generation X-er mentality I assumed this film would have outdated humour- but let me assure you (and seeing Rushmore confirmed this for me) -Bill Murray and his humour will NEVER go out of style; he is fabulous. He takes just the right amount of self-deprication (not too much) and combines it with cynicism....well I don't want to try to *define* his humour- the easiest way would be to watch him in action! Also, the writing for this film is absolutely perfect.Go see for yourselves... and hope that ONE DAY the groundhog will actually NOT see his shadow......lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a fifth dimension, beyond that known to man....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a winner in almost all respects, a kind of comic Twilight Zone episode that never quits. Murray has had roles in which he does nothing funny but seems to stand around waiting for laughs anyway, wearing a goofy expectant smile, as in "Stripes." But not here. This is probably his best role. He may still have the goofy expression but this time the laughs arrive on time.The movie excells at three levels.One is the overall conception, the comic theme itself. Murray, a sarcastic and sadistic weatherman finds himself stuck in a small dreary town in Pennsylvania with two colleagues, one of them Andie MacDowell, his producer. They cover the local Groundhog Day celebration then find themselves unable to leave because of a blizzard. The next morning Murray wakes up to find that it's the same Groundhog Day all over again. And the next morning too. And so on ad almost infinitum. So far so good. A nice concept but it could go either way, depending on how it's handled. In fact, it's handled very well. What could have been a one-gag movie that ran out of steam after the first quarter hour turns instead into a neatly logical progression of plot and character development. Murray of course is the centerpiece of the tale and it is his changes that occupy our attention; the other roles, although well done, are mostly there to provide reflections on Murray's moral evolution. (Andie MacDowell, wardrobed in slacks, white blouse and checked vest, and done up with long fluffy curly black hair, looks radiantly appealing.)Murray's reaction discovering that he is now living Day Two is one of a terrible anxiety. He manages to get this across effectively, even though it is tinged with his own brand of distant amusement. On Day Three he is depressed and gets drunk. On Day Four he realizes that tomorrow will have no consequences and tests this hypothesis by breaking all of the rules of traffic. As the days pass, he plans to seduce MacDowell, and he implements his plan cleverly, discovering more and more about her -- her favorite drink, her favorite toast, the kind of man she is looking for. He has so much time on his hands that he learns to play the piano expertly because MacDowell likes men who play instruments. His scheme seems to be working but no matter how perfect his playacting he simply cannot get her into bed in one single day -- and every day he must start over with her from scratch. ("Twelve years of Catholic school speaking," she tells him.) Eventually, however, he comes to realize that he really DOES care for her because, after all, he's gotten to know her quite well with the passage of time, although she doesn't know it. When he undergoes this epiphany he goes about doing good, no longer just acting nice but actually BEING nice, whether it advances his desire to get her in the sack or not. Obliquely, indirectly, it works without his having intended it to. She falls for him and they live happily ever after. That's the overall conception and it's very well handled.Level Two is the script, the dialogue, and this too is superior. How many movies can throw in a handfull of quotes from Sir Walter Scott and people of that ilk -- one quote is in French -- without making a contemporary audience, used to MTV, squirm? "And winter/ slumbering in the open ground/ wears upon his smiling face/ a dream of spring." And it isn't just stuck into the script; it fits into the scene and is an appropriate comment on the plot. But more than that, the lines are not only intelligent but sometimes very witty. Just a few examples that come to mind.On Day Two, I believe, Murray is sitting in a bowling alley with two local drunks, bemoaning his fate. He once spent a beautiful day in the Carribean with a gorgeous girl. They drank pina coladas. They watched the sun go down and then they made love like two otters. Why couldn't he be stuck in THAT day instead of this one? "How would you feel," he asks his pals, "if you woke up every morning and it was the same awful day and nothing you ever did made the slightest difference because nothing meant anything?" One of the drunks, glumly replies: "That about sums it up."On Day Three, Murray and MacDowell are sitting in the Tip Top Cafe and he has a huge tray of fattening food in front of him. He lights a cigaretteand stuffs whipped-cream pastries into his mouth. MacDowell: "I hate to see a man of your advanced years destroying himself." Murray: "Maybe they're not advancing as fast as you think."Last example from dialogue, somewhere down the time line, after he's begun worming his way into her affections: Murray and MacDowell are walking along at night in the snow, her arm through his, and she tells him, "Thank you for a very nice day. It's the kind of day that could never be planned." Murray: "Well -- it CAN be planned but it takes a lot of work."The third level at which the movie works is, very simply, the actual small bits of business that the actors involve themselves in. Ramis, the director, plays the doctor who checks out X-rays of Murray's skull to see if there's any pathology. Ramis stares at the photos and says, "No clots, no tumors, no aneurysms -- at least as far as I can see," then he turns around and squints tightly and rapidly three time in a row. (Who thinks up something like that?) And Murray takes a girl to a Clint Eastwood movie and does an expert impression of Eastwood, from the Man With No Name costume to the voice. When he turns his back and speaks, it sounds exactly like Eastwood. There are running gags about things like innocent-looking but bottomless puddles in the gutter. I know that some of these things sound old, but they are so well realized here that we can forget their age. They seem born anew, just like Murray.There is one danger in a story like this that the movie skirts neatly. The romance between Murray and MacDowell, had more been made of it, could easily have turned cloying. That's what happens to Jack London's characters in "The Sea Wolf." You've got to handle this carefully, because, as we all know, comedy in itself is of no significance. (How many comedies win academy awards?) The movie has to be about something deeper, of course, and the sort of logic that comes to that conclusions must also come to the conclusion that the audience consists of an unwashed horde of semi-moronic dolts who must have the "seriousness" pounded into their heads with a sixteen-pound sledge hammer. The problem is deftly avoided in "Groundhog Day." The romance is funny more often than not. And during the moments when it isn't played for laughs, it advances our understanding of the changes in Murray's character. And MacDowell looks angelic enough that Murray's growing feelings for her are believable. I should also mention the use of appropriate musical numbers on the track. "The Pennsylvania Polka" is used as punctuation throughout. Midway through the movie, we get Ray Charles' "You Don't Know Me," underlining the uncertainty of the romance. By the end we have an even more romantic theme from Rachmaninoff that begins in sincerity and ends in a jolly jazzed-up version.This is one of the best comedies of the last ten or fifteen years, including "The In Laws" and "The Freshman" and "My Cousin Vinny." Before that, there were "Love at First Bite" and "Murder by Death." Pure comedies, successful ones, come along rarely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endless day where everyday is like Sunday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phil Connors, a cynical and unbearable journalist goes like every year in a small town in Pennsylvania to report on "Groundhog Day", it means the beginning of the spring. But, he is out of luck because due to the bad weather, he and his crew (including the pretty Rita) he is compelled to stay at his work place for the night. The following day, he awakes and lives exactly the same day again but he is the only one to realize it. It is like this, the next days again and again! What should Phil do to stop this? Maybe an improvement of his personality would be the wisest solution.You can easily imagine what a filmmaker like Frank Capra would have done with such a topic but Harold Ramis managed very well and he signs here his most beautiful success to date and one of the finest comedies of the nineties. The main strength of "Groundhog Day" comes from a strong and inventive screenplay which enables Bill Murray to go through all the different states which is logical because if tomorrow is the same day, anything goes for him! The script also draws its comical force from the repetition. This process gives delightful sequences, notably in the first part of the movie. You have to see Murray live the same day again, faced with the same situations and as he despises people, it can only make the spectator laugh. Moreover, Ramis described his main character by mocking at him a little.Of course, the evolution followed by Murray is a little predictable (scornful at the beginning, he will succeed in becoming nice at the end of the film and in finding love with Rita) and you easily guess the message that Ramis tries to put across. But it remains nevertheless warm and deeply humane. However that may be, the director gave us a pleasant, sometimes funny sometimes moving movie to watch. And it is one of Bill Murray's best performances: fair, never bombastic. What more could you ask from him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Is Jesus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis. He's Chicago born Jew with no religious training. He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station. Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema. The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.There are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning. Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again. Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior. Every man is trapped by his wiring. Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany. We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eternal movie.... (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought at first that it was only a concept movie: a "what-if" story; an unbelievable story in reality but a very funny &amp; rich one in the philosophical reflexion, like only arts can offer. Another example of this free creativity would be for me "Back to the future"... You can't go back in your past, but your imagination does! Here's the bottled-up feeling of eternity is excellently considered: the assets (you have time to learn, you know everything &amp; every one...) and the pitfalls (a final boredom, the sadness of losing people without preventing it,...)Then, I realised that this movie is closer to every one's life than many others.... The revelation occurred while the chat between Bill Murray &amp; 2 buddies at the bar:- "What would you do if you were stuck in one place, every day was exactly the same, nothing you did mattered ?"- "That about sums it up for me;"It's my life: I always complain about today is like yesterday &amp; as tomorrow! Getting up tired, taking crowded subways, managing different kind of people with a perverse boss, back to the home to eat nearly the eternal same supper, complicated relationship..... Well, same day over, over &amp; over....That's me, maybe you, and you or you..... This movie appeals to every one: Fantastic! And it offers in addition a solution: being socially generous.... Smile, help as much as you can &amp; you will have the payback: your life will improve!!!! Zen, philosophy, psychology, religion says the same thing but in hundred years, thousand pages of writing..... Here's what a 2 hours movie can do!!!But that's not all: all this would have been impossible without this superb duo of Bill Murray &amp; Andie MacDowell: I am a fan of both and they excel in this movie: I think they never have been closer than their true self: Murray has really two faces: the cynic &amp; the kind... MacDowell: well, she smiles, she laughs, she plays, she is kind, romantic, honorable, trustful... the perfect soulmate for every one...And the final touch: the Director: Harold Ramis.. I was a fan of National lampoon, Ghostbusters and with his DVD commentary, I discover a great man: sympathetic, spiritual. He shares his enthusiasm with success and gives great insights for his movie (the symbolic &amp; funny thanks of all the town as his motivation to direct...)So, if you have infinite time, enjoy this one as much.. And if you don't have time, give yourself a little to view it !!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the most novel and entertaining of movies, a genuine modern classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Groundhog Day" is Bill Murray's serious movie. Along with Andie McDowell they make great chemistry. "Phil" is the wise-cracking weatherman who thinks he is too good for everyone else. He is in PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa to do a newscast, and wishes he were just about anywhere else. They get snowed in, have to spend the night, and the next morning at 6AM the fun begins.It is groundhog day again! He goes out, sees all the same people, doing and saying all the same things. To everyone else, this is the only time they have lived this particular day. But for Phil, it is the second time. In fact, every morning thereafter he awakes at 6AM to exactly the same music, the same day, it looks like it will be for eternity.January 2007: Just watched it yet again, it never gets old. (pun)Feb, 2, 2009 - Groundhog Day - I just watched it again. Never gets old!!Feb 4, 2010 - Two days late. But never better, I even saw some things that escaped me the first several times. CAUTION--SPOILERS--At first, Phil takes the "repeat" days to deal in funny, or cruel, ways with others he knows he will meet. He knows everything will be wiped clean and he can start fresh the next day. No one but he will remember what happened the prior day. After a while, he gets depressed at the thought of being sentenced to an eternity of living the same day, so he tries to kill himself. Jumping off a building, taking a bath with a toaster, driving a car off a cliff, getting into the path of a truck. He succeeds each time, however when 6AM comes the next day, he's back in his bed, Groundhog Day again, and his daily cycle starts again. And eventually he decides to go ahead and try to make good use of his situation.So he takes on new hobbies. He becomes expert at ice sculpture, medicine, piano-playing, poetry, and a number of others. He comes to know all the people in town, not only their names but also intimate details of their lives. The film never hints at how many times he re-lives the same day. However, to gain all the proficiencies he did, it must have been several hundred. Perhaps even in the thousands. But that detail doesn't matter.As he becomes more and more charming, he decides to try and seduce his producer, played by McDowell. Each day he gets a bit farther, only to show off as the real jerk that he is, then is slapped and snubbed. But each day, since he is the only one who remembers, he gets a bit further. However, he is destined to never get the girl, unless he really changes, and he doesn't realize this.In the last 1/4 of the film, he has become a truly changed man. He helps people because it is the right thing to do. He is humble about his successes, and it is this change that ultimately attracts the woman of his dreams, and which gets him out of the seemingly endless cycle of re-playing Groundhog Day.And that, in a nutshell, is what the film is all about. In a unique way - the re-play of a day - it is a commentary on the need to be true and pure in our intentions to be able to get out of our rut and make any meaningful contribution to this world. I rate it "10", and is one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the best movies of all times - on a comical level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit this movie was one of my favorites when I was a teenager. I'm just watching it again, and I felt it necessary to review this film, as the effect has not only not faded away, but actually made the jokes more powerful - as I grasp on them differently, more fully. Bill Murry's jerk character is so hilarious and original, and his lines are so funny that you cannot resist liking him. On the other hand Andy's angelic, curly haired, innocent face opposes this brut.I think one of the smartest ideas is that the setting is pure and simple: it could be anywhere BUT nowhere important. Of course, it is important for our character to get stuck in the middle of nowhere - as of course it wouldn't come as a curse to spend every day on a nice island or a big city. Here monotomy hits us hard. And here comes the maturity: people in their 30s, 40s can easily get the metaphor: that 'every day looks the same'. We work, sleep, eat, .... and what else? Something is missing, right? It takes an eternity to realize that there are more important things, human relations, remembering who we are, what makes us happy - and the full capacity of love. This deeper message is nicely wrapped in a funny storytelling, and even more hilarious actions. I don't think we have to simplify it for a "bad" man becoming "good", more virtous, but rather waking up from his own 'groundhog' sleep, a sleep in which he has been spending most of his life....Have fun, and don't be afraid of your own shadow:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** O'boy here be spoilers ** Phil (Murray) is a meteorologist in Pittsburg. He is totally egocentric and does not like at all that he has been assigned to go to Punxsutawney and cover Groundhog day. Along with him goes sweet Rita (MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Elliott). Phil, just wants to do the work and leave as quick as possible ( or before that if he gets his say). Well, unfortunately for Phil, a snowstorm (that he himself predicted would miss them) makes leaving town impossible and when Phil wakes up it's Groundhog day all over again. Phil is stuck. Stuck in Punxsutawney and stuck on Groundhog day. What to do? Well, you could perfect the arts or study. You could get dates with attractive women just by trial and error. You could be the biggest jerk in the world or an angel sent from above. You could rob a bank or kidnap a famous woodchuck. Or you could get depressed and kill yourself in a lot of different (more or less creative) ways. And always wake up to the same day all over again. Phil does all that. But how to solve this mysterious riddle so that poor Phil can go on with his life?A funny and interesting movie, with funny little quirks. The story is great, and the concept of it brings a _lot_ of unique possibilities, most of them followed through in the movie. Good work Ramis and Rubin! Murray is great as the sarcastic Phil. He is asked to act out in a lot of different moods and situations and pull all of them off brilliantly. MacDowell is good as well, even if her character is given a secondary role to that of Murray. Elliot's character is even more in the perimeter but he is good and occasionally chips in with a funny tidbit. But mostly, the movie is funny because of a great story, Murray's acting and a nice directing and editing. There is a romantic bit in the movie as well, but in my opinion that is well integrated in the comedic part, which is the one emphasized.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly deep and also hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Groundhog Day" is another example of a movie that deserved multiple nominations (and wins) at the Academy Awards. At the time, it was often dismissed as a light fantasy-comedy. But actually Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis wrote an incredibly intelligent, heartwarming, and funny script, and Bill Murray put in the performance of his lifetime.Phil Connors, played by Murray, is having a bad day. A nearly infinite amount of times. I don't believe the story that the movie takes place over 10 years of reliving the same day; it's clearly implied that it's A LOT more than that, and that's what the screenwriter originally had intended anyway. And this is where the brilliance of both the script and Murray's performance lies; we're not watching the same thing over and over again, because we have as a focal point Phil, who's reliving the day and reacting to it differently each time. The stages he goes through until he finally learns to accept it and try to make something of it are interesting. By the end of the movie he's reached something akin to nirvana, where every move he makes is perfect, and thus he's finally allowed to move on.We never get an explanation of why this is happening, which only heightens our fascination of it. It seems implied by the ending that something divine is going on; Phil really seems to reach perfection, a state of being, perhaps, a perfect human being, or as close to it as we can get, and that's where the timescale becomes apparent; think how long it would take to achieve such a thing! And all this is masked at first appearance by all the humor going on. At first glance, it really appears to be a screwball comedy (and even as such, it's laugh-out-loud funny), and you can't see the brilliance behind everything. It's a nearly perfect movie, and it's one of my favorites.</fullReview>

First times I watched the movie ( I already have seen it a dozen times) I just laughed about it. But after some times watching I saw what the director wanted to say with it.In my own life the same thing happened but not as heavy as in the movie. I mean, in my life the day just become another day. ( really I ask myself, the only thing that was different that was the date) I think a lot of people live in groundhog day, doing the same thing again and again, not taking the best out of life. Just living without any consciousness. Not having enough time by their own fault, because time is a thing you can offer yourself by making other choices.Groundhog day....I personally am getting rid of that day more and more fortunately and finally too. More and more I am trying to make best of life and using every day in another way. I am not crazy. No, I just watch movies with some kind of view lately. In every movie there is a hidden message told.Enough about Ground Hog day....I gave the movie an 8 because the number 8 is the number of eternity. And that's also a thing the movie is about. About eternity and not about the bad and boring repeating of the stupid livings.Danny</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this is one of the few movies of recent vintage that could be called a writer's story. It's wonderfully thematic! Phil has so much to learn and takes a long time to learn it, but what he learns is so encouraging and humanistic. He learns that by developing his artistic side he will learn to love and be loved. He learns to sculpt and play the piano beautifully. And, it seems to me, finally, that he chooses to do it for the right reasons: the pure joy of expression, the pleasure of bringing beauty and truth to the world. My wife asked me in wonder how I could love this flick so much; it's so unrealistic. But, ah, the theme is so strong that I want to suspend my disbelief. It functions ultimately as an allegory. We must all learn to try to forget ourselves and concentrate on the moment, live each day not as if it will be our last, but as though it will be our only day! When we learn that lesson, then we can begin to live again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable comedy that is totally driven by a great Bill Murray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weather man Phil goes to a small village in Western Pennsylvania to cover the start of spring on Groundhog Day. Despite his cynical approach to the whole thing he gets through the day but gets trapped in the town by a blizzard. However he finds that he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again bringing him out in a series of reactions until he can work out what he is meant to learn.The premises sounds silly ? who would want to watch the same day over and over again? Even if it is a comedy? However with Harold Ramis in control this easily becomes something better than it sounds. The plot may be a sentimental thing at the end of the day but since the plot is simple it leaves a lot of space for things to repeat. The message when it comes is good ? about becoming a better person and learning to care for others being the most important stage.The key to the film however is the space where things just repeat. This leaves Bill Murray plenty of time to let his sarcastic wit run riot ? whether it be cruel as at the start or more gentle towards the end. His impact on the film is immeasurable. Unless you hate him then he makes the whole film work.The rest of the cast is made up of plenty of well-known faces from similar comedy films. Andie MacDowell may not have been the best choice for a love interest but she's actually not too bad compared to how vapid she can be. The rest of the cast has the likes of Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky, Doyle-Murphy etc ? a whole pile of `where have I seen him before' types.Overall this is a very enjoyable comedy from a good director and great star. The film is a good idea but it is totally brought to life by a wonderful performance by Murray. The film may well be a slight comedy at heart but it is very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read somewhere that the Internet is full of philosophers and religions that have adopted this movie as their favorite parable. I'm not surprised, but that's not the reason I love it.This movie starts with a premise that could be light, silly, trite, or promising but disappointing. Through deft writing and Murray's amazing comic timing, it manages to be none of those. The movie just keeps getting better the longer you watch it, and every silliness comes with a bit of serious thinking behind it.Take home from this movie: A visceral awareness of what really matters in life, and how your own attitude in it is really everything there is. Not just mostly... entirely everything.This movie threatens at first to go on forever, but after a while I wished it would. It compresses the lesson of "It's a Wonderful Life" into its first act, and then improves continually from there. I honestly can't think of how this movie could be improved.To see how bad this movie *could* have been, watch "Multiplicity" with Michael Keaton. Then watch "Groundhog Day" again and enjoy. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual that I enjoyed a film involving the supernatural so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not common that a film involving the surreal or supernatural - especially time travel - is so successful. I think the reason for this is that once you enter that realm, literally anything goes. That concept may seem exciting at first, but in practice it can become so illogical and have so little basis in reality that ultimately we can't relate to it. Consider how silly time travel can become. For example, in "Back to the Future", looking at a photograph and seeing the people in it start to fade?? C'mon. Or dealing with "paradoxes" such as going back in time and killing your grandfather. What now?Not trying to explain how time travel occurs, this movie skirts those issues by simply backing up and reliving a day (there is no chance to "travel back to the future" - you must "live through it".) One of the reasons it is so successful is that while ultimately a happy movie, the truly horrible feelings that would inevitably arise in this situation are also explored. Finally living through his day to the next day is a metaphor in this case for the maturing of the main character. He does not know what is happening to him, but in the end he has been allowed a period of experimentation and growth. Haven't we all fantasised about that? For example, having 10 fresh chances to approach a person of the opposite sex we want to meet and seeing which works best? In the meantime the film explores this journey with both humour and sorrow. Having 10 fresh chances to try something sounds great if it's your *choice* - but not so great if you never get to stop the carousel and say "That's a keeper - let's get on with my life now!" Few actors other than Murray could play this role so well - he seems perfectly cast. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I haven't watched this in awhile, I found it a very nice lighthearted romance/comedy that got better with each of the three times I viewed it. The role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.You would think a movie with this plot - the same day reoccurring day after day - would grow thin in a hurry but it doesn't. The screenwriters and actors all made it clever and fun to view each "new day." All the characters from Murray to female lead Andie MacDowell to the supporting actors do a great job of keeping the story fresh. Particularly funny was Stephen Tobolowsky, who portrays a nerdy insurance salesman. I liked Marita Geraghty, too, and it was fun to see Rick Ducommun again, my favorite actor from "The 'burbs." For a modern-day comedy, the language in here is very mild. The only drawback was seeing MacDowell's character compromise her wholesome values at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>philosophical comedy genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS It's almost unheard of for a piece of comedy genius to also be so deeply meaningful and philosophical. Yet, in 1993's "Groundhog Day", writer Danny Rubin has created something very special. Hilarious at times and often quite deep, this film is deservedly praised by everyone who sees it.Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant news reader. Travelling to Puxatony to witness the world famous Groundhog Day, Connors finds himself repeating this day over and over. With none of his actions affecting his life, Connors firstly experiments with life before realising that he could well be stuck repeating this same day for eternity.This light hearted comedy is perhaps Bill Murray's finest performance. Going through a renaissance of sorts since the Millennium, Murray has evolved into a much more serious actor. Deservedly Oscar nominated for "Lost In Translation" (2004), Murray is at his funniest all these years back in 1993. Rude and self obsessed to begin with, the transformation of Murray's character is pure genius as he relives the same day continuously until he learns the error of his ways and wins the girl (played surprisingly well by Andie MacDowell).The social commentary of this film is absolutely superb. The way Connors is able to often deceive others with prior knowledge is superb. As, most notably, is the way that Andie MacDowell's Rita can so magically change her opinion of Phil the second that she finds out that he plays an instrument. Rita is actually just as superficial as Connors and truthfully it would be brilliant to see how well the two coped over the following few months after the film ended.Personally the finest Philosophical story about this film is the death of the old homeless guy. Irrelevant of how Connors acts, this man always dies at the same point of the day. As the doctor says 'it was just his time'. This quote is brilliant because it suggests that however we live our lives, when we are due to die, we are due to die. This is one of the most important, most powerful, messages of the film, and it is delivered with subtlety and beauty. Full marks to director Harold Ramis for this one five minute period of skill.It's easy to over think the intelligence of "Groundhog Day". Yes first and foremost it is a comedy, but it is also incredibly easy to see more depth in a generally simple comedy. So, as a comedy, let us consider it's main points. Well, firstly it is a hilarious piece of work which is well written and adequately shot. Secondly it is brilliantly acted by everyone involved, including the usually awful Andie MacDowell. Finally, it is a feel good story which leaves you with a smile on your face. So whether you think of the film as being deep or whether you view it as a simple romantic comedy, it is perfect on either level. It is genuinely an excellent film.Brilliant on so many levels, "Groundhog Day" is one of the finest romantic comedies of all time. Daft but entertaining, it features a great performance by Bill Murray as well as a potentially deep message. All in all, it's just a superb entertaining film and it should be watched at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man, what a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1993 was a wonderful movie year. 2 movie masterpieces stand out today from it; "Schindler's list" and "Groundhog day". Personally, I always loved the second one more. "Groundhog day" is a perfect example why Bill Murray will always be a superior actor than the Oscar darlings Tom Hanks and Spencer Tracy. He plays Phil whom thanks to a time distortion ( a day repeating itself again and again ) gets away with stealing money, committing suicide 20 times, sleeping with local girls without consequences and finding out everyones deepest secrets. The story is so subtle that you may at first think its just a comedy. But once you think about it, you will realize how almost every problem from life is contained in it. Most noticeable, the one about how people will make the same mistakes again and again, until they change. And that's what's all about: change. Once when Phil changes himself, the world changes finally too. He is a grown man, but childish in his persona. That's why thanks to the time distortion he ages psychologically, until he finally becomes a real man, not a spoiled kid. This is an extreme satire about life. Think about it. Its about the imprisoned human spirit crying for a change, a difference. Phil became an individual, the only person on Earth that has self-consciousness. At that moment all other characters just became puppets. You can also regard it as a parody of Totalitarian regimes ( Phil is the only person that does something different than the others, and that's why he is misunderstood ). Plus the explanation for the mysterious time distortion is never given. It's shown more like something as natural as the weather, something that just happened.--------------The only great film the director Harold Ramis ever made, "Groundhog day" was until recently the highest marked Murray film on the site rotten-tomatoes.com with extremely high average grade of 8.1/10. "Lost in translation" beat it, with 8.4/10, but quite frankly, it was overrated. If there was any justice, "Groundhog day" should have won Oscars and Golden Globes for the best picture, script and the main actor. But alas, since Murray was underrated for so long, its finally time he gets overrated for once!You just have to love him when he is in the studio doing a weather forecast: "In California there is going to be a big heat tomorrow, and gang fights and too high real estate prizes too. Oh, what's this? A cold front is coming up! Fuuuu( blows the clouds on the screen)." The only flaw is that some better director could have directed it more radical and extreme than Ramis, but if we love Frank Capra, we must love this symbolic story about the triumph of emotions over cold cynicism.Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest comedy of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray is without a doubt one of my favourite comedians. His deadpan, laid back attitude always makes him a hoot to watch. That was one of the reasons why Ghostbusters was such a success. But Groundhog Day has got to be his best comedy since, because this ingenious Harold Ramis film is tailor made for Bill Murray's talents.Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors. A selfish, cynical and sarcastic man, he is not one of the easiest people in the world to like. Every February 2nd, he travels to Punxsutawney, P.A. to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival. Legend has it if the groundhog (also called Phil) sees a shadow, it won't be an early Spring.This is an event Phil hates, and he can't stand the town. This year, he goes there with his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) whom he insults every chance he gets, and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). Phil falls in love with Rita, but can't open up to her in that way, and comes off as arrogant to her.This marks his fourth visit to Punxsatawney, and after Phil (the groundhog) predicts that Winter won't be ending anytime soon this year, Phil can't wait to leave town. But a blizzard unexpectedly strands Phil, Rita and Larry, and they are forced to spend another night in Punxatawney.When Phil wakes up the next morning, he's got a real freaky sense of deja vu. His clock radio is blaring out "I Got You Babe", the DJs are saying the exact same shtick as yesterday, and when he looks out the window, people are getting ready to go out. It's Groundhog Day all over again.Everyone else doesn't seem to notice, and to them everything is perfectly normal. What is wonderful about this film is the way it explores every possible angle to Phil's situation and covers such a wide spectrum of emotion. From being initially baffled, to exploiting it for his own gain, depression, suicide, acceptance, and finally, self-reflection.Despite the repetition of this never-ending day, it surprisingly never becomes boring. Although the situations may be the same, you know Bill Murray is going to do something slightly different with it. His reactions are priceless, and he experiments in a variety of different ways.An example is when he runs into an old high school friend, Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). An insurance salesman who is ingratiating, persistent and extremely annoying. Someone you can't wait to get away from. After a couple of times Phil punches Ned, and then much later, embraces him, to Ned's horror. Stephen Tobolowsky is perfect as Ned, and nobody else could have done the performance as well.I like the part when Phil has different ways of destroying the clock radio, from knocking it off the table, to hurling it to the floor. That's understandable if you had to wake up to "I Got You Babe" every single morning. Harold Ramis clearly wanted to be as inventive as possible with this comedy, to keep the viewers interest, which he certainly did.Phil's various suicide attempts are a highlight in a morbid way, because he goes through every death imaginable to try to break this time warp. Unsuccessfully of course.The main focus of the film is Phil's attempts to get it on with Rita. But she is not the kind of person who just wants to get into bed with someone, unlike Phil. Although he does learn things about Rita, he just can't seem to make it work with her. But eventually, Phil gradually realises his shortcomings, and begins to change things about himself.Phil learns to appreciate life more, and begins to care a great deal for the people of Punxatawney. One of my favourite scenes is when he tries to save a homeless man from dying of old age. But every day, he still dies, no matter what Phil's efforts.The film does have a happy ending, but it doesn't feel contrived the way Scrooged was. You are genuinely happy for Phil when he finally wakes up to a Groundhog Day with Rita who loves him in return. Wisely, we never find out what was causing the time warp. It adds to the charm of this film. Any attempt to explain it would have cheapened the impact.This will always be one of my favourite films, and the wonderful range of quirky characters ensure you will always be entertained. Harold Ramis showed a capacity for storytelling on a par with Frank Capra, giving us a benign story about how you can improve yourself today for a better tomorrow.Groundhog Day is a timeless film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My humble Groundhog Day opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this movie.....I saw it years after it came out, and I admit "The Razor's Edge" (also a Bill Murray movie) is another of my favorites. However, I think that for some reason, the people that gravitate toward this film also tend to be "karma sympathizers", slightly Hindu, or at least appreciate the spiritual parallels.If someone as cynical as Bill (Phil) can be redeemed on the day where for thousands of years, a small little animal has to choose between the dark and the light, than anyone watching knows they too can go out and be a better person. I had forgotten it was Paxsutawney Phil's day to shine till I looked at the news today, but just remembering that film, and its story line makes me want to go out and do something nice for my kids today. Maybe we'll go get cocoa before dance lessons- the sun is shining here! Happy Candlemas/Groundhog day to all...MM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just the greatest movie ever made!!! I think that this movie is just perfect: You have everything in it from Romance to Comedy to sometimes really deep topics. I also like the soundtrack and one very special thing: although the movie was, as far as I now, a hit, they never did a sequel, which is absolutely right, because this movie is one of the rare ones, that are absolutely self-contained. Bill Murray is a great actor and gives his best. You see his perfect play very good in the scene when they build the snowman the second time - the constrained way he acts, when he falls down to the ground and tries to come closer to Rita as naturally as the day before. If you're able to speak or at least understand German, check out the dubbed version with the great Mr Elsholtz (who is also the voice of Tom Hanks and Kevin Kline)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a funny movie, a life lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On this movie, Bill Murray ends up stuck in a rather boring day of his life. He's unhappy with his job and is covering by the third time in a row an event that has no meaning to him. At first he's skeptical and shocked with everything that's happening. He just wanted that day to end since the beginning. His plan was to get there on the night before, sleep, do his jog and go back to his city as soon as possible. But a snowstorm closes the road and his group is forced to spend one more night there and this night is the one that starts to repeat the day making Bill's character stuck. When he realizes what's happening and that there's nothing he can do about it he just stop caring. He drinks, smokes, mock the coverage and the city, steal and do everything he wouldn't do if he knew that the time would pass as normal. He tries to learn about things to use this knowledge in his favor. He ends up knowing everything about the city, the schedule, people's life and preferences. With that he's able to make the day go exactly as he wants to. Eventually he grow tired of it all and just want things to be normal again. Sure it was fun to lie and live the life as nothing bad could happen to him but he misses what we all got, the possibility of a future. And the great lesson we can get from the movie is to try. You don't need to live like this day is going to repeat forever but instead of wait and think about the consequences of your acts just do it. If you wanna do something, get out there and do it. If you don't do it you'll be like Bill's character but in a bad way. The days are going to pass but you'll be stuck always doing the same thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate 80's-style comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) continues the tradition of 80's-style comedies such as THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980), GHOSTBUSTERS (1984) and SCROOGED (1988), although there is a major difference. This one is based on an amazing concept, and has much more ambitious, existentialistic themes, almost in the vein of art-house movies, yet without ever feeling pretentious. It manages to be as thought-provoking and clever as movies by Stanley Kubrick, Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier, but it's told in such a light manner that it's much easier to grasp for mainstream audiences. Therefore it's able to almost sneak its themes in on those, who perhaps aren't normally used to thinking about the movies they watch. To me that's a great accomplishment in itself. GROUNDHOG DAY shows how we shouldn't take the important things for granted, that we should make the most of the time we are given on Earth, and that if the world feels like a terrible place, the changes must come from within yourself.It's a movie which different people will interpret different meanings from. It tells the story of Phil Connors (Bill Murray), an arrogant and egocentric TV weatherman, who goes on an assignment in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where he mysteriously gets forced to live through the same day over and over, apparently with no possibility to break the loop. This gives him the opportunity to explore life without consequences. At first he takes advantage of his situation by stealing money, becoming a drunk, and even committing suicide. Yet Phil soon realizes that his hostility towards the world isn't really because of the world, it's because of himself. The lesson is that he must change within to get together with his dream-woman and live happily ever after. Phil is not supposed to make her like him, he's supposed to make himself a likable guy. If you are constantly angry at the world then search within yourself, because that's most likely where the problem exists.GROUNDHOG DAY is Harold Ramis's greatest movie yet. It far exceeds his other comedies, which are funny movies, but without the grandiosity of this one, in terms of the unique idea and themes. Of course Danny Rubin's ingenious manuscript has to receive credits as well, as it is basically the premise of the whole movie. Bill Murray, who is one of my favorite actors, is perfect as the Phil Corners character. Murray is able to express more than thousands of words with his eyes, and his sense of irony is fully exploited. The cameo-roles are full of comedic character-actors such as Chris Elliott, Harold Ramis (the director) and Stephen Tobolowsky. Pure genius! 10/10</fullReview>

The script, the acting, the directing, and even the music are all excellent. I cannot understand why there had been such little attention from audience to this movie and even the number of comments made are small in the IMDb.It is among my top 5 best loving movies I've ever seen and it really deserves an Oscar though it is regrettable that comedies are rarely considered for the award.It deserves a rating of 9.999 and so I gave it 10, just to round up. Afterall, no movie should be considered completely perfect, but it's nearly there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me the most incredible Hollywood movie to date. And then a comedy! With Bill Murray! Now this is funny!Most comments I have read seem to only just miss the point of this movie. Say a day in the life of Bill is "a life". Say "6:00" is the moment of birth. and you have the story of what we are all about!Bill has many many things to learn. It gives a great view of the process and "the only way out". Not suicide, not cleverness, but "forgetting yourself" and spending your life in beauty in order to help other people. There are limits to this, as the "poor old man" shows.The moment he accepts his faith and starts to help other people he is on his way out. There is a smile on his face. And the morning that the radio did not continue in the familiar way...Any one of us will get out more or less the way Bill does. The number of "days" is not defined. The end-result is.

It shows how you can appreciate every little moment of your life and how this moment can be so vital and catalytic for the rest of your day or for your remaining existence in this world. Also how can you play a very vital role in someone else's life. There is no such thing as fate. Everything is in your hand, in your mind and in your actions. It's never to late to do anything. Learn something new like an art eg. Piano or Sculpture or how to talk to people and to make them feel better about them selves and about you if you are interested.

		<shortDescription>Superb Comedy With A Good Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Groundhog Day is a superb comedy film for two reasons-firstly it is totally funny and makes good use of it's stars; secondly, it has a good message for us all.Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman who heads out to Pennsylvania to cover the start of spring (Groundhog Day). Despite the absolute absurdity of it,the same day keeps repeating over and over again but only Phil seems to notice it.I am unaware of how many times the same day starts over and over-I would guess thirty days plus. This sets up some funny situations. One scene(s) is where Phil keeps bumping into a tramp. The first time, he ignores him and the second time, he ignores him but eventually he ends up giving the tramp a large chunk of dough. Another funny scene involves an old friend and a puddle.You would think that watching the same day repeat would be boring but it is not because the fun is in seeing Phil learn from his mistakes whilst having a good old time. It's also fun seeing Phil's relationship with Rita (played by Andie MacDowell) played over and over again.As the same day keeps repeating itself, Phil gradually changes. At the beginning of the film he is pompous and arrogant but by being forced to repeat the same day, he gradually becomes more sensitive and caring. Therein lies the message. Obviously, in the real world we cannot repeat the same day over and over but wish we could because we could change things. I can think of several days where I wish I could have started again and changed things. I guess this film is telling us to be aware of the consequences of our actions and to treat people the right way. If we could repeat certain days, I am sure we could but we can't so we must try and get things right the first time round.A lovely movie with a lovely message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it snowing in space?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's really not a lot you can say about Groundhog Day that hasn't been said before. It's unlikely that anyone remotely interested in Bill Murray would have long since seen it by now, and in all likelihood loves it because it's nailed on one of Murray's finest pictures. Of course, as is the case with comedy in general, there are those who don't like it, but in my experience it's the one comedy movie that tickles the funny bones of most the most! Some have seen it just the once and loved it but feel it is a once only movie, others such as myself return to it yearly like an old friend because it's a pick me up, a tonic for the troops, it never fails to deliver the goods.That it has struck such a chord over the years is no surprise, it's a genius premise. Grumpy misanthrope TV weather man Phil Connors (Murray) is once again sent out to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. It's a place he considers as dull on earth, the festivities pointless and beneath the broadcasting talent he feels he has. The plan is to get the broadcast done and get out of Punxsutawney as quick as possible. But a snowstorm prevents him leaving and waking up the next day he finds he is stuck in the same Groundhog Day as the day before, and soon he finds that every day is the same day."I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank pi?a coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over, and over, and over..." The film then follows a trajectory that sees Connors go through a number of psychological transformations. From despair to using the situation for nefarious means, to despair again and onto using his unique situation to do good. It's material tailor made for Murray who excels with a number of running gags that get expanded upon with each day. However, the ace up Harold Ramis' (director) sleeve is that the film is more than a comedy, it is also an intelligent character study, a message movie and it also doesn't lack for dramatic purpose, often proving to be a moving experience once the tickled rib pain begins to subside. It's a picture as deep in human awareness as it is rich with comedy value.Andie MacDowell as Rita, Phil's producer and object of his lust throughout the story, proves to be surprisingly good foil for Murray's comedic ebullience. While elsewhere a number of reoccurring characters are performed memorably by the support cast (Stephen Tobolowsky and Chris Elliott standing out). Ramis keeps it brisk, never allowing the plotting to fold in on itself and the sound tracking is irritatingly catchy. But it's with the screenplay (Ramis and Danny Rubin) where ultimately Groundhog day is judged, be it the comedy or human interest, it's a zinger as written. And thankfully, with Murray at the top of his game, the brainy fun on the page is brought vividly to life on the screen. Groundhog Day, one of the finest comedies of the modern era. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most well-known Bill Murray films, a movie that defined a whole subgenre of time travel fiction ? the so called "Groundhog Day Loop" ? while also being a sweet love story in its own right. Nowadays it's a loved classic, and for a good reason. Its premise is really rather simple, a man is forced to live out the exact day over and over again, but the film makers explore its possibilities to their fullest, giving us a tale about the meaning of human interaction, loneliness and the depths we can either sink or rise when there's no one to witness us.This is Bill Murray's film, through and through. His performance was the one that would either make or break the film, and he pulls it off magnificently. He gives us everything. The initial confusion, the horror of realization, the rage against the heavens, the joy of possibilities, the descend into monotony, the despair that comes with time, the strength to still move forwards. All this given with just the right amount of snark to keep the tone comedic, while also selling the depth of the story. I've never seen him show us more range and scale than in this movie.Andie MacDowell also shines as the female lead, and the various other actors give us a nice setting in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it does now if the setting had been a larger city. Now you get to know the locale, the various inhabitants, which makes the humour and drama that much more poignant.Groundhog Day is a fantastic film. Its premise and idea are pure fantasy comedy, but it rounds it up with heavy doses of emotion and drama, while still keeping it lighthearted enough to entertain. And it's those few darker moments that make the overall film shine all that much brighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie worth watching over and over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main theme of the movie is repetition of a day in a simple town. It looks like there is nothing left to do, but the movie illustrates life perfectly, and as people start learning and improving themselves, their life becomes better and they become more likable. This is a movie that can really motivate the watcher to be a better person than he/she was a day before.The main character comes as grumpy and sarcastic, but in the end, he becomes a real artist, because he was motivated and led forward by love. Some things in life can't be achieved by forced repetition or mind hacking, but they depend on the internal values and self- confidence. This movie is a classic that is definitely worth watching a few times, as it represents different phases of life, from the lowest point, up to the total enlightenment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Bill Murray's best films! In fact, the whole cast is really superlative. But no matter how skillful the cast, however, you're not going to get very far if the screenplay is not absolutely first-rate ? and that it is! True, I thought the script's central idea was a bit overdone in places and put too much strain on credulity (e.g. the car plunging off the cliff and bursting into flames), but more than 90% of the time, the narrative does hang together rather well, despite the script's occasional attempts to undermine credulity. Of course it's an idea that Hollywood has used before, but previous versions have not explored its implications as cleverly as this riveting scenario. It's Murray's film. In fact, he is on the screen continually from go to whoa, but he handles the role so cleverly and with such charisma that it's not until is all over that we realize how adept he has been at disguising his continual presence and allowing some of the other actors, like the gifted Andie MacDowell, a few moments center screen.

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest and original "philosophical" comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first movies I bought on DVD after the technology came out in 1997 in the U.S. It is an ideal movie to watch when one feels blue or down in the dumps. Its humorous script and scenes always give me many laughs. Besides the humorous situations Bill Murray's Phil gets into, this film has a distinct message. It is a morality play without being preachy. It lets us see the consequences of living a selfish hedonistic life versus a decent unselfish life. And, it's all done with great humor.The genius of Harold Ramis as a comedy writer is apparent in this film. Ramis wrote some of the funniest scripts of the last half of the 20th century (besides "Groundhog Day" ? "Caddyshack" in 1980, "Stripes" in 1981, "Ghostbusters" in 1984 and others). The trivia section has an interesting item under the IMDb biography of Ramis. He and Bill Murray had a falling out over "Groundhog Day" that ended their collaboration on films. The item refers to an interview Ramis gave. He said the falling out was "due to differing views on what the film should be about (Murray wanted it to be more philosophical, Ramis wanted it to be a comedy)." That seems sad and ironic because this film turned out to be such a great philosophical comedy. I don't know if anyone else has tried to count the number of times that Phil wakes up to the same day, Feb. 2 in this film. The advantage of a DVD makes it a little easier to do that; but still, some of the repetitious scenes flash so quickly that it takes some effort, and sitting through the film a few times to try to nail down the number. My count is 39 times, with the 40th occurrence being Feb. 3. If we were to figure how much time it would take Phil to learn the things he does ? French poetry, playing the piano, ice sculptor, and to do all the good deeds he does, who knows how many days that would take in reality. A big majority of the scenes are his failures that also provide much of the humor. But, toward the end of those, the sense of futility that we viewers begin to feel starts to wear on the humor. So, the filmmakers timed it perfectly and at that point Phil is inspired to turn around ? by something that Rita says. Andie MacDowell plays Phil's TV producer, Rita, very well; and Chris Elliott is very good as Larry, the cameraman.Phil's repeated days probably would have totaled a year or more. The only incongruity in the logic of the plot is at the end. But, without it, the film ending wouldn't make sense. The one characteristic throughout the film up to that point is that only Phil has his days repeated. To everyone else, it's Feb. 2 for the first and only time. And, every day Phil begins with the knowledge (lessons) of the previous repeated days. The accumulation of the days and their experiences explains how Phil can progress from one day to the next when he begins to read, study, play the piano, etc. Of course, some scenes would be a little different over time ? i.e., Phil being able to play the piano a little better on succeeding days with his piano teacher, played by Peggy Roeder.So, for the final February 2, all the people whom Phil has encountered on his many repeated days of Feb. 2 now know him fairly well. It's not likely that he would have been able to do all of what he did in one day, so now all the other characters also have a cumulative memory of days knowing Phil in the past. As I said, it's the only way it makes sense. I wouldn't normally dissect a film this much, but "Groundhog Day" is such a unique concept for a movie that it invites this sort of circumspection and analysis.Here are a few choice lines that alone give a laugh each time. Phil, "Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow? gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. Up in the Pacific Northwest, as you can see, they're going to have some very tall trees."Phil, "Do you ever have dj? vu, Mrs. Lancaster." Mrs. Lancaster, "I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen."On the phone in his room, Phil: "Yeah, sport. I know there's a blizzard. When are the long distance lines gonna be repaired? ?Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today ?. Hello? ? Hello?"Phil, "What would you do if you were stuck in one place ? and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered?" Ralph, "That about sums it up for me."Gus, "Hey, Phil. If we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive."The dinner scene with Rita is a riot when Phil asks her what she is looking for in a man. She describes admirable traits, and Phil says, "Me ? me ? me." She describes some more, and Phil answers, "Me ? me ?. Me." Rita, "He's not afraid to cry in front of me." Phil, "This is a man we're talking about, right?" Rita, "He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers." Phil, "Does he have to use the word, 'poopy?'" Rita, "Oh, and he plays an instrument, and he loves his mother." Phil, "I am really close on this one. Really, really close.""Groundhog Day" is one of the best comedies of all time. It's sure to tickle a funny bone. It is sophisticated comedy that older kids and adults should enjoy immensely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life changing Movie. How to make a new breathe into your life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an excellent movie! - 20 years passed and its still actual and interesting! And this tradition of groundhog day its still going on. - An interesting thing that groundhogs name is the same as the man's name in the main role, and they are both weather forecasters :) - The curious thing is that the main character passes through several stages from the first state when he hates his job, the people that surround him, environment, he hates his life. And people that surround him also feel it, they feel negative energy from him, his egocentric nature. And when every day your life repeats, when nothing changing around you, you lose your desire to live. And then the second state - the main hero tries to satisfy his own desires, having every time in the world. But this didn't work for him. Then the third state he begins to learn new skills, to get new knowledge. It helps, but not satisfy him, nothing changes. And finally he understands that most important thing is to help others, to save more lives, to make more people happier. And from selfish man, that he was at first, he becomes a generous, very kind, and altruistic person. And the moral of this movie is that our life, given to us by God, is not for only satisfying our material needs and selfish desires, but for helping others, saving lives, learning and developing ourselves, making this world better and people in it more happier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Groundhog Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not waste your time w/ boring details of funny and knee slapping events of Groundhog Day. The fact stands that Bill Murray is one of the greatest comedic geniuses of his time. I cannot explain the grace and charm Bill releases into the texture of the movie. It is hard to fathom another actor who audiences have the patience to sit through and watch a man, over and over again, fail miserably at winning the girl's heart. Phil's transformation from a demon to a saint is well accommodated by Bill Murray's physical versatility. He can portray a "glass half empty" character and still be left with grace, or he can bring out a believable kindhearted soul that audiences follow with admiration. It is my opinion that Harold Ramis did not directly create the character, but let Bill Murray manifesting himself into the character of Phil Conners. I know very little about Harold Ramis' creative techniques, but I do know that he is a great man for making the executive decision to place his old friend Bill Murray into this role. I am speaking out of my rear end and this is just my opinion, so if there is any discrepancies do not write a counter comment please. Bottom line: Led by Harold Ramis, Bill Murray needs to team up with Andie Mac Dowell once again and create "Another Groundhog Day".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is one of those movies you wish you could remake. This is not a criticism - it is a complement. The movie is based on such a powerful thematic idea - that of reliving a day over and over again until you get it right - that it deservers to become the kind of classic story, like A Christmas Carol, that is remade periodically every few years to see what a different cast and director can make of it.For instance, the movie is in the comedy/drama/romance genres, but I felt the comedy should have given way a bit more clearly to drama when the emotional turning point is reached; but the point is that I cared enough about the idea to be interested in thinking about improving its execution. I thought about the movie quite a bit, in fact, and that is exceedingly rare for me. I think the theme is good enough for doctoral dissertations and certainly Sunday sermons.And I keep finding myself humming "The Pennsylvania Polka".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you spend your eternity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A philosophical parable, a sarcastic metaphor, or just a sheer superb Hollywood-molded comedy, are the titles marked by different spectators. No body however can deny its greatness, although it did not win any award -even in the Oscar (may be nominated in that year as I remembered).Groundhog Day tells us quite an ordinary story: a cynical weather reporter has to repeat the same day Feb 2 in a little town he hates most, so he becomes a god, becomes immortal and wildered by this eternal and miserable day- and finally a traditional but never cheesy happy-end. What makes this movie far beyond a comedic clich? In my point of view, it is the outstanding theme that uplifts this movie. This hilarious movie has a serious and profound theme which bases on Dostoevsky's query If God had died, could we do anything as we like? or the equivalent, Pascals famous saying Without a God, humans degradation turns meaningless.Fantastically and dramatically, this poor reporter Phil Connors (Bill Murray) acquires a privilege (or a damn) to repeat the same day. That means everything he does in this day will have no consequences. When he wakes up in tomorrow morning, all the things happened in yesterday become a dream. Then he has to live through today repeatedly. Therefore, with this exciting privilege, Phil naturally begins to carry out all the actions he wants to do but dare not to do: to beat an annoying man, to gluttonize desserts without fearing heart diseases, to break laws and rile policemen, to steal money and luxuriously live for one day, to coax a lady into one night stand, to chase his female colleague Rita (Andie McDowell). However, before long, he gradually finds all these mischievous or wicked deeds to be insignificant and temporary, hence a mood of tiredness and despair fills Phils mind so that he decides to end his one-day-life. But, ending this nightmare seems not to be easier than behaving badly. He tries everything. He has been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hanged, electrocuted and burned. Nevertheless, the next day is still the same Groundhog Day.In this endless torment, Phil becomes to understand that under that circumstance, fame, vanity, lust, money, happiness, sorrow, even life all really turn ephemeral- lasting only one day long- except his mind and thought. To make his transient and eternal life more meaningful, Phil resorts to some grand things- doing good deeds to others. Henceforward, he begins to observe all the people in need, and help them out of trouble in the future. He catches a boy falling down off a tree in an exact time, helps two old ladies repair their car, saves an old man from being chocked? He reads all kinds of books and learns to play piano in order to spend his eternity. Time goes on and on, everyday he repeats these routines cordially and tirelessly until the miracle happens- he finally makes Groundhog Day an end with embracing his love around arms. Phil Connors transcends, not only this torment, but also his past. That line he says is quite impressive: Today is tomorrow. Actually, almost every ordinary man has ever complained that he has to repeat routines and live through a watery everyday life, but not every one has ever tried to put his soul on it, and reap the fruit of the fair life. With the envy of Phils fabulous story, I cannot help asking myself: If I happen to have this trial, how will I spend my eternity? Moreover, this movie affirms an assertion of mine: A mediocre comedy makes you laugh and forget the sadness temporarily whereas an excellent one makes you laugh and confront the ruthless reality intrepidly.Feeling tired of my didactic analysis? Do not be scared. In fact, this Groundhog Day can be everything but a stern sermon. Except for the theme, the nearly perfect performance of actors (esp. Bill Murray), the elaborate and thought-provoking lines, the adept film editing of the director, all make this movie almost flawless. The shortcomings, if there are any, lie in? well, I have tried to point out some, but I fail, because none of them is conspicuous and impeachable.In a word, never miss this Groundhog Day; it will not disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Murray in a tour de force performance as the cocky weather man Phil, who gets to learn a thing or two about humility. Phil is initially a rather tragic man, lonesome and unhappy with his life, which shows in his satiric and disrespectful attitude towards people. This is also the case with his work, for instance when he must cover the festivities around the groundhog day in the small town Punxsutawney. But fate has had enough, and an unexpected snow blizzard forces Phil and his camerateam to stay one more night in town. The next day, Phil experiences deja vu: he's stuck in yesterday! From now on, he goes through a series of transformations, ranging from bliss, to megalomania, to utter despair, to resignation, and finally: empathy.Bill Murray's contribution to this movie is immense. His mimic and body language alone is enough to make you laugh, and a wonderful script is the icing on the cake. Groundhog Day is a movie with a lot of heart and a great atmosphere, and it offers many laughs as well. I must have seen it about ten times by now, and I'd rank it as my favorite comedy.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

In the beginning the story seems to be strange, but then you recognize more and more that this movie is pure philosophy, pure wisdom. The director must be an Illuminated or something like this. If you have a bad day, all you have to do, is to think on this movie and things will change. The actors, Bill Murray and Andie Mac Dowell, are absolutely marvelous. The scene, where Bill as Phil tells Andie as Rita how wonderful she is, is indescribable, although I know it only with german synchronsation. Well, you MUST see this movie, there is no way.

		<shortDescription>A simple tale that conceals surprising depth and meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Groundhog Day" is a rare case of audiences actually being ahead of the critics. When this superficially simple tale of a self-obsessed weatherman (Bill Murray) who is forced to relive the same day over and over again was initially released, most critics, even the best, completely missed this movie's subtle and intricate take on the vagaries of life. They followed only its simple premise, slapstick humour and the great, sarcastic shadow of Bill Murray, who, as always, dominates every scene. Audiences, however, immediately took to it. Despite being released (appropriately) in February, the famine period of the movie calendar, "Groundhog Day" went on to gross over $70 million and became a sleeper hit later on video. Soon, the phrase "It's like Groundhog Day" began passing from mouth to mouth as a descriptor for any number of human situations, and Groundhog Day was better recognised as a metaphor than as a holiday. Today, "Groundhog Day" is recognised by the AFI and the Writer's Guild of America. That "Groundhog Day" works on all the levels it does is not necessarily due to conscious action on the part of the writers (Harold Ramis and John Rubin), who focus primarily on delivering a sharp and witty script that fully explores every comic (and later, tragic) outcome of its premise, but because its premise, so utterly simple, is also marvelously applicable to an almost endless array of life experiences. In that sense, it is like a fairy tale or a myth: a universal story that manages to capture something essential in the human experience. For example, there is very little overt religious symbolism in the film, and yet representatives of several entirely different religions have drawn parallels between the story and the tenets of their faith. Buddhists see Murray's character's dilemma as a representation of the cycle of rebirth, while Catholics see it as Purgatory. In truth, as the film itself notes, *everyone* feels trapped in an endlessly repeating cycle of identical days for at least part of their lives, and so is free to read it as applies to them. Beyond this though, it really is quite astounding how perfect this little film is; how annoying characters we wouldn't give the time of day to in the street suddenly become fully fleshed out comic creations, simply because we took the time to see them properly. How every bland suburban street reveals turn-of-the-century architectural gems that our eyes would have passed over on first viewing, and how beautiful the sky can look on a cold February morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you are trapped in one day and cannot escape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange movie because there are some existentialist elements to it, some elements of Carpe Diem, and some elements of the inability of humanity to control his or her environment. I have never seen a movie with this sort of plot before and as such I consider it to be incredibly unique and as such worth watching and considering, if only for a unique plot. Not only is the plot unique, but the main character, Phil (Bill Murry) grows and develops through the film as he tries to come to terms with what is happening to him.Phil is a weather man in a small television station in Pittsburg. He wants something better but all he is doing now is going up to a town which is the home of Groundhog Day, the day when Phil the Groundhog comes out of his home and if he sees his shadow then there will be six more weeks of winter. He hates the town and the day, even though festivities go on all night and all day, all he wants to do is get back to the city and hopefully move up in the world. He cannot get back though as a blizzard has moved in. He returns, goes to sleep and wakes up 6:00 Groundhog Day, and the day repeats itself, and continues to do so. There is no explanation as to why this happens, but one can assume that it is his rather self-serving attitude. He wants to get out of the town, but the town won't let him go.The existentialist element comes up as he is drinking at the bowling alley with some of the town drunks. He says to them, "what would you do if everyday seems to be the same." This is literal where Phil is concerned, but the others see this as life. Groundhog Day is just a break in the monotony of everyday life. Get up, go to work, go home, go to sleep. Nothing changes. When he realises this he basically runs amok. To the guys he is with, this is serious, but Phil is testing the water, and sure enough, when he wakes up the day has started again, and nothing has leaked over from the previous day.At first this is fun, as he takes advantage of all the knowledge that he can accumulate and use against people, but he soon comes to realise how powerless he is where no matter what he does, he just simply cannot get his producer (Addie McDowel) to sleep with him. He knows everything about her, but the way he is, the sleaze, he simply cannot get what he wants from her. The Carpe Diem aspects come along here where he sees that he can seize the day, and he certainly does because he knows everything that happens, and by the end of the film, he can prevent almost all of the disasters from happening (almost all as he is powerless to prevent the death of the town drunk).As he goes through this one day, he soon comes to see how powerless he is. This is seen with his inability to get his producer to bed, and moreso, his inability to die. He tries everything but he always wakes up in the morning. Not only that, he cannot stop an old man from dying. He can save a kid, he can save a man from choking, and he can get a hesitant fiance to marry her fianc, but he cannot stop a man from dying of old age. No matter the advantage of knowing everything about everybody and everything that is going to happen in this one day, he is still human and he is powerless to stop death.This is the most humbling aspect of Phil, for he tries everything, but he always finds that by the end of the day this man is dead. He cannot stop it. He calls himself a god, but he knows that he is really a man.How does he get out of it? Well the movie does not really explain how. You know when, and I will not reveal that, but there is no reason why. There is no reason why it starts and no reason why it ends. What does happen is that he starts off as a slime, and ends as the most loving and caring man that anybody could know. The question is, what happens to him when he wakes up the next day? Now that he is out, how long does it take for him to return to his former self. One can see glimpses of his former self beginning to shine through that next day. One thing about Phil, is that he is only human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This (along with Lost in Translation) is my favorite Bill Murray movie. It has everything needed to make it a classic movie. It has a highly innovative story, excellent acting and something else which cannot be described but you feel it.Bill Murray stars in this film which in essence is a film about a man who relives the same day over and over and over. If you can get past the fact that this is impossible you are in for a hell of a movie treat. As I see it the storyline is perfect for character development and great gags. Without saying too much I can say that the main character, who is the only one who can actually remember the day before, plays on this and seduces women. The writer originally wanted the audience to join the main character as he had already been trapped in this time loop for many years (he doesn't age, how can he when the day before never happened?) and he knows everything about everyone. This approach was thankfully abandoned because watching Bill Murray react to his predicament is nothing short of priceless. He is initially intrigued by the concept and abuses his situation but eventually there is a change in the character. What changes I will leave to future viewers to find out for themselves. The film graces a few philosophical questions but nothing more than that because the objective of the film is entertainment and it succeeds brilliantly in its goals.The cast is stellar. Bill Murray, one of our time's greatest actors both comedy wise and dramatically, does an excellent job. His comic timing is flawless and his underplayed and sometimes quite dark humor works brilliantly on screen. Also he portrays the changes in his character with great skill. Pure movie magic. Andie MacDowell, who in my opinion is a very underrated actress, does a great job as well. She is instantly likable and the audience relates to her character immediately because of this. Her reactions are highly believable and this of course adds to the overall credibility of the film. Chris Elliot gracefully underacts his part which is a good thing because the emphasis is on Murray's character but he serves his purpose to great effect. Stephen Tobolowsky steals every scene he is in and contrary to Chris Elliot he overacts every scene he is in but he stays within the confines of believable so his character too works magnificently and creates a lot of laughs. Other than the actors mentioned the supporting cast is excellent. What few scenes Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill Murray's brother, is in he makes his own.Overall the film's cinematography and sets work pretty well but as the emphasis is on the characters its not really worth mentioning aside from what I've just said. The music is another thing which is very good. The score by George Fenton is excellent and fresh. It doesn't sound like something we've heard before and therefore adds to the originality of the film which is already substantial.The whole concept of the film might sound a bit pretentious but it doesn't feel that way. In fact it feels very down to earth because of the characters' believable reactions and seemingly genuine emotions.All in all an excellent, highly original comedy that is definitely worth a look.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>human transformation so brilliantly and touchingly portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually find a comment which sums up my thinking exactly. Here's the one I found this time: "The most underrated movie ever made?, 22 October 1998 Author: Scoopy from Budapest When people assemble their lists of great film comedies, this never appears on the list. It should. It has absolutely everything a great comedy should have."First, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right."Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation."How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? (or plays Rachmaninoff at the piano: my comment) Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.) "Murray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on. It's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery." Besides Scoopy's apt reference to Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" we mustn't forget the Flying Dutchman legend as well: a sailor's curse keeps him sailing the ocean forever until he finds a woman on land who can redeem him from his curse with her love. Just like in this incredibly wonderful film: great, unique, undervalued; a treasure, a gem of a portrayal of the transformations of the human heart in which seemingly all-knowing triumphant domination and sexual success are followed by frustration and despair and finally redemption through love: still a great moral fable brought up to date for our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching, humanistic, philosophical masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a marvelous and touching movie, a work of philosophy really, and it does what it needs to do to be popular and effective. My comments are not really criticisms of it as an effective movie, and would probably make it a less effective movie, but a more interesting work taken as philosophy. First, it is important and valuable because it teaches that to be a good person, you must be attentive to the feelings going on inside other people, and do what you can to make good people feel better. This is similar to what makes Jane Austen so appealing: the recognition that other people's feelings matter, and that it is a moral good for each of us to recognize that, to do nothing that gratuitously makes people feel worse, and to do things that make people feel better. Second, by confining all the action to the little town, there is a distinct 1950s nostalgic feel to the whole movie. Everyone Phil encounters is a good person, or at least, a not-bad person, even if annoying in parts. The day he lives over and over is in a town full of celebration over a very antiquated event, a very simplified human environment. The movie would have been more interesting had he been in a more troubled, complex, modern environment.Third, Phil's existence is in effect that of a very wealthy man. He has money to buy anything he wants, since he starts over each day with all of his expenses restored. He never has to fear bad health or worry about the future or fulfill any responsibility to anyone else. And he never ages. The one thing he can carry-over from day to day is learning and training. He puts that to use almost immediately, as he learns all about the different people in the town, and learns to anticipate what each person is going to do, or to suffer, at a particular point in the day. Then he figures out that he can learn skills as well as information, so he learns piano, ice sculpture, and who knows what else. The endlessly repeating day becomes an opportunity for Phil to embark on the mother of all self-improvement, self-education programs, completely funded by God or fate. I think that he would grow to appreciate this so much that he would not want real life to "restart." Fourth, I think that Phil's own awareness of his growing knowledge and skills, and comparison with the fact that everyone else in town makes no progress at all, would produce a change in his attitude towards the townspeople, and towards his love-interest. According to several other sources, Phil relives the one day more than 3,652 times (ten years including 2 leap- years). Ten years, every morning he sees the same attractive young woman, and she never changes. In the early period, as he gets to know her, he will grow to love her, but will he really be so lastingly enamored of her that he spends ten years trying to become a person who can evoke her to love him? His dedication to winning her love is a part of the movie-imposed context, similar to the fundamental fact that the day repeats over and over. Somehow, it is just a given that he is driven to win her love, no matter how many days he has to repeat in order to do so. Fifth, the movie's logic is that Phil earns the right to rejoin the normal world only by becoming a person who evokes in the heart of a good woman her sincere love. In the movie, she functions as a sort of proxy for God; if you earn her love, you have earned God's approval to rejoin the human world. This is a beautiful message and a very important one to make, but it raises the question: if she had not been in the town, could Phil ever have escaped? What if his world had not included anyone whose character was so good and sweet, that she or he functioned as a kind of proxy for God's judgment, because her or his feelings towards him were a proper moral judge of his character? And if we apply the lessons of the movie to our own lives -- which is what makes the movie important -- what if there is no person in our lives who is qualified to serve that role? If we live in a world of scoundrels, is there any way in which we can prove our worth? I would like to see a "Groundhog Day" that occurs to a young man in one of our drug-gang-ridden inner cities, or to an associate in a greedy law firm, to examine this problem. Sixth, once Phil rejoins the normal world where each day is different, where we age, where the money we spend does not magically reappear in our pockets the next morning, etc., his ten-year sabbatical will have left him almost incapable of dealing with it. Given his detailed knowledge of everyone in the town, it seems that he would set himself up as the most insightful therapist the town had ever seen, with apparently supernatural insight into every person and issue, and that he would run for mayor, be elected in a landslide, and become a famous author -- like the real "Doctor Phil" of TV and publishing fame. All this success would be founded on the ten-years' education he had obtained, absolutely for free, in the space of just one day. Phil is really a very lucky fellow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu? Didn't you just say that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This romcom is a very original and imaginative piece of work. It is an excruciatingly tense viewing in which Bill Murray is stuck in the same day (Groundhog Day), and is reliving it over and over and over. The performances are good, and the fact Bill manipulates his producer to fall in love with him by acting in a way which would please her, after secretly finding out her preferences and charms from a previous Groundhog Day. Confused yet?If not you should be, the film is very confusing, and after a bit you think the day will never end, it is an astounding culmination of hilarious comedy, touching romance and outstanding acting that hits you with great effect.Its got action, romance, comedy and drama its funny, yet can still be saddening, so many emotions packed into one film make this a classic. Don't read this review, just get the film and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most modern comedies either aren't really funny, are nothing but a funny movie, or three-quarters of the way through, they switch from comedy to solving a problem. Groundhog Day is funny from start to finish, even though we follow the main character through 34 Groundhog Days of personal discovery and growth. When I showed this movie to my then 10 year old daughter, Jessica, she was horrified by it for many years; she didn't see the comedy, she saw the hell of someone who has, as Sartre's play is named in English, "No Exit." Murray's character's inability to accept that he can not keep the old man alive when it's the old man's day to die is a movie moment that always brings tears to my eyes.This movie is one of my 50 favorites, and it's a hard list to make.</fullReview>

But this film also brings up a situation which some may not wish to have. How does one seek to change their ways in a world devoid of such commonalities? Quite a head trip when one really looks deeply into the concept. Murray fully delved into the horrendous nature of self gratification. Once Murray turned into a man who could be a caring an warm individual, his world finally changed. Makes you wish such a predicament could fall on other individuals in need of an attitude adjustment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some answers (maybe)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers follow.Two questions might trouble the curious: (1) Why is Phil trapped in Groundhog Day in the first place, and (2) Why (or how) does he eventually escape? We're never told, and rightly so. The answer to the first question cannot possibly matter, unless perhaps it's part of an answer to the second; but while watching the film for the first time the second question, in the form of "What can Phil do in order to escape?", preoccupied me, and I thought he was on the right track several times: when he kidnapped and killed the groundhog, when he persuaded Rita to stay with him for the crucial hour, when he tried to save the life of the old tramp (who might, for all I knew, have been Father Time).I think there IS an answer, to both questions, and it is this: Phil is trapped on the 2nd of February FOR NO REASON WHATEVER, and consequently there is no reason whatever for his escape. But let me consider the competing theories first.(1) Phil is reliving the same day again and again until he gets it right. If this is so he may very well have to repeat February 3 a few times, too.(2) Phil is trapped in order to become a better person, and so he is released when he has "made up for lost time" and done with Groundhog Day precisely as much as he ought to have done with the previous portion of his life.(3) Phil is reliving the same day until he exhausts all the possibilities, either of the day itself or of the position he is in. This third hypothesis is a good description of what the film itself is doing - which is why it's such a great film. The FILM does what it can to exhaust the possibilities before it ends, and we feel that it has done so. Of course, it hasn't - it can't have - but perhaps Phil, in the many moments when we weren't looking, has.(4) The same cruel demon which imprisoned Phil in a town he loathes on a day he loathes, sets him free just when he has made a permanent peace with the situation.I like all of these theories, and I will not insist upon mine. (If mine is right, though, two things follow which feel right to me: there was no need for Phil to have escaped at all, and the fact that he ends up with the not-particularly-interesting-or-lovable Rita in his arms was pure accident... even if he lives the rest of his life as though it wasn't.) Why is this a great movie? Not because, in the end, it fails to tell us which of the five main competing possibilities is right, but because it so artlessly (and humourously) suggests all five at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully witty and intelligent romantic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Groundhog Day' is one of those films where the efforts of all involved neatly and sweetly comes together to produce a work that is simultaneously funny, romantic, satirical, philosophical, emotionally moving and above all, thoroughly warm hearted and enjoyable.Director and co-writer Harold Ramis teams up with former 'Ghostbusters' co-star Bill Murray to tell the story of misanthropic weatherman Phil Connors who is reluctantly sent to a rural town to report on the local 'Groundhog Day' festival, an event wherein a small rodent is fabled to be capable of forecasting the end of winter. Upon completing the dreaded report and earning a well deserved night's rest, Phil awakes to find it's 'Groundhog Day' again?and again? This begins an intriguing and comedic exploration of the human condition, as we witness the gamut of emotions Phil experiences and the choices he makes each time he relives the same day, again and again. Being the only one to remember the previous day's experience, some of his choices are more self-serving than others, while the range of his emotions includes fear, anxiety, excitement, enjoyment, boredom, frustration, despair, loneliness, warmth and affection ? all while he is developing a yearning to find love and happiness, a deeper meaning to life and ultimately, some form of resolution and peace.Central to Phil's attempts to reconcile himself to his predicament is his relationship with his television station's producer, Rita, affably played by Andie MacDowell. Initially dismissive of her, Phil is nonetheless drawn to her quiet charm and unassuming nature and his attempts to figure out how he feels about her gives rise to a great on screen chemistry between the two actors and numerous opportunities for Murray to display his signature wit and sense of humour as his character develops. Providing additional comedic sustenance are enthusiastic cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and annoying old school buddy Ned (Stephen Tobolowsky), both of whom give great supporting performances.Rubin and Ramis' script is sharp and engaging, often poignant, genuinely funny and romantic and offers a gentle satirical commentary on some of life's everyday circumstances, while never missing an opportunity to demonstrate how we can grow and develop in the midst of the most unlikely of situations.Fully deserving of its 2006 inclusion in the United States National Film Registry of films considered culturally, historically or aesthetically significant, 'Groundhog Day' is an intelligent and entertaining reflection on the meaning of life and the beauty of love, with delightful performances by its two leads and surely contains something for everyone?again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a glorious film that gives a hilarious and sometimes bleak view of what would happen if you had to live one day over and over. It's funny and enjoyable, and while it's greatness is different to, say, Citizen Kane or star Wars, it remains the best temporal displacement comedy (if not movie), and is one of the best romantic comedies. Murray is excellent as Phil, the disenfranchised, broken down, sarcastic weather man who finds himself going over groundhog day eternally. He is perfectly cast, and proves once again why he is one of the best comics who has ever lived. His deadpan face and sarcastic nature are used to full fury, and he is aided by a great supporting cast, including Andie McDowell in one of her not crap roles, and Steven Tobolowsky, who plays the hilariously annoying Ned Ryerson. This is a must see comedy for anyone who loves Murray, time altering or whatever. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie years after it came out, and was blown away.--SPOILER AHEAD-- It hit me that it was in a sense a re-doing of "Beauty and the Beast". In that story, the Beast could not be transformed until he had truly won the love of the girl. Here, Bill Murray could not get out of the endless loop until he won the love of the girl.The movie sort of felt like a fable, as day piled upon endless day. I also thought it did a good job of taking Murray through the various stages: Denial; anger; trying to take advantage of the situation; and finally acceptance and grace in dealing with his situation.IMHO even though this movie is generally well-regarded, I think it is under-appreciated. I think it is a very well-done version of a timeless fable.</fullReview>

MacDowell especially puts in a poor effort due to bad directing. The story does not show enough of the other characters.

		<shortDescription>Interesting as well as entertaining (may contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Dead Poet's Society" referred to a poem called "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time", which is known as a 'carpe deim poem'. Carpe deim is latin for 'sieze the day'. This is a major theme in Groundhog Day. Bill Murray plays, weatherman, Phil Conners - a cynical, bad tempered man who, each year, has to visit Pugsatawny to see if the Groundhog will see his shadow. We watch him go through the day in a 'let's get this over with and get the hell out of here' attitude only to find he's stuck there for the night due to a snow storm. He wakes up the next day to find, to his dismay, that it's Groundhog day all over again. This cycle is repeated endlessly throughout the movie, until he learns to 'sieze the day' and make the most of it. What makes this movie good is that it exploits an interesting theme( look at the bright side and/or make the most of the day ) as well as entertains. When he realizes what's going on and gets used to the idea ( after 2 or 3 times of reliving the same day )he does what many of us would : take advantage of the situation. My favorite is asking several blunt questions about what school an attractive woman he doesn't know went to and who was her teacher and so on and then the next day ( which of course is groundhog day again ) pretending to know her by using the information he got the last time around. After the fun and games, though, he focuses on how to get out of the cycle. He tries to kill himself in several different ways, which doesn't work. It's only when he uses the time in an unselfish/make-the-most-of-the-day manner that the cycle is broken. This is another one of those movies that you can watch over and over again ( ironic, hey? lol ) and still enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprise and a Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having read the reviews, I just wasn't ready for what a delight this film was. I'm normally not a fan of the "smarmy" school of humor that's so popular with the original bunch of Saturday Night Live alums: Chase, Belushi, Murray, et al. The "humor" in their characters all too often consists of them being "cooler" than the rest of the world, and laughing at those less "cool". And if you want to be "cool", too, you'd better laugh with them. It's humor as high school clique. Of the lot of them, I've always found Bill Murray to be the most tolerable; but even he rode the edge of my tolerance.But in this film, that's the point! Murray starts out as EXACTLY the smarmy character who annoys me so much; and because of who he is, he can't quite get his life to work out right. But through a little bit of Twilight Zone logic, he keeps getting chances to do it right. What seems like a curse at first -- repeating the same day over and over -- turns into an opportunity for him to grow as a character and as a human being.At the end, the smarm is still there; but it's turned inward, and becomes more self deprecating. Murray's character no longer views himself as the cool outsider, laughing at all the rubes. Instead, he joins the rubes -- the human race -- and laughs at life and love and himself. This transformation seems very natural, and makes for an irresistible film.</fullReview>

I see each groundhog day as another incarnation - until Phil Connors re-evaluates his existence, not only in helping others, but also in self-improvement, (learn a language, an instrument.) It's only then, that after what could have been an eternity in his "own private hell" that Phil was able to move on to the next level of existence - in this case, February 3rd and a future with Andie.My closed minded coworker insists that I'm reading entirely too much into this movie.

		<fullReview>Before putting electronic pen to electronic paper, I carefully read through all other users' comments which are predominately highly favourable. I too must add my paen of praise.This is one of the funniest and most original of Hollywood films and a tour de force for Bill Murray - the perfect actor for the principal role of the tv weather man.The "Ghostbusters" connection works well with a very humourous and thought provoking script directed by Harold Ramis.The plot and main philosophical sentiments have aleady been adequately aired below, especially by our friend resident in China.All I will add is, "Amor Vincit Omnia".This film will appeal to succeeding generations as the truths and theme of the film are universal and timeless.As I had a sudden urge to see this film one evening, I had to e-mail my son at Bristol University to ascertain its whereabouts in the house (as he is an avid collector of dvds and I am useless at looking for things).I had previously looked at the evening paper on the way home and I could see "nothing on" worth viewing on the multifarious terrestial and digital channels to which we subscribe.Bill Murray's dead-pan humour and sense of the ridiculous really appeals to me, especially the touch of irony that he imbues into his roles.I especially laughed when the cops stopped the car he has been driving with the two deadbeats and casually asks the officer for flapjacks while he is being booked for dangerous driving.Perhaps we can "forgive" the scriptwiters for a predicatable happy ending because we all want to feel good at its conclusion.Music is something I especially pay attention to when viewing films and we have an admirable selection here which enhances the action in the major scenes, from classical - Variations on a theme by Paganini (I also detected Mozart), to contemporary jazz, to "pop", which will appeal to most musical tastes.The mark of a good comedy should be, did it genuinely make you make you laugh? Most certainly It did.For another example of Bill Murray playing the "miserable old git" see "Scrooged", another heartwarming Christmas piece about redemption of the spirit (with aplogies to Charles Dickens).</fullReview>

What a wonderful surprise it was to see a movie I knew would always be one of my all-time favourites.This is a light-hearted movie on the surface with intellectual and emotional depth underneath. One of the best interpretations I've read compares Phil's predicament with Nietzsche's concept of eternal recurrence - try to imagine how you would live your life, every instant of it, if you knew all those instants would recur again and again for eternity, unchanged.This simple (but devastating) idea is explored in a delightful and enjoyable story that will surely be watched again and again in years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies that can also convey sentiment are hard to find. Good ones, that is. This is a very funny movie. I have watched it several times and appreciate something new with each viewing. Basically, it's about a guy named Phil (played by Billy Murray) reliving the same day over and over again. His romantic interest, played by Andie McDowell, represents a brick wall he keeps smashing himself against until figuring out that he has to be happy with himself and what he has instead of what he wants. I usually can't stand "feel good" movies, but this movie is touching. A man nobody likes ends up epitomizing all the things that make a person good. Many people feel like they are living the same day over and over again, and in relating to Phil's self-inflicted plight, they laugh out loud at his frustrations and misery. In truth, many people are living the same day over and over again because, like the main character, they make the same mistakes over and over again. What makes it so interesting is how it exposes the problems-and hilarity of such problems- that a lot of men have. Phil learns to appreciate what IS. He learns that if another person can be "conquered" that they weren't worth conquering to begin with; that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. True happiness comes from within. Blah, blah, blah and so forth. I can't imagine the film with anyone other than Murray. With miraculous insight, he exploits the introspective, narcissistic humor of the story. The two work brilliantly together, exposing an ironic, self deprecating charm before it's over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film always entertains me and leaves me with a good outlook on life which I wish more films could do. Too many things in life and on the news can make you feel that it is all doom and gloom. This film however shows you how life should be and what the truly important things are. Most people, if they got a chance to live a day over and over would do the same things as Phil Connors, trying to make things better for themselves. However, this can just lead to rejection and frustration. Phil eventually realises that life is more rewarding when he gives to others and ends up getting all that he wants.On top of this moral theme, there is brilliant humour. For example, when he is drunk and driving the car with the two deadbeats. After they crash the car and are stopped by the cops, they ask for an order of flapjacks.All actors were well suited for the roles (including Phil - the groundhog). The location and music were also perfect.This film is one you can watch over and over and over....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is built on two things: a great concept and the right actors for the right characters. The whole idea for the movie is superb. To start with it makes you think "what if", but by the end it has you thinking a little bit deeper. I mean, there is no real indication of the duration of the characters stay in limbo - has he lived the same day over for a few days, weeks, months, years or centuries? This is just one question of many, in a film lacking (though not really needing) any answers. Then of course there is the casting of Murray. This, along with his Ghostbusters outings, seems to be the perfect role for the guy. He revels in the sarcastic humorist role, but is totally believable when he softens to the effortless charms of McDowell (who also fits her character like a glove). Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of his career, Murray has epitomized that horrible, simplistic, overdone slapstick type of humor which Americans seem to be obsessed by and those of us in the rest of the world, well, it can make our skin crawl, to be honest. In two great movies, Murray rises above that infantile "finger up yer nose" stuff and really turns in a complex and brilliant performance, one such is "What about Bob?" with Richard Dreyfuss and the other is "Groundhog Day." Unlike such lame, childish crap as "Caddy Shack," this is simply one of the funniest movies ever made and proves that, like Jim Carrey, when Bill plays it "straight," he can really shine. Not only is this one worth seeing, it is worth seeing over and over and over and over........</fullReview>

The story is excellent, the cast is fantastic, the acting is superb, the comedy is right on, this film ROCKS!!!Bill Murray pulls off one of his best performances to date (along side "What About Bob?" and "Ghostbusters"). It's amazing how he's such a b**tard in the beginning of the film, but you still like his character in a weird way, and by the end of the film you really do like the person he has become. Andie MacDowell also pulls off one of her better performances. Throughout the film you really like her character and she's not that hard on the eyes either. Chris Elliot, Brian Doyle-Murray and Stephen Tobolowsky also deserve some credit for their work in this film, they both play their parts quite well. Also, I feel I should mention Harold Ramis, he did a superb job directing this film, he really is an under-appreciated director. Great job Harold!As I mentioned above, the comedy in this film is right on. There are so many scenes that my friends and I love repeating to each other and get us laughing just thinking about them. If you like Bill Murray, then I'm sure you'd like this film. I would definitely recommend this film to just about anyone, it's really a fantastic film. Do yourself a favor and go see this film, I truly hope that you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

He starts doing things which usually would have bad consequences and he starts hitting on his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell).

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray's best film. HILARIOUS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is of the funniest movies ever released or even remotely thought up of by cinema makers. Bill Murray is at his greatest with outstanding lines of sarcastic replies and obvious insults to whoever his victim may be. Harold Ramis wrote and directed this film, as he has so many other fine pieces of film. Ramis also had a small role as a doctor in this film. Andie McDowel had a key role in this movie as the woman Murray's character is in love with. I usually find McDowel's accent and her acting quite annoying, but this is one of her better films. Saturday Night Live's Chris Elliott had a supporting role as "Larry" and he played his part very well. I believed he was better than Andie McDowel in some certain points. There is nothing that is not funny about this very entertaining film. Groundhog Day is about one man's experience through a day of hell that will never end- Groundhog Day. He tries to shoot,electrocute,stap,get run over by a Semi truck, but he always wakes up on one day- Groundhog Day. The "Academy" failed to award an outstanding film the awards it deserved. Groundhog Day is a film that all should experience. Bill Murray will definitely make you laugh. I would highly recommend that you rent this film because it is a highly wonderful piece of entertainment that all will enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuck in the same day over and over again? Then it must be GROUNDHOG DAY.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine what it would be like to repeat the worst day of your life over and over again. This is the dilemma for weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who is stuck in the one day of the year he hates the most, Groundhog Day.Set in a small town called Punxatawny, there is an annual event in which a groundhog 'predicts' wether there will be another six weeks of winter or an early spring. Phil Connors has covered this event for three years and is hoping this will be his last but fate seems to have other ideas. Once the festivities are over Connors, cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) start to make their way back to Pittsburgh when they are suddenly hit by a blizzard that Phil had wrongly predicted would pass over them. With the long distance phone lines down and no way out of Punxatawny, Phil is at his wits end as he wants to leave as soon as he possibly can. When he thinks things couldn't get any worse, they do and Phil wakes up to find that he has woken up on February 2nd, Groundhog Day.Directed by Harold Ramis (Stripes, Caddyshack) Groundhog Day is undoubtedly one of the finest comedies to grace the silver screen. With a screenplay that was co-written by Ramis alongside Danny Rubin, the movie never lets up. At first, Connors thinks that he must be in his own personal hell but soon realises that when he wakes up on the third day he can do whatever he wants without any consequences. Even committing suicide doesn't make any difference. Once he finds out that he can't die he turns his attentions to his producer Rita to try and win over her affections.Each day is met with a new twist and turn and for a movie with a concept such as simple as this then someone with a mind for ideas only need apply. There is always something new going on but it only works if you have some great talent working not only behind the camera but in front of it too and that's where Bill Murray comes in. There is not one moment that is dull or boring when Murray is on screen. Every scene turns to gold when he is on screen and there is an immediate chemistry between him and Andie MacDowell.Ramis has done an absolutely magnificent job in turning such a simple idea into a work of cinematic art. Bill Murray has once again proved he is a comedic talent to be reckoned with and will remain that way for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog day was a breath of fresh air, when I watched it. I've never seen a movie like it. Possibly due to the fact that a plot like this only works once and Groundhog day, to my knowledge, took full advantage of it.The actor playing the main character must be good in order for a movie to have any chance, even with good support cast and director; in this movie, Bill Murray did a sensational job convincing me. His Mannerisms were flawless throughout the movie, as he evolved throughout the day repeating itself over and over.Bill Murray, the plot, the support cast keeps you in to the movie all the way. It's nice to know that the suspence doesn't build as much as more dramatic movies do, rather it starts rather quickly in the movie and just doesn't stop until the conclusion.Who sais a plot has to go with the laws of science? Watch groundhog day, it's a spiritual movie and a very interesting one and that's all the viewer needs. Excellent movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We watch a man forced to learn that his lifetime is much more than one day after another but what do we learn ourselves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Slight spoiler, but it's been out a while...)We read reviews, generally, to learn about a film. We can also learn about the reviewers. This parallels our experience in watching this film. One can see it on a teenage hormone level of guy tries to get (bed) girl or even a deep and probably skewed level of a Woody Allen-like ever-lasting angst that betrays itself by getting a Hollywood ending. This film succeeds in being a mirror to ourselves by opening itself to whatever impression we want get or, moreover, give.One friend dismissed the film as a drawn-out cynical seduction. (Something like: "Sincerity is the most important thing. Once you can fake that you can achieve anything.") Another laughed himself silly and especially liked the scene when the insurance salesman was decked onto the slushy street.The first time I saw it I was somewhat distracted and thought it was rather fun; that's it. The second time I watched it with calm and it was like the first time I saw The Wizard of Oz on a color TV (OK, I'm showing my age) and finally understood the difference between Kansas and Oz.Watch it for yourself. Ask yourself if Phil could wake up on February 3rd even if Rita merely dances with him once. I bet he would have. Better yet, buy the tape and watch it every day until you can gain something worthwhile from it. Now that would be the ultimate circular experience!I couldn't recommend any film more. I don't own many films but this one is a keeper.</fullReview>

Not only is he extremely funny, but its obvious that he goes to great lengths in order to develop his character of Phil Conners (kudos as well to the director for this development). I liked this movie mostly because of the way Murray reacts in different ways to the same events occurring over and over again. Each reaction is always new, always fresh and always entertaining. Rounding out the supporting cast, Andie MacDowell is okay as Murray's love interest, and Chris Elliot has some funny moments in the film as well.</fullReview>

The idea, though it repeats in many sci-fi series is always a refreshing one, when implemented with enough skill, like in this case.If there is someone that has not seen this movie - then GO! Rent it, buy it, go visit a friend that has it. It really is a good movie. Though some might consider it a bit too sugarry at times. But I like it.And in the end I'd like to insert my favourite quote from the movie. For me it represents the beautiful side of the movie."What I wanted to say was......I think you are the kindest......sweetest, prettiest person......I've ever met in my life.I've never seen anyone......that's nicer to people than you are.And the first time I saw you......something happened to me. I never told you......but I knew I wanted to hold you......as hard as I could.I don't deserve someone like you. But if I ever could......I swear I would love you......for the rest of my life."This is what Phil said to Rita during one of the (better) days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eureka! I can finally declare to the world my enthusiasm for "Groundhog Day." Besides providing Bill Murray the best venue yet for his comedic genius, it gives him a role that resonates with the spiritual angst of his character in "The Razor's Edge." Both roles reflect Buddhist themes. "Groundhog Day" strikes equally deep chords whether one sees Phil's revved up life journey as toiling toward Christian redemption or Buddhist enlightenment. I love that Phil has to give up wanting the object of his desire (the girl) in order to get it. He has to plunge to the depths of despair and accept that there is no escape from the cycle of life and death except through surrender. Yet it is also true that he learns the rewards of unselfish behavior. Finally, joy and love are his after pursuing activities in which he develops his full potential -- jazz and classical piano, ice sculpting, speaking and reading French, to name a few. In the end he is loved and lovable because he does not seek love in his own self-interest.There are many sub-themes on Phil's way to enlightenment. One of my favorite scenes is when Phil philosophizes with two drunks while driving along railroad tracks toward an oncoming train: "What if there were no tomorrow? That means there'd be no consequences! Your whole life it's the same, 'Clean up your room. Be nice to your sister. Don't mix beer and wine. Don't drive on the railroad tracks.'" (One of the drunks says, "Hey, I happen to agree with that one!") Phil goes on, "Sometimes you just have to take things in your own hands. I'm not going to live by their rules any more. You make your choices and you live with them." Then, he dies one of his many deaths and wakes up again the next day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a Wonderful Life" for a cynical generation....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the most under-rated comedy of all time. If George Bailey represents the everyman for the generation that lived through WWII, Phil Connors is his self-absorbed, loud-mouthed offspring. Vain and self-important, he represents a generation who excuse rudeness as refreshing honesty and see their time as being too precious to be wasted as they race from one meaningless experience to another. And just as George Bailey learns his value to the world by losing his place in time, Phil Connors learns his complete lack of importance by being given too much time, literally. By reliving the same day over and over, Connors has the opportunity to see how worthless his time, and his life, really is. Everyone in this movie is perfect. Bill Murray is utterly fantastic. Even Andie MacDowell, never a particularly talented actress, is good. Harold Ramis's direction never rushes the story, but allows it to unfold gradually to an ending that is truly satisfying. So good for so many reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bill Murray Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilarious! A classic for the Bill Murray fan. Andie MacDowell is subtly sexy as always. What I appreciate most about this unique film is that it realistically addresses a question all of us have asked ourselves before..."What would I have done differently if I could do it again?" (I wouldn't have raised my voice at my senior prom date--a stunningly attractive girl--because she didn't wait until I opened the car door for her. We didn't know each other well to begin with and it ruined the evening.) We see through Murray the transformation of a man from self-centered to sharing, cold-hearted to caring, as he re-lives the same day over and over and over again. My favorite scene involved a dinner date with Murray's film love interest, Andie MacDowell. As they dine across from one another, discussing their interests, hopes and dreams, Andie highlights her love for European classics (or something similarly mundane). Murray's character, in classic alpha-male form, bursts out laughing like "that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life." Andie is visibly hurt. Cut to the next scene--same dinner, same conversation. Andie--"I love European classics." Murray - meditating on the profundity of Andie's statement, quotes a poem from that period...in French! Andie--"I didn't know you had such an appreciation for those works." Murray--"Oui" (French for yes) Score 10 pts. for Murray in Andie's book. For one day, we get to see someone live a regret-free, no holds barred, do want you want to, anything goes day. Yesterday's mistake becomes today's victory! I (obviously) haven't seen the film in awhile, but I recall little profanity and no nudity or violence, making it (somewhat) kid appropriate. One of my favorite comedies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now in 2001 I've just seen Groundhog day for the very first time, on DVD. What a refreshing film. It's very funny in it's repetition and utterly true in it's movements.Perhaps what I enjoyed the most about it was the evolution of Phil (Bill Murray) and the realism of his actions. His responses were predictable on a level. I don't mean that as a criticism but as a positive element. While I didn't always know what was coming next, I certainly understood on an emotional level. Who wouldn't, after realizing they were living the same day over and over, abuse the power of it. Run from the cops, rob a Brinks truck. But as we progressed, we understood why Phil moved from abuse to improvement. A quality film. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, full of heart, but lacks the ending you need.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other comments on this film are, collectively, pretty accurate, I think. Murray plays the role of the witty cynic, who lives the same boring day repeatedly, with charm and a credible mix of belief and disbelief. He was the perfect choice for a part that was probably harder to play than he makes it look. The writing is as good as the acting (almost; see below), moving quickly past the phase where Murray's character comes to terms with what's happening to him (a smart move, since the viewer already knows, and would be bored if it took long on the screen), and on to exploring the various things we might all think of eventually, if caught in the same sort of Twilight-Zonish phenomenon. The results of the "hero's" efforts to cope with his problem are satisfying, as is his personal evolution, brought on by the experience of trying. Only the end, which satisfies the heart, but not the brain, fails to equal the rest of the movie. You never really learn why or how this extraordinary occurrence came to be. The film is a fable, or fairy-tale, yet its events are so logically presented, and Murray's ways of dealing with and, finally, gaining by them so grounded in reason that the absence of any explanation leaves a hole in the story and, ultimately, your experience in seeing the film. This would be a four-star movie, if only they'd filled that gap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only one word can resume what this film is: Perfection. This instant comedy classic is a fable about making things go right. Murray plays a weather reporter who wakes up on the same day in a boring town over and over. When the situation becomes a chance the film moves from straight comedy to romantic comedy without a problem. A totally round story, an sensible direction and a nice casting with a fabulous Bill Murray playing his character with a touch of cinisism that never lets the film become corny, and one of the best screenplay that I've ever seen, are the ingredients that makes this film a jewel. "Run Lola Run", the Germanic flick is exactly about the same topic, see both films.</fullReview>

Groundhog Day from 1993 is a fantastic fantasy romantic comedy from Harold Ramis.The plot is very interesting and it keeps you interested till the end of the movie.Even though there are the same scenes shown many times.The actors do great work.Bill Murray handles his job very well.The man is great at comedy and in this movie he really shines.There are many hilarious scenes in this movie.Scenes that make you laugh at loud.And there's also a deeper message in the movie.It shows that anybody can become a better human being.We just have to want that ourself.So watch Groundhog Day and learn something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a magnificent movie.I rented it when it first came out and immediately I was hooked. I watched it alone later with a friend and once again alone before returning it.I could write an enormous review about this movie, but I'll keep it short since most of it has been said already anyway.This movie always makes me feel good. One of the most important messages I see is that you should live everyday as if it where your last. It sounds corny I know but bare with me. The character may repeat the same day over and over, but the fact remains that everything he accomplishes, he does so in a single day. In a single day he manages to save lives and make himself loved by everyone. At the end of the movie I am left with a warm feeling. If Phil who started out as a hated and lonely man could turn his live around in (essentially) a single day, then image what I could do.....This makes Groundhog day one my favorite movies ever. To illustrate; since I rented it that first time, I must have seen it 28+ times. I have it on tape myself, and every time it is shown on TV I just can not resist.If you haven't seen this movie..

		<fullReview>Warnig Spoliers. A true gem of a movie, that I was very pleased with after the first viewing and has never disappointed since. The concept of the film, reliving the same day again and again, is a solid one and the filmmakers make the most of it. Director/writer Harold Ramis and co-writer Danny Rubin take the story of a curmudgeonly weather forecaster trapped perpetually in the same day from a cleverly set up beginning to a fitting terminus. They intertwine the repetitions of the eternal day with the vicissitudes of our reluctant subject and produce a work that is both smart and filled with jeu d' esprit. Add the comic genius of Bill Murray and the strong support of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot and you have a notable comedy. Of course I must admit that the very idea of reliving a day is a reoccurring fantasy of mine, as I'm sure it is with many. The old wish, `if I could just go back and redo that' is in essence I guess a way to deal with regret and reconsideration of moments passed. That is why films such as this and `Family Man' and `Disney's The Kid' have such an appeal. The difference between those films and this one is that I could not find any room for improvement here. A rare strong Hollywood work that is truly sui generis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not just a comedy gives you a dry laugh. I believe this is a comedy with good philosophy content. In a sense most of us are repeating our lives over and over again. Get out form the bed, go to work, go lunch at some deli, go home at 5?K Everyday is the same day like yesterday, nothing exciting happens. However, the important thing is how are we going to live today, the one just like every other day? The film used the groundhog festival wisely as a moral. Like Phil the groundhog, you can look at your own shadow in cold winter but do nothing, or you can use today to make a difference, open yourself to welcome a coming new Spring. Watch again the movie, you will find the message within this awesome film.Lynx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Deja Vu---all over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever had a bad day--a REALLY bad day--and replayed all of the horrible things that went wrong in your mind, wondering what you could have done differently to make things turn out better? This is the dilemma facing Pittsburgh's Channel 9 weatherman Phil Connors as he journeys to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the seventh year in a row to cover the annual ritual to see if his namesake, Punxsutawney Phil, the town's resident groundhog will emerge to see his shadow, thus consigning us to six more weeks of winter before the arrival of spring.Bill Murray is Phil Connors, and things have not been going too well for him. Life's experiences have made him cynical, arrogant, self-serving, and just plain hard to get along with. His producer, Rita (played charmingly by Andie MacDowell) and Channel 9 cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott), who accompany Phil to Punxsutawney, can barely tolerate him. His life has sunk so low, the only way to go is up--and the road to redemption takes a strange turn.Forced to remain in Punxsutawney when the Channel 9 crew is trapped by a sudden snowstorm, Phil Connors awakens the next morning to the realization it is groundhog day--again. All of the events of the previous day play themselves out all over again--but Phil is the only one who is aware the day is repeating itself.Thinking it is all a bad dream, Phil Connors returns to his bed-and-breakfast, only to awaken the next morning to find--it is groundhog day all over again. Now in a panic, he realizes he is stuck in some kind of a time warp and turns to Rita for help. Naturally, she does not understand what he is talking about and thinks he is going crazy.The next morning, guess what? It is groundhog day again. And again the next morning. And the next. It seems Phil Connors is doomed to relive the same day over and over again forever. At first, he tries to end it all by committing suicide, but the next morning, he wakes up in his bed again. After all, it is groundhog day again and yesterday never really happened.After awhile, Phil begins to realize he has the power to change the circumstances of the day, since he already knows in advance what is going to happen. He begins to fall for Rita and attempts to develop a relationship with her. At some point, though, she rebuffs him. He then is able to figure out what he did wrong and the next day makes an adjustment which moves him closer to his goal.At first, true to his character, Phil has ulterior motives. However, somewhere along the way, he figures out that the way he responds to people affects the quality of his own life. His redemption is complete. He wins Rita. He becomes the most popular person in Punxsutawney and when he wakes up the next morning, groundhog day is past and his life can move on.There is a real lesson for us all here. We can improve the quality of our lives, not by our circumstances, but by how we respond to them. We, too, have the power to change our lives just by changing our attitudes. GROUNDHOG DAY is a parable of the redemption of a lost human spirit, in the tradition of A CHRISTMAS CAROL and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. It is an up-to-date adaptation of this theme, some element of which everyone can identify with. Murray and McDowell make a terrific team. A look at this film always improves my outlook on life, no matter the circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is amazing. Not only has Harold Ramis used wit and intelligence in a hilarious comedy as he did in Ghostbusters, but he has delivered a feel-good masterpiece that makes one think twice about the direction of their lives. This film had much more than a story to tell, (although it's appearance of The Twilight Zone gone comedy is breathtaking) but it actually enlightens the audience to a whole new world of possibilities within their lives. Bill Murray is at his best as a cruel and cynnical but witty Pittsburg weatherman named Phil Connors. After going to the small but lively town of Punxatawney to report the groundhog festival, he learns that he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again.... until he gets it right. The antics Phil goes about are wonderfully imaginative, sparking the question in everyone's mind: What would you do if there were no tomorrow? When the film gets a bit more serious, Phil decides to impress the woman he secretly loves (Andie McDowell). Unfortunately, every day she wakes up without any memory of yesterday. Phil is the only one who this happens to.The interesting aspect of this film, as stated in a prior review, is the unmentioned amount of days Phil repeats. After close analysis I found it to be about twenty years. His learning different talents, such as piano and multiple languages, implies a span of many years. Not to mention that a simple game he learned, throwing cards in a hat, took him months to learn. Imagine all the games he learned besides that. "Is this what you do with eternity?" McDowell asks.</fullReview>

Groundhog day is not only interesting, it is wonderful.This is a brilliant comedy with a terrific cast. Bill Murray is naturally funny and Andie McDowell is naturally beautiful. The repetitive nature of this movie, actually works in a way that gives you an opportunity to see it over and over again, without catching everything in 1 particular viewing. As a result, this movie gets better every time you watch it, simply because we get to do what the main character does, we get a chance to get it right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes Groundhog Day special is that it is not only philosophically deeper than most movies, but also socially relevant. How many people in this world have often felt like they're living the same day over and over again? So many that Groundhog Day has now become a synonym for a monotonous lifestyle. People can often be heard saying, "I feel like I'm in Groundhog Day." How many movies have inspired a new expression in the English language? Not many.While Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey finds out what life would be like had he never existed, Bill Murray's Phil Connors finds out what it's like to exist without consequences, to live like there's no tomorrow. I have often seen similarities between Stewart and Murray, and would say they are parallels of two different generations. Both are actors that are likeable enough to carry any movie. And Groundhog Day is Murray's best movie (so far).I won't say much more about the movie because it's rich enough with meaning that it could be interpreted in many other ways. In fact, it's nearly impossible to cover everything that I got out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done Phil!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phil Connors,a sarcastic weather man disappointed from his boring life the 2nd of February of every year goes to a lost little city in Pennsilvanya to shoot a reportage about an old local tradition "The Groundhog day",where a nice big rat,like Phil calls it,seems able to preview the last of the winter and the came of the spring..but this time something of really strange happens,Phil ,for a joke of the destiny (or who knows what else..)is obliged to live the same day for hundred of times ,so every day ,for his desperation,he's woke up at 6:00 am by the same song at the radio and meets always the same people who obviously don't realize what is going on and can't understand his drama. I think this one the best comedy of the 90s not only for the Brilliant performance of Bill Murray (absolutely perfect in this role)but in particular for the deeper meaning of the story. In fact Phil's life is a disaster he's selfish,presumptuous, cinic and only when he changes his nature,stopping to use this absurd situation for his goals ,things will be better for him and the 2nd of February finally will be the 3rd!.So knowing perfectly the things of the day he's forced to live ever he starts helping people : save a child who's falling form a tree,save a man hit by an heart attack and so on in this way he also conquest the woman of his dreams (Andy McDowell).So this film is a metaphor.Each of us after all live always the same day (wake at the same time,make the same job,see the same people)without realizing it,maybe we should make like Phil and try to change ,even just a bit,to be better person and to feel better ,is it so difficult ?..</fullReview>

I had heard from certain people that it was good, and from some people that it wasn't so great...I don't have a clue what they were on about, because this is a very intelligent, well-thought out movie with a storyline that breaks all boundaries.Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot's acting in this film are spotless, wonderful, and the story is eerie, intriguing and very original indeed! No matter how many times you watch it, you are guaranteed to laugh over and over again, as you follow the development of Bill Murray's character, and how he hopelessly deals with his somewhat strange situation!I totally recommend this film for anyone who hasn't seen it, and for those who have seen it, go watch it again!F-A-B!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is definitely a film which grows on you. Murray plays the same character he always plays, the frustrated and sarcastic cynic who comes to realize that life does have a meaning after all. He comes to love the town he hates, and the people in it. Especially of note are the scenes with the bum, which is really where his 'redemption' begins. Murray plays off the other cast members very well, with most of them there as straight men (&amp; women) to his situation. But what really sells me is the continuity; The same people are in EXACTLY the same places at EXACTLY the same times, every time. Of course, his relationship with McDowell is great as well. Well worth watching twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Bill Murray Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would you do if you could live the same day over and over again? Bill Murray as Phil Connors had to find this out in one of my favorite comedies of all time. "Groundhog Day" could have been severely repetitive based on being forced to live a day over and over until Connors gets it right. The film goes from Murray's change from a cynical, self-centered weatherman to a suicidal depressive to someone who makes life better for everyone else, including himself. It's often hilarious, many times heartfelt and sad, touching and ultimately rewarding. You watch Bill Murray's character go from lust to love over Andie McDowell, and his evolution to not only make himself better for her, but overall.I've seen this film countless times, and it still gets me how thoughtful and well-written this film is. It's full of great dialogue and some clever sight gags and humor. It's never too silly or too sappy.Movies like this are rare and not usually pulled off this well that have such a unique premise. Bill Murray proves that while he's still among one of the funniest people around, he can also pull off a convincing romantic lead. Definitely worth seeing for those who like comedy/romance films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other viewers said it's a really funny movie well I dissagree with them it wasn't that funny but it is a great movie too watch. Bill Murray did some great acting trying first too make everything perfect, that alone took him several years, too win Rita's heart and get her into bed. That didn't work and he gave up for a while then Rita said something that was the turning point. The character went from rude and cyincal too caring and nice.What made him relive the day over and over again? In my opinion it could be several things. 1 being the blizzard 2 the ground hog 3 other viewers mentioned this first learning too love himself before he could love another and win their love in return, what makes me think of Beauty of the Beast.</fullReview>

The timewarp is both hilarious and meaningful, with no explanation but the one you find for yourself, perhaps like life. The town of Punxsatawny is a living society in this film and the more one watches it, the more small details of the community you begin to see. There are so many recurring characters and small details to pick up on. The range of emotions and eventual redemption of Phil is a compelling study of humanity and the way we exist in our modern society. Never enough time to do what we really want. These messages are wrapped up in hilarious incidents, but Phil's suicide phase and the deaths of the old man reveal that this film is easily something deeper than a romcom.</fullReview>

Phil Connorsis a snobby TV weatherman who is convinced he "creates" theweather! So he and his crew, Rita and Larry (wonderfully playedby Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot) journey to Punxatawney, PAto broadcast the annual event that Punxatawney Phil, thegroundhog sees his shadow, which he did. After a harrowingblizzard strikes the town, Phil and his crew are stuck in littleberg. Phil wakes up the next day.... and realizes in horror thatGroundhog Day is happening again!! The same things and the samestorm occurs in front of Phil's astonished eyes. The next daysfollow, and the holiday is again replaying in his mind. Philthinks he's lost it, and tries to commit suicide. But thatdoesn't work because he wakes up in the same inn bed without ascratch! So Phil decides to hide away his egotistical feelings,falls in love with Rita, and everything isn't as bad as itseemed to him anymore. "Groundhog Day" is a satisfyingly funnyfilm with excellent performances by Murray (who seems born toplay guys with giant egos!) and McDowell. This is a perfect filmto watch on Valentine's Day, and maybe, if you have the nerve,you can watch it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always liked Bill Murray, especially as the egotistical-but-lovable guy he plays in just about everything he's ever done (but most notably, in Meatballs, Stripes and Ghostbusters). But he takes it to a higher level in Harold Ramis' "Groundhog Day," owing to a fantastic script which perfectly executes the story's clever premise, and makes perfect use of the Lovable Jerk persona as a springboard for a real character-driven story. I can't imagine the movie being done with another actor in the lead role, and that is, I think, one of the more remarkable things about it. Everything, including the casting, fits together so well.The premise of living out the same day over and over again is a very "high" concept, but ironically, the story works because the characters are so believable. Not many comedies would have its hero try to commit suicide over and over again, only to wake up alive, saying, "Ah, nuts."Even the usually unbearably bland Andie Macdowell is a three-dimensional, charming and believable foil/love interest. I credit Ramis and Murray for bringing out the best in her. While I'm being superlative, let me go on record to say that the film's big comic payoff, when Phil tries to get Rita (Macdowell) into bed through what must be months of conversational scheming, is one of the funniest 15 minutes in film history.I would call this the most underrated comedy of the 90's, if it wasn't on TV so damn much. But I watch it every time it is, and I still marvel at how close it is to perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant comedy/morality tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I will admit by bias. I think Bill Murray is a comic genius, which is on display in full force in this comic tour de force.Bill Murray plays a disgruntled meteorologist who works for a small-market TV station. He is embarrassed that he still has to do gigs like the local groundhog festival in a smalltown. As it happens, the last place that Murray wants to be is the place where he must remain. He wakes up the morning after to discover that he is reliving the previous day. With each passing day (the same day that is), Murray realizes that there are no rules for him because each day he is given a second chance. No rules means no consequences. He attempts to woo the luminous Andie MacDowell(in her best role), but after repeated failures, he starts killing himself off. This is the darkly comic part of the movie, especially the kidnapping of Phil the groundhog.I will not spoil the ending, but suffice it to say, it is not disappointing. Murray realizes the meaning of life is not about self; it's about selflessness. Point being: we live dead-end lives when we live them in selfishness. We can only escape when we learn to be compassionate, and we can't be loved until we learn to love others ourselves.This is more than mindless entertainment to me. It is truly an uplifting story, not to mention the fact that it is one of the most romantic movies I've seen. Without a doubt, Bill Murray is one of our best and most under-appreciated actors. Watch "Rushmore" if you think I am mistaken. "Groundhog Day" is one for the keeping and cherishing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film comedy of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not only the greatest comedy of all time but one of the best films ever, in any genre. What makes it so great, besides a stellar performance by Bill Murray (which is, hands down, his best screen work to date) is how perfectly the script has been worked out, down to the tiniest little details. The premise is a solid one - a man is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he learns how to become a better, less self-centered person. But it could have failed on so many levels: the built-in repetition factor could easily have sunk the film, and a very real danger existed that the situation would simply become as boring and infuriating to the audience as it is to the main character. The filmmakers - director Harold Ramis and his co-writer Danny Rubin, who came up with the original story - find several ingenious ways to ring changes upon the premise, and do a totally convincing job in mapping out the growth and development of the main character. That character is a cruel and shallow Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors who is disgusted to find himself once again in Punxsatawney Pennsylvania to cover the dreaded (to him) groundhog day festival. By being forced to live the day again and again, amongst people he despises, he will have to come to terms with his own shallowness and lack of human connection. The film, then, is his quest for personal redemption and deliverance. If that sounds heavy to you, well . . . it is, sort of. While the film is clearly a comedy (and is very very funny), it does not hesitate to display the horror and desperation of Phil's predicament. By the end, you FEEL for him, and have come to know him, in a way that just would not be possible if his situation was played only for laughs. If ever a movie wrung every last drop of greatness and potential out of its central premise, it is this one. If nothing else, the script should have been up for an Academy Award; it is - hands down - the best comedy script of the 90s.Of course, probably the biggest concern is that the audience will enjoy Phil being a crumb much more than they will watching him become a nice guy, which would pretty much undercut the central theme of the movie. This is where Bill Murray's amazing performance comes in to play, since he's equally entertaining as a good-hearted and reformed man as he is as a jaded cynic. This is no mean accomplishment, and it's absolutely essential for the movie's success: if he came across as too nice, then we wouldn't buy the character's initial misanthropy, making the "transformation" a foregone conclusion; equally, if his change into a happier, more well-adjusted person wasn't funny and enjoyable in its own right, then we'd walk away thinking "The movie had a great first hour - then it got boring as he started to change." Either eventuality would have absolutely killed this picture.Fortunately, Murray - perhaps unique among screen comics - has always been equally adept at working either side of the sweet / sour divide. He can just as easily be lovable as despicable, and get laughs doing both. I can't really think of any other comic actor who can do this (Robin Williams is always relentlessly cheery; Steve Martin is funniest when he's angriest; Jim Carrey couldn't get laughs by being sweet and sincere if his life depended on it, etc.). Therefore, the movie is unthinkable without him. But it is also an absolute gift to him - no other film he has ever done has allowed him to show this much range as an actor while still letting him play to his strengths. Anyone who witnessed him trying to go dramatic in The Razor's Edge, or to bring off a similar grump-turns-into-a-nice-guy premise in the atrocious Scrooged will know exactly what I mean.To sum up, this is one of the best films ever, and belongs on that short list of works that are truly uplifting and heartwarming - but which EARN it. As "transformation" movies go, it's right up there with the seasonal classics of Scrooge, the Grinch and George Bailey in "It's A Wonderful Life" - all without the benefit of the Christmas season for its backdrop. In fact, one of the best things about Groundhog Day is that it might actually start a new trend - showing this film every year on TV in the wastes of February would be a good idea, when we could all really use a good cheering up!</fullReview>

Its an interesting premise for a film, Bill Murray as a obnoxious weatherman is trapped in a day he cant escape - no matter what he does every morning he wakes and its Groundhog day again. There's no explanation of how this happened to him (good!!) but its great watching him deal with it. His main challenge is to make Andi Mcdowell love him and his attempts are wonderfully funny. If you haven't seen it, watch it now, if you have watch it again. See it for the laughs, for Andi Mcdowell's beauty, for the performance of a great cast (Bill Murray is truly superb), see it to make life feel a little bit better.</fullReview>

Classic. Well cast and directed, this is a film that any movie lover should own. It's arguably Murray's best performance (you can literally spit off ten or 12 great Murray lines right off the top of your head). It's one of those films that you watch, forget you're watching it and when it's over, you wish it was longer. If you haven't seen Groundhog Day, run, don't walk, and buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is there not an Academy Award for comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to baffle me why there is no Award for good comedies. Good comedy is harder to write and perform than almost any other genre and yet great films like Groundhog Day are constantly ignored when the Academy issues it's nominees. It seems that to win, or even be nominated all you have to do is set your drama in the late part of the last century. Among Groundhog Day's 1993 contemporaries are the Piano, Remains of the Day, Schindler's List and Philadelphia. Worthy films all and while there may not be a dry eye in the house for any of them, there surely aren't too many laughs either! Don't get me wrong, you won't guffaw your way through this film in the way you might at say, the Naked Gun films or South Park but it is an excellently scripted and crafted piece by Harold Ramis (famed as Egon in Ghostbusters). Ramis and Murray do appear to have an exceptional working chemistry having also collaborated on the under-rated Stripes waaaay back in the 80s. That chemistry is obvious here as Bill Murray puts in what was at that point arguably his best performance. I'm not an Andie MacDowell fan by any stretch of the imagination but she is well cast here as the prissy producer to Murray's cynical Weatherman. Also of note is Chris Elliot who you may recognise as Woogie from "There's something about Mary". Elliot carries off the part of long suffering and desperate cameraman Larry with some aplomb and I find it a shame that he does not do more work in the film industry, if only so he'd stop doing those awful Baked Tostito's ads!While it certainly didn't deserve to win the 1994 Best Picture Oscar, it could certainly have merited a nomination. Groundhog Day is though very deserving of it's top 250 position on IMDB, although it could justify being a little higher in my opinion. It is over sentimental in parts but that could just be the cynical Brit coming out in me :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Groundhog Day....again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Groundhog Day" is loosely patterned after Dicken's "A Christmas Carol", with the Groundhog as the ghost of Groundhog day present. Bill Murray is much more successful in this movie than he was in "Scrooged", which was also a Dicken's spin-off. It's nice to see Mr. Bill do something thoughtful for a change... Of course, the real brains behind this movie is Harold Ramis, who wrote, produced, and directed "Groundhog Day". Ramis doesn't write a lot of movie scripts (just thirteen), but he has cranked out some of the most original comedies in the past twenty years, including "Animal House" and "Ghostbusters" (which also starred Bill Murray). "Groundhog Day" is up there with his best...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well as I sit here in Akron,Ohio I am reminded of the greatest movie ever made; GROUNDHOG DAY, I know I may have said this previously at many occasions, but it rocks ! So ever since we saw it for the Nth time at Peel, it stays on my mind all the time, it's insane, I got a lot out of it. after all this time and so many viewings ! I really got a different vibe from it this time, of course it was funny again and I laughed again, but it stroke a different psychological effect. Or moral I should say, even philosophical I would dare to say. or simply said - a good life lesson. First, let me say that I was surprised this time at just how good of an actor Bill Murray is in this movie, in my opinion THE best ever, but that's just a side track, what really hit me this time is funny 'cos it's almost as if I finally understood the movie, I saw it as a one piece, as opposed to how I use to see the movie as a 3 or 4 different parts. Now I comprehended the evolution of Phil like never before, the whole thing about how he grew up as a man (and therefore got the girl- though that's not even the most important part) when he begins to care for others. It's more than just taking care of himself by learning the piano or sculpting, he really gets to grow and improve as a human being when he begins to care for others, all others, needle head Ned included. Even the girl (Andy McD.) doesn't care for needle head Ned, but Phil does, he buys all the insurance from him. The old ladies, the old man and even Larry (pastry Larry). It reminds me of this coworker I have who is hated by everybody, and whenever I am nice to her it makes me feel better than usual because to care for her is more difficult than to care for a nice person. I could go on for pages, maybe I will but not today. So to be truly a groundhog man you have to be good towards everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In addition to all the praise that this movie has received from the other reviewers, I would like to point out that the philosophy of this movie runs pretty deep if you look at it carefully.Is it just me, or does the Bill Murray's predicament in the movie seem to a metaphor for the whole Buddhist belief about reincarnation and breaking out of that never-ending cycle by letting go of desire and achieving Nirvana? Bill Murray is forced to relive the same day and he only moves on when he discovers the compassionate side of himself and stops being selfish. And, it took many many lifetimes for to do it, just as Buddhists believe we come back many many lifetimes.Just my observation.Regardless of at what level you choose to view this movie, it's a must see.</fullReview>

You can watch this movie as a good-humoured comedy turning around the crazy idea of the same day repeating over and over and have all the fun you can ask for. The cast is great, with Bill Murray going through all the highs and lows coming with his situation, Andie McDowell at her loveliest and Chris Elliott delivering great one-liners. When you start thinking it over, it occurs to you that the script touches on the last questions of human existence. It's not easy to postpone the question about life's sense, when there is no more tomorrow to postpone it until. Watching the flick, you might not immediately notice the plot's depth, just as it takes Bill Murray's character some time to realize the time-loop he's caught in. But once it gets to you, it won't let go of you.</fullReview>

Phil Connnors teaches us that acts of altruism must be performed for the sake of altruism -- not for any material or personal gain. Kindness, self-improvement, sincerity... these are rewards in and of themselves. Murray's comic wit and deadpan face imparts this message with more warmth than any actor has before or since.When you forget what it means to be selfless, Groundhog Day should be the movie in your VCR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely underrated !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film had been made four decades ago it would not have surprised me to see Frank Capra's name attached to it. This is ironic as one of his most celebrated movies, It's a Wonderful Life was also hugely underrated in its day and in fact was slated by some critics. The difference between these films is that Harold Ramis is not held in the same esteem as Frank Capra, at least not at present. In order for that to happen Harold will need to make a film of the same acclaim as 'Mr Smith goes to Washington'. Things could easily change.Meanwhile 'Groundhog Day is an impressive use of imagination (whilst not perfect) and is one of those 'what if...' wonderfully quirky movies that you find yourselves talking and debating far more than even the most profoundly philosophical of deep thought provoking epics. Pure escapist fun and for once that does not mean some sci fi big budget action blaster.Then there are the performances mostly good solid ones with a glorious subtle piece of acting from Murray, probably his best to date.I could go on but I do not wish to hype it too much for those who have not seen it. I will admit one shameful thing....I gave it 10/10 in order to raise it in the top 250. My true vote would be 9.5 out of 10 !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this 'what-if' comedy surpasses all expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This surpasses all the expectations one would have for the kind of movie that it appears to be: a whimsical comedy based on a 'what if?' premise, in which some fundamental assumption about the universe around us is altered, to amusing effect. Films in this particular sub-genre (does it have a name? I think of these as 'Twilight Zone' comedies) have a certain appeal for me, but most supply a few laughs, not much more. I usually come away from them with a sense of an opportunity missed, due to sloppy execution or lack of imagination. The screenplay of "Groundhog Day" is outstanding, in that its creators evidently gave much thought to answering the question: if a person found himself inescapably, eternally repeating the same day in his life, just what _would_ he do? The execution of this 'thought experiment' is so thorough that it passes beyond hilarity, beyond cleverness -- though the film has both qualities in abundance -- to reach a level of psychological, even spiritual profundity that puts Groundhog Day in league with the very best examples of its type, "It's a Wonderful Life" and "A Christmas Carol". All this from a Bill Murray comedy -- who would have thought! ("Scrooged", Bill's own version of the "Christmas Carol" story, wilts in comparison.) Anyone who liked "The Truman Show" ought to love this. It crackles, it surprises, and it even moves, with Murray's dry wit steering us clear of sentimentality. Watch and enjoy it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film as entertainment and for Bill Murray at his best, with a serious flip side to his well-known flip attitude. More than that, though, I just LOVED Hollywood going philosophical on us, and doing a great job of it.Without giving too much of the story away, Murray's character faces the same situation most of us face, at some time: every day looks the same, the routine is unshakeable-- enough to drive you out of your mind. So what can you do?Well, naturally, you can try one sleazy thing after another-- Bill Murray's usual schtick. Then after all that has been tried and has failed (and here's where things become unusual, for Murray and for American popular movies) you can give up and do something really unusual, like trying to transform the rut you're in, by transforming yourself.Try it (the film) -- you'll probably like it. And if you're anything like me, you might even think of the movie, from time to time, when you feel stuck in a rut, and wonder what to do about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is one of those movies that is worth getting the DVD. Not for the picture quality - which is good, nor for the surround sound track - which is there but not remarkable, but because the movie is so carefully crafted. Anytime you repeatedly watch a movie, you become aware of details in the background. You'll find very few slip ups in Groundhog Day. And, the details in the background enhance the experience. It's fun to watch the supporting characters interact when they are not up front. This is one of the few movies to do this. And, it's important due to the premise of the movie itself.The lead-in song "I'm Your Weatherman" just draws you into the movie every time. I'm always anxious to get to Gobbler's Knob each time I hear that song. The change in Bill Murray's character, from a sarcastic, self-centered individual to the kind, caring person we see at the end is a satisfying conclusion - but does require the viewer to accept quite a bit. Especially considering how the whole town raves about Phil and all the things he has done on the final repetition! I have my doubts whether there are enough minutes in the day to do all the good deeds that Phil did on that one day.We are never really told what caused Phil to have to repeat the same day over and over. In this case, that's good, as it leaves it to your imagination. However, the clues are there at the exact moment when the repetition finally ends.A great (but not perfect), upbeat, entertaining movie that's worth watching again and again!</fullReview>

At first he uses it to only his own advantage, but it becomes quite heartwarming as he starts to help people out, obviously knowing anything bad that was going to happen.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, not only because it was funny, but because it shows even the most heartless people can be kind too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly undervalued film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beneath the light and generally upbeat tone of this film lies one interpretation of "the meaning of life." Whether you espouse reincarnation or not, the idea of "doing it over until you do it right" is something one learns as one ages.Why is it some experiences happen once and others seem to recur in an unending pattern? No matter how hard you try, you find yourself faced with the same dilemma - in spite of a change of location, employment, even significant other.Groundhog Day offers an answer in an easy-to-swallow form. Take it on the level you choose, but if you plumb the depths on this one, you will find it very worthwhile.My hat is particularly off to Bill Murray, who appears aware of the complex task before him, and to the primary writer of the screenplay, who I assume is Danny Rubin. Unfortunately, Rubin seems not to have followed up this effort with anything of comparable significance - yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phil, a sarcastic weatherman from Pittsburgh, goes every year to a little "hick town" where he covers the Groundhog Day festival. He hates it there, and can't wait to get out. But then he gets trapped in a time warp, and realizes that his problems just keep starting over and over again. I thought that this movie didn't look like it was gonna be all that great, maybe a few laughs, but not the best comedy ever.I was wrong. This movie is funny, creative, heart-warming, clever, entertaining, funny, and um, really funny. Just when you think this movie is gonna "run out of tricks" it takes a new turn and ends up getting better and better. And then it makes you think. The only movie of this type that comes close to Groundhog day, in my most humble opinion, is As Good As it Gets. See Groundhog day. I did. over and over again. and it's still just as good as the first time I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie because it shows some of the most important life lessons we can only learn in times of desperation: that we need to seize the day and strive to become the best we can possibly be, because it's the only thing that can get us out of the routine that we fall into in life. The movie also poses a profound question: What would you do if none of your actions will have any consequences tomorrow? Would you be the worst of yourself? Or would you be the best of yourself? Would you become frustrated because you know nothing good will last, or would you be filled with confidence that you can really do the best you can because you won't be afraid to try everything?Is the glass half-empty or half-full? How will you live your life?This movie changed my view on life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very funny movie that showcases do-overs until you get it right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was greatly entertained by this movie but it also made me very wistful (by the way not a good feeling). My life is peppered with regrets and I've made a mess of it and I don't really understand, in retrospect, how it got so screwed up. I've screwed up every important aspect of my life and put effort into things that ultimately were not all that important but hell I was successful in those ultimately unimportant endeavors! To look back on one's life and regret having ever existed is as bad as it gets. Damn would I like just one do-over day, one I could do over and over again until I knew I had it right (there are several candidates but one stands out in particular), but it's not to be, so my advice to everyone else is stay in the moment and weigh everything you do to ensure you don't screw up and simply do what you in your heart knows is right and you will be okay! Lord Byron wrote "Sorrow is knowledge, those that know the most must mourn the deepest, the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life." However do-over days should be limited to righting wrongs not for personal gain. By the way I have to give a shout out to Andie McDowell for her appeal and astounding femininity in this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy classic with a fulfilling meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray stars in this absolute classic of a comedy, a comedy written in a way most mainstream American comedies attempt but fail badly at: a story with lots of funny moments, and an actual morality at the end that rings true, genuine and somewhat deep. Lots and lots of funny moments in this uniquely (at the time) structured film, and whether you're a Murray fan or not, there should be enough in those scenes to make you at least partake in the fun. This movie has this sort of a contagious grip on the viewer like it's a kind of game (as Murray's day keeps on repeating on perpetual loop). A movie that's had many generations laugh out loud, and movie-makers directly inspired from it. In the madness of his "now-daily routine", Murray seeks redemption, and isn't that endless loop perhaps a metaphor (that he wasn't doing the right thing in his daily life), and highly reminiscent of the perpetual torments in Greek mythology ? Comedy classic. Should be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing this film because I was curious what they were going to do with its plot. There is a lot you can do with a plot like this and I was interested to know which directions the movie was going to go in. I was very proud of the angle the movie went in. After watching it, I can safely say that it is one of the best comedies from the past 25-30 years.A weatherman finds himself living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. He is the only one who seems to know that it is happening. After he adjusts to it, he tries different things such as finding a love interest, meeting new people, doing illegal activities, helping out people, and trying to figure out how to stop it from going on.Instances he encounters on that day which keeps on getting repeated include: meeting a friendly former classmate who is trying to sell him insurance, doing a news report on the event of the "Groundhog Day" which he finds to be stupid and pointless, and experiencing a snow blizzard which traps him in a town. He is also very rude to his co-workers: Rita and Larry. He dislikes his job, his colleagues, and himself most of all.However, he learns that in order for the event to stop: he may have to change his normal way of life. Over the course of the days, he discovers his love for Rita and his desire to be with her. He also learns to be more kind to other people and he gets to know and help out people around town that he wouldn't have been introduced to had the events in the film had never have taken place. The event makes him learn to love himself and others. It's a very interesting idea a film could use for representing a change in a characters personality.Another great thing in the film is that it leaves the reason for the day's constant repetition ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide why that happened to him. It makes the viewer wonder if there was an entity or something else that was doing this to him in hopes of having him change his life and personality around. I can understand why someone wouldn't like this, but I didn't mind it because it gave the film sort of an alien or other-worldly feel to it. That's not to say that the movie didn't have one to begin with, but the ambiguity increased it.Phil's character development in the movie is very convincing and realistic because we can easily believe that the situation would make him react the way he does. There are dark periods in the film when he endangers his life, does illegal activities, and tries to commit suicide. There are also reckless periods in the film when he tries weird and foolish things he wouldn't normally try. Finally, there are some happy periods in the film when he tries to improve on his life and personality. It makes sense that he would try different things because since he doesn't know anything about the situation: There is no way for him to know how to stop it from happening and whether or not he's supposed to do something. Since he loves Rita, the only way he can impress her is by actually changing instead of faking it. At one point in the movie, Rita says that egocentricity is one of his "defining characteristics". He doesn't stop being egocentric at the end. He just learns to use it in a positive direction.One of the other great things about this film is Bill Murray's terrific acting. I can't think of any actor who would've performed the role better than Bill Murray did. He proved to us that he's not only able to show dramatic depth, but he is also able to combine a comedic and serious side all into the same character. I think that his role here is his best performance yet.The only thing I didn't like about it is that I wished it was funnier. Of course, there were only a couple points in the film when it made me laugh. However, even the jokes that I did laugh at weren't super creative or that well-written. However, this is my only complaint for the film and nothing else really bugged me about it.In conclusion, this could've just been a good movie, but the fantastic choice of turning it into a character study makes it something special. His character development was interesting and convincing and it was handled very well in the movie. The feeling of ambiguity and Bill Murray's incredible acting also helped to carry this movie. Even though it was light on comedy, this is still an amazing comedy film which ranks up there with some of the very best of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate to wait a whole year to watch it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has become something of an annual event to watch "Groundhog Day" ON February 2nd or as close to that date as can be arranged. Which is GREAT except that the "house rule" only permits a once per year viewing. This is one that keeps getting better and better and better.It was originally seen as "just" a comedy BUT as years have passed and the film has been re-watched and reviews and analyzes of it have been noted, the depth of it have become more apparent. It's FUNNY as all heck. But it is also incredibly sad and in many cases incredibly moving and almost heart-breakingly so.When first seeing Phil Conners this year, my first reaction was " I hate this guy... he is a snarky bully". This is the first time that I reacted to him quite this negatively, btw. BUT as the film progressed and he realized exactly what was happening to him but not WHY, he became something / someone quite different. One of the most BRILLIANT decisions of the film makers / writers was to NOT tell us just WHY this happened to Phil ! Actually, it's done so well that I never even asked this question .. it just WAS ! The entire cast is just right. Reading about who was considered for the role brought forth "what were they thinking?" The cast just WORKS ! Watch it. Watch it again. And again. It's that kind of a picture. Layered.. multi-tasking... GREAT !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great films, "Groundhog Day" is a satisfying romantic comedy that also works as an exploration of existential and philosophical concepts.Phil (Bill Murray) is a Pittsburgh weatherman who must cover the Groundhog Day festivities for the fourth year in a row. He reluctantly travels to Puxatawney, PA with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to record the antics of Puxatawney Phil. After they get there, he is caught in a time loop, making him relive February 2nd over and over.Before he goes to Puxatawney, Phil is tired of his boring life. To him, it feels like everyday is the same--more clouds, more precipitation, more cold fronts. He is abrasively sarcastic and genuinely depressed.When he is forced to live a life where literally everyday is essentially the same, he learns to appreciate the small things. And he realizes that he is the primary variable in his own life; it is up to him to appreciate the little things and to make the most of his time.The script is terrific. Not only does it hold together on scrutiny, it is touching and funny. Bill Murray straddles the line between humorous and meanness perfectly, affecting a transformation that is believable. Andie MacDowell does a good job portraying a woman who is essentially romantic and optimistic, but wary of Phil's intentions. Chris Elliott is self-deprecating and perfectly tuned to his role as an immature schlub.I know I am not alone in saying I have watched "Groundhog Day" so many times I have lost count. Its appeal is so great, it easily bears rewatching, like "The Wizard of Oz". In my estimation, Bill Murray has two of the top comedies of our time with "Groundhog Day" and "What About Bob?"</fullReview>

We can't help but relate to the ups and downs and frustrations of being stuck.

Very interesting concept, i think many people have imagined what it could be to live the same day over and over again, erasing all your mistakes.In my opinion, the essence of this film is to show everybody, how to better their own lives, Phil was not happy with his life, so living the Groundhog day over and over again taught him what he really wants and needs. And to achieve what you want, in his case, to be with Rita, you need to improve and grow as a person, find yourself via learning new skills, meeting new people, helping somebody out just for the heck of it. And i think that is the reason Phil finally got out of living the groundhog day.Clever, funny, motivating, exciting, just a decent movie for all tastes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, imaginative and good-natured comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day Event in which a Groundhog is used to predict what kind of weather is to be expected. Phil is generally cynical about this event and vows that this will be the last year that he'll be covering the event. However, after 'covering' the event Phil wakes up at 6 o'clock the next morning (and every morning thereafter) and finds himself living the same day over and over again.On paper, Groundhog Day really shouldn't have worked anywhere near as well as it did. The premise of having a weatherman reliving the same day over and over again could have been a monotonous bore in the wrong hands, but Ramis and co really make the most of the premise meaning that it generally works well on every level.I think what makes this film works so well is that the writers really went to town in an attempt to explore as many possibilities (both good and bad) of living each day exactly the same as the previous one. As a result of living the same day every day Phil inevitably goes through various emotional stages - denial, anger, frustration, depression, acceptance. Each aspect of the story is handled well by Ramis and co and no aspect stays longer than is necessary.The script is good here, but so too are the performances from MacDowell and Murray. Murray has the difficult task of taking his character through each of the various emotional stages and gives a very convincing performance throughout. MacDowell is also good, but she isn't given quite as much to work with. Together though,their chemistry was fantastic and given the journey that they'd shared together I actually found myself believing in their blossoming romance (this is coming from someone who normally gags when they watch anything romantic). Groundhog Day also has a lot of heart to it as well and for this reason it is a very likable film.As well as all of the above and perhaps most importantly the film also remembers to have lots of fun with its imaginative premise - the scene where Phil was driving with the Groundhog was genius. Whilst this film is never laugh out loud funny there were still plenty of amusing moments.Are there any problems here? Well yes, but they are only minor.... The central plot sees Phil living the same day as the last and whilst it is very funny for the most part actually seeing the same scenes being repeated over and over again does get a bit tedious at times - although there are slight variances in each of the repetitions so it's not a major problem. The insurance guy was also really annoying, but he's only in a couple of scenes so again this wasn't a major problem.It's a testament to Ramis and Co as writers that they've managed to create a film about a man living a seemingly monotonous existence and flesh it out to create a charming, funny, imaginative and rather insightful piece of work. Not many films leave me with a smile on my face at the end, but this one did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a comedy about a man, who is a popular weather forecaster. In the film, first, he goes to a country town to report "Groundhog Day." Second, he notices he spends the exact same day over and over. Finally, he decides to make use of the situation to be a respectable person. I feel it is funny that the man fails to make advances to the heroine over and over. Taking the ending into consideration, we can understand she doesn't like his self-centered attitude. In contrast, I don't like the scene the man tries to kill himself. This is because I wonder whether he really needs to do such a thing. In my opinion, the director can show his feelings by using another way. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching this film throughout the whole. Therefore, I recommend every people to watch it.

		<shortDescription>Interesting dramady for all ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dramady genre is defined almost to perfection by this movie. It's not the most gut wrenching comedy you'll see, but it has a few heavy scenes that most comedies don't. I think they did a pretty good job on it because there are a lot of places where they could have slipped up and didn't. Two examples are 1) not trying to give an explanation for why the time lapse happens since that would have created another storyline with a lot of room for error, and 2) keeping it to a PG rating, because it probably have detracted from the overall effect if we had thirty more scenes of Phil doing everything he would never dare do normally. If you took this exact same concept and put it into a modern movie, it wouldn't be as good. We pretty much saw this exemplified by Click, which had a similar feel to Groundhog's Day even though it was kind of the inverse concept.Our protagonist is egotistical and slightly unlikeable weatherman Phil Conners. We get to see nearly every side of his personality as he reacts to his plight of being stuck in one of his least favorite days of the year. Regardless of how any give viewer feels about his personality, almost everyone will be able to sympathize with Phil to an extent at one point or another. Some people might not like it that Phil ends up a nicer guy at the end and does a 180, but I would argue that it's completely plausible. We can approximate that Phil was stuck in Groundhog's Day for at least a year, probably much more. And he had plenty of time to think along with plenty to think about. Besides that we see his progression from irresponsibility, to depression, to self improvement and generosity. So I think his maturing was completely plausible, though not inevitable. We get to know some of the other characters fairly well like Larry the cameraman, Phil's high school classmate Ned Ryerson, the lady who runs the hotel, and obviously Phil's new co-worker and love interest Rita. I read a review that said Rita was portrayed as too perfect, which might be true, but it might also just be that Phil is so insensitive to her that we don't notice her shortcomings. Besides, for all we know she just woke up on the right side of the bed that particular day and was a horrible person the rest of the time.The comedy is mostly comprised of the different ironic situations Phil gets into from repeating the same day and how he reacts to the differently each day. There are a few good one-liners, but there is relatively little verbal comedy for the most part.You might get annoyed with the repetition of the different events, as Phil does, but it's not very annoying considering that they have to repeat some events several times. This reflects pretty well on the screenwriter(s) with the way they gave the audience enough information, but didn't repeat it. The way they executed the progression of Phil trying to win over Rita was well done, along with him learning the piano and the general knowledge that he gains of the Punxatawny (probably spelled that wrong) residents. It doesn't come off as spectacular, but it's notable that there weren't any problems with those scenes.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story or plot basis. The acting's fine, and you could argue that Bill Murray has an above par performance. It is properly labeled as a comedy, but there are enough serious dramatic elements that you shouldn't choose it if you're looking for strictly comedy. It's one of very few movies that can be enjoyed by all ages without being completely kid geared, so you can enjoy it equally with your family or on your own. If you don't like Rita's character or the general story after about forty minutes, it's probably not worth your time to finish it out. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding comedy-fantasy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is an outstanding comedy-fantasy film about an egotistical TV weatherman named Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, who resents being forced by his Pittsburgh news producer to head to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and cover the reveal of whether the groundhog will see his shadow on Groundhog's Day. Thinking he's a god amongst women, he assumes his travel producer Rita, played by Andie MacDowell, lusts after him and he can't help but take pot shots at his cameraman Larry, played by Chris Elliott. Once Phil has completed his day and is trapped overnight in Punxsutawney due to a blizzard closing down the highway back to Pittsburgh, he ends up in a time loop that forces him to repeat the same day over and over. He seems to be the only person who remembers already going through that day previous and even when he gets so desperate as to kill himself, he continually wakes up at 6AM on Groundhog Day back in his bed and breakfast room.The movie focuses itself around the theme that to really achieve anything in life we must let go of ourselves and open up to those around us. Phil remains self-centered through much of the film. After he first tries repeated attempts to kill himself due to the imagined torture of spending eternity repeating a day he deems miserable, he continues to make the same mistakes as he takes advantage of the knowledge he gains to seduce Rita and steal money from an armored car.For much of the movie, the lighting is pretty drab. Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, at least through Phil's eyes, is very dull. Setting the movie on Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania as opposed to Miami Beach on the Fourth of July was obviously not just a coin flip by the writers. We are supposed to see the same dull, blandness that Phil sees and this lighting in Pennsylvania in February is very believable. In fact, we barely get even a hint of sunlight until the very end when Groundhog Day finally ends and life for Phil continues, lesson learned.The camera angles in this movie really reveal a lot about Phil as well. Much of the time we are looking up at him even if just slightly. This gives the impression that he's bigger than he really is and points to his inflated ego. When the camera cuts back and forth between Phil and whoever he is talking to in over-the-shoulder shots, we are looking from Phil's view down toward the person he is speaking with and up toward Phil from the opposite angle. On characters like Rita, this could be passed off as being because she is much shorter than Phil. But this angle is even used on characters the same height as Phil, such as Ned Ryerson. The exception to this is the Sheriff that closes the highway in the blizzard. In this case, the camera angle looking up from Phil toward him indicates the Sheriff's power but we also notice that we don't see any of Phil in these shots. As Phil starts to change his ways toward the end of the movie, the camera no longer looks down on the others but even Rita, who is obviously shorter, is shot from a lower angle as well making all the characters appear to be on level playing field with Phil.The film has a similar theme as another Bill Murray movie, Scrooged, which of course was based on the Charles Dickens' story A Christmas Carol. In both films, Murray plays a self-absorbed man who learns he must change his ways, however, Groundhog Day does a much better job with its message. This movie you can easily see the true struggle Phil must go through to open himself up to those around him and think about everyone else instead of himself for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film works on two levels - as a wacky comedy, and as a deep meditation on life. We've all known someone like Phil (Bill Murray), the nasty, burnt-out TV weather man who hasn't got a good word to say to anyone, who is cynical about everything and impossible to get along with. Life has been bad to him, so he's going to be nasty back. In Groundhog Day, by having to live the same day over again and again, it slowly dawns on him that his life can improve, but it's going to take some effort on his part. For example, actually learning to be nice to his camera man. To me, the best scene is when Phil walks into a bar, and declares in despair that it's always the same day. A drunk at the bar remarks that that's what his own life is like. Like a lot of people in real life, I thought. Stuck in the same rut like Phil, self destructing, committing crimes, over-eating and running into the same old people, until they can find a way to break out and make the most of life. The only thing I don't like about this film is Rita, the love interest. She's great when she's producing his weather segment and telling him off for being such a slob, but I felt the romantic resolution was too twee and weird. It's like he finally learns how to manipulate a woman into going out with him. Isn't there something wrong with that? But perhaps I'm too cynical. Maybe it's just that he learns how to love someone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fall-Down Funny and Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all of the films that span the career of Bill Murray, I may have found my all-time favorite. Groundhog Day is a heartwarming film. A true one, not some clichd schmaltz you normally associate romantic comedies with. This, to me, is in the same league as Capra. The best film made by the late, great, Harold Ramis. It starts out as the sarcastic comedy that Murray and Ramis are known for (in the vein of Ghostbusters). Then it turns into a psychological dark comedy, of which we follow Phil's decent into madness in cheery Punxsutawney. Then, a romantic comedy, that pays tribute to that age old premise of going back in time, to get the girl. C'mon, you've all had that desire. Then, something really special happens. We see Phil, not only mastering his sensitivity with women, but with humanity, period. Suddenly, Murray transforms into the world's greatest good samaritan, after spending so much time taking advantage of everyone. This is what you call, ingenious story and character development. It's wholesome, but not saccharine. It's incredibly funny and really, unexpectedly touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this movie. It's funny, it's inventive and imaginative, the acting work is great and the casting choices were the best it could've ever been. I think this movie is just fantastic. Even though, when you watch it now, it's very outdated, it still will bring laughter into your home. I've seen it so many times, too many times in fact, and I never get sick of it. This movie is about a weather man who is sent to do a story on the forecasting groundhog, on Groundhog Day. This is his fourth time doing the same story, so as you can imagine, he's not thrilled or making a huge effort. When he wakes up the next day, he realizes that it's Groundhog Day again. And this happens again, and again, and again. Over and over, repeating the same day. At first he's very upset and does what ever he can to undo what ever is making it happen, but then he comes to embrace the repeated day and use it to his advantage, doing productive things. He learns how to play the piano brilliantly, which I really enjoy. The piano teacher's face when he's come in for a beginners lesson and can already play is amazingly, is just so funny. He accepts the fact that he'll repeat the day, everyday for the rest of his life, but one morning he wakes up, and it's a new day. And by the way, the groundhog is so adorable. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Unique with Comedy and Charming Performances,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a terrific movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a really unique comedy film, there really isn't anything else quite like it, the concept was really interesting, seeing a man repeat the same day over and over again, and it is thoroughly entertaining. Bill Murray delivers a terrific performance, he has a lot of very funny parts, but he also gets to show a more dramatic side, something the world had seen little of from Murray at this stage in his career, particularly his scenes with Andie MacDowell are very well acted and their chemistry together was superb. Funny and very sweet, I would recommend Groundhog Day to anyone looking for a good comedy. After a weatherman heads to a small village for Groundhog Day, he finds himself forced to live the same day over and over again. Best Performance: Bill Murray Worst Performance: Marita Geraghty</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare comedy movie with great philosophical undertone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just after watching Primer, quite a complex film on time loops (List of films featuring time loops), I decided to watch Groundhog Day, a romantic comedy.~~ Spoilers below ~~This movie also features time loop where the protagonist "Phil" gets stuck in a tight time loop where he wakes up, again and again on 2nd Feb, the Groundhog day. Whatever he does on that day, goes away the next morning where he starts afresh. Only he has the memory and awareness of this loop. For everything and everyone else, this is a fresh start. For example, if he breaks a clock, the next morning it will be renewed, same with breaking somebody else's nose. Only he would have the memory of breaking the stuff. When he realizes this, as expected, he tries to get the max out of this situation in a hedonistic way. As none of his actions would lead to any consequences, he can now do whatever he wants. He also uses his ability to have multiple passes to the same events, gather larger world knowledge and use it to his advantage (securing a date for example). While doing so, he realizes his actual love for Rita, his co-worker. But however he might want to impress her, things just does not work out. He then contemplates suicide. And does it. But however he tries, he wakes up just the same at 6 am on Groundhog day. There is just no tomorrow for him.Once he is completely bored with suicides, he tries to build up skills. He learns, ice sculptures, piano, car mechanic's job and many different things. With multiple repetitions, he also has much more knowledge about the stuffs that happen on the small town. He uses these two knowledge to help many people around him. And finally, with all these, he manages to win the heart of Rita. Once he does that, tomorrow comes back to his life. He wakes up on 3rd February.That being the story, there are many philosophical, spiritual and metaphorical undertones in this movie.First, the repeat of 2nd Feb in Phil's life, in some way is a metaphor to our own materialistic, repetitive, absurd and boring days. And unless we do something significant, like learning piano like a pro, or helping out someone from choking, or finally getting our dream date, there is just no tomorrow for us. What we see as tomorrow is just the repeat of yesterday. As it comes out from this conversation between Phil and Ralph whom he meets at the caf. Phil: What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? Ralph: That about sums it up for me.Each day, learn something new, feel something new, do something new. Make sure today you do something different from yesterday.It also touches life in another philosophical sense. Like Phil's 2nd Feb, our own life may very well be as pointless and may lack purpose, that does not mean we won't do our work or would not try to be a better person. Our life may be as pointless as the life of Sisyphus; but that does not mean we need to be unhappy about it. "This story of a man doomed to relive the same day over and over again is not concerned about tomorrow. A true absurdist triumph, it cares not what the destination might be, for it knows that the pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful whether or not that pursuit is eventually rewarded.[1]" Just like it is told in Karma yoga.It also has a spiritual and philosophical undertone. Each 2nd Feb in Phil's life seems to be corresponding to the life. And just like Phil, we are stuck in endless cycle of birth and death, bound to the wheel of time until we get the promotion to next level [2].Overall it's a great movie. A simple take on a complex subject such as time loop. Go watch it.References: [1] http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/imagining-sisyphus-happy- a-groundhog-day-retrospective [2] http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-groundhog-day-1993</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Bill Murray's Best Is More Than Just A Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with "Ghostbusters" this is one of my favourite Bill Murray movies. It is a beautiful movie, filled with great performances. Plot In A Paragraph: TV weatherman Phil Conners (A brilliant Bill Murray) is forced to live the same day (February 2nd) over and over again.Bill Murray is simply a joy here, arrogant, funny, suicidal, sleazy, thoughtful, helpful, and romantic. He does them all here. Andie McDowell has never looked more attractive than she does here, and most of the time she is wrapped up in layers of clothes with a cold red nose, and she looks adorable. Harold Ramis does a great job of directing, and the movie has some surprising you Hong moments. One thing I'd like to know is, exactly how long was he stuck in Febuary 2nd for??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Film. One Of Bill Murray's Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a meteorologist who goes to a Groundhog Day celebration to give a report. He eventually gets caught in a blizzard, and then, he suddenly finds himself being stuck in a time loop, everyday is February 2, and through this time, he experiences numerous triumphs and a few tragedies.From Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, comes a classic that is bound to please anybody who watches it. I had heard so many outstanding things about this film, and considering that I like both Harold Ramis and Bill Murray, and that I had heard it was funny. But when I watched it, I got more than just a comedy. As a comedy, the movie would probably rank somewhere in the 8's. While the idea of a man being stuck in a time loop may sound kind of silly, it's anything but that. During the course of the movie, Phil is able to enjoy getting into trouble because it will be reset the next day, he is able to make romance with a few women, and the best one of all, he is able to become a much better person and at the same time, make some triumphs by helping out a few people. I was surprised at the angle that the movie took. At first, I believed that it was strictly going to be a comedy, similar to Caddyshack, which Murray also worked on with Ramis, but it eventually heads into serious territory when Phil realizes that his knowledge of knowing what goes on in the day can lead to numerous outcomes, depending on which paths that he chooses.The acting is absolutely incredible. Bill Murray absolutely astonished me with his performance. I had always been used to seeing him in comedies, particularly Caddyshack and Ghostbusters. Granted, while this movie is a comedy (and he does provide us with some big laughs, such as his opening report and the scene where he drives along the railroad tracks), Murray also showcases his talents in playing a role that's more dramatic. In the second half of the movie, whenever he sees something bad happen, he realizes that his errors have resulted in tragedy, and he wakes up the next day when it's reset and tries to put things right. Andie MacDowell is superb as Murray's co-weather reporter, to whom Murray eventually becomes attracted to during his journey through the time loop. Chris Elliot also shines in his role, he plays another one of Murray's partners in the weather business. However, as much as I enjoyed everyone in the film, Bill Murray (as you might have guessed) hands down gave the best performance in the film, he blew me away with his dramatic abilities, and he made me laugh with his comedic abilities too.It was such a pity when Harold Ramis died last February, because it meant that a comedic genius who directed movies like Caddyshack, Analyze This &amp; Anaylze That, and this very movie, Groundhog Day was gone forever. Rest in peace Mr. Ramis, you will surely be missed. Anyhow, Ramis directed what I would call his best movie when he made this film. As much as I loved Caddyshack, I loved this film more. That's probably because that they are two different movies. Caddyshack is strictly a comedy, while this movie, is more than just a comedy. Groundhog Day is a movie that just about anybody can relate to, it's a touching film that shows how decisions we make can affect other people. And you had better choose carefully, because unlike Phil in this movie, you won't get a second chance. All in all, if you have not yet seen this film, then you have definitely got to see it, as you will be absolutely astounded by what you will see, you will see a hilarious and touching movie that you will say is one of the best comedies of all time, and even one of the best movies of all time.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strangely addictive movie to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film on the website here and read the plot summary, I couldn't believe a movie about a weather man living the same day over and over again could have such high ratings. Well, after watching it, I can see why! Groundhog Day is somewhat like Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol; it begins with Phil, a cynical, pessimistic, arrogant weatherman, and ends with a cheerful guy who has learned what matters most in life. How the hell did he change? Well, poor Phil somehow finds himself trapped reliving the same day, February 22nd, over and over again. There's no escaping it; he's stuck in the boring little town of Gobbler's Nob with a lot of eccentric people and the two colleagues he doesn't seem to care for very much. As time goes by, it sees as if he's lost his sanity, especially when he begins breaking the law for cheap thrills and committing suicide (he just wakes up unharmed), but he begins to fall for his co-worker Rita, someone he's always seen as sort of a ditz, as he learns that she's actually a very smart and interesting person. He also tries to be a better person and begins to care more about the lives of others, something very unusual for him.It's hard to explain this movie and how it's so effective, you have to see it for yourself to be honest with you. All I can say otherwise is that I really liked it; the soundtrack is great, the acting is great and the plot is comedic and original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy held in such a terrific movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a light comedy. But it is not just a simple comedy. It is somehow like the movie "Edge of Tomorrow " that the leading character experience the same day again and again. But the differences between these two fantasy movies is that in Groundhog Day, the only way to get out of the infinite cycle is to change person's attitude towards life, which makes this movie not a simple comedy, but a terrific movie with full philosophy on life.Often we hear the adage, "It is just a film". Well, but what if we truly face the similar predicament?Assuming that we all have to suffer the same day like Phil and whatever we did today would leave no impact on others tomorrow and what makes you awake everyday is a song saying I got you Babe , maybe most of us would react to this crazy predicament passively and madly like what Phil did at first, giving everything up as despair. But when we reflect the situation more calmly,we might live a totally different lives. Just as the Phil did in the movie,he took up piano, began reading, learned to ice-sculpt.Everything seems better than beforeThere are many truth conveyed in this movie, and I do appreciate such a ingenious movie. It reminds me how happy we are as we have such a bright future, in which we can achieve any marvel as long as we make efforts to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A JPC Recommendation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is my favorite film because it deals with every aspect of life. You know you've felt like it's the same thing everyday before. You wake up, go to school or work, usual usual, come home to usual usual. You can abuse this, make a joke of it, kill some people, or help some people. Depending on how you approach it is what this day is actually about. The story is not so seemingly deep or preachy in the film as I may make it out because it is also entertainment which is how things should be looked back on. The worst experience is the most experience. Bill Murray's deadpan sarcasm adds to the amusement of this experience. I give the film ten stars because only a few films anymore leave an impression on me in a certain way. You see so many films and you get so bored and down with everyday sometimes you need to watch some douche deal with the same problem only in this film it's literal. A JPC recommendation goes to any film that leaves an actual impression on me where most others did not. This ones amusing, sad with a sarcastic main character, with romance, and about a holiday that nobody cares for. If there was ever a film about having a positive attitude this one I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day was one of Harold Ramis' best movies as director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after 21 years of only hearing about this movie (though when I worked at a movie theatre at the time, I did manage to watch a few scenes here and there), I finally got to see the whole thing on Netflix disc with my mom who hadn't seen this when it was first released either. She was confused part of the time but she seemed to enjoy it while I knew about the living-the-same-day-over premise the whole time. It's funny seeing Bill Murray at first taking advantage of what he can get away with in going back to what it was before and then experiencing some depression in not going forward before redeeming himself in the process. Andie MacDowell is luminous as his eventual love interest. Chris Elliott has some moments near the end. Bill's brother Brian Doyle-Murray is appropriately boisterous as the groundhog spokesman. And Stephan Tobolowsky is a hoot as this Ned fellow Bill keeps encountering. Harold Ramis did fine as director and co-writer and he provides a nice commentary track on the DVD. Since he died earlier in the year, this review is dedicated in his memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Defining Film of Bill Murray's Career!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie buff, I cannot believe that I have not seen Groundhog Day until now and I wonder what put me off from seeing this movie for so long, especially as a big Bill Murray fan. This film uses his comedic talent to a long extent, but also this is a showcase for his dramatic talent too. This film has a rather interesting concept in reliving a day every day for what seems to be forever. This film is somewhat predictable, but it has a sweet, undeniable message about love and life.Harold Ramis, who also co-wrote this film, directs a film about a grumpy TV anchor named Phil Connors who has to go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the events along with his lovely producer and his wise-cracking camera-man. But after a big blizzard strikes the area, Phil is stuck in a time loop and he must relive the day over and over and over again.This is one of the best films of Bill Murray's career. He was excellent in such films like Ghostbusters and Lost in Translation, but his role here is even better. Even though he is like Scrooge in the film, he still managed to be hilarious. He gave his character an edge where we can like him despite his rudeness. Andie Macdowell also does a really good job as Rita, Phil's producer.Overall, Groundhog Day is a magical film that has an original sci-fi concept, but manages to effectively work comedy and romance to that concept. While it seems complicated, it's actually a simple story. We just have to thank the screenplay that Harold Ramis co-wrote for that. I don't normally give perfect scores to comedies so that proves how great this film really is. A magical, funny adventure about love. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How We Spend Everyday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this movie once with my parents on Groundhogs Day, 2013. I didn't even know what the movie was about, not even knowing that the plot would be about a day repeating itself over and over. So, yeah while only seeing this movie one time, the plot is memorable along with the messages from the movie. To me personally, I can't think of any movie that has ever left me with a more positive message than this movie. Most movies will try to leave you with a good life message, but this movie has a very powerful message. Let's think about this movie in perspective trying not to use any spoilers. Well, Groundhog's Day is a holiday and one of the smaller holidays, a holiday most of us probably don't think much about except on February 2nd. It's not like Halloween which is coming up where we're already seeing decorations and costumes out, or Christmas where in 2 months we will see a lot of Christmas decorations along with hearing Christmas music on many radio stations. Groundhog's Day is mostly like a regular day where school doesn't get canceled or anything, and we find out on the news depending on if the Groundhog sees his shadow if we will have an early Spring or 6 more weeks of winter. In this movie, a weatherman known as Phil played by Bill Murray goes with his team to a certain town in Pennsylvania to do a report on the annual Groundhog's Day ceremony. After Phil stays with his team there another night because of a snowstorm, he notices he wakes up not to the next day, but the previous day Groundhog's Day, and the same thing seems to happen over and over and no matter how Phil spends his day, it just seems to continually repeat itself. Nobody else is aware of this time loop and it seems like everything goes the same way with the rest of the community during the day, only Phil can change the events happening by anticipating what is going to happen. So, basically the message this movie has taught me, is how we have everyday a period of 24 hours and we are the ones who decide how to spend the time each day. Most of the things we do each day are probably based on routine and habit, which is a good reason to get into good habits making somethings more natural to us. Obviously, we have countless opportunities of what we can do every single day with our time. Interestingly, we often times look back and are amazed at all the time that has passed from memorable moments, thinking the time flies. However, this movie shows how we spend are time in a single day and what we can do with all those opportunities, doing different things if a day keeps repeating itself, and getting different things from what we choose to do, like Phil chose to learn how to play the piano and get to know the community. So, basically each day is an opportunity in our life to do something, even things we've never done before. I personally am amazed at all we can do in a single day. I thought about that when I ran Cross Country in College, some days we would run 10 miles on scenic routes in the middle of nowhere on a day where we had classes, and a school night. We'd get back in time for dinner and to do homework. It was interesting to see myself in places I'm normally at on vacations in just an afternoon during a Cross Country practice along with getting good exercise and seeing the beautiful world. So, we might not be able to see the end from the beginning like Murray could. But, often times we don't take chances in life and miss out on opportunities we have because we are too afraid and don't try and unlike Phil some of those opportunities we have now, never come back. It's up to us to do what we can as I read earlier today on the internet, "If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine It's Lethal." The plot of a time loop has also been a plot in other movies like one more recently with Zachary Gordon, "Pete's Christmas," which wasn't nearly as good as this is. But, we just need to think about how we spend are time and what we do, and we will get results. Some of those results will last a lifetime. I'd give this movie a 10/10. While it's not one of my favorite movies, not like one I'd care to own. I give it a 10/10 because of the positive message it leaves us with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film showing a variety of tones...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day takes place in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil Conners is a weatherman that is sent to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities for his local news station. Accompanying Phil are his producer Rita and his cameraman Larry. Phil finds the assignment in Punxsutawney to be beneath him and wants to get in and out as fast as possible, unfortunately, the weather does not cooperate and they find themselves stranded in Punxsutawney.Begrudgingly, Phil spends the night in Punxsutawney and when he wakes up, he finds himself reliving Groundhog Day. He is the only person that knows what is happening and he goes through several different stages. He tells Rita that he is a God, he gets depressed and tries to kill himself, and finally, he accepts his fate and starts to better him. He grows fond of the people of the small Pennsylvania town. He eventually learns to play the piano as well as create ice sculptures. Eventually, Phil becomes such a good person and Rita falls in love with him. That results in Phil waking up in his bed, and discovering that it is February 3rd. I feel the theme of this movie is that if we seek true happiness, we must first be happy with ourselves. By the end of the movie, Phil is no longer a grump and has genuinely changed for the better. He is happy.Bill Murray, who plays Phil, is an excellent choice for the lead because of his "everyman" appearance. He does an excellent job portraying Phil going through the stages on his way to acceptance and eventually happiness. The tone of the movie changes as Phil's feelings about his fate change. There is an ominous tone early in the film with the storm. That switches to a light hearted tone when Phil is having fun with his new found fate. He steals money from an armored car, seduces an attractive woman, and gorges on desserts with no fear of repercussions. As depression sets in, the tone of the film turns dark again. Phil tries to kill himself in a variety of ways. Finally, when Phil decides that real change and growth are needed, the movie reflects that with a jubilant tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day Gives Phil Connors A Lesson On How To Become A Better Human Being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The First Time I saw this movie, I thought it was weird. As I watched numerous times over the years, I love it. I think this movie has great lessons aimed to the viewer. We have Phil Connors (Bill Murray), a T.V. weatherman out of Pittsburg, P.A.. He will be going for the 4th time in a roll to Punxsutawney, P.A.. Along with him is Rita( the producer) for WPBH; and Larry(Chris Elliott). Phil hates covering the festival, and everything about it. He is hateful, obnoxious, paranoid, and somewhat of a snob. As soon as they get there, Phil can't wait to leave. He just wants to get the coverage, dehumanize his co-workers as well a some of the locals. Once they get the coverage start to leave a big snowstorm hits, closing down the highways. Once back in Punxsutawney, Phil starts to have a case of Deja Vu or so he thinks. The movie cuts and we see Phil in the bed at the bed and breakfast. The alarm goes off and he wakes to the Sonny and Cher song I've Got U Babe. He wakes as is usual self grumpy; and the radio is playing the same music, saying the same lines as the day before. He is stuck in Groundhog Day again and he's like W.T.F.. As the movie goes along he starts learning how to become a better human being, but the day will start over again if he fails to learn from his mistakes. As the movie proceeds we see Phil develop a romantic relationship with Rita, help a homeless man by bonding with him, take up piano lessons; and come to the aid of Buster( Brian-Doyle Murray)who was choking. This movie is about feelings, relationships, and humanity. This is a touching story, sometimes we forget how to treat each other with respect. To me this is not a romance movie; but a movie about human interaction.THX, Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Jim Carrey There Was Bill Murray.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, this film was highly entertaining and refreshing. Having missed a chance to see it in my youth, I am seeing this film for the first time in my thirties. These days I research about a film first before I see it. The concept of this film appealed to my imagination: a man repeating a specific day, Groundhog day, over and over again.With time, this man Phil Connors(Bill Murray) learns to turn every situation and encounter to his advantage. Some may think that this guy is evil since he can toy around with anyone without getting implicated. Bill Murray was the ideal character for this film since he is egocentric and sarcastic. His has the ability to make you laugh while remaining straight-faced. Only a few actors have this precious ability. The other noble person in the film is actress Andie MacDowell. She plays news producer Rita Hanson (MacDowell), who is the love interest of Phil.Will Phil ever escape this time-loop? Watch the film and find out what happens next.Similar films: Star Trek Generations, Source Code, The Truman Show, Back To The Future Trilogy, Time After Time, The Time Machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest comedies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has everything! It's hilarious, at times touching and has one of the most ingenious story lines ever written. As an added bonus, it's got Bill Murray in it, and man does he deliver.So the plot concerns a weatherman (Bill Murray) who covers 'Groundhog Day' as a news story every year. He spends most of his time being cynical, insulting and generally dislikeable...until he gets the wake up call of a lifetime. After spending the worst day of his life in a town that he hates, he begins to repeat the same day over and over again. Caught in a seemingly endless time loop, he begins to see this as a chance to do all the bad things that he's always wanted to do without consequence, but eventually realises that he must change his ways if he is to escape.Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time and serves as an example of the perfect comedy. Perfectly plotted and consistently funny, this Scrooge-like tale is ultimately uplifting and provides a good message about the power of being an all-round good person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spiritual and philosophical film that also happens to be quite entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?" "That about sums it up for me."There are films that don't necessarily need inventive and artistic camera shots, or groundbreaking special effects, or even gorgeous cinematography to be considered masterpieces. Sometimes a film like Groundhog Day comes along with a smart and charming story with performances and characters that are so well developed that it automatically connects with audiences by reaching for the heart, and turning it into an instant classic. With a premise that might seem boring due to the fact that the lead character has to repeat and live the same day over and over again in a small Pennsylvania town, director Harold Ramis manages to catch our attention by creating interesting characters and through a witty script he introduces important themes such as existentialism in a rather refreshing and light way. It is a very spiritual film without ever feeling religious. In a way the story reminded me of Dickens' A Christmas Story where you have an egocentric and arrogant character who is transformed once he experiences a supernatural event. In Groundhog Day the transformation is much more subtle while at times it does go to dark places. Ironically Bill Murray went on to play Scrooge in one of the many adaptations of Dickens' classic tale. Murray is the heart and soul of this film and although he is hard to like at the beginning of the film there is something about his performance that keeps us interested in him. This isn't one of those laugh out loud comedies (I don't think I laughed at a single scene), but it is so charming that it is impossible to resist and it leaves you with a smile on your face during its entire running time. Once it ends we realize how philosophical this film really was, but Ramis kept us so entertained that we didn't really pick up on it until the very end.The original screenplay for Groundhog Day was co-written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin. It centers on a weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) working as a TV meteorologist for a local Pittsburgh station. Phil is an arrogant narcissist who is expecting to work for a more important broadcasting channel soon. On the eve of Groundhog Day, he is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual festivities along with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) with whom he doesn't get along very well. Phil hates this assignment which he has covered over the past four years so he doesn't put much effort into his report. After covering the event an unexpected blizzard forces the roads to close so Phil and his crew are stuck in Punxsutawney for another day. The next day Phil wakes up and realizes he has to relive Groundhog Day all over again and he's the only one that notices that the day unfolds in the exact same way. Everyone else seems to be living the day for the first time, but he finds himself stuck in the same day over and over again like if he were trapped in a loop hole with no way out.The premise seemed boring for me at first considering I thought it was going to repeat itself too many times, but Murray's character is so fun and he relives each day in so many different ways that it managed to keep me entertained. At first Phil feels like he has gone mad and tries to rationalize things, but once he realizes his fate he decides to take advantage of it. Being the self centered person he is, Phil lives knowing he wont have to suffer any consequences, but eventually he grows tired of this hedonistic lifestyle. He feels so desperate that he tries to commit suicide in every possible way, but no matter what he does he still wakes up the next morning reliving Groundhog Day. Eventually Phil gives up on living for himself and begins looking at others and caring for them. He begins to find purpose and joy in life in helping others. Ramis has made a deeply spiritual and philosophical film without the audience realizing it at first. It could have become tedious and preachy, but it never does because the characters are subtly transformed and the growing chemistry between Phil and Rita is believable. Ramis found a way to reach out to our hearts and remind us that life isn't about living for ourselves, but finding pleasure in helping and caring for others. Groundhog Day is a movie about self- improvement and becoming a better person and I can't think of a better actor to have pulled it off so well as Bill Murray did in his transformation here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a comedy but a study of man nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a very funny movie but it also studies what would a person do if they had to keep on living the same day over and over again, the only catch is they're the only one that knows that this is going on and you remember everything that happens every day. No matter what you do or how you do it you're not accountable for your actions, since when you wake up after going to bed it's going to be a whole new day. Since everything is exactly the same in the surroundings around you can just rob a bank without anyone being the wiser or something along those lines.This is the type of comedy that's tailor made for Bill Murray where he can be a smart aleck but also being charismatic at the same time. In the movie Murray redeems himself and makes you get behind his rehabilitation into a better person who's no longer jaded by the world around him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm and delightful with a universal message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most striking thing about Groundhog Day is its relatability. In India, there is an ongoing clash between Anna Hazare, a social activist and the Indian government. The issue is the introduction of Jan Lokpal Bill- a bill that employs tougher measures to root out corruption. Anna, with his countless fasts and the government's constant rejection of the former's proposed bill is entering into a log jam. The Indian news channels that cover this issue keep rambling every single day without even throwing light on other issues like the zeroing in on Gaddafi etc. Whenever I switch to the news channels, I feel so bugged by the repetitiveness that I switch over to movies, and that boredom got me to Groundhog Day, and I was actually delighted by the movie. Very few movies are able to take a simplistic plot and retain its sweetness and also send the message across subtly.Phil (Bill Murray) is an egocentric, apathetic and caustic reporter who does his duty mechanically, insults his colleagues and keeps quibbling for a better life. His companion Larry (Chris Elliot) too is indifferent to him. When the two of them, along with an optimistic, bright and large-hearted reporter named Rita (Andie MacDowell) have to cover an annual event called the Groundhog Day in the quaint, difficult-to-pronounce town of Punxuntawney, in which a groundhog decides whether spring would come or not, depending on whether its seen its shadow or not, Phil gets even more agitated, grumbling and 'prima donna'. He even looks down on the generous and simple-minded town folks and avoids his over-zealous, annoying old classmate Ned (Stepher Tobolowsky). Groundhog Day turns out to be a failure with the groundhog prognosticating that the town wouldn't see spring for the next few weeks, and Phil, Rita and Larry can't leave the place because of a blizzard. However, this is nothing compared to the one that befalls Phil later. He wakes up the next day to find that it's Feb 2 again and he has to relive the day again and again. How Phil turns this curse to a blessing is what the movie is about. The first question that came to my mind while watching the film was that how was it going to be different and keep me engaged for more than 90 minutes? I'm eighteen now and there so there was a time when I loved Disney shows and this time loop phenomenon has been done on quite some Disney shows. Also, I was slightly put off when I came to know that this was a time loop story, since I already had pictured some predictable sequences in my mind, which thankfully didn't occur. Yeah, Phil is flabbergasted and confused, he does seek for solutions and there are other predictable things done by him, but nothing dampens the mood of the film. And this is because 1) The performance by Bill Murray is natural and 2) The screenplay never turns corny. Phil does everything to push the day forward, failing every time. He first acts funny, doing random stuff, then goes ballistic and kills himself in different ways, acts like a jerk to everyone around him, then tries to seduce Rita, only to wake up to the tune of Cher and Bono and morning radio. What he realizes eventually that his time may seem monotonous to him because he never lived his day to the fullest. That's when Phil decides not to live the day for himself but for everyone around him. This may sound too clichd, but thankfully it is handled with care and finesse. The humor in the film is spontaneous and restrained, never going overboard, even at the most desperate moments. Some of my favorite digs are the one where dj? vu is mistook for a beverage and the 'Don't spoil it' by Andie MacDowell towards the end. The auction scene too is hilarious. The best part is the flow of the humor, not too little, not too much. The acting is strong. Murray becomes Phil, and plays his character truthfully throughout. I agree with Roger Ebert that Bill was tailor-made for this role. Had this role gone to other actors, it wouldn't have been so sincerely played. Let's look at a few examples:1) Jim Carrey- 'OH this can't BE HAPPENing! I'm going crazy, yeah! I'm GOING CRAZY!!!" And the crazy gestures and hyper-acting.2) Ben Stiller- 'Oh no, I can't believe this is happening!" Blank stare at the wall, puts pillow over his head. 3) Gerald Butler- (I know he is new but it's just an example) "Sex?. Yeah, sex!" And nothing else?.4) Adam Sandler- A complete no-noThe rest of the cast too shoulders the film quite well, especially Andie, who has to play the same scene again and again, each time refreshing her act. When Phil decides to improve himself, he does not make the day perfect for him but for everyone around him. His perception towards the townsfolk changes. He gets a couple married and gives them tickets to Wrestlemania (LOL!), helps a few others and even plays the piano! And everything falls in place, as for the very first time he spends the night with Rita without getting slapped. And that's when he has learned his lesson and in Phil's own words, "Today is tomorrow!" A very poignant moment is when one realizes that Phil on his final day does not take advantage of Rita, and decides to sleep instead of going third-base hastily and ruining everything.To be special, a movie has to have its moments. Groundhog Day has lovely, breezy moments and gives a slender treatment to its script. My rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful movie? This movie shows that no matter how boring and monotonous a day is, you should try to make the best out of it. Even if that means reliving the same cold winter day over and over again. That's what happens to the egocentric weather reporter Phil, who travels to the little picturesque town of Punxsutawney, where the annual Groundhog Day is celebrated. He finds himself trapped in a weird cycle: every morning he wakes up on the same day! But he's the only one who relives the day, for the rest it's all new. Little by little he learns about all the people; who they are, what they do, what makes them tick... At first, he uses this information to his benefit, thinking he can get away with anything, since nothing has consequences he reckons. He lives like there's no tomorrow, which is actually true. Using trial &amp; error he gets almost everything he wants, except for one thing: the affection of his producer Rita. No matter how hard he tries, she won't give in... Disappointed by this failure Phil take another route, which leads to his self-destruction time after time. When and how will he find his redemption?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare say that "Groundhog Day" changed the face of comedy. The whole concept behind it is ingenious. One man, living the same day over and over again, eventually decides to make the most of it and he is changed forever.This movie is genuinely funny and it can't help being so. What person wouldn't find that concept funny? Even if it gets annoying eventually, it remains funny in the pit of your stomach because Phil is such a jerk in the beginning that it's hard to feel sorry for him. When we start to see his transformation, we see something that hits home for all of us: he is misunderstood. He wants to quit and turn back into a jerk. But eventually, even Phil Connors pulls through.Proof that given the chance, pretty much anyone can find happiness. It's all in your mindset. A surprisingly powerful message hidden in this comedy gem that will make you wet your pants and keep you so interested you won't bother changing until the movie is over.9 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps not the best movie for younger people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie (more than 10 years ago) I didn't really like it all that much. Of course I was a lot younger then (I'm 26 now), didn't have the same taste for movies that I have now and probably didn't understand everything as well as I do now. The cynical humor, the seemingly endless repetition of almost every detail... I probably wasn't ready for it then, but I sure was now and I loved every part of it.Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman, is sent to a small town (don't make me say the actual name because I would probably get my tongue into a nod) to cover a story about a weather forecasting groundhog or 'rat' as he calls it. When the job is finished he wants to get out of the town as quickly as possible, but a snow storm (which he didn't even predict right) forces them to stay one more day. The next day he wakes up and finds out that it's Groundhog Day again. The same for the next day, and the next day, and the next... And every time he wakes up and starts his day with that annoying song from Sonny and Cher combined with the even more annoying voices of the deejays.This really was an hilarious movie like we don't get enough these days. The humor was right, the acting and the story were very good. This movie really worked. Still, I wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers, not because of some explicit content, but just because I guess that they will not be able to fully appreciate the movie (just like me). Anyway, I reward this movie with an 8/10, perhaps even an 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a great feel good movie and although not a x-mas movie it just feels even better watching it at that time of year.There are only one or two movies that I have seen in my life that I will score a 10 so to give this a 9 is high praise indeed.After watching it the first time I would have scored it a 7 or 8, but this film more than any other I have ever watched stands up to repeat viewings. It is rare that I watch a movie more than once or twice but I have seen this four or five times and always enjoy it as much as the first time.This I find amazing as the film itself shows the same day over and over, you would have maybe thought the opposite and that you would get bored second time around.Maybe I find it so enjoyable because you put yourself in his shoes and wonder how you would deal with the situation, only to see the film cover every angle until finally the secret is found (though were never quite sure what it is other than 'be good') and the next day dawns Bill Murray is perfect for the role and I don't think it would have worked so well without him.Scores a 9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most thoroughly romantic movie of the baby boom generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think when the history of this era is written, the most interesting entry will be for Bill Murray. On SNL he carved out a sort of Andy Kaufman anti-comedy role, the entertainer with no talent who didn't care if you knew; he'd belt out the songs anyway. Which undoubtedly helped cement the rumor that he was the show's dope dealer doing a cameo.Honing the persona year in and out, in Ground Hog Day he's a charmer with no apparent charm, a nihilist with too much success to notice he's depressed. When he gets the chance to reflect, he finds something he really wants, and discovers he has to develop all of his real qualities, hard as they may be to find, to get it. I gave this movie a ten not for its quality alone, but because I think when we ALL reflect we'll recognize it as the signature film of its time.</fullReview>

The affectionate tension builds, beginning low-key and subtly, between the cynicism and pessimism of Bill Murray's weatherman, Phil, and the tolerant accommodation of his producer, Rita(Andie McDowell), not to mention the general good-cheer of the townsfolk.But does Phil have to become an optimist to win Rita's heart?Or is there something else going on here?Is it even about learning how to do a myriad of things, just in order to impress the girl?Phil is definitely your true-to-life cynic. But what it is that finally changes Phil, in the end?The focus narrows as he refines his technique, his approach, his way of thinking.What finally is it, that changes Phil?And what finally enables Phil, and Rita, to make it through to the next day, breaking the spell?It isn't because they were able to stay up all night, through to 6 a.m.Because it shows they were clearly asleep when the clock announces a new day.</fullReview>

Only at the end does the viewer realize that the victim has spent the equivalent of many lifetimes in the one-day loop, with no hope of release, even death is not granted to him.When he is finally released, a rebuilt and different man, I want to cheer.Recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a thoroughly entertaining look at one man's selfish and imperfect life and his misadventures as he attempts to make it (and himself) better. Bill Murray and Geena Davis did a great job entertaining us in this film. The chemistry between them was fun and exciting, and the cast of unusual characters from small town USA added greatly to the humor of the situation. The premise of the story was almost believable in a happily ever after kind of world. I found myself hoping that Bill Murray's character would finally get it right even as I watched him struggle to overcome his personality flaws and screw up time and again. How wonderful it would be if we all had the opportunity to start over (and over and over and over) until we get it right.</fullReview>

It told the story of Phil Connors, a weather man who isn't very friendly or caring and on February 2 he must do a report on the groundhog (he was so cute) in a PA town. But for some reason Phil keeps repeating this day over and over again.He probably went through this day 30 times throughout the whole movie, which gave me some good laughs.

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly Bill Murray's Best Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) - Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Toblowski - Written By Danny Rubin, Directed By Harold Ramis - ****Premise: Weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) finds himself repeating the same day, February 2nd, every single day.Bill Murray is one of everyone's favorite comedians. His sarcastic humor is matched by few, if any. Needless to say, Bill was excellent in the movie. Andie MacDowell was very good, as well. I was surprised to see Chris Elliott in this movie, but he did a great job, considering this wasn't his usual slapstick comedy.The premise of the movie was original and well-executed. It never explains why Phil Connors was forced to repeat that day, and in a way, I'm glad there was no explanation. If they had, they would have probably used a highly overused voodoo curse or something. So, maybe the lack of explanation is for the best.The movie was also very funny. Bill Murray's sarcastic humor kept me laughing. There were some nice one-liners and very few physical gags, but the sarcasm is what really makes Groundhog Day a truly funny movie.This is the movie any true Bill Murray fan should see. Anyone who isn't a Bill Murray fan, will be made a Bill Murray fan by watching it. This was an excellent movie. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love this movie. It is Bill Murray's best. Our family watches it every year on Groundhog Day. It's a tradition.The movie stars Bill Murray as an egocentric weatherman who wakes up in Punxatauny, PA, where he is reporting on the annual Groundhog Day celebration, over and over again. Although he wakes up at 6:00 AM on Feb. 2 just over 30 times in the movie, it is understood from the plot that he actually goes through hundreds, if not thousands, of iterations.He learns how to play the piano, how to ice sculpt, and how to pick up women with reckless abandon. But, finally, he learns something much more important.During his plight of reliving Groundhog Day, he commits suicide by every means known to man. But he keeps waking up on that same morning again and again. Andie McDowell is beautiful. Her character makes a great love interest for Murray's.I highly recommend this movie. It's funny, at times touching, and well-acted. I gave it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 90's comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is the best comedy of the 90's and I feel was overlooked at the Oscars in a way. The story is that of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has arrived in a small town to cover the Groundhog festival with his producer Rita (Andie McDowell) and camera man Larry (Chris Elliot). But when he must stay in the town for the night, he wakes up at in the previous day and it does so, again and again. This movie has the ultimate gag of all time with the concept of living a day for the rest of your life, it is used with great effect and Harold Ramis the director sets up very neat scenarios and does a time warp of the situations he is in but in different days. Bill Murray is in his prime here and Phil Connors is one of his best characters and his portrayl deserved perhaps a nomination, if Kline got one for A Fish Called Wanda then Murray should have recieved one. The sarcasm of Phil is great and the first cover of the festival is some of the most funny sarcasm I have ever seen. It is a shame that Murray doesn't sometimes write his characters dialogue, because he can handle the use of sarcasm to the best comedic possibilities. There is one scene in the movie which he improvised, Ned comes up to him and instead of being a wise ass he hugs him, Ned is shaken and while hugging, Murray comes up with... "I don't know where you're heading, but, can you call in work sick." Ned obliges politley and runs away, Murray is right on par here in some of his best work. McDowell and Elliot are good too providing solid support but the movie truly belongs to Murray. The two category's this should have been nominated for at the Academy was Best Screenplay and Best Actor, overlooked without a doubt. This film is a very intelligent film, it has such spiritual foundations that it is feel good and also you come away with something new to your life. If you want an intelligent, romantic, fun, hilarious movie, with the best Bill Murray sarcasm, than watch Groundhog Day. When you watch you will want to watch it again, and again, and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is no sooner than the credits of this holy film have gone from the screen that the viewer realizes that he was witnessed the birth of a new Method. Not that of Brando and De Niro, but the aural force emitted from the acting of this spiritual leader, Bill Murray. A majestic performance of astounding subtlety that brings to mind Orson Welles.As Murray cries: "You're hypocrites! All o'ya!", his demented lament - one of a soul trapped in parallel universes of existence - leaves us to ponder on the meaning of life itself and what we make of it. Harold Ramis' direction is a true tour de force, ripping forward to the uncertain (if any) future of the hero. And when Murray jumps of a chapel (campanario/champagnerie), those of us who have not yet suffered a stroke from intensive spasms of laughter, enter a state of shock, a catharsis both on and off the screen.Arguably one of the greatest comedies of all time, this Kafkaesque interpretation of one man and his weather demands repetitive viewing, until the onset of coma.

		<fullReview>I won't say this is the greatest movie of all times since you will most likely disagree with me, but in my world it sure is.Back in good old Sweden this movie was very poorly marketed, but luckily some friends of mine discovered this movie a few years after its premiere and it quickly became our favorite movie. The basic genre of the movie is the "romantic comedy" genre, which is flooded by enjoyable but very average movies that makes time fly by without leaving any major impressions. I believe the genre also is the curse of Groundhog Day, people are supposed to leave their brains shut of when watching these kind of movies and no one is supposed to love romantic comedies, you are meant to like them. In my view Groundhog Day is the most underestimated work of art in the movie history....(or it might be that people simply have different tastes and just don't love the movie as I do, but when it comes to Groundhog Day I don't like that kind of thoughts ;) )The movie is about the art of enjoying your everyday life.... ....or it is a philosophical what-if-movie, about the eventuality of someone having to relive the same day over and over again, reflecting on the moral and psychological consequences... ...or it is a beautiful romantic film where someone manages to change into a better person in order to charm the woman of his dreams... ...or a hilarious comedy that makes you breathless while trying to stop laughing.If you don't like some of the different aspects of the film simply ignore them, you will still enjoy the movie.Groundhog Day is in my view the most obvious 10/10 movie. And I strongly recommend it to anyone, hopingly you will love it too and if you don't you will surely like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is far more than a good comedy. It's an analogy to life. Phil's curse is a repetitious day that starts over the same every morning at 6:00 AM - regardless of his actions the "day before". He alone remembers that it has already occurred. At first he is clever -- using the situation for personal gain. He finds out facts about pretty girls on day one, then uses these facts to endear himself to them on day 2. He robs the armored car truck during the few seconds he knows it is going to be unguarded. The novelty pales. Unsatisfied, he becomes more desperate and apathetic. Finally, he realizes that the only way to find true satisfaction is to improve himself, help others, and try to do the world some good instead of trying to figure out what he can get from it. When he finally lives a day to perfection, the spell breaks and his life falls into place. It's inspiring, it's hilarious, and it's so intriguing you won't want it to end. You'll want to see this movie every couple of years just so you can remember what life is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forever In A Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry.Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him."Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed.It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic."Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it."The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole.Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis.What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it.The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film.But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my favourite film of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen.Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion.I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad?The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can.But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally.It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time.In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage.I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy.Yeah. I liked it.There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is ? if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades.But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy.I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again?</fullReview>

With a comedian like Bill Murray the film is for sure a funny one and will get plenty of laughs from any age audience. The filming is excellent so is the editing especially because they had to recreate the same scene over and over and over with slightly changed characteristics. Overall I rated the film an 8 out of 10 because it's a great film and what's really nice is that it's most certainly one that you can watch with your whole family and everyone will find it funny!</fullReview>

Because of this he wakes up on Groundhog Day every day for the next 6 weeks. At first he likes it but then realizes that he may be doing the same thing over and over again.This Movie is awesome. It has a great cast, Bill Murray is funny as always, and when dramatic moments hit they hit hard.

		<fullReview>I saw this again after 10 years or more had passed since my last viewing, and my appreciation of it--particularly the writing--grew enormously. I had given it 7 stars back then, but I've upped it to 9.This time around, I see the movie as being about two things: 1) how hard it can be to get laid properly; and 2) the eternal recurrence (see Nietzsche--"Thus Spake Zarathustra," and elsewhere). The idea is, we should live our life as though it will be repeated, again and again, forever. If that were true, and we knew it, we would strive to make the day perfect in every way. Then, how much better all our lives would be!Why not 10 of 10, then? What the movie lacks is any self-reflection at all. The ideas are there, but because they are presented in the context of a silly idea, and because Bill Murray's excellent performance--the very essence of character development--proceeds only through crude trial, error, and more trial and error, then it takes us repeated viewings to get the point. Another qualm, somewhat minor, is that the piano teacher whom Bill Murray takes on late in the story somehow takes credit for his miraculous development as a jazz pianist: if she is like all the other characters in the story (except Murray), she has only known him for one day and could hardly think that she had taken him from rank beginner to polished professional performer in a single day. I think that by this point in the story, the writers and audience were both getting a bit weary of painstaking plot and character development and were asked to take on sudden change without question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably THE best Feel Good movie ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this doesn't get 10 out of 10 is because of one fatal flaw! It ended!! There are so many levels to this movie that you need an organiser to keep track of all the parts you should be admiring. The onion analogy would work well here. I'm not an expert only a 'watcher' so I love all the 'little mistakes' 'cos I suppose they're supposed to be there!! There is no doubt that this is a one character script with everyone else only there as filling so I suppose a question mark over the lead lady being so well known? Definitely not required. A must see and if it won any awards it definitely deserved them. No hesitation in recommending this!</fullReview>

It's also an incredible achievement on the writing department with one of the most creatively ingenuous plot devices : having a man living the same day, over and over again. As usual, the thin frontier between simplicity and genius provides, in the comedy genre, a goldmine for gags and humorous situations, mostly based on the comedy of repetition.

Phil, I mean the man, is obnoxious, sarcastic and hardly inspires the sympathy of his team : the cameraman and Rita, his assistant. But for some strange reason, Phil is suddenly stuck in a time loop and live the same day over and over again, with the same situations and the same encounters. Progressively, the nightmarish feel is replaced by a domestication of this power which Phil uses by making each day the next one's draft, avoiding the same mistakes and blunders, or taking advantages of some situations through stealing, seducing women and being totally irresponsible with no fear of long-term consequences. The movie is a fantasy in the way it fantasizes about the impossibility of giving ourselves eternal second chances, it's the sad basis of our human mortal condition that implies the acceptance of responsibilities and consequences, even of the most futile actions. It's even an evocation of the Schopenhauer's view of world as our own will and representation, which puts us as our own self-referential axis in a universe that can be totally different from another perspective. But interestingly, this power will progressively drives an empathic move in which Phil will help, save people, and learn to dedicate his time for the community, and God knows how much he's got. Punxsutawney is his representation, ordinary peoples' happiness, his eternity. And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, the heart of the film is in Phil Connor's redemption and use of the gift to make his life better for him, for the others, and for Rita, played by the beautiful Andie McDowell."Groundhog Day" is a story with an inspirational message, carried by Bill Murray's virtuoso performance, and providing some of the funniest cinematic running gags ... including one hell of a face punch!AND THANKS FOR READING ...

This is one of the best acting jobs by endlessly charming Bill Murray. I just want to use this review to recommend this movie to younger generations which are driven too much toward likes of Matrix and comic book heroes, movies which quality is more judged by their visuals instead of some good message at the end.Best part is it does not matter will you watch it in hd or not.

		<shortDescription>A modern classic - terrific comedy, poignant drama, a philosophical angle, what more could you ask from a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a great movie. I'm generally weary of 'high concept' movies because they tend to exhaust their creativity in whatever gimmick gave birth to them in the first place but GHD is truly something special. Eat your heart out Jim Carrey. It has a gimmick so simple and brilliant in its conception it makes you wonder why no one had thought of it before, yet Ramis and Rubin milk it for all its worth and in so many different ways, none of them any less successful than the others. We get comedy, we get poignant drama, we get romance, we get a philosophical angle - a slight turn of the screw and the same situation turns from one to the next, all seamlessly blending together. I still think one of the most poignant dramatic realizations is when Murray's character realizes in the hospital that the old man he ignores in the street every morning dies every night. One could fill a diatribe on the philosophic readings GHD lends itself to, but in the end, like Murray's character finally understands, all we can hope from life are the small moments of happiness. And GHD is filled with 'em.I think GHD is another case of It's a Wonderful Life. Like Capra's movie went on to become a tremendous classic and the better known of the two despite losing several Oscars to Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives when it came out, so GHD seems to be climbing in status and fans as the years pass despite being received initially at face value as yet another Ramis-Murray comedy. A modern classic no doubt about it. And the connections with It's a Wonderful Life extend beyond critical praise - sentimentality done the right way, seamless combination of drama and comedy and both of the same great quality, a narrative gimmick, a great performance by a charismatic protagonist etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking and hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't think that Bill Murray is one of the funniest men on the planet, then you clearly haven't seen Groundhog Day. Murray owns the screen from beginning to end of this marvelous film, and I mean he owns it. Obviously the Academy Awards don't actually care about honoring great film, regardless of genre, because this is clearly one of the best films of 1993, the 1990's as a whole, and also of all time.Murray plays Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. His one-day trip turns into a never-ending cycle, as Phil gets caught in a time warp that causes him to relive the same day over and over again. Phil is stuck in Punxsatawney for a seemingly endless amount of time; each day, he wakes up in the same Bed and Breakfast and nobody else remembers a thing about all the days he's lived. We follow Phil through several emotional stages, ranging from confusion to terror to joy to despair and ultimately to real happiness.Groundhog Day is one of the most original comedies I've ever seen. The plot has been repeated on television shows several times since (and perhaps the idea had been filmed beforehand, I'm not sure), but never has it been as perfectly crafted as it is here. Groundhog Day is both funny and realistic, (as realistic as a time-warp movie can be) and Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role. Andie McDowell is also very good as Rita, Phil's co-worker and eventual love interest.Groundhog Day is essentially a comedy, but it is also deeply thought-provoking, and makes you consider how you live your life. Phil starts out as a selfish, cynical man and slowly changes into a considerate, helpful individual who truly cares about others. As we watch him transform into a better person, we laugh a whole lot at the situations he gets into- but we hopefully emerge from it all like him, a changed man for the better. Groundhog Day is a brilliant piece of film-making and should be watched by everybody (preferably every Groundhog Day, which is February 2nd).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 25th Review: This movie is a comedy that should go down with Bill Murrays best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am a big fan of Bill Murray and I loved movies with him in it like The Man Who Knew too Little and Caddyshack. The movie is about a stuck up news reporter who finds himself in his home town reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. This movie is good because it is clever, original and funny or hilarious as I should say. This Bill Murray movie is probably my equal favourite one with him in it to The Man Who Knew too Little. Overall I rate this movie very high for cleverness and all that while being one of the funniest Bill Murray movies out there so I recommend this to anyone and everyone as it is enjoyable and should be(and probably by now is) a major classic so 97%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murray and Ramis' Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the very first episode of "Late Night with David Letterman", Bill Murray ran to the edge of the stage where he led the audience in an impromptu set of calisthenics while he sang "Lets Get Physical". That was the early Bill, a man who paradoxically was a smarmy phony and infectiously enthusiastic at the same time.Later on, in "Lost in Translation" and "Broken Flowers" Murray has become more introspective. "Groundhog Day" somehow catches Murray as he in the midst of the transformation from early Bill to the current Bill.When I first saw "Groundhog Day" I remember leaving the theater feeling oddly moved, as if I had just witnessed something that was simutltaneously humorous fluff and deeply important. Later on, and upon further viewings, it dawned on me that this was the greatest film of redemption ever made, and one of my favorite films of all time.I won't rehash the plot, other than to say that Murray's character, Phil, undergoes a transformation from incredulity to opportunism to despondence, and finally acceptance and understanding that this day is his to perfect.During his transformation, Phil goes from superficial to caring and motivated, and to me that is an interesting parallel with Murray's career. One scene that is particularly telling is when Phil is wooing Andy McDowall's character by using information he has gleaned on previous days. At first, his attempts work, but as he tries to re-create the scenes that help his seduction succeed, his method becomes rote and forced. Like his voice work on the "Garfield" films, he is just phoning it in.Once he realizes that his attempts are a sham, Phil becomes despondent and tries to get himself out of his personal purgatory by various attempts at suicide, but each day starts anew with Sonny and Cher singing "I Got You, Babe". As Phil reaches acceptance of his fate, he takes his cue from the characters and the town of Punxatawny, and becomes genuinely interested and involved with his surroundings.On Phil's final day, Ramis and Murray shine. Not one misstep, everything clicks, and you can't help but smile as Phil captures the love and attention of the town and his associates not through guile and phoniness, but with genuine effort and caring.If you are one of the few people who hasn't seen this fine film, rent or buy the DVD ASAP. To this day, I don't believe that Ramis and Murray are fully aware of the importance of this film, but as time has gone on since its release, critics (including the IMDb folks) have recognized as the truly excellent film that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen to "you" if you were to live the same day over, and over, and over again? Would you go mad? Or, would you indulge yourself in drinking, eating and sleeping? You would not only live the same day over and over again but you would be endowed with immortality. Even if you commit suicide, you will wake up the same morning, intact and unharmed. Could you fall in love? What would be the point of living? You would memorize everything that will happen on that particular day. You would know what time, who would be where and for what reason. Perhaps, that is what life is - the uncertainty principle that makes us live. You wouldn't need any money for anything. Very clever film and one of Murray's best performance - highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before the internet and IMDb there was this movie that I simply adored. Imagine my pleasure to learn that this movie occupies a spot on the top #250. A true testament to its appeal.I have many favorite movies that are comedies but what sets Groundhog Day apart from the rest is its message of redemption. Okay, maybe that is a message that today's post-modern moviegoers don't want to hear. But some odd coincidences with my own life endowed the movie with an unusual resonance for me personally. For example, I had taken up studying piano and Rachmaninoff's 18th Variation was one of the pieces I aspired to master (q.v. the dance at the end). I also had read many Chekhov works (q.v. Murray quoting Chekhov in one of his broadcasts from Punxsutawney).Bottomline, if you find this movie distasteful, I can only assume that you too are stuck in your own groundhog day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been said by other reviewers about the metaphorical aspects of this well written and acted film, so I won't waste time rehashing all that. Basically Bill Muray's character is forced into introspection and growth because the only element of his existence he is able to permanently change is himself. Murray is pretty good at this type of metamorphosis (see "Scrooged"). While placing characters in situations that encourage or stimulate personal growth is common movie fare, the way it is accomplished here is really unique. In a world of so many copy-cat stories and variations on a theme this movie is brilliantly original. Oh yeah, the "I got you, babe" every morning as an indication we're still on groundhog day is priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can be understood without knowing much background info on the holiday; but such info makes for a richer movie-watching experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a holiday with deep roots in the pagan past. It is our only holiday whose theme is weather. It occurs at a time of year when weather occupies our thoughts more thoroughly than at any other time of the year. We know we're still stuck in winter, but enough of the winter has elapsed that we now feel justified in looking ahead to the promise of the spring equinox.More than any other holiday, Groundhog Day is the "looking-ahead" holiday. We're not so much celebrating the present on February 2 as we are a day in the not-too-distant future, the spring equinox (a very important time in the lives of ancient peoples). The spring equinox is simply being celebrated ahead of time, as Groundhog Day, on February 2. Asking us to bottle up our hopes until three weeks in March have passed would be be just plain unreasonable, right? This analysis helps explain all the talk of "forecasting" on Groundhog Day. But it isn't the Groundhog who's looking ahead, it is we. And whether it arrives early, late or on-time, this is one prediction that inevitably will prove true: spring will arrive, one way or another -- it always has. And on Groundhog Day we take solace in that fact.As I imply in my article, "Groundhog Day and the Groundhog Day Movie" the latter can be fully understood only in this context. Like the holiday itself, the "Groundhog Day" movie is all about transition. Sure, you can discern the transition without knowing much background at all about the holiday; but such knowledge improves the experience of watching the movie.Then again, "Groundhog Day" can be appreciated on many levels. Superficially, it can be enjoyed as a romantic comedy; Bill Murray makes it work on this level. But for those with a philosophical bent, it is a very profound movie. Some have even suggested a connection with Nietzsche's teaching of the Eternal Recurrence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an old Doors song that has the chorus line "break on through to the other side", and it comes to mind as I write. There are many movies now that begin by showing us an everyday, mundane, version of our world and then have the central character "breaking through" to something much more meaningful and significant.Probably The Matrix (1999) is the best example of such a movie, where a computer message implores Neo to "Wake Up!" and begin a journey that has him uncovering an alternate reality. And then there is The Truman Show (1998), where Truman (True Man) Burbank begins to suspect that his routine everyday existence in the town of Seahaven has another side to it. Even Star Wars (1977) has a dual reality theme, with a deeper reality being evident in scenes with The Force; the light sabre scenes with Darth Vader, in particular, are fights between spiritual warriors, not ordinary beings.And then we come to Groundhog Day where a nice cosy small town visit leads Phil Connors (Bill Murray) to move beyond the selfishness that has trapped him, towards being a more expansive and loving human being. He realises his limits and becomes a better person. This implies that our lives have a higher purpose and the movie is elevated from simply being a small town comedy.Groundhog Day is yet another example of a movie that can be enjoyed at two levels: as an entertaining and popular box office hit as well as a thought-provoking movie that raises questions about life, the universe and everything. What could have been an ordinary comedy is lifted up by an intelligent script as well as good acting and directing. It's a movie that is well worth seeing over and over!Trivia: Groundhog Day is #34 on the AFI's list of funniest American movies.</fullReview>

My children have grown to love the movie as much as I do, and have laughed at different parts as they matured. There're so many nuances, and moments that get found and that are anticipated that you laugh the moment before it happens. I marvel at the timing and movement as you are drawn through the growth and changes faced by this unwilling human ( Phil Conners)as he faces life head on. There are many outstanding supporting performances by Chris Elliot, as the cameraman the dumb and dumber twins of Ralph and Gus (Rick Overton and Rich Ducommun). It's one of those movies that some hate but most love. Including my family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few movies I will never get tired of watching and it makes me laugh although I already know all the jokes. Every time they show it on TV, I somehow end up glued to the screen. No winter is perfect without at least one viewing of this lovely winter tale. Although it's not about Christmas, it has this very X-masy feel about it. The way Bill Murray plays the cynic is great, and it is very moving (and funny at the same time) to watch how he gradually gets purified by his ordeal, until by the end he is ethically almost "superhuman". Also it is so funny because you know what's going to come next and you can't wait to see how he tries out different ways of dealing with the same situation. Although there never is an explanation about why and how the repetition of this one day comes about, it is obvious from the way the movie ends that God (or someone else up there who wants us to become good people) takes a hand in this. Of course there are a few things in the plot that can't stand up under scrutiny (people seem to remember things they shouldn't) - but that is not the point.This is entertainment at its best. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if every morning you woke up everything happened the same way as it did the day before? It would be like reliving a disaster, knowing that there was nothing that you could do to intervene or penetrate the situation, but just to stand there and watch passively, absorbing all the external influences that come your way. This is what 'Groundhog Day' is all about. Fertile ground for discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor SpoilersGroundhog Day is one of MY favorites movies because its always funny and I like the cast and and the direction is very good by the co-writer of Ghostbusters Harold Ramis. I just love it each and every time Bill Murray relives Groundhog Day.He is so funny in it and I really like that blizzard that they wern`t suppose to get.To ME every thing is good in Groundhog Day like the incredible story,music,direction,and many other things. If you love Bill Murray,Ghostbusters,Scrooged,or just to see a great funny but serious movie then I strongly suggest you see Groundhog Day! This is truly a special movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Well, it's Groundhog Day?again?" Harold Ramis' existential romantic comedy/fantasy begs the question, "What could/would/should you do if you had an eternity to do it?" Bill Murray's character tries just about everything, only to find fulfillment in making every moment count. He plays Phil Connors, a weatherman who finds himself caught in a time warp, where he relives the same day over and over again. In a sense, Groundhog Day is the opposite of those movies premised on a character who has lost his/her long term memory (e.g., Memento, 50 First Dates). In those movies, the main character is unable to remember anything that happens from day to day, while everyone and everything else persists as usual. In Groundhog Day, Phil's memory?more specifically, his mental memory?and only his memory?persists from day to day, while the memories of everyone else and the "memory" of the physical world?including that portion of it that Phil's body occupies?are reset every morning at precisely 6:00 A.M. So, he is able to pig out on donuts without gaining weight, commit crimes without serving long-term sentences, and commit suicide without losing his life. No matter what he does or what happens to him during each day, he wakes up in the same physical condition in the same bed in the same bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania, where he is stranded by a blizzard and expected to report on the findings of Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog who predicts the weather with his shadow. At the outset, Phil Connors is a shadow of the man he could be: successful and intelligent, but cynical, self-centered, inconsiderate, and nearly anti-social. He is ahead of himself, using the people and events of the moment as stepping stones to a better potential future that he views as being more worthy of himself. His repetitive predicament forces him to be alive in the moment, because the future is out of his reach. At first, he is simply unnerved by his situation, but as time goes on (or continues not to) he discovers the advantages he can gain by acquiring knowledge, while the people in his world leave each Groundhog Day behind. He robs a bank truck by being able to predict the precise moment when a guard loses focus. He learns the details and preferences of the women in his world so that he can successfully woo them. He starts out as the guy every guy wants to be: egotistical, insensitive, and able to breeze by on blind ambition. His gradual omniscience enables him to trick his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell) into falling for him, but to make it stick, he will eventually have to use his unlimited time to become the man every woman wants?the man he knows Rita deserves. Danny Rubin's script does a brilliant job of exploring the strange specificity of a human moment. So, although Phil can use his knowledge of the day to reliably change certain events for the better (like breaking a boy's fall from a tree or saving a man from choking), other events (like the death of the homeless man) are unalterably overpowered by fate, and others (like that first moment when Rita genuinely falls for him) can't be recreated, despite hundreds, perhaps thousands of attempts. Murray's acting performance is remarkable both for the entertainment value it confers and the difficult challenges it handily overcomes. Not only does he have to act a version of a scene as if it had never happened before, but then he has to act another version of that same scene as if he is acting (to Rita) as if he hadn't been there before, with a subtle wink to us that reminds us that he had. Andie MacDowell's acting challenge is slightly different, but just as formidable, and her performance is just as remarkable. She has to act each version of a scene as if she had never been there before, but with slight variations depending on how genuine Phil's advances come off and how much he has told her (and how much she believes) about his situation. Harold Ramis can probably be credited for allowing the material enough wiggle room to examine various facets of time and existence, without ever letting it foray into irreversible darkness. Groundhog Day is light, clever, touching, and funny throughout. In fact, it's so good, you'll want to relive it again and again and again and again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day is one of those films you either love or hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No in between, no take it or leave it. Everyone has an opinion, and surprisingly they all appear to be valid. I fall on the "love it" side of the equation, but I am a huge Bill Murray fan. Everyone knows a Bill Murray, the guy who wants to do something just wrong enough to get him fired and just right enough to be fun. Bill's character in this film is at the stage in his life where he is totally focused on advancing his career, regardless of what happens to those around him, which is why he cannot advance his career. Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman is resolved to his role in life, observing the lives of others and getting his paycheck at the end of the day. Maybe Chris wanted to try a straight role for once, maybe there was only room for one comedian in the film, but Chris actually contributes little to the film. Andie MacDowell is the naive, wide eyed beginning producer who really doesn't care about her job as much as she cares about her own agenda. Only in her case, she isn't willing to step over or on people to get where she needs to be in life. Personally I like this film because it is an exhaustive study on the transition of a man through circumstance from an ass to a man. Rated PG for a couple of sexual situations and some violence, I'd say the teens would not be offended, but I doubt they will get it. Collectible if you like Murray, or just like an interesting play on Karma.</fullReview>

He plays the role with perfection with his sarcastic humour being the highlight.The plot is simple yet so enjoyable. His actions during the film makes you think that is just what you would do in the same situation. Timing of each scene is spot on with no time wasting. Top scenes/characters include - good old Ned Ryerson, "if you want to get ahead of the weather" &amp; his fantastic news report.A must see for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some of Bill Murray films including "What About Bob" and "Ghostbusters" were surprisingly good, this is by far the best Bill Murray film and the best Harold Ramis feature film in the history that has a beautiful mix of comedy, romance, and character study. The story is very original and it's concept about Phil trying to get back to Groundhog Day while it's being repeated over and over again is excellent in every level. The characters are great including Phil and Rita and I liked the relationships between Phil and all of the other people in Pittsburg and the acting is flawless. The comedic moments with the characters are hilarious and unforgettable and the romance between Phil and Rita is great. The music score from George Fenton and the songs "Pennsylvania Polka", "I've Got You, Babe", "Almost Like Feeling In Love" and "Weather Man" were memorable.Groundhog Day is not only one of the best films of all time, but to die hard fans of Bill Murray that came out in February 2 in Groundhog Day and it's on the same day as my birthday. Thumbs up from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex, endearing movie; more than just "high concept" comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like "Groundhog Day" for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that it's the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings. Bill Murray makes the most of a weighty role as Phil Connors, egocentric, wise ass weatherman who travels to the Pennsylvania community of Punsxutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A blizzard confines him to the town - a blizzard he failed to predict accurately - and while there he realizes he's trapped in a time loop; Groundhog Day repeats itself over and over, to the point where Phil becomes aware of practically every event that will occur. By turns, Phil is both ecstatic - if there's no tomorrow, he doesn't have to worry about the consequences of his actions, and he engages in some great comic bits of recklessness - and despondent, when his attempts to use his knowledge for self gain go awry. Only after some efforts to come to grips with the course of events does he realize the power of any human being's thoughts and actions, as he has the ability to be there for other people and even save their lives. Murray is great, whether he's being introspective, rascally / charming, or saddened. Andie MacDowell provides an appealing love interest as Rita, the terminally chipper producer to whom he realizes he's becoming attracted. A supporting cast of familiar faces also helps: Chris Elliott as the cameraman, Stephen Tobolowsky (in his best known role) as aggressive insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, Bill's older brother Brian Doyle- Murray as "groundhog honcho" Buster Green, comedians Rick Ducommun and Rick Overton as scruffy locals, Robin Duke as the diner waitress, and, in his film debut, a young Michael Shannon as a guy getting married. Director / co-writer Harold Ramis, making a cameo as a local neurologist, keeps things headed in clever directions (it's a delicious bit of dark comedy when Phil tries various means of suicide in his attempts to end the cycle), always successfully alternating between the laughs and the more touching elements. In fact, "Groundhog Day" is simply very sweet as Phil develops more of an interest in an old homeless man's welfare and becomes increasingly attached to Rita. And George Fenton's music always hits just the right notes for any given scene. In short, it's one of the star's best ever vehicles and a consistently entertaining movie worth revisiting. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nature of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time is nothing more than that: one day after one day after another. The only thing that tells us we are not living the &gt;same&lt; day once and again is the fact that we preserve our memories. To make use of time passing is one great advantage the human race has. This movie helps to understand this concept and the nature of time itself.A man who lives the same day, time and again, who has no consequences of his actions, who is trapped in time with no way out. He wishes he would be trapped in a different day, a day he would love to repeat once and again, but no, he is trapped in a common day, surrounded of people he barely cares about. He tries everything, even suicide. He also tries robbery, without fearing any consequences of his acts. He becomes extremely bored.He feels totally unhappy... until he accepts the situation and decides to try something different. He starts doing things he's not used to, he suddenly wants to learn to play the piano, avoid other people's accidents, gain the heart of a woman he first didn't care about at all, but whom he got to know until he finally fell in love with.It is this transformation and this love what pull him through time.The same day repeats over and over, until he lives a perfect day. And even though it is only a few hours he has until the end of the day, he actually got everybody to love him, the woman he loves gives him all her admiration and respect, he makes lots of friends and he uses the time in such a productive way that it is almost impossible to believe one person can achieve so much in "just one day"... He has become one superior man, he has transcended time.Only then he breaks the spell of time and time passes. He is no longer trapped in time, but he has learned to live now, from being an asshole he is now a great human being.But is this not the actual nature of time as we know it? Is it not actually the same thing as in the movie? It is up to each individual what he/she decides to do with his/her time on Earth, but life could actually be something beautiful, regardless of any personal circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch this film every year, on 2nd February if I remember, in homage to the concept of life repeating itself. Others have paid tribute to the wonderful performances of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, but everything that happens is worth watching over and over again. It never becomes stale because there is some basic existential truth in Groundhog Day. It's also a puzzle that is never solved.Recently, I heard on a TV documentary (I can't remember what it was about) that 2nd February is Candlemas, an ancient festival linked to folk tradition as well as a religious festival. Traditionally, on this date, animals which hibernate such as bears and wolves will come out and inspect the weather. If they see fine weather, they anticipate that harsh winter weather will continue for another 40 days, and they return to their hibernation. I feel that the choice of Groundhog Day as the day on which Phil experiences being trapped in the winter world of Punxsatawney is meaningful for this reason as well as what happens to the main character.Overall, it's a very hopeful story, with a wonderful ending, and I will never grow tired of watching it every year.For everyone except Phil, that day is a brand new 24 hours, and everything happens once. Phil experiences the day repeatedly, so he can learn something each time. The others meet him anew, or on Rita's case, have only 1 day to get to know him better. Still, by the end he has learnt how to maximise the impact of his interactions because he only has that day in which to do it. Another thing that occurred to me recently is poignant: his Bed and Breakfast establishment is homely but doesn't have hot showers! The day on which Phil is stuck is one on which he must take a cold shower - every day. That's purgatory, by my reckoning.Update: I watch this film every year on 2nd February, or as close as possible. This year I was impressed again by Bill Murray's wonderful performance, the cheerfulness of all the characters and the life-affirming message of the film. I was also surprised when I awoke on 3rd February to see that it had snowed overnight (in London, UK), and therefore I think the weather was telling me that it was indeed the day after Groundhog Day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A weather man is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting "rat" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realisation that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing Every day. This Movie Is A Classic. One Of My Favourites Of The 90's &amp; I Have Seen This Movie So Much &amp; I Am Still Trying To Find Out How Long He Was In "Groundhog Day"...My Assumption...Maybe 34 Days Because Thats All We See So He Spent A Month In The Same Day I Don't Agree With The Whole "10 Years" Thing. The Song "I Got You Babe" Becomes Annoying With This Movie. If You Want Me To Pick Flaws In This Movie I'm Sorry There Is A 1 000 Word Limit So I Can't. The Character Development Of Phil Is One Of The Best Parts Of This Movie &amp; I Love How In One "Groundhog Day" He Meets That Ned Character Who Annoys The Hell Outta Anyone &amp; Hugs Him &amp; Says "I Have Missed You So Much" The First Time I Saw That I Was Killing Myself Laughing...Then I Woke Up In My Bed &amp; Relived That Day...Just Kidding But I Was Killing Myself Laughing.

		<fullReview>What happens when one day repeats itself until eternity? When there is no way to escape this vicious circle? Exactly, This is what "Groundhog Day" movie shows, and it shows it in an impeccable manner.Phil Conners(Bill Murray) is a weather reporter, who is being sent for the last 4 years to cover this "Groundhog Day", and Phil doesn't like this. Actually, he is so frustrated with this that he doesn't want to stay even a second longer in that place. But due to Blizzard, he has to stop and stay over night. Next day he wakes up at 6.00 am to find the same thing played in radio again, same things happen what happened yesterday, and today its the same "Groundhog Day". Next day, its again the groundhog day, and again, and again, and again... Initially frustrated, then turning into maniac, then slowly into a charmer, then again into a super duper maniac, then into a great guy, and then falling in love. This is the story of how a man changes in dire circumstances from scumbag into a Champion.This movie is fresh, and funny, and whatever else you want, its in there. Go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Funny Over and Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you ask someone to think of a Bill Murray movie, Groundhog Day is usually the answer they give. The other half will say Ghostbusters. This is the kind of a role that one is born to play. Murray plays the character of Phil Conners and does it better than a real Phil Conners would have. His comedic talents are highly honed in this performance and he is working near the top of his game. It is so important to be inside a Phil Conner's head in this movie due to the repetitive nature of the movie. Murray is consistent, funny and just melds with the story line.The story line is pretty basic. Phil Conners is a weatherman on assignment to cover Groundhog Day. He doesn't seem to be a nice man nor does he like his job very much. He mis-predicts the weather and end up getting stuck in Puncsutawney, PA where an annual Groundhog Day event is held putting the whole town on hold. Upon awakening the next morning in Puncsutawney the following day he discovers that it is Groundhog Day all over again. There is a great scene when Murray dresses as a cowboy with a date that is classic; and the way he is able to handle the Brink's guards is also very humorous.Also fun to watch in the movie is the talented Andie MacDowell whose character of Rita is completely unaware that it is the same day for Phil. She tries to understand. Less understanding is Phil's cameraman played by David Letterman funny man Chris Elliot who gives his usual spot on dufus performance. The man who will always be synonymous with the film is Stephen Tobolowsky who plays the knee-slapping funny Ned Ryerson. The scenes, few as they are, with Bill Murray are comedy at its finest and also very Bill Murray. Written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis (Murray's co-star in Ghostbusters), this film was almost an experiment to see if Hollywood would let them make a movie in which the characters relive the same day over and over again. There have even been analysis papers written about time travel and how Phill Conners reacts in his environment so as to allow the same actions to take place again the next day. The film really found a cult like following when the replay rights were purchased by Turner Broadcasting and the movie received so much repeat airplay on TBS that some viewers thought they were in the actual movie. Ramis is to be commended for keeping all the scenes and continuity straight even with so many Hollywood tricks he could have chosen to use. This movie has turned out to be an important film of the 1990s. 8/10** The poster for the film is a little too cutesy and I never thought of this film as cutesy or talking down to the audience. Of course what does it is the addition of MacDowell on the poster. It must have been in her contract.</fullReview>

Reliving each day over and over again leads to some brilliant comic set-pieces. However, its the gradual change in Murray's character and his cheerful acceptance of things which makes this film a perennial favorite of mine. There are plenty of laughs but mostly in the first hour, after which the tone changes slightly. The supporting cast are all fine and Andie Macdowell is good as the leading lady.

(Trick question - the answer is "One".) The endless playing out, like variations on a theme, take us and the character far from the starting point. There are Faustian parallels here. Faust was not free until he was able to say "Stay for thou art fair",just as Groundhog day will recur until the errant weatherman realises that this day is perfect (better than that day in the Bahamas that he would have originally preferred.)And how refreshing it is not to have some glib "explanation" offered as to why this happened. See this movie, enjoy and then contemplate how much nicer a person your local TV weatherman would be if he spent an eternity in Punxsatawney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really know what to expect out of Groundhog Day, to be honest I'm not really a Bill Murray fan. Him carrying a film is not too promising to me, but I'm starting to doubt that since I've been enjoying his films more and more lately. Groundhog Day is brought up in my film books and my mom said that it was a very cute movie that I might wanna check out. When I saw the excellent rating on IMDb, I got even more excited. So I figured I would rent it and give it a shot, though I got a little scared when I read what the plot was about, it seemed a little silly, but when I watched this film this morning, it surprisingly worked! Phil is a weatherman who is sent to Pennsylvania to cover the story for groundhog day with a beautiful woman, Rita who he's had a crush on for a long time. But he's always been too cocky and self centered in her opinion. When the groundhog's shadow shows, there are going to be six more weeks of winter and Phil then experiences something strange. He is reliving February 2 over and over again, but he can remember what happened the day before, so he uses it to his advantage at first. But he starts to realize maybe he could do some good in the world before worrying about getting Rita.Groundhog Day is one of those films that is very charming and the story is really cute. I loved Phil's character, how he changed and transformed himself throughout the film. He went from being a conceited jerk to a lovable guy that wins the audience. It's cheesy, I know, but it's always a plot that wins my heart. The ending was perfect, this movie was just a lot of fun to watch and I would highly recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

If you need a movie to make your day better, this is the one to watch. I am going to make it a point to watch this film every Groundhog Day from now on.One thing that I always wondered when watching this film was how long Phil actually repeats the same day. By the end of the movie he is a classical pianist, physician, ice sculptor, etc... When watching the DVD extras you find out that in the original screenplay Phil repeats the same day over 1000 years! When you think about that it adds even more to the movie and why he eventually tries to kill himself because of the sheer boredom.This movie is my favorite comedy and one of my favorite movies of all times.

		<shortDescription>What a delightful rendering of Hindu philosophy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hindu philosophy, reincarnation supposes that life is a cycle of birth, death, and re-birth ... which continues over and over until the soul finally reaches the state known as Nirvana. In theory, the soul attempts to improve upon itself with each re-birth ... and eventually becomes an "old soul" (many reincarnations) just before Nirvana is attained.In the case of this movie, the cycle is confined to a single day. And the improvements Phil Connors (Bill Murray) makes with each cycle are slow but sure. He transforms himself from being self-centered and egotistical to being life-centered and compassionate. Quite a transformation for a single day ... but it helped that he could repeat the day until he got it right. And during the time between his challenges to this cycle and the time he "accepts" the cycle as his lot in life, the transformation occurs.By the way, here's a trivial tidbit with a little mystery. In "Groundhog Day," one of Connors' first encounters is with a character called Ned Ryerson - someone who grew up and went to school with Connors (but that Connors has forgotten about). Bill Murray was a good friend and colleague of comedian, John Belushi. When John died, he was buried in a Martha's Vineyard graveyard (Massachusetts). Murray has been to the gravesite ... and, the grave next to Belushi has a tombstone for its occupant -- Ned Ryerson.Screenplay writer, Danny Rubin, swears he didn't know this ... that he just "thought up the name," thinking that another actor, Ned Beatty, would be ideal for the role. He's never been to the gravesite, either. Perhaps Rubin did just "think up" the name as he says and it's just a cosmic coincidence. Or perhaps, he was able to tap into Murray's stream of consciousness (another Hindu possibility) and took the name Ned Ryerson from that stream. I guess we'll never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie about endless other chances to get it right. Phil (not the groundhog) doesn't start out at the bottom of the barrel of humanity- he could have forced his way with Rita, but he never tried that. No, Phil the weatherman is a somewhat average schmoo out for himself- not bad, just not connected. At least not yet.The premise of this much-deeper-than-it-seems film is that, whether or not we get "do overs", it's not about us, it's about Us.Music and ice sculpture and grace and love await. Here's hoping we all someday get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, deeply moving and original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder what Bill Murray made of this script when it landed on his doorstep. Surely it was going to be a winner as the Murray/Ramis partnership had been one that had bared fruit on a number of occasions already with titles such as Caddyshack, stripes and Ghostbusters all lodged firmly in the minds of movie goers as classic Murray fests. However, I sincerely doubt that he could have ever envisioned the success and popularity that this tale of a local weatherman reliving the same day over and over would go on to achieve at the box office and with fans alike. Murray is the best in the business at world weary cynicism and Phil Connors trial by time is at heart a simple story of a man forced to realise that in a place where nothing changes but himself that this is the only difference that truly matters. The Director Ramis claims to have received letters from people of all religions who have seen this movie and understand the message as one of their own following. In essence this is much more than a simple comedy and as Connors himself reminds us not to underestimate the significance of Groundhog Day.However I would never like to deter anyone from seeing this film on the basis that it may be too convoluted in its message. Every scene is packed with hilarious antics and typically astute Murray one liners. The film is brilliantly cast and Andie Macdowells's innocence and integrity provide a useful contrast to Murray's downbeat yet brilliant humour. She represents the ultimate female companion for Connors and gives the film its real heart as she is the person to which he attains to. There's something quite tragic about reaching out to someone and never being able to have that affection returned. The idea of human loneliness was dealt with great elegance in arguably Murray's finest work 'Lost in Translation' but the comic element of Groundhog Day does not detract from the similar pathos we feel for his isolation in a world where he can touch but never change. This movie has something for everyone. If you're after a deep message, a great love story or are just looking to laugh your ass off then this will be a winner on all fronts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bill Murray guide to Buddhism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the closest thing to a modern Frank Capra movie, Harold Ramis' "Groundhog Day" sees actor Bill Murray playing Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who finds himself trapped in the small town of Punxsutawney, repeating the same day over and over again. Why Connors is forced to relive the same day isn't explained, but it is made clear that Connors was trapped in a cycle of repetition even before his never-ending day began. Projecting nothing but facile sarcasm, ironic self-awareness and aloof detachment, Connors is a thoroughly postmodern man, his life long filled with what he perceives to be pointless and mindless routine. But Connors is not a pessimist or self-centred, so much as he is super-aware, perpetually dejected and world-weary. For Connors, every day offers only what philosopher Francois Cusset called the "dead end of postmodernity". Enchantment is thoroughly dead and everything that will happen has already happened.When Connors wakes up to find that today is, and always will be, yesterday, he is forced into violently confronting the fact that postmodernism conceives of contemporary life as a spectacle before which the individual always sits powerless, and within which questions of the real are always problematized. To the postmodern subject, there is nowhere else, no other time or place, the subject a ghost-viewer in a movie that plays regardless of his volition.At first Connors uses this opportunity to engage in pranks, hedonism and deceit, concocting schemes to amass money and bed a beautiful woman, played by Andie McDowell, but gradually these games start to lose their appeal. After learning that all the material and sexual gratifications in the world are not spiritually sustaining, Connors grows suicidal. He takes his life several times, but still the curse continues. From here on the plot becomes a mixture of the myth of Sisyphus and Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" (Bill Murray is essentially Ebenezer Scrooge), with a little Camus and Nietczhe thrown in. The film's existential avenues are best hinted at by a poem (The Lay of the Last Minstrel) by Sir Walter Scott, an excerpt of which Andie McDowell recites to Connors in a diner: "Despite those titles, power, and pelf, The wretch, concentrated all in self, Living shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down, To the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung."And so gradually Connors relinquishes the Self. Of course contemporary neuroscience has now thoroughly undermined the notion of a Sovereign Self, but director Harold Ramis is a Buddhist, and Buddhism has long denied the existence of a metaphysical self. Buddhist's call this "Anatta", or "not self", in which it is taught that all things perceived by the senses are not really "I" or "mine", and in which a line is drawn from the problem of personal identity to moral responsibility.A thoroughly changed man, Connors thus now begins to live each day to the fullest. No longer obsessed with "moving on" or possessing Andie McDowell, he instead helps everyone, acts selflessly, without ego (paradoxically an egotistical, if not impossible act) and uses whatever spare time he has to engage in various artistic and intellectual refinements (piano, ice sculpting, poetry etc). To his co-workers, Connors now seems like a radically different person. He seems reborn. Unsurprisingly, at this moment of transformation, the temporal curse is broken and tomorrow finally comes, though Connors now refuses to move on and instead opts to stay in Punxsutawney."Connors's transformation (which resembles the Buddhist Samsara cycle) goes against almost everything postmodernity teaches," author Jonah Goldberg says. Connors doesn't find paradise or liberation by becoming more "authentic" or "individual", but by doing exactly the opposite. "He learns to appreciate the crowd," Goldberg says, "the community, even the bourgeois hicks and their values?[?]?and most of all by shedding his ironic detachment from the world." Unsurprisingly radical economists view the film in different lights - man trapped in an sociocultural dead end unless he relinquishes greed, profit and egomania - but such readings are byproducts, rather than intended.The film is regarded as a family classic in the US, Canada and UK, and is routinely played around Christmas time, embraced by middle-class folk the same way Frank Capra's sentimental morality tales gradually became inextricable from the whole codified "spirit of Christmas" and "national image and values". The film has a spiritual resonance, all denominations able to read what they wish into it, but its actor Bill Murray's trademark humour ? aloof, sarcastic and detached ? that really sells things. Audiences today don't buy the aww shucks performances of Capra's everyman (often Jimmy Stewart) heroes. Bill Murray's meta-detachment, however, they relate to in spades. 8.9/10 ? While some may have liked a darker, creepier take on the story (Ramis and Murray had a falling out because the star wanted to take the story into darker territory - think about it, what would you get up to if there were no consequences to your actions?), "Groundhog Day" is nevertheless a charming family film, and there aren't many of those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if there was no tomorrow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, I wrote a review of 'Groundhog Day' when I was in college, back in 1993, for 'The College Voice' at Glendale Community College in Arizona. I have yet to dig up my published review, so I am going to do this review off a recent viewing on Groundhog Day 2009. What a wonderful movie, dare I say a comedic masterpiece? (Okay, I will, and damned if I will be criticized, but it is still my opinion. Still on top-ten best comedies. So, there.) I believe I have it 5/5 stars back then, and still do. This movie still holds up extremely well, 16 years after originally released. The comedy is still dead on, the emotion and the romantic scenes are also spot on. All the lines were hilarious: "What if there was no tomorrow? There wasn't one today!" "That sums it up for me" (and does for me, too, unfortunately) and the long "I am a god. I'm not thee God" scene was masterful. I love how they never explain how it happens, they just allow the repeated day happen multiple times (no actual count, another great aspect) and have Bill Murray's Phil learn how to be a decent individual. Absolutely holds true, even if were made today. Only difference if it were made today: everyone would have cell phones. And even then, they would play it off as if the cell tower was damaged in the storm. Funny story: after watching the movie again on 2/2/09, I came into work on Tuesday the 3rd, and asked my boss to make sure it was 2/3 and he said it was. I was extremely happy not to have to live the extremely busy (day-after-Super Bowl, 25% work-force call in sick) Monday over and over. It would have been a nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sounds obsessive but there is something about this movie. I guess one enjoys living in it for a while. It's probably my favorite. The characters are rich, and the message is great. Disappointing to find out Rubin, according to Ramis, is Zen Buddhist because it so affirms the values in Christianity. We even used it as a backbone for a bible study in my church's middle school class.How many Christians have felt they were in a twilight zone experience waiting to progress, while having to undergo tests that improve character? The movie shows that. Sometimes works are larger than their creators - because no matter what Rubin believes, the movie does refer to God when Phil looks up to the sky after poring over the dead man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy classic that's always watchable - 93%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody knows this film. Most people have seen it at least once before and the film has become a part of modern culture. It's also the reason you'll never hear Sonny &amp; Cher on breakfast radio any more. It is rightly regarded as a classic, easily the best thing Bill Murray has ever been in and probably the only thing Andie MacDowell will be remembered for except those annoying hair-colouring commercials. If, by some unfortunate mishap, you've missed "Groundhog Day" in the past twelve years then immediately rectify the situation and seek yourself a copy. And may I just say welcome back from your coma.Murray plays Phil Conners, as smug an arsehole as you can imagine. He's sarcastic, bitter and a TV weatherman sent to Punxsatawney in Pennslyvania to cover Groundhog Day, a curious festival revolving around a weather-predicting groundhog. To Phil, this feels like the worst day of his life. Trapped by a blizzard in a small town with his attractive but cold producer Rita (MacDowell) and nerdy cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott), Phil gets the job done and returns to his hotel in the hope that he can go home tomorrow. Only, tomorrow never comes and Phil finds himself trapped in a time-loop, forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over again.I know, it sounds stupid on paper but this is Bill Murray at his absolute finest. Cracking one-liners and a face like a bloodhound, Murray carries this movie with ease as he draws scorn and sympathy from the viewer. Rarely does a comedy engage you emotionally but the more desperate he becomes to end his nightmare, the more pity you feel for him. MacDowell offers us a small reminder that she can act but because Murray is the film, she doesn't really get much of a look-in. It's amazing how much comic potential there is in this bizarre set-up and Murray and director Harold Ramis wring every last bit of it out, from Conners learning to play piano to kidnapping the groundhog in an attempt to free himself from his predicament. After all, what would you do if today had no consequences? I had a really hard time deciding if this was a ten-star film or not. It is still a very funny film and it has all the things a good comedy should have - a superstar lead, superb gags and a warm, fuzzy romantic side for the ladies (I'm joking - sarcasm doesn't work that well when typed, does it?). The only issue you could have with this picture is the overly-sugary ending but that hardly ruins the movie. In the end, I decided that this is one of the best films I have seen because I'd happily watch it again, it appeals to almost any viewer and it is one of the best comedies made in my lifetime. Murray will rarely be as good as he is here and MacDowell's legacy hangs solely on this film. Watch this film and watch it again. Just don't put on the radio, OK?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, a egocentric weatherman whose life is in a constant loop in which he continuously repeats the same day, over and over. While the experiences he has in these loops are hilarious, ultimately, its a movie of redemption that will make it one to endure for the ages. Written by Danny Rubin, the film has been prescribed by psychiatrists to their patients and has been the source of essays on the fundamental tenets of many major religions. I found an interview recently with Danny Rubin where he talks about how the film grew into the remarkably famous film it is today, and just had to re-watch it.

		<fullReview>GROUNDHOG DAY is a masterpiece that has been often imitated, but never equaled. Bill Murray in his prime plays a cocky and horribly bored weatherman who travels to the tiny town of Punxsatawney, Pa., for Groundhog Day and finds himself stuck there on the same day over and over again. At first, he makes a game of it, then he tries killing himself, and finally comes around to realizing he's been given a second chance. You've seen the plot before, but never so well done. Andie MacDowell, also in her prime, costars as Murray's love interest. The writer (Dan Rubin) and director (longtime Murray cohort and GHOSTBUSTERS costar Harold Ramis) really outdo themselves with this clever film. This is the first film I have ever given a 10 to. It is well-deserved.</fullReview>

Who would have thought that Harold Ramis, crown prince of the slob comedy, and Bill Murray, an actor whose specialty is looking disinterested, would combine to create a work of this caliber? "Groundhog Day" eschews cheap laughs and throwaway gags for something much richer, deeper and more sophisticated. The idea of someone living the same day over and over again, until he finally gets it right, is absolutely ingenious. The transformation of this character in the process is a revelation and a joy to watch. "Groundhog Day" is truly sublime, one of the best motion picture comedies ever.</fullReview>

No...I have watched at least 100 times and I do not exaggerate at all. I am still watching it on DVD of course with any friend who haven't seen it and they love it also.I like every scene I like the wit, homour, story, dialouges, romance and the message.My favourate scene is the hip hop restaurant where Connor discloses that He is A God and wants Rita to believe in Him. Well He knows everything, everybody in town and correctly predicts whats gonna come next.And many other scenes of course. I have become also a Bill Murray fun after the movie but nothing he did achieved the same passion in me.I did not know through all these years that I have been watching the Gorundhog Day over and over again, that the movie has become a shocking hit among the public as opposed to Oscar elite, and I am so happy that it has been underrated by the pundits but embraced by the real DVD watchers.What is left to us is to thank Bill Murray and the Director Harold Ramis for the great job that they did and I hope regardless of the fact that they have not won any significant establishment awards they are happy now...with being over-over and over rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd been wanting to watch Groundhog Day for some time, but it was only when I ordered the Blu-Ray version a couple of days ago that I could finally sit down and watch the bloody film. I'd heard a lot of stuff about it, I had seen a couple of scenes in cable (never managed to finish the movie for a diversity of reasons), but I'd never seen the movie.Well, now I have. And I definitely don't regret the experience.It's no mystery that Bill Murray is one of the most gifted comedians... no, wait, scratch that, gifted actors in modern cinema. He is funny in a way that one doesn't realize he is actually being funny until you listen to what he is saying. He doesn't depend on wacky mannerisms or profanity in order to make audiences laugh; it's his matter-of-factly delivery of lines and the actual lines that he says that make him so funny. Most comedies he's done are pretty great - including, of course, Groundhog Day -, and even some of the mediocre films he's done get elevated by his presence.Now, Groundhog Day has a complicated premise, but it deals with it in a very simple, straightforward manner that nevertheless makes one think, laugh and admire what the filmmakers are conveying. Weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It's February the 2nd. And it's Groundhog Day - a day he hates so much, he only comes to the Pennsylavian town to do his work and leave immediately before he kills himself. This day is different, though, much to his concern - time has seemed to stop, and he's reliving this same dreaded day over and over again, indefinitely. He's definitely not crazy, but how can he tell anyone, even his co-workers Rita (Andie McDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) about his current situation? The thing about Groundhog Day is that it's got a really smart premise and that it doesn't mess with it. Although it avoids many potentially-grim possibilities, it nevertheless explores a lot of things Phil could do with his new powers - memorize everything that happens in town, kill himself and doing illegal stuff without suffering the consequences, trying to conquer Rita's love, and many more. I liked the movie because it's both smart and funny, and the humour it provides with is intelligent enough and diverse enough for all audiences to enjoy the film. There's no place for bathroom jokes and profanity in this movie - in fact, this is one film that proves comedies don't have to be R-rated in order to be hilarious.I also like that it doesn't provide with any explanations for Phil's predicament - after all, this is a comedy, and since we see everything from Phil's point of view and he doesn't really have a way of learning the reason for the time loop, then the audience doesn't have to know it either. Instead of focusing on the scientific aspect of the story, the movie provides with something more humane, something more basic. It deals with romance, comedy, everyday-situations being repeated - in subtly different ways - over and over again and, of course, the redemption of Murray's character, who starts the movie as a total creep and ends it as a wiser, gentler man. My God, i's almost as if he's learned a lesson! Does saying that he earns Rita's heart constitute as a spoiler? I don't think so. I believe the viewer actually expects this to happen, and is simply waiting to see how it will happen.Groundhog Day is a masterwork, not only because it delights on a technical level, but also because it's one of those few comedies that manages to touch tickle the funny bone and touch the heart. It isn't formulaic by any means - although it does fulfill some expectations most members of the audience might have - and, despite being a little longer than most comedies, it never feels tiresome or overlong. Considering most comedies nowadays are either boring retreads or R-rated endeavors (which are really funny on their own right - see Tropic Thunder or Pineapple Express) that can't be enjoyed by the whole family, it's always a good idea to watch such a clean, fun and particularly smart movie like Groundhog Day.</fullReview>

It proves one thing, writing a good story is what makes a good movie period, adding graphic violence, sex, swearing and huge explosions and stunts with tons of computer effects are all over done today, all we want is a good story that takes us through the movie and makes us feel good at the end.

I mean I get that not many are going to love this review and no film has ever been loved by everyone but I honestly don't understand the colt following of this.The filmed looked aged even for its time. The acting seemed to be half delivered. The cinematography was very basic and the soundtrack a lot of the time didn't match the scenes. I found myself watching it all only to not offend my dad. The character development of Phil (Bill Murray) was verybpredicable and the love connection seemed to forget that this was over the course of one day plus I don't think that Rita's (Andie MacDowell)character from the start was very much like what she was come the end which doesn't make sense in this particular scenario.However I did enjoy the insanity and suicide montage it was by far the funniest part.

		<shortDescription>A brilliant idea for a movie - executed very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phil is a bitter, egocentric weatherman who treats his co-workers and the public in general with sarcastic contempt. He joylessly travels to the remote town of Punxsutawney to carry out an annual assignment that he particularly dislikes - the Groundhog Day. While here, he inexplicably he wakes every morning thereafter to live the same day over and over again but with the freewill to act it out newly as he sees fit. In reliving the same day he moves from exploiting his unique position in order to use people to his advantage and onto a position where he begins to care more about these people and acts like a less self-centred individual.Groundhog Day is pretty clearly a high concept movie, i.e. a film whose premise you could describe in one sentence. Consequently, high concept movies don't tend to have the best of reputations as great cinema. But, it has to be said, that Groundhog Day is a very good example of a film that makes the most of a very straightforward premise. The format is deceptively simple but it allows for a lot of scope for lots of comedy as well as some well observed pathos. Such a simple idea but such a brilliant one. But what makes it hit an even higher level is the performance of Bill Murray in the central role. This is essentially a vehicle for his brand of acerbic comedy and its hard thinking of anyone else playing his part, he is so well suited to it and so effortless at playing it. It's certainly rare for a film to remain so funny after a couple of decades and the best bits of this one are still highly amusing but it also has a good deal of wisdom too. It maybe sometimes overplays the sentimentality in its final third but it can be forgiven for this on account of the many things it gets right elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bill Murray's best movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a morality piece done in the vein of a classic Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode. I kind of "what if...?" sort of tale that puts a generally successful and selfish man (played by Murray) into a hopeless situation of never being able to escape a single day in a small town. On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over. However the further you go into the movie you get some true and believable character development. The fact Bill pulls it off convincingly as well as with his classic entertaining wit is what makes the movie shine.Don't think of the movie as just some lesson to learn and take with you. While it does have that they don't preach it to you. You figure the lessons out along with Phil (Murray), and that makes for a rather deep experience. The movie at its core is a comedy, and it's such a good comedy it's rating among the top comedies of all time by various film associations. It's not just a comedy either as it also has a healthy dose of romance in it. So much romance that it can pass off as a "chick flick" for those who are into that. So I guess you can say Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy/Twilight-Zonesque/morality play.Groundhog Day is a truly great film and it works on many levels, as a black comedy, a love story, and a spiritual journey. It's one of those rare films that you can watch over and over and still feel it's impact. Bill Murray deserved an Oscar for his performance and the supporting cast were totally solid too. I defy anyone to see the Ned Ryerson character (needle nose Ned, Ned the head) and not feel the urge to damage him in some way ha-ha. Bravo to Bill Murray and also to Harold Ramis for his excellent directing of a highly original film! Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell star in this delightful Harold Ramis romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell star in this delightful Harold Ramis romantic comedy. Murray plays Phil, an egotistical and shallow TV weatherman presenter, sent to report on Groundhog Day with Rita (MacDowell) as the producer, and cameraman, Larry (Chris Elliott).Stranded by an unexpected blizzard, Phil wakes up each morning to the same day, over and over. Phil sees this as an opportunity to enjoy himself at the expense of those around him, but as he becomes aware of his growing affection for Rita , and her dislike of him, he grows to understand that there is much more to life than the superficiality of his earlier shallow existence. In doing so, he changes into a much warmer and kinder individual, and finds life treating him very differently, now that he is behaving to others differently.It's a fairy-tale of sorts. Beautifully played by both leads, it's full of charm. However, at it's core is a delicious performance by Murray finding nuance and humour in almost every line. The gradual transformation is well served by an intelligent script, ensuring that repeating scenes always have something fresh to offer. It's a serious comedy. Murray's dramatic depth is required too, particularly in scenes with an old man. Murray's comic abilities were never to be doubted, but here he does much more than make us laugh. It's possibly his finest ever performance.It's a film full of hope for all of us, and it deals with some of the biggest issues. A lovely film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go With The Flow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray and His Friend, Director Harold Ramis Team Up again in this Endearing, Enduring Comedy that has only Gained in Reputation over the Years. With Gross-Out Teen Comedies making Tons of Money this one remained Mostly Ignored on its Initial Release not causing much of a stir.It was Just too Cerebral and Subtle to make much of an impact. It did Make Money and Received some Good Reviews but it was mostly Forgotten. But Year after Year it kept getting Talked About and eventually Gained a Cult then Broke into Sacred Ground as one of the Best Comedies Ever and is Considered so to this Day.It definitely has a Personal Baggage Thing going, a lot will Depend on what the Viewer brings... the Expectations. It Thinks More than most, and delivers its Message with a sort of Zen Experience. There is Little Slapstick and the Jokes are Not Side Splitting, but along with the Warm and Uplifting Story there are Slaps, and it Splits the Space Time Continuum for a Lesson in Life for a former Cynic (Bill Murray) and the Audience as well.The Movie is a Comedy made for Adults and is Rated PG. Unheard of Today. Its Charm is Universal and Timeless. It's a Special Movie that may not Appeal to Everyone but it has Appeal Aplenty for those willing to Go with the Flow, Just like Phil the Weatherman. He and the World became a Better Place because of What He Did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Could Watch Bill Murray Everyday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a great movie with a terrific original premise. Having the main character Phil, played by Bill Murray, be a easily unlikable character allows for some great storytelling and character development that you don't get a chance to have in other films. By giving Phil unlimited days to grow and change, while everyone around him will always remains unchanged, only highlights Phil's journey to become a better man that much more. In that journey there is a lot of comedy, with terrific directing from Harold Ramis, and one of Murray's best performances. I love this movie, and no matter how many times I see it I always enjoy it, and it who doesn't love seeing a groundhog driving a pickup truck.

		<shortDescription>Best Bill Murray performance and one of the best comedies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray is usually irresistibly charming even if he's playing a huge douche. Nowhere is that more perfect than in here. He's so likable but so unlikable and charming, it's unreal. At his absolute best in this unusual romantic comedy of self change.Phil Conners, (Bill Murray) is a grumpy weather man who travels to Punxsutawney, PA for the annual Groundhog Day, only to be stuck in a time loop, reliving groundhog day over and over again. With nothing to lose, he has as much fun with it as possible, until his attraction to his journalist, (Andie Macdowell) makes him look at his life when he falls in love with her, not being able to change himself for her.It's a different take of romantic comedy where the romance is one sided. It deals with Bill Murray coping with the situation in different ways. He tries suicide, having fun, trying to do good to the point where he's tired of acting good then becoming rotten again. It's such a well set up film with a really fun touch to it. It cleverly plays around with the repetitive nature of the scenes. It can drive some nuts, but seeing him react in different ways every day is super fun.There have been so many philosophies about the time loop in this film: How long does he stay in the loop? what is the perspective of everybody else? What causes it? So many questions near the end, but it's such a clever way to display its message about self change.With that said, Bill Murray is hilarious. He is so care free and sarcastic in this film, it's unreal. He'll go with anything if it feels right. He manipulates women by learning a lot about them overtime, then sleeping with them. It's a film that can go anywhere at anytime. Watching Bill Murray's multiple reactions is just insanely hilarious. Nobody else could have pulled this off. It's simply perfect.Even though It's probably not the best comedy of all time, it's my favorite comedy. It's the perfect blend of stupid, clever, and emotional, and to be centered around one of the funniest people of all time, there's no getting around how excellent and timeless this is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of time loop always excites the plot, the story may be repeating in the same phase but changes in narration, people get with the baffled situations and the exploring idea along with the characters in the movie; this is the beauty of such genre.1993's ''Groundhog Day'' is one such kind of movie that has a good combinations of fiction, curiosity, love, values of feelings and the beauty of knowing new things in our daily life. This movie revolves around the weather reporter Phil who visits Punxsutawney to report about the Groundhog Day with which he is least interested, after his first day in that place he plans to get back but due to weather impediment he has to stay back in that place and from here the film gets its twist and the flow of curiosity where Phil get stuck with the Groundhog Day again and again, such an exciting plot surely never disappoints its viewers.Some catchy phrases from the movie like ''what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today'' this actually gained my attention, the scene where Phil helps the beggar to make him feel good in his last days of living was portrayed so emotionally that turns to be the enlightening once, overall this movie is best of its kind, Bill Murray and Andie performed the best, movie has a good grip in its full flow and never creates the confusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Look: 'Groundhog Day'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today." Bill Murray gives probably his best and warm-hearted performances of his career in this 1993 American fantasy comedy as a grumpy weatherman caught in a time loop where everyday is the titular holiday. But will the misanthropic meteorologist eventually discover redemption through caring about the people around him during this monotonous sojourn? Let's take a look. Murray plays the wry, wisecracking weatherman Phil Connors of whom, begrudgingly, goes to the small friendly district of Punxsutawney, PA to attend/report the yearly Groundhog Day festivities. Traveling with him is news producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and smart-aleck cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to capture the event with him. On the road back to Pittsburgh, a blizzard shuts down all road travel, and the team is forced to return to Punxsutawney and stay another night. Upon awakening the next morning, he discovers that he is reliving February 2 all over again, the day playing out exactly as it had done before on the worst day of his life, with no one but Phil aware of the loop. At first he is confused, but, when the phenomenon continues on subsequent days (isn't Sonny and Cher's 'I Got You Babe' on the clock radio alarm a bit ironic?), he decides to take advantage of the situation with no fear or regrets of long-term consequences. He seduces women, drives recklessly, indulges in hedonism, is constantly confronted by annoying insurance salesman Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) and commits numerous acts of suicide. But Phil gets his own mental wake-up call when it eventually hits him that the only way out is to re-examine his own life and to explore on his own sojourn the positive outlook of living with a purpose and to become less of a self-centered individual and to become more of a caring person, eventually winning the heart of Rita and the respect of the locals as well...despite having Phil discover this over and over (and over) again to hilarious effect. After all was said and done, Phil "awoke" from his slumber of egocentricity to a new redemption and another shot at living anew.Written and directed by by Harold Ramis (with a cameo as a neurologist) and Danny Rubin, 'Groundhog Day' remained truly one of the top comedies of the 90's and still, twenty plus years later, manages to make us laugh, allows us to think and, rather than going through the daily motions like a broken record, to live with a sense of purpose while having others in mind for the long run as well. Fresh, original and often times hysterical, please take the time to partake in the festivities with the celebratory plucky prognosticator marmot, the world-famous hirsute weatherman...critter...by checking out this funny and farcical flick where comedy is rarely this perfect. And there's six more weeks of winter. Just saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much to his detest, snobby weatherman Murray is sent over to Punxsutawney, PA to cover the groundhog story with crew MacDowell and Elliott, spending his time flirting with the former and bullying the latter to get through the dreadful assignment. However, he'll have to come up with new ways to kill time to get through this trip because he keeps waking up to the same day (Groundhog Dog) over and over again. WHAT ABOUT BOB? meets THE TWILIGHT ZONE and ends up being a priceless match. A good comfort movie with lots of replay value, but perhaps it's also an examination on how much control one does and doesn't have over everyday events. Really fun! **** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray's sarcasm vs. Punxsutawney Phil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time this review is published it will be the real groundhog day. By that time of course we will know whether or not Phil saw his shadow. But anyways on to this film which I am reviewing in honor of the occasion. Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a weatherman who along with co-workers Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and Larry the camera man (Chris Elliot) are sent to cover the weather report in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States for Groundhog day. Phil is most displeased but swallows his pride and goes through with it. After having a less than perfect February 2, he goes to sleep and wakes up on the exact same day. Over and over Phil finds himself in February 2,1993 with the exact same events occurring and he's the only one that knows about it. With this he starts to act out which includes expressing how he really feels about the entire celebration. It's a very funny movie with Murray's trademark sarcasm but it also can help you relate to some real life problems. Everyone feels like Phil sometimes. We are all forced to do things we don't really want to for work and that's exactly what we see here. I can definitely recommend Groundhog Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I saw it for the first time, I saw it again... and again... and again. Kind of like Bill Murray's character must have felt in this awesome romantic comedy.We all wish occasionally that we could turn back time to fix our mistakes. Murray, portraying a TV weatherman trapped in a one-day time loop actually gets to do it. At first, he does not realize what good luck he has. Reporting on groundhog's weather prediction capabilities is about on his list where a root canal ranks. He's just that kind of a cynical ass. When he wakes up on the same day over and over again, it seems the gods have punished him. But then he begins to fall for his intelligent and pretty colleague. At first, he woos her with cheap one- liners and tricks that just don't seem to work. Then he starts making life-changing efforts, such as spending months (years?) to study the piano so he can impress her. Still not right, but you now realize how serious he has become, spending years of his life learning something constructive to achieve a goal. After a near-death experience to get out of the loop, he is finally redeemed, and the gods seem more merciful.The movie is great on many levels. As a modern scrooge story; as a romantic comedy; as fantasy. You name it. It is well directed, well edited, and well played by all. A truly remarkable achievement among 90s comedies, which features quite a few good films in the US and abroad in that genre.Well, I'm going to have to see it again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A funny, touching film on the importance of waking up to life and its simple pleasures.Phil (Bill Murray) is a jaded TV weatherman who has become anesthetized to the routine of life. Rita (Andie MacDowell) is the kind of woman he wouldn't ordinarily pay that much attention to -- the producer who accompanies him to Punxatawney, Pa., for the annual Groundhog Day ritual.Phil's life goes into pause mode -- at a particularly disliked juncture on the calendar -- until he "gets" that it's only by focusing and living in the moment that he can rediscover meaning.There are many funny bits on this now-iconic film -- the "Jeopardy" sequence is priceless -- but I particularly enjoyed Phil's quotations from 19th-century French poetry. (What woman wouldn't swoon?)Murray -- in, possibly, the performance of his career -- is amazing in the unlikely role of romantic lead, and the chemistry between him and Rita is powerful.As a native of Pittsburgh, I loved the hometown, and exurban, backdrops for this film."Groundhog Day" was deeper and thought-provoking the second time around. Definitely worth a re-viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating blend of heartfelt narration, wonderful direction, clever writing, impressive performances &amp; remarkable use of humour, Groundhog Day is one of the most exciting, witty &amp; original concepts to grace the film canvas and isn't just one of the best films of its year or decade but is simply one of cinema's finest comedies of all time.Set in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Groundhog Day concerns a self-centered meteorologist who, for unspecified reasons, finds himself stuck in a time loop &amp; living the same day with same events over n over again. The plot covers his confusion, frustration, hedonism, depression &amp; acceptance of his fate after which he starts re-examining his life &amp; priorities.Directed by Harold Ramis, Groundhog Day remains the finest work of his filmmaking career and is deftly crafted from start to finish. Written by Danny Rubin, the idea is refreshingly original, imaginative &amp; intriguing. Cinematography nicely the town it is filmed in, editing keeps the plot fresh throughout its runtime &amp; the use of songs is elegantly done.Coming to the performances, it is Bill Murray's show all the way as we witness his character's transformation from an egocentric &amp; arrogant person to someone who grows to care &amp; appreciate everything around him and Murray delivers an exquisitely balanced performance here that also presents him sharing an amazing on-screen chemistry with Andie MacDowell who herself does a very good job in her given role.On an overall scale, Groundhog Day is a surprisingly pleasant, intensely heartwarming &amp; downright hilarious cinema that balances its elements of romance, fantasy, comedy &amp; drama extremely well and is sure to leave most viewers completely bedazzled by its sweetness, honesty &amp; plethora of spiritual themes it presents. A must-watch for every cinema lover out there, Groundhog Day comes one-hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TV weatherman Phil Connors, is annoyed when he's assigned the job of covering the annual Groundhog festivities in the small town of Punxsutawney, for the fourth time. The only upside is his attractive and good-natured producer. The real nightmare begins when Phil ends up reliving the same day over, and over again. Unable to leave the town due to a severe blizzard, and with no end in sight, Phil struggles to find a way to escape his seemingly hopeless situation......Its high concept all the way for this, probably Ramis's finest directorial effort, and Murray's, arguably last greatest comedy role.This is the sarcastic Murray we all know and love from Ghostbusters and Scrooged, and then he turns, turns into a wonderful, lovable character, and then back to his sarcastic best.The narrative here though is the main pull. How many times a scene is retold doesn't really matter, because each minor tweak in the plot makes it all the more unique.And Murray isn't only brilliant, he has a warmth and chemistry with every character he encounters in the story. But it's more heartwarming because he is so cold toward many of them before the main plot point.Its strange that we never know just how long Phil is stuck in this one day for. It could be months, weeks, years, even centuries, but the narrative is clear that its a long time, because the days go into steps.1. Denial. For the first few times he is bewildered and lost. Then he begins to take advantage of him living the same day over and over.2. Resignation. This is the part when Phil tries over and over to end it all.3. Redemption. Is is the main part of the narrative. Phill does everything in his power to help everyone around him. From catching a boy from a tree, to becoming a better man, and here lies the moral of the story.Its hilarious in parts, sweet in others, and sometimes quite sobering, in one scene Phil learns that time waits for no man, despite his best efforts.Its a landmark movie, endlessly watchable, and one of those films that is guaranteed to cheer you up on a bad day.A great film to watch with The Shawshank Redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is, first and foremost, a very funny film. Bill Murray plays TV weatherman Phil Connors, an egotistical cynic full of frustrated ambition who, much to his annoyance, finds himself having to broadcast from small-town Punxsutawney PA on the annual "Groundhog Day" festival. This is the last thing a big star weatherman like Connors wants to be doing, but in spite of his best efforts to get it over before the incoming storm front, things don't really work out as planned: the big-city sophisticate is forced to live out the same day again and again in a place he really doesn't want to be, Small Town USA, full of hicks from the sticks.The central mystery of the repeating day is never explained. We don't have time to ponder this as the well-paced script moves briskly along, giving Murray the perfect stage to display his deadpan comic talents. The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman. Often, the humour gives way to pathos and some deeply touching (if not to say disturbing) reflections on life, as the perceptive and subtle love story at the heart of the film reveals itself.No matter how many times you see Groundhog Day (it frequently pops up in TV schedules and believe me, you will watch it a lot), you still laugh at the old jokes, notice new jokes that you previously missed, find Andie MacDowell increasingly attractive, Bill Murray funnier and funnier. As time goes by, with each repeated viewing, it is acquiring the mythic charm of something like "It's a Wonderful Life", a movie with which it shares some curious thematic parallels. I get the feeling that it really wasn't planned that way, that the project started out as quite an 'ordinary', low budget vehicle for Bill Murray, but somehow had depth and greatness thrust upon it. Again, very much like the story of "It's a Wonderful Life".And afterwards that repeating day starts to bother you again. What does it mean? Something about reincarnation? A blueprint for raised consciousness? A biting satire on modern life? Perhaps, as Phil Connors, in his deep, serious mode might say, you realise we are all trapped in our own little versions of Groundhog Day, and if things don't seem to get much better, nor do we get much happier, maybe with a bit of luck, we get a little wiser.</fullReview>

The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors a weatherman for the Pittsburgh weather channel who finds out he is reliving Groundhog day over and over again and really gets annoyed about it (I would too if i reliving the same day over and over again too, but thank god that doesn't happen in real life.) As well as telling the rarest of all plots for movies especially for a comedy reliving the same day which really would be annoying if that happened in real life, (of which was Ramis' message.). This movie is one of the best comedy movie that I have seen in a long time thanks to both Bill Murray's and Harold Ramis' comedic genius as well as a movie that made me have more appreciation for comedy movies even though I like more serious types of movies. But in the end it was a comedic pleasure as much as very funny when the same scene was being repeated all over in which made me laugh a lot more.</fullReview>

I forgot to tell the movie genre it is a comedy mostly with romance and some philosophical themes. The main actor is Bill Murray who gives a stronger performance in his comedies (like Ghostbuster) than many other actors. I could even say than it is his best and more nuanced performance. I have never felt such different emotions than when watching this movie. It is much better than other comedies of the 90's. Watch it! It will make you cry, laugh and ultimately think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would you do if you relive the same day?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day has a very interesting starting point: What if the whole world relives the same day over and over again and only man notices this? In the movie it seems that Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is the only person who relives the 2nd of February over and over again but of course all the people living in small Punxsutawney relive this day. Everything they experience is forgotten the moment that they wake up again when it is the 2nd of February again and also their physical condition is the same as on their wake-up on the day before. Notice that Phil can save lives but if he doesn't interfere the deceased will also wake-up next morning. It is even possible (although we don't see this) that a baby is born over and over again because in the morning he is back in his or hers mama's belly. Or that Phil impregnates a woman (he makes love to at least one woman in the film) and that the fertilized ovum is unimpregnated again when the woman wakes up.Phil Connors is a weatherman who desperately wants to make career steps but without them is forced to do reports on local events like the annual Groundhog Day where an animal predicts if the winter will be long that year. He undergoes a terrible day in Punxsutawney and is extremely annoyed when he is forced to stay one night longer because of a blizzard that he didn't predicted. When his alarm goes off at six o'clock he notices that everything is the same as the day before. During the days his mood changes from confused to indifferent to desperate. He doesn't care for his health anymore because he doesn't get older, fatter or injured. At one point he is so in despair that he tries suicide in many different ways knowing that he will get up next morning in perfect health.In the end he settles for learning activities like chainsaw sculpture and playing the piano. Besides that he tries to seduce his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). At first he tries to impress her by collecting all information from her about things she likes. But one day is not enough and every day he has to start all over again. In the end he tells her the truth and convinces her by showing all the knowledge he has about the town and its inhabitants and predicting all the events happening that day. After spending the night with her he notices a different song from his alarm clock and finally (and without specific reason) it is the 3rd of February.As in all films that play a game with time there are some plot holes. Phil is the only person noticing but Rita makes a hint at one point that she has the feeling that she has a dj?-vu. No reason at all is given why Punxsutawney is in time-loop. It is mentioned in reviews that the reason is for Bill to become a better person and the time-loop stops when he has achieved that. During the film Bill becomes an expert in chainsaw sculpting and a master at the piano. That these talents require also some physical changes (strong muscles and flexible fingers) implicates that some changes of the body don't disappear the next morning. As a viewer I also wondered if the time-loop was bound to Punxsutawney. During the movie there is no mention of contact with the rest of the world and I never saw Phil trying to escape the place before the roads were blocked because of the blizzard.Bill Murray had mentioned that he preferred Groundhog Day to be a more philosophical movie instead of a romantic comedy. I understand that completely. There is a short story by Stephen King where a young boy goes to eternity and is coming out completely mad. Phil doesn't have to go that far but after 10 or 38 years (the time that probably has elapsed before there is a real next day) your mental state would be pretty mixed-up. Director Harold Ramis chose to make another movie and concentrates on the humor (which is outstanding) and the romance between Phil and Rita. And therefore the film looses a lot of his appeal. There's not really chemistry between Murray and MacDowell and the movie is too centered on the character of Phil to let the love story fully develop. But in the end Groundhog Day is an excellent comedy with some philosophical issues that makes you think what you would do when you were in the same situation. Probably watching movies every day and still remember them next day without getting fat because of the chips, popcorn and cola. Only a shame that my reviews on IMDb would be erased when I log in the next day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: Contains very minor spoilers...Groundhog Day is a miracle comedy, housing in every genre a film can handle such as truly haunting science-fiction, a beautiful romance, uproariously funny comedy, enticing drama, and a beautiful "seize the day" message tacked on as a nicely tied-bow instead of a completely manipulative screen writing device.At the film's core is a career-making performance by Billy Murray, an actor who can play a man of condescending intellect, deeply-rooted vulnerability, and charismatic and charming qualities all within the same scene. He is ideal for the character of Phil Connors, a local-area meteorologist sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the fourth year in a row. He loathes doing it because of the holiday's inherent silliness but goes along with it anyway in a smug fashion.The events of the day involve him waking up in his hotel-room, eating breakfast, rushing to the festivities, running into an old "friend" from school who now sells insurance, and then being stuck in a blizzard on the way home. The day is long and merciless and Phil can't wait to fall asleep and start February 3rd. However, when Phil wakes up, it's still February 2nd and the same events unfold as if they'd never occurred. Phil is now reliving a day that went from terrible to an inconceivable nightmare over and over again. Each day's events become inconsequential happenings, as no matter what Phil does, he'll wake up at the same time, in the same hotel-room in the same fashion to the same song on the clock-radio, as if someone pushed a reset button on everything.At first, Phil panics and worries, trying to make sense of what is happening. Nobody understands what he's going through (how can they?) and nobody seems to be in this same, alternate universe as Phil. As days turn into weeks, Phil begins having fun, causing a little bit of havoc, being sent to prison, annoying people in his life, etc. He uses it in a hedonistic way in some cases, as he waltzes down to the diner, abruptly and arbitrarily asks a girl for her personal information before returning the following day and using the newfound information to make a move on her.But after a while, the effect becomes sickening to Phil, who realizes that even committing suicide is only met with the same result of waking up in the same hotel-room. What writers Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis pull off, however, is something I would've never expected. They make it so the repetition wears on Phil but also the audience in a way that doesn't make the film boring or irritating but in a way that almost treads on empathy. It's a difficult thing to accurately summarize, but after watching the same day being relived on a consistent basis, with the scene of Phil waking up to the same annoying tune on the radio, begins to wear on us in a way that we feel as if we're stuck in this time loop as well. When Phil tries to explain his predicament to others, it's as if we're trying to explain to them what's happening in our heads (or, in some cases, maybe aloud) and can't get anyone to understand or listen to us.Rubin and Ramis put us under a spell and give us no answers, another daring move on their behalf. We're never given a justification as to how long Phil is stuck in this trance (although Ramis has informally states anywhere from ten years to 10,000 years, which, with that information, just exhausts a person by the very thought of that) or, the bigger question, why?. This is wonderful because adding an explanation could've cheapened the entire film and its boldly original story, although perhaps both writers, who seemed to be on a neverending winning streak with their material here, could've found an original way to pull it off.Furthermore, the film has an incredibly black concept for a comedy that can be so funny at times. The idea of this time loop occurring is something to tie your mind in knots, but if thought about at great length, the film is deeply haunting. Imagine one of your worst days being repeated over and over again with nothing you could do to escape it. Suicide isn't an option, staying in bed won't always work, and you can't tell anyone your problems because they simply will not make the slightest sense of them (neither can you, really). With Bill Murray at the center, the film manages to be both equal parts hilarious as well as dark and often bleak as can be.Groundhog Day is sublime black-comedy filmmaking, housing an original premise, a brilliantly written script, an engaging and simultaneously depressing Bill Murray performance, and a concept to thoroughly contemplate. Being that Rubin and Ramis take so many risks with the storytelling, the concept, and the project, and discard conventional routes of explanation and simple justification, this could effectively be called experimental comedic filmmaking.Starring: Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliot. Directed by: Harold Ramis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, innovative and Bill Murray.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say, how many times have you wished to live a day again? Maybe when you're really happy about something, so happy, in fact, that you want to live it through all over again. Maybe a most perfect day you could imagine. "Groundhog Day" isn't a movie about those days. It's about a guy who relives the day of the year he despises the most. Tall order, you think, but director Harold Ramis actually gets away with it. He assembles a movie so thoughtful, so intelligent and so funny that you end up having a great time even if the idea does seem a bit far-fetched.We bump into Phil (Bill Murray), a cocky TV meteorologist who has to cover the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsutawney every year on February 2nd. Phil hates that part of his job. He's getting a better job, he brags at one point, so he won't have to go there again. Accompanying him on his little jaunt is Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, and Larry (Chris Elliott), his usual cameraman. Phil gets his weather calculations wrong on the big day and ends up being stuck in Punxsutawney after his broadcast because of a snowstorm. The next day, he wakes up to find himself living the same day over again. Initially surprised and spooked, he slowly begins to realize that he can't snap out of it unless the time loop is broken. As his frustrations quickly turn into mildly violent episodes, he begins to realize the other ways these odd circumstances could be used for."Groundhog Day" begins almost lazily as Ramis spends a considerable amount of time to build the story. But as the movie progresses, it grows increasingly engaging though there is a light risk of it being repetitive since the crux of the plot is about deja vu. Once we get the gist of what is about to unfold, the flow is impossible to stop. Smoothly edited and neatly written, "Groundhog Day" is a well-made crowd-pleaser that delights you with its wit. Cutting a fine line between a drama and a comedy, the film never takes itself too seriously. And therein lies its strength. Ramis is aware of the goofiness of the plot but the charming characters lead you to believe otherwise. "Groundhog Day" misfires at times when he doesn't know what it wants to be. And that's aggravating to watch because the hesitancy translates on the screen. There were stretches of time when I had no clue what the movie eventually wanted but that niggle is rectified when it slides into a new soul later on. The movie scores with its characters. Bill Murray is nothing short of terrific, bringing the much needed zing factor into the proceedings with his enthusiastic performance that is infectious. The beautiful MacDowell has never been so endearing and she delivers a nearly flawless performance that's nicely textured. Some of the secondary actors aren't as good, I'm afraid, because they are reduced to mere caricatures. But since they don't gobble up much of the screen-time, that doesn't pose as a major problem."Groundhog Day" is a charming, enjoyable fare that entertains and sermonizes in equal measure. If you're willing to overlook the minor hitches, it could be a movie that makes your day. And gives you a quick lesson in morals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie! Well written and produced!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again.Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change.Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic comedy with a twist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993) is a romantic comedy that is filled with laughter, love, and at times a feeling of hopelessness, over and over again. "Groundhog Day" is a about a local, self-centered weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has been sent to cover the infamous February 2nd festivities, better known as Groundhog Day, in a small town named Punxsutawney, Pa. Teamed with his lovely, well- grounded producer named Rita (Andie MacDowell) and his young, wise cracking cameraman named Larry (Chris Elliot), the three make the annual pilgrimage from Pittsburg to Punxsutawney for this historic event.We all know the story behind the famous date of February 2nd. If the "weather predicting rat" (groundhog) as Phil calls it, comes out from its burrow and sees his shadow then it's another 6 weeks of winter. If no shadow appears, then happy days are here because spring is near. Although Phil has been to the small town of Punxsutawney five times to cover the festivities, he does not intend to spend any longer than necessary to uncover the story, announce the prediction and get back on the road to Pittsburg. Phil wraps up the story, Larry packs the van and the three get on the road to head home. Here lies the problem, a winter storm is brewing and moving in the direction of Punxsutawney. The crew did not make it far before the road was closed by the Highway Patrol and were directed to return to Punxsutawney much to Phil's dislike. This is where Phil's vicious loop of the dreaded February 2nd begins.The storyline of "Groundhog Day" closely reminds us of the film "Yes Man" (2008) starring Jim Carrey as Carl Allen. In this story, Carl has committed to saying "yes" to everything. Soon he understands the magical power of the word yes" and his life is turned upside, sideways, and all around. Soon, Carl discovers a new love in his life, Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel and attempts to convince her that his love for her is real and he is not just saying that under this magical spell. Groundhog Day allows Phil to relive February 2nd over and over again. This motif gives Phil the latitude to develop his character during the film. He learns to be a better person through caring for an elderly gentleman, taking piano lessons, and reading more books and poetry. His sense of maturity is soon recognized by his attractive producer and sparks an interest to him. During this film there was not much use of lighting and colors. This could have been partly because of the mood that Phil Connors was feeling in addition to the dreariness of the nearby winter storm. This lack of lighting gave the appearance the days were meek and mild with overcast.Many times the camera angle gave the impression that they were stationary utilizing an objective point of view just to observe the action. However, there were times during the film when the cameras would pan overhead to recognize a crowd gathering at Gobblers Knob or give a subjective point of view like when Phil steals Punxsutawney Phil and drives over the cliff at the rock quarry. When Phil appeared in his bed every morning, the film crew utilized a high camera to stare down at Phil as he was lying in his bed before his alarm clock would go off at 6:00 am.No matter how many times you see this film, it will leave a lasting impression. The term "groundhog day" has become part of the free dictionary meaning a situation that repeats itself. This film is entertaining providing good, clean, wholesome comedy with a romantic twist that appears to never end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm a god. I'm not "the" God... I don't think."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the what style of storytelling, this conceptual light romantic comedy is amongst the greatest of its' genre due to Harold Ramis' treatment of Danny Rubin's story and the ever so obnoxious delivery of SNL legend Bill Murray. Being so familiar with his wry sarcastic nature, we can fully experience his metamorphosis under the Hindu-istic spell of a never changing calendar. Is it a curse or a gift? Andie MacDowell does her best, but it's Steven Tobolosky's wacky insurance sell and the Chris Elliot persona that take the weight off Murray to allow the drama to unfold and Phil Connors to evolve. What if there isn't a tomorrow? There wasn't one today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First,I should say that I watched it just because of Bill Murray! And I love all thing what are in this movie. I love this movie,not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For example,you realize that how many fail do you in a day. And you realize if you had a chance to live your day again,you would do everything more good. You are witness that Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person. He is living same day repeatedly. And he became better,lovely person. Watch it,and you will think that; If you could live today again,what would you do,you live same or you change everything?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie could so easily have been terrible but under right direction it is a classic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of Groundhog Day, under wrong direction and execution could be an awful clichd mess but under right direction as presented in the film, there is so much good and so little bad about this classic comedic 90's movieGroundhog Day is a movie that's premise is so straightforward that it is literally impossible to not understand, at any time, what is going on. A weatherman named Phil falls under a time loop in which he lives 'Groundhog Day' every day of his life under a time loop. The movie is so strong and so fun that in terms of fun comedies, it can match up to movies like Back to the Future. There is just so much to love about this movie, in particular our two main characters, Phil and Rita. Phil is a typical douchebag at the start of the movie who cares about nothing in his life. However, under the continuous fall of the time loop, he turns into a human being and grows a heart and learns about the qualities of humanity. Like I said earlier, under the wrong director, his character could've been an un-relatable and unrealistic mess but here, the character is done to the top standard. The writing and execution in the movie is just fantastic. The acting stands very strong with Bull Murry being a particular reason to why the movie is so good and his character is so believable. The story itself moves along very well never falling astray. The movie is also very focused on tone constantly giving us the comedic and emotional tone. The movie is, despite being a comedy, very sad and moving on many occasions. The idea of a comedy being a very emotional comedy can often be a mess but the film never tries to be too funny nor too emotional, so the tones are balanced out well. Overall, Groundhog Day is a movie that I guarantee any movie lover will love whether it be the story, the jokes, the characters or whatever! Its a great movie and a true comedy classic from the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy that is much more than funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would you do if you had to relive the same day over and over? Would you go insane? Kill yourself? Fall in love? On one of Phil Conners least favorite days of the year, February 2, he reports the weather just like he does every other day. But somehow he makes it through the day with his sarcastic comments and bad-mannered nature, waiting for tomorrow; hoping it is better. But tomorrow never comes. This movie brings so much more to the table than one would expect. Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role who learns important lessons throughout. The fact this it is labeled as a comedy is one that I think is wrong; that is merely one of the qualities that it offers. It is hilarious, heart breaking, touching, and inspiring, all of which I would hope to see in a film. I loved it so much that I even want to put the song "I Got You Babe" as my alarm in the morning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Innovation: something new or different. An apt word to describe the film written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis, based upon a story by Danny Rubin. With so many films just copying each other, sometimes with very little change other than the actors - witness the ripoffs of great foreign films made by Hollywood with sub-par actors - it is refreshing to see something different.Starring Bill Murray in what is probably his best role, Lost in Translation notwithstanding, it also feature a fantastic performance by Andie MacDowell, who grabbed my heart in Four Weddings and a Funeral.This is a film that will keep you laughing and holds up well despite the fact that I have seen it ten times at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in the theater, it just made me laugh. Bill Murray is his regular smart mouth slightly obnoxious self...and he is brilliant at it. If you have not yet seen this movie you owe it to yourself to watch it. Harold Ramis could have just written this about any day, but by centering it around Ground Hog Day Feb 2 he has ensured we all get to watch this great movie every year on some cable channel.While humorous this movie has a serious side of a man who is stuck in a endless loop (dilema or opportunity...you decide) tries to find a purpose and cause to better himself.After you watch this movie, you can't help but think what would you do in this situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is quite ingenious, it all starts from there. Watching Bill Murray going through the motions of the same day over and over again, is funny up to some point, then it gets increasingly scary. It's just not a very fun situation. I've never really seen the creepy side to that song "I Got You Babe", but there you have it. The movie doesn't really go for gags, it's just all so wacky and unpleasant at the same time. I don't know why kidnapping a groundhog is funny, it just is. However, it's likely that the real idea is actually a social comment. People don't have time anymore, nothing ever changes, live the day to its fullest, take your pick. That's probably the angle that separates this from a whole bunch of inferior comedies. It's nothing special, but it's nice that's it's there I guess. The ending was the best choice they could made I think, any bigger, more spectacular, more explanatory ending would have just been an anti-climax. Oh, and Andie MacDowell looks quite good in this movie. That ought to be said. Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie! I really thought it was about an 10 on the scale, but just couldn't quite pull the trigger on a 9.I probably should have given it a 11 for the simple reason that it was VERY clever. How many hundreds of movies have we seen about time travel? And, how many times have we seen someone interact with another person in their early lives? But, to be able to interact with YOURSELF - and for both parties to know it - and to be able for both parties to teach the other something valuable that changes their lives - is really remarkable. And, if you think I am telling you the punch line, I'm not. There is a little more of a twist to it. Not quite the Sixth Sense, mind you, but a little surprise at the end.It was simple, sweet and even a little romantic. I would strongly recommend it for anyone. Interestingly, the survey of reviewers in Entertainment Weekly averaged a B- as I recall, but someone gave it a D. Seriously, they have to be out of their mind.Groundhog Day is awesome fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just realized one of the reasons this movie is so great.It's great because it flew under the radar of the producers.So many movies succumb to "producer syndrome", where the movie starts out great, but then turns sour and ends badly. And that's because "the suits" get cold feet, decide to overthrow the director's vision, and start dictating artistic direction halfway through. It derails the film; and it never fails to sicken me when I see it: Films that suffer from this syndrome could have been great if only the producers hadn't panicked.Groundhog Day was a perfect movie to avoid this problem. Sure, it's got a pithy narrative with "heavy" dramatic interest and serious darkness, but when the suits asked, "Look, does he get the girl?" they could, in good conscience, say "Oh, you betcha!" And when they asked, "Does everyone live happily ever after?" they could answer with a hearty affirmative.And they achieve these producer-appeasing ends with a narrative in which, yes, (almost) everyone winds up happy, but all dues that need to be paid get paid, in full, and the process by which Phil is redeemed has a surprisingly honorable depth and resonance.So I was telling a friend that this movie surprised me because the influence of the producers was backwards; you see their influence in the beginning of the movie, but then they back off and let the creative people have their way. And they bring the story home; good and firm and safe and sound.And happy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray gives comedy a different flavor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a nice movie, reminds me of The Truman show, Back to the future, What women want etc. It is hilarious, a good quality fun and touches various life chords also. Bill Murray gives his own flavor to comedy, deals with sarcasm to perfection. The biggest plus of the movie is the lesson(s) it teaches you about life, like you never stop trying especially when you are in love, you try to hit the perfection level and luckily this guy had several chances too, to do so. Another way to look at it is, also when you spend a lot of time with certain people, over a period you do tend to develop good feelings towards them. It is symbolic in sense that life can be so much better if you try to be good to people around, it is a petty cost you pay to be away from frustration or its worst form, depression. On the technical side, the repetitive sequences in the movie could have been lessened by combining some of them because towards the end they do become a little irritating. But the curiosity to see how it will end &amp; Bill Murray's face expressions keep you up. It is a well casted movie, gets into motion right away. The scenes have been ordered sensibly, keeping in line with Bill Murray's state of mind (in the movie ;)). All in all good stuff with good after taste too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great work of popular art. It's a simple premise; a man keeps experiencing the same day over and over again until he learns to use the experience to his advantage and, as fate would have it, become a better person into the bargain. It's a morality tale that the writers Harold Ramis, who also directed, and Danny Rubin have fashioned into a sweet-natured and very funny comedy, a Rolls Royce of a vehicle for its star, the great Bill Murray.And it could so easily have gone wrong. It takes a very special lightness of touch to keep a souffl like this from deflating. It must move us as well as make us laugh and it must do it without degenerating into the kind of schmaltz that categorizes so many American movies. Personally I think it is one of the great 'American' films, a lovingly recreated picture of small-town, homespun values. I could live Murray's day over and over again with him and never want it to end.</fullReview>

The story is uplifting, inspirational and entertaining without becoming mushy. Yes, one can get stuck in life while wallowing in anger that is masked by a veneer of bitter cynicism. The movie's premise is simple yet it's message is profound. How does one deal with the emotional obstacles that distort and inhibit communication? And do you really know the person you're with? Angry people have stories too and sometimes we can read people wrong. Metaphors abound but without the clichs. Life goes on ... or does it? Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One heck of a Groundhog Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day: the story of one man caught seemingly in a never-ending time warp that constantly repeats itself on February 2nd. While the premise of the film is very appealing and original as well as the bulk of the movie itself, I think it falls a bit short of landing a spot in the top 250.The first 20 minutes or so details what we are going to be seeing for quite awhile in the movie. It develops a sarcastic man named Phil, played hilariously by Bill Murray. He's guy who pretty much hates everything, and he's covering Groundhog Day in Pux-a-something, in which everything is horrible. He is even stuck in this town because of a blizzard, so he's forced to return to his dreaded town, and eventually fall asleep.Once Phil wakes up, he immediately notices the same song playing and two idiots attempting to make the weather report they made yesterday. Everything outside is the same, the same events begin happening, and his worst fears are realized when a lady confirms it is Groundhog Day. He lives throughout the day trying to solve this problem, and eventually, must stay in the town again (the blizzard once again has trapped him here).The next day it happens again. And every time it happens, it creates more laughs. Fortunately, the director knew when to stop in order not to tire itself out, and the events would be altered based on Phil's reactions to everything.It is once the formula is changed, sadly, where humor is not as consistent. While there is certainly a great deal of it and even a hilarious suicidal montage, the film has lost its steam and traveling at an average-comedy pace. Towards the end, the film transitions finally into more of a drama. Why? I'll get into that a bit later.Over the course of the film we see Phil's personality making drastic and eventual changes. First he freaks out about Groundhog's Day, then becomes even more of a jerk by using the day to his advantage. But his daily wants and needs cause him to feel pain and misery for awhile, and he still sees no way out. It is only when a girl he likes offers him indirect advice that he begins an ascent in his perspective of life and a change in himself.The transition begins when Phil becomes selfless, and even though it doesn't have the tone of a drama, Phil seems to be more serious about things. It's kind of sad, though, because all the humor was working well.There's really not much more to say about Groundhog Day. It's a good film that should be viewed by everyone. It is most plausible in its comedic moments and still pretty good in its more serious moments; some of those moments are even rather touching, and those serious moments are worthy of commendation. In the end, I'd have to give this film a 7.6/10. It's good but loses steam after about 40 or so minutes with only one other quick train of top-notch humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can watch it over and over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is definitely one of my favorite movies.It manages to combine comedy, romance, drama and originality in such an entertaining way that it can be watched over and over again and still be enjoyed.Of course the main reason why the film works is Bill Murray's wonderful performance as Phil Connors. I can't think of any other actor who could have done the role justice. Murray captures not only the humor, but also lets his character grow and become much more sympathetic as the film progresses.Harold Ramis, the director, also has to take great credit for this, as his pacing for the whole film is absolutely flawless. It's disappointing that Ramis has never come close to making this quality of film again...Also, Andie McDowell gives by far and away her best ever performance in this movie. Her and Murray have great chemistry and she is the perfect foil for him right throughout the film.This is truly and wonderful and uplifting film which everyone should see, and more than once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting and truly unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films in which you can watch and genuinely feel uplifted and can make you feel like every day is important...this is one of them. A truly special film. It follows Phil Conners (Bill Murray) a TV weatherman man who pretty much hates his life, and the world around him- he's cold, and drips sarcasm and dry humour and no one really knows him. But its not one of those yawn inducing romance movies, where the bad man turns good because of love instantly- this is a much smarter movie, the premise is unique as Phil aims to get his report over with, in Punxatawney to cover the groundhog day, as quickly as possible and get out. He can't stand the town, and finds the whole day utterly pointless. Thus the groundhog day commences at 6am and his radio alarm awakes him to two radio presenters "Its groundhog day..." after the quirky ceremony he tries to get out of town but his own weather report lets him down as the storm forces him to stay another day. What he doesn't realise is this is a day he may have to re-live for the rest of his life. He awakes to exactly the same day and events as the previous one- and continues to do so. From this point on Phil goes through many stages: At first he treats the repeated days with contempt; then he continues his personality of dry ego-centric and impersonal, by using it to his advantage- by picking up women rather impressively i might add, living it with reckless abandon with the realisation there are no consequences stealing,arrested; then the next stage was that of being suicidal- as he commits suicide every day as this repeated day was a curse; however as the movie develops so too does his interest in the sweet good natured Rita Andie McDowell character, whom he woos and romances and he uses each day to develop his knowledge of her. He gets a lot of slaps in the face as he attempts to use it to bed her in one go; but this soon gives him a reason to keep going, and he over time develops an excitement in his life and re-living it as he starts doing good in the community helping people and sculpturing and playing and instrument and his nature changes to one of good... and he finally gets groundhog day right- it all comes together for him and he gets his girl, and he feels genuinely uplifted as he awakes the next day with Rita beside him and he finally made it to the next day.Themes wise, there is a distinct religious overtone- almost Buddhist in its philosophy.The conclusion makes the viewer realise that every day should be cherished, by living one through the eyes of a man we can all relate too. What would you do with having to relive the same day over and over? in many ways we'd probably all go through the stages that Bill Murray does. Personally i can relate to the metaphorical idea that you live the same day in the same town when nothing really matters, this movie takes that in a literal sense which is unique- and finds an uplifting way to change Phil Conners character. In terms of comedy, this is undoubtedly in my opinion Bill Murray's finest achievement he is a wonderfully skilled comedic actor but he is given a script he can run riot with as he makes the character his own in his fantastic Murray way. His facial expressions, his dry humour-- some of the moments in this movie are just fantastic, it makes you laugh out loud, but it also makes you feel heart-warmed and carries a strong message. Harold Ramis does a fantastic job of directing in this movie also...all in all i feel this could possibly be one of the underrated gems of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is one of the most cleverly written/directed/acted movies ever produced. If you've never seen it, watch it without distraction. Undoubtedly, you will then be able to grasp the beauty that lies within (after repeated viewings, of course-not because they are required, but because you will want to). This movie is so well-made on many levels. If you're feeling down, this movie will cheer you up and probably change your outlook on life. I have seen this movie many times and I know it will be seen many more. It is that special. I am obsessed, as I'm sure there are many more that feel the way I do. Maybe you will be to. I tell everybody I know about this movie, and every one of them praised me for it. I've read all the reviews, plus I frequently read the IMDb message board for this movie. It kind of reassures me, I'm not the only one who "gets" it. Pass it along! Plus, this is definitely worth mentioning-if they were ever allowed to give retro Academy Awards, Bill Murray, as well as the movie itself, would easily walk away with the honor. The Academy people didn't really "get it" back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a few real problems with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smug,snide,cynical and dripping with more than an ounce of well-trained insincerity,Pittsbugh local Weatherman Phil Conners(Bill Murray,whose performance here SEEMS to be his usual,languid,wise-ass self,but upon further review,is arguable one of his most slyly executed performance of his career!)is NOT looking forward to covering Groundhog Day in nearby Punxatawney(spelling?). He isn't too thrilled with who he's being dispatched to cover it with:a bright new producer(Andie MacDowall)and an unassuming but equally wise-ass cameraman he's worked with before(Chris Elliott). Come the actual event,Phil goes through the motions,then is crestfallen to find out he'll be stuck in Punxatawney THROUGH the day(he was set to leave town that afternoon) and have to spend one more night at a quaint bed-and breakfast where he doesn't fit in.That would soon prove to be the LEAST of his problems,as he begins to relive the same Feb.2nd ad infinitum.Murray's performance here is really worth more than a cursory glance:in having to relive the same day over and over and over(and over)again,his Phil is left open to relive it in both generous and selfish ways. As he continually re-crafts the same routines(And tries,in increasingly more grim fashions to escape it),he begins to learn about things and people he absolutely never would,not the least of which his attraction and affinity for his producer.Director Harold Ramis has been far more cursed with loser material(a remake of Bedazzled,anyone? How about the incomplete idea of Multiplicity?)than good stuff,but here,with Second City and Ghostbusters cohort Murray,he is able to craft a film that,while it seems to be unable to find a way to wrap itself up(and is probably my biggest gripe of this film),is still both cuttingly funny,poignant AND somewhat philospohical in its mien. While I'm not even close to being an Andie McDowall fan(I think this and Short Cuts are the only two films of hers I've thought she was pretty good in),she is a very effectively placed foil. The sub-characters,given the way this film is constructed,are actually asked,in some parts,to CARRY this film more than most movies would allow(including obnoxious INsurance salesman Phil doesn't recall played by Stephen Toblowski,a "Long lost love interest named NAncy,the other B&amp;B guests and patrons)and it has such fun with quick cuts and restructuring the film's series of events that you could argue this is actually about TWENTY or THIRTY movies in one. Absurd,funny and more than a little off-putting,Groundhog Day is a film that you won't forget soon after viewing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a slob movie like "Meatballs" and not really "Rushmore" but really something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this many times and one thing I can say about Bill Murray is that he must have been kicking himself that he wasn't doing something like this much sooner instead of treading water through most of the 90's in such failures as "Ghostbusters 2" and later "The Man Who Knew Too Little". Later he had a spectacular comeback in "Rushmore" but if he had continued making this kind of fascinating films he could have eased his transition to "exciting character actor" much faster.This is such a great premise: A man living the same day over and over again and to top it off, a day that he thinks is one of the worst days of his life. If the film had taken a direction in which the Murray character was a nice person it wouldn't have been as much fun as when we learn that he has contempt for almost everything in his life. This character is a variation on the character Murray played in "Scrooged" but as we go through his transformation to "nice" we sort of buy it this time. In "Scrooged" the transformation was a lot more forced.Add to that, a brilliant performance by Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson. It's hard to play annoying and still make it funny but Tobolowsky is a pure treat to watch here. And as the icing on the cake we get Chris Elliott in his least memorable performance and I mean that as a good thing. Andie McDowell is sweet and cute but she is totally believable as a character who doesn't have a clue about Murray's situation and still thinks that there is something familiar about the whole thing she experiences in this one day.I am not saying that this is a masterpiece but it is easy to see why the director Harold Ramis and Murray was such a great partnership. Ramis knows how to build a scene and he knows comedy. Still, the movie tends to drag in the scenes that are supposed to be serious and the movie kind of ends abruptly after Murray wakes op next to Andie McDowell. But this has absolutely been my favorite Murray film ever since I can remember. The groundhog is cute too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shawshank Redemption of comedies......?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both movies seem to have had decent theatrical runs and seemed to be destined for the scrap heap of old movies. Then both caught a sustained second wind on TV and have grown in respect and 'importance' since.Anyway, I saw Groundhog Day on the opening weekend, and saw it several times more at the theater (3 times I think) and appreciated its subtle messages from the start, and perhaps insularly, thought I seemed to be the only one who got that it was deeper than the basic romantic comedy let on. I guess I was wrong. I've seen the movie several times since, and have been surprised by subsequent reevaluation by the likes of Roger Ebert and essays in such periodicals as the National Review about its meaning. It would seem that spiritualists from many cultures have seen this movie and approve of aspects of its deeper message. No small feat for what must have appeared to be a popcorn movie from the outset.The movie's main message seems to be very fatalistic in that whatever is destined to happen will happen regardless of what we try to do about it, but it is veiled from us, so we may as well enjoy and appreciate life as much as we can. But a little deeper, it seems to say that only some things are predestined, others we can change for the better, and if we accept certain inevitabilities we cannot control, learn to be happy in the moment, other variable aspects will change as well, enhancing the time we have. Simply being a courteous person instead of a twit paid huge dividends.Perhaps the message of self sacrifice is too much at times (I don't hold with concepts of coerced sacrifice and don't cotton to much to the idea that one is trapped in their own hell unless they put everyone else first). But there are examples during Phil's conversion that is simply courteousness on Phil's part. He certainly learned the lesson of cultural conventions that make life a lot easier. I try and ignore the more egregious examples of sacrifice that were required before Phil was allowed to 'escape'. But an acceptable flaw for all that, but knocks one * off the pile.The movie itself has been sliced and diced here enough, but just a few things that I noticed that perhaps only a few have. One is the scene where Larry is at the bar trying to put the moves on Nancy Taylor, it is at the precise moment when Phil had been trying to gather information about Rita, complete with the bartender's shaking of his head at such obviousness. Seems to say that even some small aspects of life are destined to be, but simply will happen to other people as people change aspects of themselves - Phil is no longer setting up Rita, but guys will always putting moves on somewhere. What message there is there I don't know, but yet speaks to the fabric of destiny woven around us.The second is that it would seem that at the precise moment Rita felt she loved Phil is when the snow comes curling down (and Phil looks up - to heaven?). It is that covering of snow which Phil sees the next day that clinches it for Phil that the day is, indeed, Feb 3rd. I appreciate how subtle the change is, and comports with the message of the movie. Other productions likely would have cued a swelling of strings to beat the viewer over the head that THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. Important moments in real life don't come with soundtracks.The movie only suffers a couple of blemishes that prevent it from getting a full ten stars. One is the slightly heavy hand in the self-sacrifice category, it can come off a bit like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, simply put, see things my way or you'll end up in my "hell". And the other is Andie MacDowell who annoys me in whatever I have seen her, and this is no different. I'm not going to overlook her poor abilities in attempt to bolster a top notch production even more. She is a poor actress and is a net negative to the material.</fullReview>

And then how he goes through each Groundhog Day is just so funny with Bill Murray. How he puts up with it all and struggles and struggles!

		<shortDescription>THE MOVIE on How to Date a Woman and a lot of other things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a rare gem. When the movie was first out, no one knew about it. It didn't make a huge fanfare and the Groundhog Day movie never did make it in the IMDb top 250 movies, at least in the beginning.Why this movie is one of my favorite comedy of them all? For one thing, you can watch the movie over and over again and still enjoy it. The making of a classic is it has many elements put into the movie, much like Casablanca, but this is more like Casablanca comedy. What elements does this movie had. It was perhaps the first movie that introduced Groundhog Day originates in Punxsutawney, PA and it is done every year. For Phil it is his fifth time. The second part of the movie is its unique comedy. For those who likes time travel movie - like me (e.g.Timecops,Time Machine, etc.), or those who want to know the future this is THE movie. The third element is a very good question and one that has already effected me as I am actually living in this kind of life (not rich): What would you do if you live in eternity? Would you complain, enjoy, or grow. Phil has been through all the human emotions he can enjoy, from irritation, surprise, being "God", care little about the future, hate, taking advantage of the future, to finally maturing and growing.The best part of this movie is: This is THE MOVIE on how to date a woman! Really! One of my past time is to read for fun (but not really do it) a great many articles on picking up a woman, using NLP (Neural Linguistic Programming), and other tricks.To summarize in a nutshell how to date a woman is not to view a woman as a GAME (or a prey), or make a Woman your Prize, or try to please her too much. A woman can spot a man's sense of insecurity and weaknesses in a mile! You can use all the tricks of NLP or in simple language, using the right keywords and other robotic movies and she can tell. Evolution of a woman over a man on this area is something a man will always loses. It is best not to try to be something you are not.This movie also tells you of the most common mistakes a man can make with dating a women. The way to date a woman or get a woman to like you is to make you HER PRIZE. And this is clearly shown in the movie. By making everyone like you through all the things you do, develop your skills, get other woman to want you, and she will want you. This theory in dating is the key to success and it is one of the few movie where a totally retarded man (like me) on dating can really learn this movie if one has any understand of what is going on in the movie. It is just more than getting a woman it is the development of a man's own identity and what he does.This movie basic premise is to relive your life over and over again, what would you do if given that chance, variety of emotions in the movie, and the meaning of life, romance and everything all in one. What more could you ask? Repeat viewing of this movie gets better and better. It is the best comedy movie I ever seen. In my opinion, the IMDb ranking deserves to be higher than #179 and it is only recent that this has even made it to the top 250. It should go higher still if people realize the hidden messages of the movie: should you be a cynic or should you view life positively. The screenwriter did not realized they have just wrote a masterpiece. The comedy and everything are unique only to this movie and it is well worth the watch! You won't be bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Groundhog Day for Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is the day he relives thousands upon thousands of times, then Groundhog Day for me is the movie I rewatch thousands upon thousands of times. You can watch this film many times before it is the case that you don't pick up on some new nuance of gesture from Murray or some other subtle perfection. One of my favourite lines: "You wanna know about the weather? You're asking the wrong Phil. I'll tell you about the weather. It's cold and it's grey and it's gonna last the rest of your life." His descent into despair allows for some of the best comedy of the film...Nowhere can a great comedian shine better than as a character who has hit rock bottom and has nothing left to lose</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I checked the spoiler so as to not be accused of revealing anything that isn't already known. With that said, this film is a classic tale of redemption ala A Christmas Carol. Instead of ghosts showing him the errors of his ways and warning of the consequences, it is that he must live his in an unchanging way until it dawns on him that life is not what he made of it but what he should make of it. The most poignant part of the film is where he tries to save the life of the old man and realizes that there are things in life which are already determined and are immutable, but most of life is changeable. Listening to the soundtrack evokes powerful responses and imagery. I dare you to see this film and listen to the soundtrack and not be moved. This is what makes this film so great. Just like Scrooge, his transformation is complete and his life will be forever changed for the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw this movie until it had been out on video for a few years, which is a terrible shame - the story is top-notch, the acting is the best you can about find anywhere and it seems almost effortless for the two main characters (Murray &amp; MacDowell).You perhaps have an understanding of the movie, but if not here is the "Reader's Digest" version (note that there's not really a plot "spoiler", per se, but I'll touch on what goes on later in the movie...if that's an issue to you, perhaps you should forego my review until you've seen the movie).Phil Connors (Murray) is a cranky, self-righteous, spoiled weatherman. He has little use for people in general, yet yearly he has to return to the humble Punxsutawney, PA to showcase whether or not Phil (the groundhog, not Murray) sees his shadow or not. This makes him incredibly miserable, having to deal with and interact with the local rural folks, making him feel as though he's trapped in his own private hell for that day.Well, they get stranded in the wonderful, bustling mecca that is Punxsutawney (are you getting my sarcasm? (I can say that 'cuz I'm originally from Johnstown, PA)) and to make matters worse, someone is seeing to it that Phil is forced to repeat this day, with memories and awareness intact no less, ad nauseum, all the while perfecting himself in the process.A terrific feel-good movie that has a great replay value. I've been watching it every Groundhog day now for several years, just to make sure I'm always aware of how great this movie is.Definitely a keeper - buy it, don't rent it.</fullReview>

Some unforgettable one-liners and a really good love story. I don't generally like the romantic/comedy genre, but this movie is an exception.Great character development throughout, solid plot, good casting, great acting and truly original ideas. I loved the variety of ways the main character chooses to live, or rather re-live each day. Bill was very convincing and I think this is one of his best roles, second only to his performance in Mad Dog and Glory.

		<shortDescription>One of Bill Murray's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is it folks. Comedy doesn't get much better than this. Danny Rubin's screenplay is funny and intelligent. Bill Murray easily gives one of his best performances and is perfectly cast. This is simply the best comedy Harold Ramis ever made up to now. This movie has had so many positive comments that there isn't much left to say actually. So I'm just here to throw in my two cents. Though the concept of reliving the same day over and over again is rather original to base a comedy on and the movie is build up flawless, having a lot of funny situations, it still is Bill Murray, with his almost natural sarcasm, that is the main attraction of this movie. I possibly couldn't have imagined another actor playing weatherman Phil Connors. Andie MacDowell was also perfect as Rita, the producer who was practically the complete counterpart of Phil. To put it simple: She loves life, Phil hates it. It even felt okay when those two become romantically involved at the end, 'cause you really want them to (with Rita having such a positive effect on Phil and all).Scriptwriter Danny Rubin really explores every single possible thing one can do when there are absolutely no consequences the next day. Needless to say the possibilities are endless and this movie never becomes boring. Then why am I not rating it 10 out of 10 stars, you might ask. Well, the whole "grumpy, egocentric person becoming a better man"-thing was a bit obvious. And there's another thing: the fact that Phil falls in love with Rita was totally plausible. After all he's got all the time in the world to get to know here. But Rita only had one day to get to know him. So it's a bit silly for her to, at the end of that day, agree with him to rent a house in Punxsatawney and having his kids. Well, it actually isn't suggested in such an explicit way, but still... You get the idea. But then again, this is a romantic comedy (with an underlying supernatural theme), and one of the best ones out there. And I also liked the fact that the phenomenon of the re-occurring Groundhog Day isn't explained in the end. Nice move, Mr. Rubin. GROUNDHOG DAY certainly is a movie that one can watch over and over, again and again. And who knows, you might even become a better person yourself after watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I previously thought this was a bit of an underrated movie, until i saw on IMDb it has an 8.0 average.The movie revolves around Phil (Bill Murray), a melancholy weatherman who one day realizes the futility of his life while down doing the annual "Groundhog Day" story. When he awakes the next day, he eventually discovers he is reliving yesterday. The days keep passing, and he keeps finding himself back on that same day. Phil must decide what do do with that time, and work out how he'll possibly get onto that next day and the rest of his life.It's a good story and is supposed to make us think about how we live our lives. Murray is well supported by Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Worth seeing, with plenty of solid and funny scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today is Yesterday Ad Infinitum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic premise done up with comedy and irony: when Phil (Murray) subtly hints at the beginning how repetitive his 4th time (4th year)reporting in that little town for Groundhog Day seems to be, he has no clue as to what's in store - what repetition really is. This is the amusing version of the chilling half-hour version of "12:01" where the poor guy repeats an hour. There was also a more mundane "12:01" TV movie, also with one day being repeated, which was still entertaining. But this has Murray, who besides expectedly delivering all the goods on the funny aspects of the same day premise, has to also convey some of the wistfulness and despair associated with such a dilemma. To the film's credit, the story doesn't hold back on showing the full potential of such a wild concept: Phil relives the same day for years, gaining new talents &amp; disciplines in the process, and running through the whole gamut of emotional arcs as all that special time passes: shock, bewilderment, recklessness, debauchery, suicide (the aforementioned despair), delusions of godhood and finally a kind of serene acceptance of his strange situation - this last can be construed as 'giving in' to the cosmic joke or lesson played on him.The story has some minor weaknesses: most viewers will notice, for example, after a 2nd viewing, that Phil's music teacher is taking credit for his musical genius at the end even though, for her, only one day of teaching has occurred. Surely, Phil showed her he was very adept at the start of the lesson (unless, he feigned total ignorance of music at the start of the lesson and let her think he so improved after a couple of hours - but this leaps into silliness). There also seems to be a scene missing with respect to Phil's relationship with Rita (MacDowell). I never was clear as to how or why Phil became enamored of her and eventually in love. Of course, he must have been observing her for many days as his day repeated until he came to this realization, but still, this happens suddenly and without any hint of such feelings surfacing prior to his calling her name while making out with another woman. But, overall, the concept was well thought out and well written for this version. As with the better films with such far-out concepts, questions arise afterward - why Phil? Does this happen to other people? To many other people? To everyone at some point? When will it happen to me? It's also a convenient explanation for the deja vu syndrome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while all the elements of a movie will come together making it a great movie. Groundhog Day makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you think. The only reason Groundhog Day originally received as much playtime as it did was because it was a generic "holiday" movie. It's played almost as many times on free TV as Bill Murry relives February 2nd. I, like many, watched it the first time just because it was there. Murry can forget Saturday Night Live fame, it's this cult-status movie that has made him. He's been in some good movies of late but has never been better than in Groundhog Day. In a fair world he'd have a Best Actor Oscar for this effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie show one guy's quality really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just think it's not only a funny movie ,but also a special,wonderful one .We should thank Danny Rubin,the story writer ,who created a great script for this movie. Bill Murray did very well . When he knew he could live in this day all the time ,he did something that any guys would do: First,sex ; (very easy) Second,a lot of money; (not hard ) Third,a woman he love (very hard ) so,although he knew a lot of things about "Rita" ,but he found that the love of woman is very hard to get .In fact ,he understood something should be changed in himself ,and he should know himself , understand the value of people's life and even the meaning of true love .So, he tried to change himself ,and he did it in the end . From all of comments above ,we even can get a standard way of many guys ,they work very hard ,they earn money for fun or sex ,but they can't get true love of woman he love .It's so sarcastic,isn't it? 'Cause that need a big change in himself ,it's the most hard thing,nobody like change ,it's truth ,but they did it in the end just for true love of the woman. so,I think the movie show one guy's quality really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me to be an impossible task to add anything new to the rave reviews this film has received but I'll try.This was made ten years before "Lost In Translation" and Bill Murray gets his true first chance to stretch his acting muscles and give us an extraordinary performance as Phil Connors, a careless, arrogant, egotistical weather man.Every year he sets out for Groundhog Day in Puxatawney, Pennsylvania, to catch his namesake coming up and casting a shadow (or not) for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil doesn't even bother to conceal his contempt for all that surrounds him, including his TV audience.Aye, but here's the rub. This year, Phil is destined to repeat this day over and over until he gets it right. Once it dawns on him that he is in an endless spin cycle of the same twenty four hours, he keeps experimenting with it, playing with it, even resorting to killing himself a few times, knowing that he will wake up again the following day and it will be Groundhog Day all over again.Bill brings an incredibly nuanced performance to the transformation of Phil. Andie McDowell (whom I normally despise and put her in the same one-note class as Mary Steenbergen, all hair and non-stop-come-hither eyes) as Rita, his producer who is completely turned off by Phil, plays well against him. But it is not about getting the girl at all.And this is where the movie aims for an incredible target, that of inner transformation for the sake of that transformation alone. In hands other than those of Harold Ramis (who has a small role in the movie also) this lofty ideal could have crashed and burned, but here it is extraordinary to see this egotistical man become of value to himself, tiny step by tiny step.He takes this endless eternity of the same day and starts to learn ice sculpture, piano playing, CPR, among other things. We don't have to see many of his attempts on screen and we are slowly made aware that he has befriended many in the town and is needed every day for aid and comfort and even life saving work.None of the points we observe are two by fours over the head. I would actually use the word "Profound" about this film. There is much to mull over, how are we all spending our days, could we be of more value to those around us but more importantly to ourselves if we took the time to become aware.Inspiring on all levels, superlative in both its comic and romantic genius, this film is up there in my 100 best of all time. The message lingers. A must see. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super comedy, whyever you're laughing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really super, affirmative comedy. This film works because it functions as a vehicle for Bill Murray (as weatherman Phil Connors) but without being bereft of any character or narrative itself. The story ? a man stuck as if in time, living the same very normal day in a parochial corner of Pennsylvania ? sets up an endless stream of gags: Murray not only rises to them but also subverts many. You feel drawn in by the humour, but its never rendered as contrived.What I like best is that the compromises are few. Phil's initial misanthropy is worn away over the course of the film ? it's the soul of the narrative ? but Murray's own particular brand of ennui-comique is not thrown out with the bathwater. I felt I could still laugh along with his wry weariness even as I felt my heart warming.It's not without cheese or clumsiness: there's a scene interpolated that was patently filmed on a completely different day (set?). But if you don't laugh or generally feel better disposed to people after having seen it you've a heart of granite. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if you had to live the same day over and over and over again? Would you pick the day you were in Punxsatawney, Pa. to watch a furry animal pop out of a hole to see if winter comes in 6 weeks, or in less time? I've been to Punxsatawney, and I wouldn't want to relive that day over and over again either. Unfortunately for Bill Murray's TV weatherman character Phil Conners, that's exactly what happens in this odd little comedy directed by Harold Ramis. What begins as a comedy about "big time" TV people from Pittsburgh covering the February 2nd rite of passage in Western Pennsylvania. The story ultimately revolves around how Conners is an unhappy man and somehow, he's stuck in a time warp that he can't get out of. He tries being nice, he tries be a bastard, he tries driving out of town, he tries stealing the groundhog, he even tries dying. Nothing gets him out of February 2 in Punxsatawney. Among the many groundhog days, he discovers the world, the people around him. He's saddened by the death of a man he passed every morning. He meets a person he knew in high school, and his attitude towards him changes over time, and he realizes the happiness he needs to fulfill his life is right there in front of him. Sure it's cheesy, sure it's predictable, but there's enough Bill Murray humor early in the film and Bill Murray charm in the end of the movie to hold it together. There are some cute scenes where "one day" he asks a random woman in a coffee shop what her favorite something is, and the "next day" uses that information to score a date. There are little scenes like that through the film that rely on Murray, and the audience, buying into the premise of the film. Andie MacDowell plays Conners' TV producer and Chris Elliott plays his camera man, each has the thankless job of playing characters who have no idea that Conners is reliving each day over and over again. One thing that bothered me was the movie was not shot in Punxsatawney, rather some town in Illinois, and that bothered me a bit, but most people wouldn't know unless they were told. Oh well, at least it wasn't Toronto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1990's Comedy Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GROUNDHOG DAYStarring: Bill MurrayGenre: ComedyRated PGStar Rating: ***1/2 out of 5This is one of my favorite Bill Murray movies! In this movie Bill Murray plays a weather man named Phil Conners who travels to Pittsburgh, PA every year to for the Puxatawney Phil event commonly recognized as Groundhog Day that rolls around every February and Phil is doing covering a story about a weather forecasting "rat" (is what he calls it). This is his fourth year doing the story and makes no effort to hide his frustration. After the day Phil goes back to his hotel and then the next morning he wakes up the radio alarm says that it is Groundhog Day, even thought that was yesterday which is like a deja vu! So then he keeps reliving the same day over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again! Which I thought was funny that he kept having the same day be repeated over and over and over and over and over and over and over again!SPOILER WARNING: In the end he wakes up and it is February 3rd. I'm sure he was glad that whole rerun of Groundhog Day on the same year was over.BOTTOM LINE: ONE OF MY FAVORITE 1990's COMEDY CLASSICS!</fullReview>

This movie could have been ruined if the actor played it in a slapstick manner. Murray's dry delivery is perfectly matched for this dryly witty movie.

		<shortDescription>Comedy at its Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is caught in a time loop to create what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest comedies ever. This is one of those films I can watch over and over again and still be entertained and full of laughter.Bill Murray is one of those people who could say 'goose' and I would still laugh. His delivery of lines is always spot on and his physical acting is near perfect. In this film he gives a good mix of sarcastic wit, sadness and joy which other actors could not match. Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott provide good support but the real gem amongst the supporting cast is without doubt, Stephen Tobolowski as Ned Ryerson. The scenes between Phil and Ned stand out and provide great comic moments each time, the bit where Phil punches Ned cracks me up every time.Although far fetched, the story is fantastic and original. I remember a film I saw called 12:01 had a similar concept but did not come close and went to tiresome lengths to explain how the main character was caught in the time loop which Groundhog Day leaves a mystery. The love story between Phil and Rita causes a wonderful character transformation for Phil which is both funny and touching, leaving the audience with a great feeling of satisfaction.Harold Ramis does a very good job with what is actually a very challenging film if done right. The attention to detail with extras does well to maintain credibility and although subtle, is very noticeable. The extreme close up of the clock is very expressive in showing the 'Weight of Time', pausing the laughter for just enough time for the audience to feel great empathy towards Phil. Although more famous for being Egon in Ghostbusters, Ramis should regard this as his best achievement.This film makes me so happy when I watch it and that seems to be the overall effect on everyone who has seen this film which is why it is regarded as such a classic. Instantly quotable, this is one of those films that can be a real centre piece in conversation. Groundhog Day illustrates the phrase 'if at first you don't succeed, try, try again' and very effectively puts this message across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the timing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this movie if you want to laugh (over...and over..and over...again!) With an irresistible blend of slapstick, intelligent dialogue, and more running gags than probably any other comedy since "Some Like It Hot", it's perfect for almost anyone old enough to appreciate Bill Murray in his most finely-tuned performance. I can't praise one of my favorite comedies--and comedians--too highly.In years to come, when people mention comedies from the raunchy, fluid-obsessed nineties, this film will stand alone as one that always aimed above the belt--and succeeded on its own terms. In terms of sophistication, it's well below Woody Allen, but way above the Farrellys, on a par with the Sturges comedies of the 40's and...ah, who cares? If Bill Murray's effortless charisma and fantastic comedic timing doesn't win you over, nothing I can say or do will.Oh yeah--Kudos to Harold Ramis for avoiding the usual Sci-Fi-Funny treatment (time machines, wacky scientists, gaping plot holes) for this film. So an arrogant weatherman is inexplicably stuck in the same 24-hour cycle--who cares how it happened? It's damn funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes it's true, this is no mere star vehicle for Bill Murray. It's a truly ingenius, inventive, funny, and touching comedy-fantasy. There is so much to love. Director/co-writer places brilliant touches throughout, particularly in never explaining what causes Phil's time-warp. It doesn't even really seem to have a purpose at all and the way Phil eventually manipulates his situation and then comes to use it to better himself is so wonderful and organic that it makes this movie practically the best "feel-good" movie since the days of Frank Capra. And it doesn't even seem sappy!!! Plus there is no shortage of humor- Bill Murray is at the top of his game and Andie MacDowell makes an ideal romantic companion. Even Chris Elliot (who has been terrible in movies lately) seems funny.This movie is a modern classic and its stature and memory will outlive that of movies like "A Beautiful Mind" or "American Beauty" (two movies you should avoid at all costs). Among films made in the 1990s, this easily ranks in the top ten and surely among the top 100 of all time. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As mainstream US romantic comedy goes, this is one of the better ones.Bill Murray's career was always leading up to this movie, and he really doesn't disappoint. Could anyone else have embodied in weatherman Phil Connors the same qualities? Day after day after groundhog day?Andie MacDowell has serious limitations as an actress, but her role as TV producer and Connor's romantic interest suits her, and falls within her range of believability. Add Chris Elliot as the oafish cameraman Larry (every good film has a 'Larry' in it!) and you have all the ingredients for a feel-good film.OK, so the premise is often less than believable - a guy lives February 2 over and over again, and everything is always reset at 6 AM, apart from his own memory and ability which he is able to work on. And the happy ending lets things down slightly - it would maybe be better if he worked hard to achieve the perfect day, and then had to do it again, for all eternity.But it's an enjoyable film, made by the little throwaway lines (Larry: 'he might be OK...' and the supporting characters. You'll never listen to 'I got you babe' in the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Soul Reclaimed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the "gift" or "curse" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like "It's a Wonderful Life," is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the "characters" he meets. But like most "everymen," he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.He can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long. I find this movie so intriguing, not for what it says but for what it teaches. Some don't like the ending, but whatever the forces are that bring it about, it has to be. If we accept that premise, it's OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A briliant comedy with an important theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a comic mastermind, Harold Ramis has made a brilliant film that deals with the universal human spirituality and the importance of personal contributions to the world we live in. The beauty of this film is that a concept as utterly impossible as repetition of time is made completely and undeniably believeable, and then used to comment on the need for selflessness in today's society. In my notes from this film, I find the quote, `since time and talents are all we have, that's what we should give.' Groundhog Day delivers this powerful warhead in the non-threatening missile of a Bill Murray comedy. Although zany and comedic, the movie has an intended message within the script, that selflessness is both a virtue to be strived for and not a characteristic to be ashamed of. If this film had just been written as a screwball comedy, and Ramis had tried to include the theme secondhand, the message would have no power. Morality and message never works when injected into a film de facto; they only appear as contrived and misplaced. This film is a perfect blend of comedy and serious introspective reflection for me. In my personality, just as in the movie, I can effectively juxtapose desires to strive for selflessness and generosity with quotes like `I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster and drank pina coladas. At sunset we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over?' Crass comedy doesn't get anywhere with me, but I can appreciate a joke like that. I think it's just my convert sense of humor, which sometimes does me more harm then good. It is a disappointment that much of today's comedy has departed from clever comedy with a positive theme to crass scatological humor or anger-laced ranting. The classic comedies of the eighties and early nineties have given way at the box office to films like American Pie, Dude Where's My Car, and Saving Silverman. At least when Groundhog Day had a sexual joke it was done tastefully. We've degraded drastically from clever word play and wit to adolescents fornicating with pastries on camera. I'll stay with the oldies, but the goodies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the notable exception of film critics, everyone who has seen this movie loves it. It seems that Hollywood is stuck with about seven basic plots. Here's a movie that is totally different. A new idea, a comment on our humanity, a metaphor for our lives, and we're not scolded about our failings, we're allowed to laugh as we learn - what were the critics thinking about with their ho hum reviews?The plot? Bill Murray is a conceited and arrogant Pittsburgh weatherman doomed for all eternity to repeat February 2 in boring Punxatawnie, PA over and over again. At least until he gets it right. What's right? Murray finds out the hard way, and you'll have a delightful trip learning with him. And you might discover something about yourself along the way.Murray is the only person alive who could have pulled off the lead role, and Andie McDowell plays the innocent foil just perfectly. The setting in Punxatawnie is cleverly broadly American. Critic Roger Ebert recently asked why we see no movies about small town Americans who are as lovable and eccentric as those in certain Irish and English settings such as "Waking Ned Divine." Well here it is Ebert, the characters and the actors portraying them are as eccentric and lovable as they come. They make the movie work.Harold Ramus did absolutely nothing wrong putting this movie together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful fantasy/comedy -- actually about spirituality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day, the holiday, provides the springboard for a lively romantic tale, very funny -- with about twenty times the imagination of most such fare. The subject, the hidden message (not hidden very deeply), if you will, is about what it feels like to be stuck -- to be unable to transcend your own problems and limitations. Sounds like a film about learning to be mature, about being willing to listen to others, learning to care about them. These are spiritual matters. But this film has Bill Murray, right? And what a fine job he does. No one would go to see a straight-out religious film about learning to be kind, learning to listen, about what really makes living worthwhile -- well, OK, a few people might. But make it into a lively comedy (and why not? Dante's great poem was "The Divine Comedy," after all) -- and you get something like this. "Groundhog Day" should be classed alongside, or even above, to my mind, "It's a Wonderful Life." Every parent should take their kid to see this film -- if you have a larger family, take each one of your kids individually, make the occasion special thereby. Then talk about it together, ask your child they liked about it. This is non-denominational spirituality; Gandhi said "God has no religion." This comedy has that kind of Gandhian quality, in the best sense. This film can be especially wonderful and powerful for young men, even teenagers -- because it seems like Murray's character is happy exploring all kinds of mischief, delighted about getting away with everything -- almost. Then he gets kind of angry. Personally, growing up, especially during my teen years, I thought being angry was what being a man was all about. Not that I always "thought" about it; but a deeper, subconscious feeling lived inside me, the sense that anger would protect me, or make me strong. Hey, don't get me wrong -- seeing this film didn't get me over that. But getting over it, or at leasting understanding where I'd been, etc., was a huge step for me. "Groundhog Day" made me receptive to more positive thinking, because it didn't preach. Oh, did I mention I couldn't stop laughing in the theater and worried about embarrassing other people around me because I was laughing so much? Most of them were laughing, too. A great film; I really believe that. People love Charlie Chaplin's "Little Tramp" -- the same kind of sentiment applies for me to this film. I buy very few films, since renting nowadays, and cable and satellite dishes all work so well. But "Groundhog Day" is one of about ten videos I've bought in the last twenty years. And it's the most watched and rewatched of the lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Simply put, the premise of the movie is based upon the belief that we are doomed to repeat the errors of our lives unless we learn from them, but applies this principle literally to the main character Phil.I agree with some of the earlier comments that this is an inspiring movie that should be watched every few years to remind us what life is all about.That being said I have a question and a comment. After watching this movie again tonight I decided to look up the other credits for the writer. I was sadly disappointed that there are not any other significant credits. How is it that someone who created a work of art so clever and sublime, could not be more accomplished in the film industry?Second, It appears that this movie is a litmus test for personalities. People either love it or hate it. I have seen this movie with several groups of people and have found that people who are annoyed by this film are also people that I don't care to associate with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Overlooked Gem that Deserved a Best Picture Nomination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Capra-esque piece of serio-comic fantasy, "Groundhog Day" was rightly hailed by critics and the public in 1993, and subsequently robbed of a Best Picture nomination in the year of "Schindler's List," "In the Name of the Father" and "The Piano." Was "The Fugitive" REALLY a better movie than this extrememly clever, heartfelt film? I don't think so.Bill Murray was perfect as Phil Connors, and watching his character evolve from smarmy misanthrope to playful Don Juan to a hopeless suicide case to a true romantic is a joy. Long before the Academy's snub of Murray's "Rushmore" performance, they snubbed him for this almost forgotten gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the cleverest, funniest, most charming films I have ever seen. I completely agree with another reviewer who said that this is one of the most underrated films of all time. The basic premise seems ridiculous - Phil, an unsavoury, ambitious weather reporter living his least favourite day of the year over and over again and is the only person aware of it. There's no explanation for it, it's just happening. But the explanation is not needed for the film-goer - our treat is to live the predicament with Phil, to watch him try everything he can think of to get to tomorrow. The script is wonderfully tight, with no duff jokes and Bill Murray gives his best performance ever - his attempts to seduce Andie MacDowell have got to be seen to believed...hilarious! The ending is 'feel good' epitomised, but not sickening in any way. I'm going to stick my neck out and say that it is nearly impossible to dislike this film (I'm sure some hard-hearted person will somehow hate it)...a must see...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The insane idea of having Bill Murray play a tv-weatherman who has to go to a small backwater town to cover the appearance of the Groundhog makes for some excellent laughs in this Harold Ramis/Bill Murray-comedy.Bill Murray obviously enjoys himself playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors and it is without a doubt Murray's dry, cynical performance that saves Groundhog Day from being just another Hollywood comedy.The underlying morality of the movie to me seems a bit over the top. Far from disliking movies with a message, at times it was simply a bit too moralizing. I definitely watch this movie for the excellent performance by Murray, and others should as well. If they get a kick out of the moralizing undercurrent it's just great - I just don't dig it that much (but yes - I *do* agree with the message of the movie!)..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a very well made comedy with an original and unique premise. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as a cynical, embittered weatherman who has a Twilight Zone kind of experience in which he re-lives the same day over and over again. I saw this movie during a very difficult period in my own life, and it was an amazing uplifting experience to watch it. So for me, personally, this is one of my favorite movies. Phil's (Murray) character gradually evolves from cynicism, despair, and selfishness to altruism. This change must come from within. And also, after seeing it for the third or fourth time, I realized what a metaphor it was for reincarnation, the belief that we come back lifetime after lifetime, gradually attaining a more enlightened state.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a decade pathetically short of great comedies, this is one of the few stand-outs. While many critics and users have commented on the film's existentialism and intelligence, the truth is it is also genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, something many intelligent dark comedies can't seem to manage. Although Bill Murray is almost always good in supporting roles, his lead roles have been notoriously uneven ("Ghostbusters" and "Stripes" vs. "Quick Change" and "The Man Who Knew Too Little"). This, however, is clearly one of his greatest roles, and he obviously has fun playing it. Best of all, the film is truly original (ironically, a film about repetitiveness is different from anything else you've ever seen). Although it has been mostly overlooked in its own time, there is no doubt in my mind that, years from now, this will be recognized as one of the great films of the decade, if not the century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Murray was born to play Phil. I have never seen him more at ease and natural than in Groundhog Day. The great thing about this one is it's not just another redemption film where the main character changes his ways based upon one single event. For instance in Good Will Hunting we are led to believe that Will is a whole new person based upon a few counseling sessions. We don't know for sure, but it might have taken Phil years of reliving the same day to get it right. It's so much fun watching Bill Murray's character change and evolve, and the scene in which he quotes Chekhov is touching and memorable. Ironically Bill Murray plays the main character in Scrooged, another tale of redemption that couldn't come close to Groundhog Day in terms of originality, script, and imagination. Groundhog day, however, is Bill Murray's best performance to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Will Always Be February 2 in My Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say that a symptom of insanity is repeating the same thing, over and over again, expecting different results. Under those standards anyone with a nine to five is certifiable. Yet you add some magical realism and the comedic abilities of Bill Murray and you have yourself arguably one of the best comedies ever put to screen. Certainly one of the best made in the last twenty years.Groundhog Day starts with a particularly onerous Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors (Murray) sent to Punxsutawney Pennsylvania for the annual Punxsutawney Groundhog Day celebration. He lives that day much like any other day; cynical, reluctant and crabby. Thanks to a freak blizzard that shuts down all travel, Phil and his crew (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott) grudgingly stay another day in town. Phil wakes up the next morning to find it is once again Groundhog Day with only he having memory of the previous day. Thus Phil is forced to relive February 2 seemingly for all eternity.When first proposed by co-writers Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (who also directed), studio executives weren't confident that a comedy repeating the same day over and over would keep the audience interested. After all how many times can you see someone say and do the exact same thing hundreds of times without asking for a refund? If you haven't seen Groundhog Day; first off you're a terrible person, and second it's not a movie on repeat.It's a film that dresses an age old hypothetical in new clothes. What would you do if you had all the time in the world? Phil essentially lives forever in a time loop, at first confused, then driven mad, then realizes the potential of his unique situation. He learns everything he can about those around him and improves himself by taking piano lessons, learning to ice sculpt and reading French poetry. How long did it take him to learn all this? Well some say seven years of practice, one hour everyday will make you proficient at anything. Ramis claims that the span of the movie is closer to 10,000 years. Yikes! All that time before internet was readily available? Here to hoping Punxsutawney has a good library.Though focusing on that would take away from the elegant character study and the warm humor of Groundhog Day. Murray transforms from a selfish man into a celebrated pillar of charity and warmth all through the knowledge he has gained of those around him. Does he do this for spiritual transcendence; desire to break the time loop; to get into Andie McDowell's pants; perhaps all, none or something deeper.Over thousands of years of existence humanity is fairly certain of only a handful of things, one of them being we have a unique ability to feel empathy for one another. It's innate and powerful if we only heed to it and one can philosophize that how we structure society, religion and 501(c)3's are largely based on our impulses. Groundhog Day centers on that reality and makes us ponder the value and beauty of human life. When Phil saves a man from choking to death or saves a child from falling off a tree branch he does so out of love for his fellow man.Yet let's not forget, Groundhog Day is ultimately a comedy meant to coax its audience to laugh. Bill Murray's ego-centrism and sighs of futility are the clear comedic highlight of the film and is definitely a career high point for the Saturday Night Live (1975) alum. Yet let's not count out the gregarious supporting work by Brian Doyle-Murray, Stephen Tobolosky and, of course, Andie MacDowell. Also in the mix is Chris Elliott who has the thankless job of playing second fiddle to Murray and somewhat succeeds.The themes of Groundhog Day are benefited by repeated viewing so I highly recommend seeing it again if you haven't viewed it since its last TNT rerun. If you have never seen Groundhog Day watch it as soon as possible and witness a near perfect comedy with a surprising amount of depth. Watch it, and then watch it again, and again, and again. After all everyone can afford to go a little insane every now and then.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In films, we often see people who for one reason or another have to live their lives over, or some segment of it. In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray, who plays weatherman Phil, has to live over Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He doesn't want to go in the first place -- it's his fourth boring trip -- but he does. Because of an impending blizzard, they get stuck there. But Phil gets really stuck. He finds he can't leave the day, the town, or the people.Every day at the same time, his alarm radio turns on and plays "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. And it's Groundhog Day. At first Phil is furious and takes it out on his broadcast about the ceremony, angering his associates (Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot) who didn't like him much to begin with. As the day continues to repeat itself, Phil finds different ways to deal with it. He picks up a woman, proposes to her so he can have sex with her, knowing that the next day the whole experience will be wiped out for her. He sees an old friend, an insurance man, puts up with him for so long, and then punches him.Finally Phil figures out how to cope with the day, which he's resigned to re-live for the rest of his life.Very funny film with Bill Murray in top form as Phil. Murray underplays the role, which somehow makes his lines funnier, dripping as they often are with sarcasm. He's very funny, and funniest when he's pretending to be sincere.The best thing about Groundhog Day is that, like City Slickers, underneath the humor, it's quite serious. It's about how we choose to deal with the situation that we're in, what we would do if we could do a part of our life over, discovering who we are, and letting go of preconceived notions.The film reminded me of something a teacher once said. If you were in an airport and there was an announcement that you would never be able to leave, every need would be met, but you would stay in the airport forever, what would happen? The teacher pointed out that initially everybody would be trying to figure a way out. It's only when you realize that there is no way out that there would be an opportunity for something wonderful to develop in that place, among those people.Groundhog Day is a wonderful film, beautifully directed by Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the screenplay with Danny Rubin, that delivers a great message using humor. You'll probably never want to hear "I Got You Babe" again, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good comedy starring Bill Murray, where he plays a weatherman reliving his same day over and over again. The plot is intriguing, cleverly directed to mix in the the right amount of comedy and drama to deliver a very suspenseful and fast-paced movie - nothing slapstick or over-the-top.We get to see Murray's character become frustrated again and again with his reoccurring days, and see him slowly attempt to transform his personality for better or for worse from all the second chances he has been given in each new day. We kind of relate to the problems he has been experiencing, from jobs to relationships. It's exciting to see how Murray will try get himself out of this repeated day predicament. Bill Murray did a great job in his role, as did actress Andie MacDowell in her performance as Rita - a very believable portrayal.The writers also did a great job on the script, mixing in life philosophies, tastefully done humor and imagination. Overall, this is very good film for all to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Practice Makes Perfect, Or Keep At It Until You Get It Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have about twenty, or so, films included in my Top 5 Movies of All-Time. I would not be surprised if some others have that same dilemma. Somewhere in that top five is the movie Groundhog Day (1993). After much consideration, I have come to the conclusion that Groundhog Day is a perfect movie. Also, I have to acknowledge that statement's clear contradiction that while Groundhog Day is a perfect movie, it does not necessarily mean that it is the greatest movie of all-time. You see, a film can be perfect by soundly succeeding in delivering its message, or by finding its mark in what it is trying to convey/accomplish. Other films I believe to be perfect are: The Natural (1984), It's A Wonderful Life (1946), High Noon (1952), and D.O.A. (1950). Those films may not be the best movies of all-time, but they are perfect cinematic works. Groundhog Day is perfect because it deals with a concept that has endless possibilities. This is a film that easily could have a running time of 3 1/2 to 4 hours without diminishing its quality and enjoyment. Groundhog Day delves into a seemingly Omnipotent universe of whacked out metaphysics and Twilight Zone type possibilities, and that abstractness creates an infinite number of mind-bending/logic defying feats that Phil finds himself able to perform to the amazement of all those who stand to witness. In essence, the powers that be allow time to stand still for Phil as he goes through a long and arduous period of adjustment, and he is given, basically, an eternity to "suddenly" transform right before Rita's eyes.If you really pay attention, Groundhog Day tells you what you need to know about Harold Ramis when he is at his best as a writer (and director). Ramis is able to smoothly and seamlessly tie together the main and sub-plots of a story in such a way that the viewer is treated to a believable sequence of events, no matter how fantastic the circumstances may appear. Bill Murray is his usually excellent self, and Andie MacDowell, as Rita, is the most beautiful woman in the world. The rest of the cast is beyond outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Fantasy Fable: Bill Murray's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray will be remembered for the "Ghostbusters" films but this is his best. This is a fable that most of us can relate to: what if we could do it all over again? Mistakes, broken promises, fatal errors that ruined our life and cannot be undone. In "Groundhog Day"' a self-centered egotistic man is "cursed" to relive the same 24 hour day over and over again. The spell is broken when he finally gets it right, which appears to take 40 or 50 times. Chris Elliot (the cameraman) gives a surprisingly restrained performance and Andie MacDowell plays "Rita" the TV producer. She is a small town girl that wants a better life. Cleverly written with many plot twists. Every day is almost the same but slightly different. For example, Phil robs an armored truck, and dresses in a "Superfly" outfit complete with fancy car. His "date" dresses like a "French Maid". Such outrageous events do not repeat and happen only once. It's always 6 AM again with the radio playing "I Got You Babe" and Phil jumping into a freezing cold shower; heading off again to re-tape the same "Groundhog Day" segment for a small time Pittsburgh Pa. TV station.Almost a "10" but I give it a "9" because I do not like the suicidal implications of the film. Phil gives up on himself and decides to die in a very violent manner because he cannot move forward. He jumps off a building. Electrocutes himself. Finally, he drives off a cliff and the truck bursts into a ball of fire; witnessed with horror by his film crew. (The groundhog is "driving"!) It's both hilarious and terrible to watch. But he doesn't die. He wakes up in bed at 6AM again and again.This film is actually embraced by many religious groups for its unique and unusual philosophical message. Why does the same day keep repeating? There is a hint in the film: Listen for a soundtrack "ping" when he washes his hands at 6:01 AM. It's a time warp. Is he being cursed or blessed by an evil supernatural force or an angel? Because Phil finally gets it right, I'm betting on the angel. Like "It's a Wonderful Life", the weather doesn't change until the day does. Phil is now a changed man with a purpose in life and finally wins the girl's heart. The last song in the movie is from "Brigadoon", the musical about a magical Scottish village, suspended in time. Harold Ramis both co-writes and directs. His best film also!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Bill Murray Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Ramis and Danny Rubin, based on a story by Rubin.Bill Murray plays Phil, a TV weatherman working for a local station in Pennsylvania but convinced that national news stardom is in his grasp. Phil displays a charm and wit on camera that evaporates the moment the red light goes off; he is bitter, appallingly self- centered, and treats his co-workers with contempt, especially his producer Rita,played by Andie MacDowell; and cameraman Larry,portrayed by Chris Elliot.On February 2, 1992, Phil, Rita, and Larry are sent on an assignment that Phil especially loathes: the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, PA, where the citizens await the appearance of Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who will supposedly determine the length of winter by his ability to see his own shadow. Phil is eager to beat a hasty retreat, but when a freak snowstorm strands him in Punxsutawney, he wakes up the next morning with the strangest sense of dj? vu: he seems to be living the same day over again. The next morning it happens again, and then again. Soon, no matter what he does, he's stuck in February 2, 1992; not imprisonment nor attempted suicide nor kidnapping the groundhog gets him out of the loop. But the more Phil relives the same day, the more he's forced to look at other people's lives, and something unusual happens: he begins to care about others. He starts to respect people, he tries to save the life of a homeless man, and he discovers that he's falling in love with Rita and therefore wants to be someone that she could love in return.Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable.Aside from that,Ramis' direction is often too cool and restrained as he wisely avoids playing into the tale's underlying sentimentality.Overall,it is an entertaining film, but it's also one that can subtly, obliquely inspire you to get out of your rut, do the right things, and move on with your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that you might consider re-watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a perfect movie to watch during a rainy evening, while sitting on a cozy couch, covered with a warm blanket, and with a bag of popcorn in hand. It's a well-structured comedy offering many laughs, with a decent plot, which doesn't necessarily involve a lot of thinking.Phil (Bill Murray), a tired and self-centered weatherman, goes on a trip to Punxsutawney (fancy name I must say), Pennsylvania, in order to cover a story of the infamous Groundhog Day celebrations that take place there every year. Along with him come an irritated cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and a pretty newbie producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). It seems like it will be just another one-day excursion, just to inform people about another useless festivities that involve a groundhog predicting the coming of spring. However, due to horrible weather conditions the trio has to settle down in the city for another night. And then the strangest thing happens. Phil wakes up to the same radio announcements; sees exactly the same view outside his window; gets the same greetings from a hotel lady. And soon discovers that Groundhog Day is going to take place all over again, and again, and again?So why not take advantage of this bizarre situation? At first, he attempts to live his life to the fullest, letting go of all the greed, selfish desires, and sexual temptations. By spending this one particular day anew he gets to know every single person in this small town, and is able to profit from all the information acquired. He also tries to get closer to Rita but fails miserably. That's phase one.In phase two, Phil realizes (after falling off a cliff in a car) that he became immortal somehow and won't die. So he tries to commit suicide in every possible way and still wakes up at 6 a.m. in the same bed listening to a song by Sonny &amp; Cher. He starts to feel miserable and tired of all the mess that he's in. And then comes phase three. He once again wants to seduce Rita. He gets to know her better day after day, in order to finally be able to sleep with her. However, as convincing as he may be, she still rejects him after all. The ultimate way to make her fall in love with him is through good deeds. After all that time he understands that by being altruistic and helpful towards other people goes a road to a woman's heart.The main quality of the movie is contained in its ability to show mostly the same sequences all over again (well, that's what it's all about), but do it in such a manner that isn't boring or dull. Even though it's the same day, the events, actions, and people that the viewer sees are different or presented in an alternative manner. This is probably one of Bill Murray's funniest roles. I always admired his passion for acting, and in Groundhog Day he is convincing enough to say that he might as well play in joyful comedies, as in respectable dramas. His performance makes the movie much more pleasurable, as we are able to look at the transformation of his character and the gradual changes that he goes through from point A (destroy, burn, steal) to point B (love, care, understand). All in all, I won't say that Groundhog Day is my favorite comedy, but it definitely showed me that even some light-hearted comedies are able to pass a meaningful message to the world, and at the same time, make you laugh at the ridiculousness of their storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect analogy for jyj meetings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie for all the obvious comedic reasons, but what makes it special for me is how it perfectly captured 4 years of my life at my companies regional meetings. We literally discussed word for word the same issues and solutions for 4 straight years every three months. The only thing different was the backgrounds of the power-point presentations and the % differences in growth quarter after quarter. About 3 meetings into this trend, I dubbed our meetings groundhog day. Did they change? Sadly no, they just started saying, "we want to avoid another 'groundhog day' in every presentation. I hope you are able to avoid this tragedy at your company. Great movie, and hilarious business analogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Murray is Magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray is at his very best playing Phil Connors, the egotistical T.V. weatherman. He is sent to Punxsatawney to see if Phil The Groundhog is going to predict a longer or shorter winter. Its a yearly festival and Connors is on his fifth year of covering the event. Then something inexplicable happens....Phil Connors is stuck in Groundhog Day. He is greeted every morning by the voices of Sonny and Cher on radio. (pure hell !!) The day does not repeat for others...so his problem is strictly personal. Its a clever premise, and is used well to provide some interesting humorous events. Connors finally (after some strange adventures) realizes that living "one perfect day"...is the only way out. He needs to make Rita (Andie McDowell) a sweeter than sweet whiter than white T.V. producer, fall in love with him. Not an easy task......she is a good Catholic girl who loves French poetry. We never find out how long Phil is stuck in this condition...but thats O.K., this is good fun. Ultimately, its a feel good movie. It also presents some interesting existential and philosophical dilemmas. Always entertaining---always highly amusing---Groundhog Day is truly memorable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's MISTER Punxsutawney Phil To You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A newscast weather reporter wakes up in a small sleepy town of Punxsutawney on February 2nd (a day like today) to see whether the groundhog will forecast whether winter will last much longer or not. Except that he will be reliving the same day over, and over, and over, and over? That's the premise of one of the best comedies I've ever seen: Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray and Andie McDowell. At first it might have seemed an ordinary comedy but when things started getting real weird and absurd is when Groundhog really takes flight and becomes an extraordinary story of perseverance, love and redemption. The reason I love Groundhog Day is that you start with a cynical and arrogant character named Phil (Bill Murray here at his very best) who unwillingly goes out on this special report about the Groundhog Day traditional annual event but would much rather be elsewhere. He's such a big city guy that he can't barely stand having to spend his precious time in this town, doing this silly report that he'd much rather not do at all, accompanied by his news crew of Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot). His day's experience is detailed extensively and it may seem that it's going nowhere until? Phil wakes up the next morning to Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe on the alarm clock. From then on it's as if he was having a dj? vu moment except that he's reliving the same day all over again. At first, he brushes it off as coincidental but as the day progresses he realizes that every event during his day in Punxsutawney is repeating itself and he can foresee every single thing that's about to happen beforehand. In the following days after his initial surprise Phil feels invincible, able to do and say things in a perfected way and hoping that "doing it well" is good enough for him to allow him to see the "next day" but, regardless of what he does, he wakes up to I Got You Babe every morning, in the same room, having to co-exist with same locals and visitors that come to see the groundhog predict the weather.READ FULL REVIEW IN MY BLOG ITALO'S CORNER</fullReview>

Phil(Bill Murray) is tired of the yearly assignment with the buck toothed animal when he and a news woman, Rita(Andie Macdowell) travel there for the report. They become stuck in town when a blizzard strikes. Phil begins to wake up on the same day every morning to the radio playing, I got you babe. He eventually realizes that he can use this time loop to gather information and use it to his benefit, including the seduction of his coworker, Rita. Murray is funny as hell and Mcdowell holds her own and Groundhog Day works on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film to remember on the day you die. "Have a lived even a day in my little life like the last day of Groundhog Day?" But then Groundhog Day tells us it takes infinite practice to live one such day. Are we then doomed to live out the failed Groundhog Days? Most likely. Perhaps we can shorten the practice period? Unlikely. So the movie is an exercise in envy as the jerk gets a chance to un-jerk his life - no, even just one day of his jerky life. This movie was itself created from 10,000 cycles of filming. It only exited the loop when the director got it perfect. The end-product is what we see now. Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sent to Punxatawny to broadcast on the annual Groundhog Day festivities, obnoxious, ambitious, arrogant TV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) is put out because he regards the assignment as beneath him. Further irritated due to being snowed in, his annoyance is complete when he finds himself waking up, over and over, to the same day.This film, nominally a comedy, almost defies classification. At the heart of it is the way Phil's experience of re-living the same day over and over gradually liberates him from the petty minded unpleasantness which governs his life, and enables his innate likability (which he has suppresses) to come out. But the variations in the repeat experiences is perhaps the easiest element for the viewer to enjoy, particularly when Phil comes to realise that he can actually do anything he wants in the knowledge that he will be free of the consequences when Sonny and Cher wake him again next morning.There is never any explanation for this, and it doesn't matter in the slightest - the film is always entertaining, always interesting, and is a true original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Bill Murray's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is simple, and yet intriguingly complex at the same time: a man is forced to repeat the same day over and over and over again until he learns the lessons he needs to learn and is able to escape from the cycle.The man is Bill Murray, playing Phil Connors - a Pittsburgh weatherman sent to Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania on February 2 to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in that small town. Phil is not a nice guy. He's self-centred and egotistical and selfish. He considers no one's feelings important but his own, and he hates the annual assignment in Punxsatawney. He hates the work, he hates his co-workers, he hates the place, he hates the festivities and he hates the people, and he can't wait to get out. He treats everything and everyone as obstacles in the way of him getting what he wants. But stranded by a blizzard, Phil wakes up the next day only to discover that it's not the next day. It's still February 2 - still Groundhog Day - and he has to do the same things all over. And the cycle keeps repeating - which is a wonderful analogy for his empty and shallow life.The point of the movie is how repeating the same day gradually changes Phil. At first he sees it as he sees the rest of life - as a chance to manipulate. And so he spends every day learning about people - and particularly about the attractive women in town so that - with him being able to remember and them not - he's able to get whatever he wants by learning their likes and dislikes as a result of perhaps centuries of living the same day (because we're never really told how long the cycle goes on.) Phil develops a particular interest in Rita (Andie McDowell) - his beautiful producer. At first he manipulates her as well, but eventually starts to have feelings for her, and she finally proves to be his escape from the cycle, along with an encounter Phil has with an old homeless man who dies, and whose death on February 2 - which Phil can't prevent no matter how many different ways he tries - seems to touch him very deeply.Murray did a great job in showing Phil's subtle changes in how he reacts to the situation. Cynical and selfish at first, he's in turns confused, manipulatively happy and opportunistic and then suicidally depressed until he finally realizes that he has to learn to make the best of his situation and he actually starts to value the people around him and the lives they lead. Murray partnered well with McDowell, and the movie itself raises the same questions for the viewer as Phil was being forced to live through - what would you do if you could lead the same day over? Would you fix your mistakes and become a better person or would you use the situation to your own advantage?This is very funny at times and at times it's equally very dark - and Murray does well with both. It's a thoughtful and thought-provoking movie that's fun to watch. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A weatherman is sent to cover a story about a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil. He is not happy about covering the story because this is his third year. After doing the story and awaking the following day he discovers that "Groundhog Day" is happening all over again, and again, and again. He at first goes crazy about it and then he starts to realize that he can use this to his advantage. He then realizes that he will spend the rest of his life in the same place, with the same people doing the same thing. Phil Conners is the selfish weatherman for the local station WPBH-TV, Pittsburgh. He has no respect for hi co-workers as well as the viewers. He absolutely hates "Groundhog Day" which is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil is to cover this event with Rita and Larry who are the new producer and cameraman. After doing the broadcast Phil wants to leave Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania immediately. However, a snowstorm leaves them spending another night. When Phil wakes the next morning he believes he is experiencing dj? vu because he is reliving Groundhog Day all over again. He keeps reliving this day after day after day. He realizes that this may be his fate but also figures out that his actions have no consequences, but the knowledge can help him gain information about what he wants especially when it comes to Rita. Phil is given ample opportunity time after time to get the day "right". Just like in the movie "50 First Dates" where a veterinarian has to keep winning the heart of a girl he fell in love with because she has a short term memory. With every new day he has to start over and make sure he gets it right. In this movie the motif is relevant to this movie because it is where they keep repeating the same day. This is important because it helps the view to understand the theme of the movie. The lighting in this movie was high-key lighting which helped create an effective image for the viewers. All Phil Conners had to do was get the day "right". Until this happened he would keep reliving the same day. This helped him gain knowledge on some stuff he needed but it also helped him realize that he would spend the rest of his life with the same people doing the same thing every day. He was given plenty of days to get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy or Drama?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is more than just a classic Bill Murray movie. It pretty much defined the 1990s for me. Harold Ramis is a comedic genius and Murray delivers comedy like no other actor before or after his prime. This is their masterpiece.I've seen Ghostbusters, and I still believe it is inferior to Groundhog Day. I've recently rewatched the film and read over some trivia to find that Murray and Ramis argued over the film's genre of being a comedy or a drama for years. I can't say which one for sure, but I certainly find it funny and it is a drama, for sure.Groundhog follows weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to Punxsutawney as he covers the groundhog festival. After his first report, Phil wakes up to February 2, again and finds that he is repeating the day over and over.It's beyond genius to make a movie about this. First of all, this is very easy to produce for the costume designer. It's the same clothes all the time! That is an easy cut of costs, and much like Back to the Future, the location remains the same essentially...so the production designer and location scouter needs not as much. It's also very interesting of an idea to actually make a movie about this sort of deja vu phenomenon.I think what makes me like this film most of all, is the amount of change that happens to Phil over the course of the film. This kind of 'hell' can shape a person from an unrelenting, unloving, uncaring, broken, incomplete shell of a man to a warm, kind-hearted, loving and peaceful soul. It's genuinely inspirational while being dramatic, funny, and romantic.There's not much mature themes or scenes that make this too unsuitable for children. But, maybe that's because I was young when I first saw this and I'd already been watching things like Seinfeld, Fraiser, Friends and horror movies like The Shining. It's still one of the greats, for me, and I think it's a classic that no one should miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold Ramis's film "Groundhog Day" revolves around bill Murrays character "Phil", a miserable weatherman forced to once again go on assignment to Pauxatuany to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. After forcing his way through the day his team encounters a blizzard on the way home which forces them to turn around. He awakes the next day to find that it is the day he just lived. Hilarity ensues and in the end he discovers he must find happiness and his true self before he is able to snap out of his funk. He falls in love with his coworker Rita played by Andie MacDowell and they live happily ever after. The theme of this film kind of reminds me of Jerry McGuire except it is actually funny.Before Phil can overcome his miserable existence and find true happiness he is forced to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right. Faced with seeing Ned, the annoying insurance salesman, everyday this takes some time. Phil experiences all the ranges of emotions while working to the end product and the director does a great job of taking us through them. He tries everything to get the day to end before realizing that he needs to embrace the day and make the best of it.The author uses several good techniques to reinforce the theme throughout the movie. I feel that "I got you babe" music every morning he wakes up is a nice touch in reference to the happiness he finds at the end of the film with Rita. The lighting is also used to reinforce how gloomy and dull both the town of Pauxotowny is and also the existence that Phil is living. While this film is a comedy classic, it also shows a real lesson that people take for granted most of the time. We go to work every day and get into the same rut over and over without putting everything into perspective. This film shows that sometimes we need to take a step back and evaluate what is important to us and spend the time putting it into perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It's funny, smart and the story is original. It's an almost perfect movie. Bill Murray is superb as Phil Connors, an arrogant, egocentric and misanthropic TV weather man who receives his comeuppance through getting to re-live the same day over and over again.Every day is the same and only Connor's attitude to those around him changes. Initially he makes the most of the experience. He sleeps with women, drinks and eats too much and steals money. Over time Phil falls in love with his lovely TV producer, Rita played by Andie MacDowell, and decides to win her heart. After her rejection he becomes lonely and depressed. He tries suicide but discovers he is indestructible. During time in captivity he begins to read philosophy and eventually learns to empathize with those around him. Phil has enough time to become a virtuoso pianist and a brilliant ice sculptor. Connors achieves some happiness by doing good and eventually becomes a reformed character. Finally he wins over Rita and is released from the spell.The plot is new but the supernatural elements are a throwback to the films of the 1930s and 1940s. Unlike A Christmas Carol, Phil doesn't have a ghost to explain to him where we went wrong and why he should change. In Groundhog Day he has to figure it out for himself and this takes a long time. The film is not a formulaic Hollywood romantic comedy and the script written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis is clever and funny. The film wouldn't work without a brilliant central performance and Bill Murray was made to play Phil Connors. He starts off as a jerk but gradually you start to like him. The rest of the cast are excellent; the film features a strong team of character actors who often steal scenes from Murray. Harold Ramis does an inspired job as the writer-director. This is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is first and foremost a comedy of ideas, on which score it never falters. A cynical weatherman (Bill Murray) must relive the same day over and over again until he sees the error of his ways.A peerless conceit actually benefits from the comparatively bland, sitcom-ish direction - the main character seems trapped in the same banal episode of his life, and not even suicide works as a way out. It's the role of Murray's career and the most inspired comedy of the 1990s. In 2006, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the mid-1990s, we had a friend named Jeff, who started talking to us rather oddly. He would make a comment in normal conversation, and then he would add, "So am I right? Am I right or am I right or am I right?!" And then he'd laugh as if he'd said something quite funny. And we'd just stare at him.Eventually Jeff loaned us a copy of Groundhog Day, and we discovered where he'd gotten that line from. But the first time we watched it, we thought the movie was kind of... strange.There aren't many movies that I watch more than once. I've seen hundreds of movies by now, and this one now holds the record for number of viewings. I do have to let some time go by before I see it again, but this is one of those rare movies that only seems to get better and better upon rewatching.Over the past 5 or 6 years I've put a lot of effort into bettering my own life. Today I was at the gym and caught the last 25 minutes of Groundhog Day while exercising. I was astonished at how some of the ideas in this movie parallel some of the ideas and understandings I've come to embrace about life and success. If you haven't seen Groundhog Day, see it. If you have, then see it again. I put it (along with Forrest Gump and Titanic) in my personal Top 10 Movies of All Time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best comedies and one of the best movies ever made, and one which will grow in stature through time. A 'perfect film'. A 'perfect film' being not necessarily the most profound or greatest film, but one with no discernible flaws. Everything works, the writing, acting, how scenes are put together. Princess Bride is another example of a perfect movie.The plot makes this such an "odd" movie. It is its own category, its own genre. I go back to look at individual scenes for themselves. They are varied and wonderful. The absolute best of Bill Murray, and that is saying something. Andie MacDowell at her best too. But the more I see the work of Harold Ramis the more I admire it. He wrote and directed Groundhog Day. He and Dan Aykroyd wrote Ghostbusters. He wrote Animal House. The unique quality of Groundhog Day, the oddness of plot, comes from the creativity of Harold Ramis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that will make this movie seem dated is the costume and hair styling. Wish they could have made this in a Gataca-like set so it can last forever. (Come to think of it, it might work to the Gataca plot too) Bet no one really sees how good this movie can be/work except the crew and producer. Why it doesn't get more attention I have no idea (only thing I could think of is that the original idea came from another film - I'm fairly pessimistic about Hollywood) Murray is fabulous. Some of the scenes are very funny. A tad on the mushy, romantic side but acceptableOnce you accept the premise all you can think about is how do they get out of it ???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Murray is brilliant. Even does some slapstick (not a comedy style I appreciate) and I actually laughed! There are a few flaws:It gets a little sappy at points (don't like the co-star- yuck, but at least she's believable and plays the happy go lucky saint type to a T) and a couple of race &amp; crash car scenes are not memorable. Gotta love a guy who has some French poetry &amp; some rocky road ready to go... But the plot does provoke some serious reflection - what exactly would you do??? Each reaction and gradient of his character's personality are explored and each potential outcome. These lines still make me giggle just remembering them: "No fudge, no white chocolate." "I like to say a prayer for world peace."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) stars as Phil Connors, a weatherman sent to record the events of Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, only to wake up everyday to see Groundhog Day repeating itself over and over again.This 1993 comedy drama from director Harold Ramis tells the story of a man who is lost in time, and in himself and is the perfect example of why Bill Murray is recognized as one of the finest comedy actors in modern cinema.Murray's portrayal of weatherman Phil Connors makes this film funny, with superb sarcasm to the witty weatherman and plenty of fantastic facial expressions to make Murray an absolute delight to watch in one of his most established roles to date.MacDowell (Four weddings and a funeral) delivers well in her role as producer Rita and though the performances are sublime, it is the writing and humour that make this film a true comedy classic.With a fairly simple plot, it is remarkable how complex the ideologies of the story work, with issues regarding life and death, love and lust all encoded for dramatic and comedic effect.The film also begs the question as to what we would do, if nothing we did affected the outcome of the world. A chance to explore everything, and take wild chances without ever being affected, is something everyone would want to experience.Filled with humour, the plot does take a few dramatic turns as well, which will make you feel sad, and really associate with the central protagonist.The ending is wonderful and open, to have the audience invited in to ask plenty of questions, which adds to the enjoyment of the story.The settings are well established, and provide great shocking entertainment throughout, and everything about Groundhog Day is truly remarkable.A sharp plot helped along by comic and dramatic twists and turns with some great performances add up to one of the funniest comedies of recent times</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ode to the Groundhog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day (1993) As Roger Ebert pointed out in his great movie's review of Groundhog Day, it is so good, so entertaining, so fun, that its all too easy to overlook its greatness. I agree.Groundhog Day is nothing less than a classic. It is a once in a lifetime kind of film, one that worked so well in the context of its own time period that its simply impossible to imagine the film having the same impact if it was made either 10 years earlier or ten years later. If that makes any sense. I suspect if you've seen it and loved it (which more often than not is simply the by-product of having seen it) you know what I mean.The premise, of course, Bill Murray plays a smarmy weatherman who is forced to relive groundhog day over and over again until he comes to great realizations about the meaning what it is to live. It's not only a very funny idea, but also a deep one with philosophical and existential undertones. Yes, not only is Groundhog Day a film so enjoyable its underrated, but also underestimated.Bill Murray is one of the funniest men to ever work in cinema, with the ability to express humor without emoting, to express subtle depth, profundity and sadness while slapsticking. Groundhog Day is one of his best outings. It's one of the few films that truly makes me nostalgic for days gone by, but optimistic for the days to come.I realize this review is little more than a puff piece, but why waste precious time on the small trivial faults when the sum of the parts is so wonderful. It is only suiting in the context of the picture itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy classic that is well written and sends a good message to viewers about self-importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best comedies I have watched,Groundhog Day succeeds in delivering comedy through one-liners and sarcasm as well as an original storyline.Bill Murray stars as an arrogant TV weatherman from Pittsburgh who decides to travel to Punxsutawney,Pennsylvania with his producer Rita(Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry(Chris Elliott) in order to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in which the rest of the season's weather is determined by Punxsutawney Phil who is a groundhog.Because Phil Connors(Bill Murray) is self-centered,things go bad for him as the day repeats itself which means that Phil is stuck in a personal time warp.Because of this,it means that he doesn't have to worry about tomorrow and gives him a chance to right his wrongs.Besides a great deal of comedy,this film also sends a philosophical message to everyone watching this film that it is never too late to make your wrongs turn into rights.Because of all of this,it has become a cult classic,culturally significant and a film that will never be forgotten.It should have been nominated for at least a Best Actor Oscar for Bill Murray and a Best Original Screenplay Oscar.It is as well written as dramas such as The Truman Show and La Vita e Bella.Definitely recommended and it is Bill Murray at his best.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karma, Comedy, and Eternal Recurrence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently Bill Murray and Harold Ramis fell out over the direction of this film, ending perhaps the most commercially successful working relationship in the history of film comedy (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, etc.). It is hard to understand the dissatisfaction of either with the finished product. The movie is an absolute masterpiece. The writing is brilliant, original and fantastically layered. The story, which details the inner journey of a Pennsylvania weatherman who finds himself living the same day over and over again, is an allegorical representation of spiritual and moral growth that has resonated with people of all religious persuasions. But for those who like their films uncomplicated, unfreighted with symbolic meanings, the movie is enjoyable on any level. There is nothing pretentious about its ambitions. The acting is note-perfect throughout, and Murray's performance is revelatory. He moves effortlessly between slapstick physical comedy, romantic love, and suicidal depression; and any number of emotional states in between. I can't recall a bad performance by Murrray in any movie, but in Groundhog day he hits more high notes than he's ever hit, before or since. It's a shame the Academy has so little respect for comedy, because his performance in this film is better than many an Oscar winner. One of the best films of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was recommended this as a easy-to-watch comedy, on my first watch I'd probably give it about 7. I had identified the obvious comedy side to it. But on my 2nd run, I found this an amazing un-natural film experience to it. It was so incredible, everything was perfect and it wavered around so many genres. The obvious side had evaporated from it, but the true inner-self had been unleashed to me. This is probably one of my favourite films because of that.Bill Murray is perfect excellence in his role and his chemistry with Andie McDoawell is lovely. Everyone else in their roles, don't give out outstanding performances, but they generally feel like real-life people that surround you almost un-noticed in your own life. And learning about themselves is wonderful too.It's a shame this film is so underrated, because I feel it needs to be appreciated just in the way I feel about it now. So watch it a second time and you'll be greatly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Murray plays a complete jerk. That's okay because you know that it's going to come out all right in the end.The fun in this movie is seeing the character arc of Phil Conners. We're never told in so many words just why he's condemned to live the same day over and over. It seems that it does have something to do with how very nasty Phil is at the start of things.He hates his job, doesn't care for his co-workers and really doesn't want to be covering Groundhog Day again. So fate steps in and stops time for Phil. He's not going to get past that day until he reforms.It doesn't happen overnight. He spends dozens, if not hundreds of Groundhog Days in Punxatawney. At first he just acts worse, taking advantage of the simple people of the town. But then he realizes that he's in love with his producer (Andie McDowall).So he's got this same day to run over and over again to convince her that he's not a total jerk. And, in order to do that, he needs to reform himself. At first it's just superficial stuff, like remembering her favorite ice cream. But then he has to go beyond that and truly become the man of her dreams. And do it in the few hours that he's got until the whole thing resets again.Bill Murray works wonderfully in this role. His low-key style of humor fits in well with his road to rehabilitation.This film is one of the "few" I have in my collection. I only buy titles that I'm likely to play over and over. And, about once a month, I do watch it over again.A wonderful movie. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day a groundbreaking movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Groundhog Day" is a fun enjoyable movie. It is humorous, although there are not many "ha-ha" moments. But this was one of those rare comedies that I watched, not necessarily for the next laugh, but I watched to see how the story would unfold. I wanted to see how Phil's character (Bill Murray) would develop while being stuck on this constant loop of Groundhog Day over and over. The movie made me think, "What would I do if I were stuck in the same situation?" You get to see Phil mature before your eyes, if not out of desire, then out of boredom or necessity. After initially fulfilling one selfish goal after another (with women, food, and even suicide) Phil decides to submit to his kinder, gentler, unselfish side, and he begins to embrace life in the town of Punxsetawney, Pennsylvania. After learning so much about the people and about communal life in general, he learns to love more than just himself. The movie was very heart-warming and inspirational. Groundhog Day was a terrific format to convey this type of story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 stages of grief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie for the umpteenth time. It never fails to make me laugh, it never fails to move me as a story, it never fails to impress me as a movie.I haven't read all 397 comments (I do have a life), but in the first couple of pages I noticed nobody spoke of the 7 stages of grief/dying. The screenplay uses this as a plot device. The next time you watch the film (I know you will), check out Murray's character as he goes through 1)Shock/disbelief, 2)Denial, 3)Bargaining, 4)Guilt, 5)Anger, 6)Depression and, finally, 7)Acceptance. Only when he reaches acceptance and becomes the beloved Phil known to the whole town, who loves Rita unconditionally with neither an agenda nor a timetable, do the fates release him to live in the present.The screenplay is positively rife with beautifully understated lines that crack me up. Many commentors have included their favorites. Mine is the bowling alley scene in which the guy responds to Murray and says, "That about sums it up." There's a long list of continuity goofs, but there's never been a movie in which they are more inconsequential. It's the massive continuity that does work that's the story here.Easily on my personal Top Ten list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this highly as a comedy but more so for it's deeper messages you can find if you think about the situation. You only have one shot at life but the main character seems to have a mini-life (the same day) repeating itself. He tries to enjoy himself but gets jaded when he realises that nothing matters the next day as nobody remembers anything. The character is lucky in the sense that he can, through trial and error, realise what's important in life. He eventually realises how he can be truly satisfied. This film can be watched repeatedly without boredom.The film is works very well the vast majority of the time with only a few minor annoyances in the script and acting. I only saw the film recently and have already viewed it multiple times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Ground Hog Day -Again Campers- &amp; We Got Ya Babe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis is a genius in how he developed this comedy in and outside the box frame work which works it's way back to a happy ending. While the plot itself has to do with being stuck in time, place, &amp; space, the development of the characters &amp; the comic situations are classic.This film is one I usually watch every year about Groud Hog Day, &amp; every time I watch it, I notice a subtle piece of humor I didn't notice before. This is the mark of a great film &amp; this is one. The only way you can't like this film is if you don't like Bill Murray. If you don't, &amp; can put that aside, you will still see the genius of the script. I think this one is without a doubt the best performance of Bill Murray's career &amp; the film he will be remembered for. Bill becomes Phil Conner in this film. As the film develops, Phil is not only stuck in this day, but he keeps exploring himself in more &amp; more ways, &amp; gets a chance to get to know the entire world of Pauxatawny, PA intimately. In a way, the predictable happy ending makes sense, as it takes Phil along long time to figure out how to achieve his dream which takes on the human form of Rita.There are some minor problems in the fact that some of the characters almost seem to realize towards the end that Phil has been hanging around town too long. Ramis genius is the themes he packs in. He does the easy ones like suicide &amp; scoring the quickie. Then he does the more subtle ones like "no consequences" &amp; playing in the snow. The touch with the bum who time has come no matter what Phil does for him each day shows an interesting depth provocation for a comedy film.The real classic Americana is the choice of Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe" to wake up to every morning. In a way, Harold Ramis got all of us with this film. "Wake up campers &amp; put on your booties because it's cold outside." Every day is the same, or is it? Decking the Life Insurance salesman is something I've always wanted to do. "Tomorrow will be today again, &amp; I can't do anything about it."</fullReview>

An egoistic, selfish and not quite likable weather man who has been covering the "GroundHog Day" celebration in a small town for the last 4 years, makes his views very clear on what he thinks to be stupid waste of time. He does not spend time with his crew members and after grumbling for some more hours goes to sleep. Next day, Mr. Fantasy kicks in his life, as he finds himself once again reliving "GroungHog Day"... And again... and again...Redundant to say, that in his ordeal of re-living the same day over and over again, he realizes his flaws and becomes a better person in the end... The storyline will have people screaming Frank Capra and Cary Grant(not James Stewart, he would be too "nice" for the main character). However, we get Harold Ramis and Bill Murray instead. And guess what? They make it a gem! Of course, major credit also goes to the script and editing department, which are razor sharp. And one can only visualize(if someone has not already seen the movie, and is a Bill Murray fan) as to what Bill Murray can do with an opportunity like this! The result is a hilarious comedy, along with it's touchy moments(not overdone, though there were plenty of opportunity for those) and the ultimate "redemption". The overall feeling - have to watch it again... and again... and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that was perhaps underrated by critics upon its release, Groundhog Day is a classic example of a film that has spread through word of mouth. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as the grumpy weatherman whose egotistical character would rather be in the studio than out on location. Andie MacDowell is equally great as the kind and caring 'environmentally friendly' love interest that contrasts diligently with Murrays bullish persona. The concept is something that almost every person has toyed with at one point or another - what would happen if tomorrow I woke up and re-lived today. With this in mind Groundhog Day manages to investigate this notion with humour, wit and a sense of class that makes it stand out as a great movie that will, I'm sure, endure the very thing it explores - time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies are pretty hard to rate on a cinematic scale. You usually judge them much differently than you would a drama film. Most comedies are lacking in some area and therefore don't usually score high amongst voters. I'm pleased to see that this film is on the top 250 list on IMDb, it SOOOO belongs there, because Groundhog Day is just a perfect comedy.Bill Murray is nothing short of sensational as Phil Connors, the man who visits the town of Punxsutawney to cover The Groundhog festival each year. This to him is a boring assignment and he can't wait to get the hell out of Dodge once his job is done. But fate has a another plan for him, as he awakens each following day and it's always Groundhog Day.This is such a well written, expertly performed and hilarious film and it never fails to amuse, no matter if it's the 10th time you're watching it. The premise is very original, and in lesser hands the film's repetitiveness could have gotten tedious, but with this sure-fire script, Harold Ramis's superb direction and, of course, Bill Murray the film is a non stop laugh riot all the way.Recommended for everybody who enjoys a truly funny film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a film that I have loved since I was maybe twelve. It is just so memorable and funny. The story, that a man has to relive the same day over and over makes for a great movie. Of course, casting Bill Murray helped the film-he delivered the lines with the correct facial expressions and air. I thought it was good that the film started Murray off as a somewhat bitter(or mean)weather man who thinks he is a celebrity. Phil Connors treats everyone as if they are there to do his bidding. The trip to Punxsawtawnee changes Phil's life and his perception of life.I really liked the way the film developed the story. Every day that passes (even though each passing day is the same day)changes Phil. At first he is in disbelief; then he is awed at the things he can get away with (mostly theft);then he is desperate to end his misery;and then finally, he tries to use his situation to better the life of the people in Punxsawtawnee. He learned that once he got to really know people and to help them any way he could, he could make his own life better.These are the reasons why I really like Groundhog Day. Every time I watch it, I always enjoy it.</fullReview>

Murray has never been better, in a role that requires more than just quick wit. Equal to the task is Andie MacDowell who glows as Murray's producer and possible love interest. For those interested, writer Harold Ramis estimates that Murray was stuck about 30 years on Groundhog Day. Some of Murray's lines are classics that come back to me again and again. Light touch still addresses bigger issues about how we live our lives with nice bottom-line message. Effective musical score and great supporting cast. On my all-time top ten movie list.

It's one of those films that could not be pulled off by any other actor.... only Bill Murray could fit this role as Phil Conners, and he fits it perfectly. The incredible extent of his whimsical acting in this film is 80% of what makes it one of the greatest films I have ever seen... the other 20% belonging to the great storyline and supporting characters.This movie can be viewed at any time and still liked. It is a peaceful movie, if you are in relaxed spirits. It is especially great for those nights when you just got home from work or school and the day didn't go as you wanted it to, and you feel though as if life is struggle to no end. This movie is about second chances, and outside of the incredible humor, can be inspiring to get every day of your life right, and to remember the things that are most important in life.Watch it, and see what you think!</fullReview>

Phil (Bill Murray) goes back to his bed and breakfast, and the wakes up the next morning with the same song in the radio as the day before. First he thinks it's deja vu, but after waking up again, on Groundhog day, he knows that there is something very very very wrong. He's having his worst day over, and over, and over again. And all the other people don't know, they just living the day. And Phil falls in love with Rita (Andie MacDowell), and he has to win her love everyday over and over again.

		<shortDescription>Awesome Film. One of Murray's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say. i've probably seen this movie twenty times and it never gets old. Murray is perfect in his role and so is Andie MacDowell. The story goes like this. Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a cynical weatherman from Pittsburgh. It's February 1 when him and his crew, Rita (Andie MacDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) go to the small town of Punxsatawney to film the groundhog awake. Phil has a miserable day and is awoken February 2 to the sound of Sonny and Cher. He goes out to the Groundhog grounds and gives his usual performance. Afterwards the crew packs up to leave but can't get back to Pittsburgh due to weather. They spend another night. The next day Phil awakes to the sound of the same Sunny and Cher song and discovers it's February 2 again. What could be going on? Now Phil repeats February 2 again and again and again for days, months, even years. What is this purpose. Is it internal damnation for Phil being cynical or an idea for Phil to change his ways and help people. What do you think?That's what you'll be thinking each time you watch this film, right up to the very end. Bill Murray is absolutely perfect for his role. Andie MacDowell is a real strong female presence for the film and Chris Elliot has some good scenes as the camera man. The plot is next to perfect, an ultimate torture type world for Phil. Each day repeats, he does whatever he wants, and the next day he's back to new. The movie really gets you thinking about are more cynical side and how we represent that dark side everyday. The movie will bring a laugh and at some points almost make you cry. Murray deserved an Oscar for this performance and shows that he is capable of being a great actor, better than he already is.Groundhog Day. Starring: Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot, and Stephen Tobolowsky.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my top 5 movies of all time. It is one of a very short list that I have seen over 10 times. I never get bored with it because the setting of the movie is so convincingly laid out that you feel like you are able to spy on the characters as the story unfolds. This is a rare quality that I have only seen with a few other movies: "Fargo", "Cape Fear" (the one with DeNiro), and "It's a Wonderful Life" It is similar to how you would feel if you were able to see a film of close friends in an entertaining story. You feel as you know the people and the place. Fantastic! Bill Murray is Outstanding!! Chris Elliot is a funny supporting character. Andie McDowell, however, leaves question as to Bill Murray's Characters taste in women (a little too angelic for my taste - doesn't fit at all with his character). The townspeople have a strong role in this picture. They are the Currier and Ives simple-folk backdrop to Bill Murray's city-slicker character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day, a film that was released with no great fanfare in 1993, has taken on the mantle of a classic in recent years. It's a well-deserved title as it is one of those rare films you can watch no matter how many times you've seen it and you are always glad when it turns up on TV. Bill Murray, who pretty much took a 10 year sabbatical from major movie roles after this film, is at the height of his powers and conveys the contrasting sides to Phil Connors character brilliantly. Andie MacDowell is charming as the object of his affections, and Ned Ryerson is a memorable cameo from Stephen Tobolowsky. An 'It's a Wonderful Life' for the 21st Century? Could be. Certainly one of the few truly excellent films of the last 15 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're planning to kill yourself, because one day is just like the next (and, by implication, that's not a fun thing) - watch this first.Then watch 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Mary Poppins', 'Schindler's List', 'La Vita e Bella', 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', 'I am Sam', 'Donnie Darko', 'Connie &amp; Carla', 'Complicity' and 'Protest' (the 2005 version by MM productions).If you still want to kill yourself after all of those, you may be beyond hope - or films just don't do it for you. Try books, knitting or morris dancing before passing 'Go' &amp; collecting your big old karmic debt.Hugs, cuddles, kissles, squelchles &amp; tickles - may also work for you.Don't do it until you've tried everything you can think of - and then sat down next to someone on the bus and asked them for everything they can think of.If you're wondering - 3 times.No - not the film - that's about 3 times a year since I first saw it, because... it wouldn't be February without Groundhog Day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy, one of Murray's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the film again after not having seen it since I saw it in the theater. I enjoyed it much more at the age of 29 than I did at the age of 17! At that younger age, the romance in this movie seemed too cheesy for me to take, but I can now see the movie as a decent romance, but mostly just a great comedy. It's sort of an existential comedy, it really puts its character in the place of having to question the value of his life. Since he can't even make the choice to end his life, in a way he's stuck in "the Myth of Sysyphus" and can't rise above it until he stops fighting it and lets other people affect him. It reminds me of the more recent film "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" in this way.Murray's character is excellently realized... the other characters are good but they come off more as sounding boards for his character, including McDowell. I enjoyed the way the film was paced, it seemed to know perfectly how and what to show the audience. Don't know what else to say about it, it's a solid film, probably Murray's best straight-up comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have said many times before that what makes a film classic is a re-watchability. "Groundhog Day" ironically qualifies many times over. Bill Murray is just sensational as the ultimate curmudgeon who learns to change because he has to. Andie McDowell is not my favorite actress, but she truly shines in this romantic comedy classic. Now I could nitpick about somethings in the film like, like, "How the Hell did he learn ice sculpture in such a short time?" but comedy is the ultimate suspension of disbelief genre, but I still would like to know who did those fabulous cultures, the credit you rarely see you in end credits. Even Chris Elliott who usually annoys me has his moments. heck, I even liked the pairing of Rick Ducommon and Rick Overton (the latter with whom I have had less than warm moments) has two mildly lovable drunks. if you have never seen the movie before, and you like clever and engaging comedies, I can pretty much guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie unless you are as cynical and the earlier Murray character in this classic. See it. Buy it. See it again... and again... and again... and don't wait until February 2nd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the movie at its first release, I found that the various scenes and lines described in this list kept me laughing from one to the next, so that I would be seized with laughter for 10-15 minutes at a stretch. It became physically uncomfortable, and my wife asked me to be quiet several times in the theater. I am delighted to read the comments and recollections of others who reacted to the movie as I did. For a long time, Dr. Strangelove was my favorite movie of all time, but Groundhog Day has now replaced it, although I can't say that I discover much new when I see the movie another time.Regardless of the cinematic or artist merits of the film, I wish that I could laugh that hard and long every few months.

		<shortDescription>groundhog has his day....many days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those films after you watch for about 10 or 15 minutes or so, and you realize you are watching something very special and original. Then, you hope the rest of the movie will equally be as good, if not better, and go beyond your expectations. Those are times when you see a movie do something very original, and when it succeeds, it's sort of like discovering a diamond in a haystack, or that secret passage behind a bookcase, you basically have no idea what's going to happen next. It's almost Hitchcockian. It's a comedy, though. I had the same kind of thought as I was watching movies like "Memento" or "Dark City." It's one of those rare gems you don't see often.The idea itself is pretty straightforward. It's Groundhog Day, and Phil, a self-absorbed newscaster, one day arrives in Pennsylvania for his gig (a place he'd rather not be), and somehow winds up so that he must repeat that same day (literally) over and over again. As Apollo in Rocky III would say, "There is no tomorrow." Literally. It's basically like time traveling to the same morning right when the day ends. (Or, to the techno-geeks out there, I suppose it's almost like an 80's text adventure game where you start over after you mess up or die in the game...but much better)This is basically, in my opinion, Bill Murray's best role thus far (To note, I personally thought "Lost in Translation" was one of the most sleep-inducing movies I've seen -- Wong Kar Wai's "In the Mood for Love" was similar in that "subtle-ness" but much better). As Phil, played excellently by Murray, repeats the same day (Groundhog Day) day after day, he starts to loathe it, then he tries to take advantage of it, using his knowledge to woo women, tries to rob a bank, then not finding fulfillment, starts to loathe his life, and even attempts suicide (to which he wakes up to the same morning he just had). I must add, whenever I hear the "I got you, Babe" song, I am reminded of this movie (a song that repeatedly plays in this movie). There's something very "groundhoggy" about that music. What I also like about a film like this is that a character eventually goes through change--he doesn't stay the exact same person as he was. Phil, for example, eventually learns that he must change inward--obviously, changes he makes outside has no effect to anybody else since it'll be the same day tomorrow. Thus, he uses the time to acquire knowledge, becoming more well-rounded, even become a more loving person (perhaps from that inward change). In observing, I can say it's amazing what one can do in one day, if one lived one's life to the fullest. The movie indeed is very funny, if it sounded as if the movie wouldn't be funny. A lot of that credit can be attributed to the actor, the perfect-for-this-role Bill Murray (especially how he reacts to the situations--at one point he punches a guy he knows he will meet again, yet not know it), the clever writers, and smart direction from Harold "Egon" Ramis (who also makes a cameo as a doctor). An excellent film. Yes, it is kind of like "It's a Wonderful Life," if in a more comedic sense. A smart, very funny movie. A keeper. 10/10</fullReview>

Groundhog Day has a deep, thought-provoking plot, combined with a couple of good action sequences, a few disturbing scenes, and an excellent finale. This makes for one of the best films of the 90s, pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without a doubt, one of the funniest films ever made. Usually, you associate funny with dumb, but with groundhog day, you get one of the most intelligent comedies of all time. Mainly set around one day, which weatherman phil conners must relive over and over again, to his utter confusion, the film just throws out brilliant idea after brilliant idea. Bill Murray will probably never be better, his comic timing is superbly spot on. He could say even the most dull line, and make it funny. And without being intimidated, the supporting actors are all as equally good in their own parts. It gets rather sentimental as it moves on, but still doesn't quit with those great one liners. This movie should replace prozac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally flawless movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to adore this film. I've seen it so many times I can speak along with the dialogue virtually throughout, but it loses none of its magic. Can there really be anyone left who hasn't heard the premise of this movie? If you are that person, then here it is: grumpy prima donna weatherman (Bill Murray), frustrated by being stuck on local news, is sent with his sexy new producer (Andie MacDowell) and irritating cameraman (Chris Elliot) to the backwater of all backwaters, Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. Why? Because that's the centre of the Groundhog Day festival where, every February 2nd, America waits to see if there will be six more weeks of winter. Murray is bored and fed up after being sent to cover the story, but his distress only escalates when he realises he is stuck in Groundhog Day every day. No matter what he does, at 6am every morning he is back in his bed listening to Sonny and Cher. This movie, while definitively romantic in places, is always, always imaginative. We follow Murray's character through depression at his time warp existence, joy at the fact he can do anything including steal thousands of dollars, determination when he realises that he can get to know MacDowell's Rita without her sensing his ulterior motives, and desolation again when he understands the meaninglessness of a life devoted to himself.Although that all sounds kind of deep, the film is a total joy from start to finish, and you never realise you're being exposed to hardcore philosophical concepts as you see Murray scoffing cake in a diner. Enough laugh-out-loud moments to make this a comedy classic, Groundhog Day also has thoughtful and intelligent subtexts, which make it worth watching dozens of times. Fabulous entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that comedy is the hardest thing to agree on. I know that I have a couple of friends who are annoyed when they watch this movie, and others who could watch this once a week and love every minute (I am in the second group). I am sure that whatever I say will be nothing more than an echo from someone else's comments. In any case, here goes...I believe that Murray is about as funny as they come, even though in each movie he seems to play the same character with different degrees of attitude. I still can't seem to get enough. This movie is classic Murray.The story is also a metaphor for reincarnation, repeating the same day until you somehow get it right. I won't hold that against the movie.To me, this is comedy at its best. It has snappy dialogue that never gets boring, interesting and quirky characters, just the right amount of sappiness and emotion, a smart story, and it never gets too raunchy. I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it, and it gets funnier with each viewing. It's the only comedy that I would rate a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only does Bill Murray do a great job as always, but his characters really learns something. It kind of makes you think, too. What if you were trapped in a mess that you got yourself into? It would be up to you to work on it to improve yourself. That is exactly what Phil (his character) did. He was a real jerk at first, but he realized that if he wanted to go somewhere with his life, he had to be a better man. Groundhog Day would never end, and he was the only one who knew that the day kept repeating itself. There's a lot you could do, and he tried to continue to be a jerk. Then, he got himself in gear and started going in the right direction.This movie is well worth while, and I give it a 9/10. It is filled with laughter, adventure and entertainment. Bill Murray is a great actor, and this ranks among his all time best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this movie if you want to laugh (over...and over..and over...again!) With an irresistible blend of slapstick, intelligent dialogue, and more running gags than probably any other comedy since "Some Like It Hot", it's perfect for almost anyone old enough to appreciate Bill Murray in his most finely-tuned performance. I can't praise one of my favorite comedies--and comedians--too highly.In years to come, when people mention comedies from the raunchy, fluid-obsessed nineties, this film will stand alone as one that always aimed above the belt--and succeeded on its own terms. In terms of sophistication, it's well below Woody Allen, but way above the Farrellys, on a par with the Sturges comedies of the 40's and...ah, who cares? If Bill Murray's effortless charisma and fantastic comedic timing doesn't win you over, nothing I can say or do will.Oh yeah--Kudos to Harold Ramis for avoiding the usual Sci-Fi-Funny treatment (time machines, wacky scientists, gaping plot holes) for this film. So an arrogant weatherman is inexplicably stuck in the same 24-hour cycle--who cares how it happened? It's damn funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep and beautiful message in a funny and always appropriate movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to express myself on one of the greatest and maybe most underrated movies ever made. Contained within is a deep and beautiful message that everyone should take example from.Starting out as a sarcastic comedy, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, a self-absored and cynical weatherman. He's trying to climb the television network ladder, and though he might be on his way up, he still got a task to do that he hates above everything else. Every year, the famous Groundhog day in Punxsutawney takes place, and Phil has to make a cute report about this event. Of course, in Phils vocabulary "cute" is a synonym for "pathetic".He travels there with a news team, the cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and Rita (Andie Macdowell), the total opposite of Phil. She is a kind, warm and gentle person. Naturally, there is a big clash between Phil and her.They arrive at Punxsutawney, and Phil does a short and arrogant report and leaves shortly thereafter, to Ritas big annoyance. However, a snow storm forces Phil to stay one more night in his "favourite" town.Next morning he wakes up early, eager to leave this extremely cute and happy place. He looks out the window, and sees a very familiar sight. It's Groundhog Day! Out on the street, he becomes perplexed and yet convinced that this is the exactly same day as yesterday. Same things happen in same order. He manages to keep sane however, and falls asleep in the evening. Next day he wakes up to exactly the same song on the radio... Rise and shine, it's Groundhog day!I'm amazed how much truth and wisdom story writer Danny Rubin has put into this movie. First, Phil realize that he can do anything and no one can stop him. He tries out virtually every capital sin, only to realize that this is not it. After a while, he comes to the conclusion that the big change must happen within himself.It's this conclusion I feel is the most important, as it reflects the civilization and humanity every day. We can go cursing the situation around us, but that only ends up in torturing ourselves. We have to realize that one of the few things we really have control over is, that's right, ourself. And as shown in Phil's change after this realization, everything is within us. It's only a question of letting it out and stop the feelings that makes us feel bad.I'm not saying this is easy, it could be a lifelong process (or LOTS of Groundhog days), where you slowly have to realize that "this place might help me do something about myself". So was the story about Phil, anyway. Does he ever get out of his "personal hell"? Well, go rent the movie and find out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with those posters who say this is a terrific and underrated movie. One measure of its quality is the fact that people all over the world are still writing long, heartfelt reviews/analyses of the thing almost a decade after its release. At least a few TV programmers must share this fondness for the movie, as it reappears fairly regularly on the tube -- often, I notice, around New Year's Day (not Groundhog Day, oddly), probably because that's the day (other than our birthdays) when we most often reflect on something as abstract as the passage of time. Like an earlier poster, I think it's interesting that we haven't heard a thing from Danny Rubin since he wrote this movie. Perhaps that was a nom de plume? For who(m)? one wonders. In a way it's sort of attractive to think of this guy suddenly appearing one day in Hollywood with this wonderful, understatedly profound script, handing it to Harold Ramis or whomever, then vanishing, never to be heard from again. Maybe he realized he wasn't likely to surpass himself. You wonder if he's even a professional writer. He could be a...weatherman, for all we know. Surely somebody somewhere knows what this fellow is doing now, but I kind of want it to remain a mystery. Not that I can improve upon the outpouring of commentary seen already, but I'll mention the movie's suggestion (an assertion, really, though understated) that, had we but world enough and time, we all should inevitably become saints, simply because to follow any other path in life would be boring and pointless. I think it's in the simplicity and certitude of this message that Groundhog Day differs from almost every other movie, even those movies called "uplifting." In Hollywood plots, after all, Good most always triumphs over Evil. But this story seems to imply that the contest between Good and Evil is an illusion: there is no real choice, we can choose to do good now or do good later, but choose it we inevitably must. What a revolutionary statement about life! One isn't very often tempted to use the word "Tolstoyan" to describe creative works of any age, let alone movies from Hollywood in the late 20th Century. Yet there it is: a story that could be said to stand on its head much of Western civilization's ethical and theological teaching, all presented via perfectly timed gags, a beautiful girl, and Bill Murray. What else do you want in your entertainment?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people assemble their lists of great film comedies, this never appears on the list. It should.It has absolutely everything a great comedy should have.First, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.)Murray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on.It's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is one of my very favorite movie. I watch it on a regular basis because it is packed with details. It's easy to appreciate right away, but its richness takes a while to seep into you because of the subtle way it's presented to you. Only a year ago I finally understood the depth of the evolution of the main character.It's funny, the laughs are numerous and the humor contagious. The romance is key, but almost secondary. The cameraman and the insurance salesman are the only characters that really tick me off, but they still fit well within the whole movie and do not detract you from appreciating this little marvel.The dialogs, which are Bill Murray's strong suite, are excellent. The scenario is without flaw, none whatsoever.It's a must see movie, even if it's a family movie.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it in 2011, and it's still rather funny. Most of the comedies of this period don't last long, because of the music, or the way it's done. Not the case here, it's still a perfect comedy after 18 years. Andie McDowel has never been as good as in this movie. Maybe with the exception for her performance in "Four weddings and a funeral". Bill Murray is also playing one of his funniest character. But the best part of this film is the screenplay. It seems that it was the first try by screenwriter Dany Rubin. He wrote the story, and did co-writing of the script with director Harold Ramis. I don't know which part of the success of this film is due to who, but it doesn't matter. There are so much incredibly laughable scenes in the film you can't count them. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film will make your Day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This movie was very very good. It is more funny and clever than you would think. A nice story about a selfish reporter with the Channel 9 and how one day, "Groundhog Day" changes his life forever. The characters and the entire set-up was really good. Bill Murray as Phil Connors was terrific and his personality change was totally convincing. This film entertains, makes you laugh, but above all the fun you have while watching this, it makes you think about the person you want to be and what you are. Actually it teaches you, 'How to be a better Human-being?' The supporting cast including the pretty Andie MacDowell were all very good. Truly a feel good movie. Everyone should enjoy this.All in all a nice film that will make your day...It certainly made mine.9.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rare kind of comedy that has repeated replay value.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... We know the day so well that we feel like we're living it with Phil after only a few viewings, and we enjoy certain moments, but crucially we have the option to turn it off whenever we want!There's a vicarious joy to be had from seeing someone who has the chance to road-test his different responses to events that he knows are going to occur. How many times have you wished you could say something to someone, only for the moment to be forever lost because the perfect comment didn't strike you at the time? The character of Phil Connors gets the opportunity to punch irritating old acquaintance Ned Ryerson, but it's OK because he doesn't seem to take that anger with him into the next cycle - he's tried that solution and he knows it isn't an answer for the future, but it makes him feel better, anyway! How would you deal with the problems you encounter in a typical day? The genius of this screenplay is it seems to have all the variable options for the different situations covered, and it's hilariously funny along the way.The movie may have a simple philosophical base, but the whole thing is cheerfully thorough in its exploration. The repetition might seem a little frustrating at first, but when everything is over you'll realise that it can really be a wonderful life - even if Murray's patented sourpuss expression for most of the film seems like it's telling you otherwise! *"I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster and drank pina coladas. At sunset we made love like sea otters. THAT was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over... ? "*, he sighs. He'll come around, eventually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rare combination of an excellent plot, superb acting and clever directing. Equally appeals to all ages and both genders. My wife and teenage son were both enchanted by the twists of the plot and hilarious situations. Bill Murray is so convincing and charming that this one movie made him a comedy superstar. But, of course, the quality of the screenplay and acting will ensure that this movie will remain at the top of the charts for decades to come. The idea of the plot is not original, but nobody even remembers other films exploiting it, while this movie quickly became a classic. It is full of a good humor and romance, and it is fun to watch again and again (I don't know about you, but I can name may be only a couple of other movies that I would like to see multiple times).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that can change the way you see the life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A minor thing for me is that the film is refinedly funny and that it develops at a continuous speed that you cannot be boring at any moment. An exception of that may be the first ten minutes, because the main character, Phil Connors, achieves to transmit his personal view of life, as a bitter routine. We, as he himself, don't have the minimum interest in the Groundhog day (sorry for those that love groundhogs). Since the moment that Phil Connors is trapped in time, the film is no more senseless. The thing that makes this film so valuable, and not recognized enough, is that it reflects our own lives. The first time that Phil re-lives the Groundhog day, one can think ?what's happened? ?which extrasensorial power has made him to be trapped in that date? Oh, well, it's just fantasy. But when you contemplate all the story, you realize that the reason is in Phil himself, the same as the reason why we live our lives as a boring routine is in ourselves. The first things that Phil Connors makes when he realizes that he cannot scape from that endless repetition, are funny, but nonsense. The happiness that we find in those things that we make to break the routine of our lives are funny too for a short time, but the entertainment ends very quickly, because our lives have no sense. The character of Phil Connors searches different ways of finding how to fill his eternal life, but the only one thing that can give sense to his life is LOVE. Not just the relation with that wonderful (until that moment undiscovered) woman, who is working with him, but love to mankind, to any person that needs us. Love means interest in their lives, in their worries. The way he finally breaks the spell can only be understood by those who have penetrate in the meaning of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kierkegaardian Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis' Groundhog Day (1993) is as a film one would not have anticipated from a man whose previous films included Club Paradise, National Lampoon's Vacation and Caddyshack. These previous films were the broadest of comedies, thinly scripted and redeemed only fitfully by the talents of its stars. While still a comedy, Groundhog Day is a character-based story that, in the end, is a deeply moral film.Bill Murray initially plays to type as Phil Connors, a shallow, egotistical, dead-ended weather man, sent to Punxsutawny, PA to cover the annual Groundhog Day event. It is an empty assignment for an empty man. In response, he is an arrogant prick to his film crew and the locals. Unexpectedly, the crew gets snowed in by a blizzard. Phil tucks in for the night in a B&amp;B, but awakens in the morning to find it is still Groundhog Day. He is repeating the same events as previously, stuck in Punxsutawny, yet only he is aware of this.The film loops through seemingly endless repetitions of the day (at least 33 depicted according to the Wikipedia, but implicitly up to 3600 according to Harold Ramis). At first Phil tries to take advantage of the situation, memorizing all the nuances of the day so he can better manipulate things. The principle target of his plans is Rita, his producer, played by Andie MacDowell. At first they are like oil and water, but as the day repeats he learns her favorite drinks, her dreams and desires. As the repetitions go past, each time he gets a little further in his seduction. At one point, he comes near to the perfect night, but takes one small misstep. From there on, his performance becomes more and more stilted until he realizes he has lost his rhythm and ardor for the pursuit.He sinks into a deepening depression. Drunk and disheveled, he kidnaps the groundhog, Punxsutawny Phil, (no accident their common name, both trapped in a single day) carrying both of them to their deaths in gravel pit. Nevertheless, he awakens in the morning again on Groundhog Day. Multiple attempts at suicide fail similarly. He robs the bank, seduces waitresses, but life seems increasingly empty. Then he encounters a bum who dies in an alley, and he is moved to act. The next time, he takes the old fellow to a diner and fills his stomach, but still he dies. He takes him next to a hospital, but he still dies. Chastened by the finality of death, frustrated, he choses honesty with Rita as they have their morning breakfast. Walking her through his day, she almost believes him and they have a genuine day and evening together, though we he awakes his plight is the same. The film is an enactment of the Kierkegaardian stages of life. Phil starts in the aesthetic stage, interested only in personal enjoyment and the life of the senses. At the start of the movie, he has already reached a dead-end with this approach. He is played out and at sea with himself. Midway through the movie he passes through despair and advances into the ethical stage, becoming aware of the moral implications of action. Despite the fact that his entire life is limited to a single day doomed to endless repetition, he resolves to make a difference. Daily he changes the flat tire of some little old ladies, catches a boy falling from a tree, learns the lives of everyone in town, takes piano lessons, learns ice sculpturing, teaches himself French, and actually becomes a thoughtful and effective weatherman. By the end, he approaches the religious stage, devoting himself selflessly to others. Only then does he realizes an authentic and spontaneous union with Rita. As a result, the next day he awakes with Rita back in real time.The movie is among the most seriously moral films, a lesson in existential philosophy disguised as a Bill Murray comedy. He gives here the first glimpses of the subtlety he would later develop as an actor. The Writer's Guild has ranked the script 27th on a list of the 101 greatest scripts, and the IMDb rates it in the top 250 movies of all time. Snatch it up should you find it in your local remainder bin.www.drdreg.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this film in the cinema in 1993, I laughed at the absurdity of the situation, like everyone else. Now I see the film in a very different light, using it as a morality tale for how to deal with people and situations I am faced with in my own life.I have watched this film so many times, but it still makes me laugh when I watch it at least once a year! I even went to Punxsutawney in 2006 for the 120th ceremony, all the way from Northern Ireland. I would recommend it to anyone. One of the highlights is watching the film at midnight in the local community centre. Follow this with a trek up a hill in the dead of night to stand around with around 20,000 other people and every TV news crew from around the world.I plan to return one year!</fullReview>

A film full of laughs to the brim, even if it's sometimes light, but it is pulled through by comic veterans Murray (who gives one of his best performances) and Ramis who follows with his tradition (Animal House, Vacation, National Lampoon, SCTV, Ghostbusters, Caddyshack and Analyze This) of great comedy films.

		<shortDescription>Maybe the only unintended masterpiece in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is said that this film has gotten an almost religious following of admirers and rightfully so.It was intended as just another comedy with Bill Murray as star. Perhaps sometime during the shooting, the director or somebody else may have suspected that it was more than so but much more than a suspicion it was apparently not.It is funny to be sure but below all fun there lies something deadly serious that was not intended but that nevertheless pulls through and leaves the spectator with a sense of awe for every day of life we are given on earth.You could simply state that it is about the limitless possibilities in the single moment or the eternity in a single day and that, if we were allowed to live fully and not as slaves to a murderous few, then a life-span of only 70 or 60 years or even less would be fully sufficient to complete our time on earth. The former thought is more likely religious and the latter more likely revolutionary but they are both possible to be induced when seeing this masterpiece of a film, that was never intended or expected to become just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray gives his usual turn of deadpan comedy in this time-trap feature.Sent once too often on an annual pilgrimage into unpronounceable small-town isolation, he finally begins cracking-up. The job is really beneath his dignity. He quite rightly hates the assignment, and makes no secret of the fact.However, next morning his problems really set in. Instead of being elsewhen, he wakes-up in the same bed, in the same guesthouse, to the same music playing on the radio. It's Sonny &amp; Cher's 'I've got you, babe.' And every subsequent morning is the same. It's Groundhog Day - for ever. First, there's shock and disbelief, but later wretched resignation. His suicide attempts count for nothing; there really is no escape. He can do and say whatever he likes, everything's the same next morning. I've got you, babe.The tale is a 'journey of discovery'. Sadly, it is over-over simplified into a romantic theme. In effect, he's not a very nice person (who is?) and - rather like Scrooge (who he has also played) - must remedy his vices in order to move on.Basically, the acid-test of rehabilitation will be his ability to get his assistant - here played by Andie MacDowell - into bed. It will be an uphill struggle. In due course he begins putting his time to constructive use, learning the piano, ice-sculpture, and of course - decency.Much as I like many elements of this movie - Murray's poker-faced one-line gag delivery is perfectly timed - it contains a slightly insidious anti-male theme that invariably leaves a sour taste. Murray's character is a fairly ordinary guy with ordinary vices. He is certainly no worse than his assistant. When asked what kind of man would meet her preference, about the only virtue she omits to stipulate is the colour of her imaginary paragon's halo. Yet she herself hardly matches those aspirations, and we infer that being female she has no need to. It is this entrenched judgementalism of maleness - especially by a female who possesses no especial merits herself - that I find so inherently sexist. Why should he have to be a diplomat, doctor, professional pianist, ice-sculptor, etc just to win the preference of a comparatively ordinary woman? Why should the selection-procedure be so one-sided and severe?This misandric undertow is what ultimately mars my full enjoyment of the movie. It's sly, and its very funny; but it's too simplistic in its denouement, and I'm just a little tired of seeing men put on the rack for no other reason than being male.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film when I first saw it as a child. Bill Murray is great, and the idea of being stuck in the same day is a fun premise.And then I saw it again recently. And again. And I actually started pondering what was going on in the film.And you know what? It's a delightful film, but it is also rubbish in terms of philosophy.Apparently Bill Murray has to spend an eternity bettering himself so he can deserve Andie MacDowell. But what does she have to do? Apparently nothing. Let me tell you something: If Murray became such a wonderful human being, he would have no interest in that selfish, self- obsessed, insipid tart. I mean, look at that woman: She imagines to be a morally superior princess that no one deserves. That is how she justifies the fact that she is still single. She proceeds to toast to 'world peace' and imagine to be a mother to a bunch of children, but in reality she'd probably divorce the poor bastard she married before they could even have a child. This is one cold woman and it doesn't even take a single day of self-improvement to figure that out.So not only is this film illogical, it is misandric.I give it two stars: one for Bill Murray and one for the hog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having now seen Groundhog Day myself, I wonder how teenagers - whose opinions of this film are probably not influenced by nostalgia - react to this film. Compared to comedies today, it is slower paced, strives for less belly-laughs, and is mostly just a quieter film. Do teens today have the patience to sit through 5 minutes of set-up with a significantly smaller gag ratio than today's comedies? Groundhog Day would never have been profitable, had it been made in the present. Which is a sad thing, as Groundhog Day reminds one of how charming the "quiet" comedy could be.TV weatherman Phil Connors is as arrogant as they come. He's rude to those around them, and insists he's a star. Due to unexplained circumstances, however, Connors is set in a time loop, in which he must relive Groundhog Day, over and over again. And he has no idea how to get out of the loop.Simply summarized, Groundhog Day is as pleasant as a film gets. While belly laughs are rare, there is a satisfactory amount of chuckles and smiles throughout the movie, but even then, one could argue that there are less such instances than in other comedies. For me, Groundhog Day is good entertainment, in spite of slightly less plentiful gags than modern audiences are used to. The story and protagonist are interesting enough that the film still works in spite of all that.Groundhog Day has its sweet moments, mostly because of the romance between Connors and new producer, Rita Hanson, that works surprisingly well. Even when working with occasionally cheesy dialogue, the two leads have great chemistry, and thus, their relationship remains interesting and believable. It gives the film a much needed extra dimension.My sole complaint (which is more a matter of preference than anything), is that Groundhog Day elects to avoid some of the darker elements of its premise. Groundhog Day is played mostly for comedy. Though it is implied that Phil Connors is frustrated with living the same day over and over, there is no dramatic scene or outlet to truly express this. Even during a montage in which he tries to commit suicide in various ways, it is done for purely comedic purposes. The ending is also a pinch unsatisfying, thanks to a cop-out that results in a somewhat hasty finale. The lighter tone of the film is largely to blame for this. Groundhog Day boasts an enjoyable cast. Bill Murray is delightful in the lead, beautifully balancing humor and drama. Andie MacDowell generally gets it right, but falters at time with some of the less intelligent dialogue. Stephen Tobolowsky is a highlight among the talented cast, portraying an overly-friendly insurance agent named Ned Ryerson. The film wisely chooses to limit his presence to just a few scenes, thus eliminating any chance of him becoming overbearing or obnoxious as he well might have with more screen time.George Fenton's score is playful and fun. Though it does contain some unfortunate '90's synths and at times, ill-suited electric guitar, it's a pleasing and enjoyable effort by Fenton.One could argue that Groundhog Day is an overly sentimental and innocuous film - a good time-killer, but nothing more. I would argue that it's a bit more than that. It does some interesting things with its premise, and has more depth than one might expect (even if it could have supported significantly more). Even if the ending disappoints a bit, and there aren't many big laughs, Groundhog Day is entertaining enough and funny enough in an endearingly mild way to make for pleasant and likable entertaining. Labeling it as a masterpiece - as many have come to do so - is absolutely stretching things more than a little. But even if its cultural significance didn't make it a must-see by most standards, it's an enjoyable enough film that it deserves a recommendation anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever. Am I right? Or am I right? &#xfeff;;-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EVER SINCE I first saw this film, that quote has never left my mind!HOW DID I never hear of this movie....?I'm a regular foreign guy in my 20's from Japan, born and raised; I'm not American, but have a background of British English, French, Swiss-German, and Japanese. And I'm *especially* interested in joining the acting/modeling business. HOW DID I MISS OUT ON THIS FILM MY WHOLE LIFE??? Groundhog Day should take "Inception"'s place, much higher on the IMDb's Top 250!People are saying "the Godfather" or "Shawshank Redemption" are the "best movies ever"??? They're wrong. It's Groundhog Day! Unlike those overrated films which seem to encourage HORRIFIC behavior, this film encourages GOOD behavior - that's a big factor as to why I like it. It's especially a much better flick than "Inception" because that's a film I pretty much didn't like because of it's confusing story and *unlikable* characters.And this movie had a way more entertaining, original, interesting, &amp; much better romantic love story than overrated 'Titanic' per say, or even MOST Hollywood films that get produced! Certainly one of the most underrated films I've seen too. But it's RIGHT UP THERE with the awesome-ness of both 'STAR WARS' and 'LORD OF THE RINGS' - not joking!It looks as if Hollywood has such a narrow-minded fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, sexual immorality, etc. (you name it); but don't get me wrong, there's some in this film too, but it's used to a limited medium where it's generally quite subtle, and film is still an engaging, relatable, and even family-friendly!I can't BELIEVE this film wasn't a part of my childhood! I wish at some time at least a friend or *somebody* had told me about or recommended this to me sooner! I will admit, I currently envy those who grew up watching this film at an earlier age. I really wish that "nostalgia factor" for this film was there for me too, like I had with the Disney films. YES! I'm going so far as to saying that. It would've been a lot more life-changing! Don't get me wrong. I watched this film (via iPod Touch) and was *amazed* by the simple story-telling, the amazing idea, and just the immense relatability. I noticed MUCH great spiritual elements in this flick too, like redemption and rebirth - seeing &amp; understanding why many pastors, preachers, rabbis (even occult Buddhists) have expressed their admonition for this great piece of work. This is one GENIUS movie! No matter who you are, where you come from, what your thoughts are, or who you know, this is a film that will grab your attention, regardless!Everything about the direction, the acting, the story, the idea, the comedy, and character study was just mind-bogglingly amazing!! In the end, it's all kudos and congrats to the genius Jewish mind of Harold Ramis making a flick suitable for the whole general audience, IMO. I have a real soft spot for Jewish people, 'cause I think everything about their history, their people group, their identity, their heritage is all so magnificently special! They have been WAY TOO persecuted throughout history (ie. Hitler), and it's about time they had some friends! A lot of them have turned out to be incredibly smart &amp; intelligent people throughout out history as well! And I'm a huge supporter of Israel.But back to the subject, I'm VERY astonished to this day as to why this movie totally missed by the Academy and never won ANY Oscars, or at the very least any nominations... So ridiculous. *I* would've given it apparently 5 Oscars! One for Best Director (Harold Ramis), Best Original Screenplay (Danny Rubin), Best Cinematography (John Bailey), Best Actor (Bill Murray), and Best Actress (Andie McDowell)!This may be the ONLY Bill Murray film I really, really like! Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, nor any of the films he's previously done - whether it be Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, Lost In Translation, Scrooged - a bunch of which I never did laugh at nor did find the least bit entertaining, but just found stupid.But actress Andie McDowell is the one who really drew my attention to this film. Seeing the pretty dumb flick "Four Weddings and a Funeral" (which was even nominated for "Best Picture" - lol wut?) with Hugh Grant. But it was SHE who caught my attention, 'cause I remember seeing her cameo in "Muppets From Space" (lol); and I saw on IMDb she was mostly recognized for this film "Groundhog Day", and it's very high rating really caught my attention...so then I decided to check it out.This movie DESERVES to be in the very high-rated spot it currently is (though I think it should be *much higher* on the Top 250 on IMDb - I think it should switch places with "Fight Club" or "Inception" - which are ALSO some movies I don't really like).And I thought it was smart why this movie doesn't address WHY Phil keeps waking up to the same day - no explanation, no reason, no exposition - it just HAPPENS... and there's no problem going along with it! Though interestingly enough, Tom Cruise's recent "Edge of Tomorrow" (which, by the way, I would say is a great tribute and dedication to the late Harold Ramis) did address how and why things where repeating over and over - and that worked well too!In the end, this film is definitely one of my favorite films of all time! Right along with "Toy Story 2" (1999) , "Tall Tale" (1995), &amp; "Shiokari Pass" (1977) RIP, Harold Ramis, you innovative Jewish genius! You will be missed! And this will live on forever! And it DEFINITELY deserves more attention in my home country of Japan!9/10</fullReview>

Well, Phil (the main character of the film) was prisoned at the groundhog day, and couldn't find a way to live the next day. That did lead him to something really inspiring and thoughtful. After many things he tried in order to make 2nd of February seem somehow different, he couldn't manage to change it.With a mix of romance, comedy and nice character features, this movie is a very relaxing one that I would surely recommend with some warm tea or chocolate.</fullReview>

During that time, Phil begins to change his behavior and finds romance with producer, Rita (MacDowell). This is a great film that's one of Murray's best and he and MacDowell have good chemistry. Elliott plays cameraman, Larry, Murray's brother, Brian plays Buster, one of the town's residents and Ramis also has a brief cameo as a doctor. The film has become another holiday tradition to watch each year and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Great Romantic Comedies Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an exceptionally unique concept propelling a compelling and consistently entertaining and funny story, the script by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis would stand up well against any of the great romantic comedies of the 1930s. And Bill Murray - not your usual choice in a romantic comedy - is bursting with comic genius and energy in this film. It's one of his very best - and it's Andie MacDowell's very best. She surprises and delights in a natural and endearing performance as the girl-next-door beauty-type, Murray's romantic interest. This is one of those films that is so deep and satisfying on so many levels that you never get tired of seeing it - year after year. And if you ever hear "I Got You (Babe)" by Sonny and Cher and DON'T think of this film...then you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stumbling on Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day... I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this film. The acting is great, the story line is so fun to comprehend, its just great!!! I first saw this film in 1995 which was 2 years after its initial release and was just compelled. Bill Murray plays a weather man named Phil Conners who reports the significant events of Groundhog Day which is celebrated in the ice cold areas of America. The following day Phil wakes up only to relive the same day again and again until the story line just gets so intriguing. Comical scenes are included when Phil tries numerous times to kill himself in creative ways but still some how manages to wake up in his bed at the same time as every other day, well... Not every "other" day, more like every "same" day. And so each day he tries to get the woman he secretly loves to love him and his efforts go to hilarious depths. I can assure you this film is so entertaining and enjoyable all the way and you will not be disappointed... And so I, Davorin Lonac, sign off once more only to return again soon in my next review. I have a feeling its gonna be about a film called Batman Begins, perhaps?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over &amp; Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis directed this inventive comedy that stars Bill Murray as Pittsburgh TV Weatherman Phil Connors, who is a cynical, sarcastic man most resentful about being sent again to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival in Punxatawney Pennsylvania. After spending a joyless day there, he is shocked to learn that it is still the same day(Feb. 2) again. Then again, and again! In fact, no matter what he says or does, he is stuck in a 24 hour time loop that only he knows about. Eventually, Phil starts to change, and becomes determined to win the affection of colleague Rita(played by Andie MacDowell) no matter how long it takes, since Phil has a lot of time on his hands... Wonderful film takes a potentially one-joke premise and constantly finds new things to do with it. Both funny and warm, this really builds up a sense of good will and empathy for Phil, and is also helped by fine supporting performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for everyone, very enjoy-full</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is a sweet romantic movie, yet not corny like the most of the romantic comedies out there. It is also very very funny even the the third watch. Both Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray is doing a good job in this movie (the whole cast is doing a fantastic job too). Murray, together with Stephen Tobolowsky sometimes, is making the movie hilarious. Beyond the jokes, the romantic and sweet parts witch will make you smile constantly, the movie has true philosophical meaning about being a good person witch is very entertaining. The movie will be enjoy-full for all family members and will make you feel good. You will also want to be a better person</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic of 90s films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my most favourite films. Every time I watch this, it brings me back to the innocence and charm that only films in the 90s seemed to have. Other films which contained this magic are ones like Mrs Doubtfire and Hook. Every time I watch this movie, I always imagined what it would be like to live in this nice small tight-knit community.The film explores most of the possibilities on how you would take advantage of being able to re-live the same day over and over again. But also the caulse where you can't kill yourself to escape it. The film offers a strong moral at the end of it which is, be nice to people and live every day to its fullest.The fact that the writers don't explain why the timeloop occurs just adds to the mystery and is definitely one of those moments where it's best not to explain it. I think thats the problem of films today, everything has to be spelt out with an explanation. Sometimes it's best for the viewer to make up their own mind.Overall a great film, I wish Harold Ramis still made films. Bill Murray's well timed humour is what really drives this film, and it's this film that made me fall in love with this actor. It's a good, wellrounded, family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Harold Ramis touch and Sarcastic Bill Murray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarcastic and egotistical TV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) is forced to cover Punxsutawney Phil groundhog day for the fourth year in a row. With him comes the beautiful new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott). He makes fun of her cheerfulness and hates all the quaint small town happiness but he's certainly willing to hit on her.Harold Ramis has created an iconic comedic premise. It has ingratiated itself into the lexicon of society. Bill Murray is the perfect actor to portray this sarcastic character. Along the way, we have some great laughs and some well constructed sequences like Phil trying to sleep with Rita. In the end, it finds a heart in this wonderfully simple premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance by Murray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day (1993)** 1/2 (out of 4) Bill Murray turns in a wonderful performance as an obnoxious jerk weatherman who finds himself covering some Groundhog Day events but at the end of the day he finds himself waking up having to repeat the day over and over again. GROUNDHOG DAY appears to have become one of the biggest classics of the decade but I remember watching it in 1993 and not caring too much for it. This here was my first time revisiting the title and I'll admit that I liked it a tad bit more but at the same time I still don't see what everyone else sees in it. There's no question that there are some funny moments and there's no question that Murray does a fantastic job but at the same time the film just doesn't work for me. I think the biggest reason it just doesn't work is because I don't find it all that funny. This is especially true for various scenes that are constantly getting replayed over and over, although they're obviously done in different ways as Murray starts to realize what's going on. It's weird but I really like the concept here of the same thing being repeated but at the same time it's just not all that funny to me. I think what comedy does work is due to Murray's performance. I think what works so well with the performance is that we can believe him as the jerk as well as the transformation into the nice guy. Murray gets to play many different sides to this character and he really nails all of them. As the jerk you can't stand him but he slowly makes you care for the guy and especially towards the end. I think the character development here is actually a lot better than many dramas out there. Andie MacDowell makes for a good love interest and we get nice support from the likes of Chris Elliott and Brian Doyle-Murray. Again, I understand that this film is loved by many. To me it's a flawed film with one great performance and a few nice laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always knew what this movie was about but never got the chance to watch it. I was very expectant of this film when I finally got around to watching it however I thought Bill Murray would be way funnier rather than the sarcastic person he was in the film, that was my only disappointment. But it was a great film, with a great storyline and an even better ending!I would recommend it to the general audience, this is just a unique movie that anyone can watch really. Light comedy for the family and it's a movie worth watching! Makes you appreciate your day more!This film was a good film. A good movie with a good storyline with good characters and a good ending. Only bad point was there was so much sarcasm but who wouldn't if you were in his situation. This movie is sort of like Cool Runnings in a way that anyone can watch it and anyone will enjoy! A good, decent movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He's having the day of his life, over and over..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked in. I had minor tad expectations. This was one of very few peoples favorite film, it had some good potential, and it had Bill Murray in it. How could anything go wrong? I sat down, turned it on, and took a swig at enjoying a mind(less) comedy...I liked it. Groundhog Day has lots of heart, lots of laugh, and lots of sarcastic one-liners from Bill Murray. But as all this seems to come and go, there were some issues with it. The characters were really one-dimensional. Murray's character was set-up to be a jerk and learn a life lesson from repeating a bad day over and over again. The set-up was useless, and it was contrived. The movie was funny, but the jokes seemed to borrow and borrow from other films similar. Maybe it was because I've seen other modern tales ripped-off from this movie, that the jokes seemed not too smart, but good nevertheless. The film came off a little forgettable, as it gives a good moral lesson and then goes elsewhere; meaning comedy. Lots of it seemed a little preachy, the kind that tells you to get off your ass and live life, but it really didn't take away that much. And my last complaint was how it lacked depth. It sends a message, gives us a good laugh, then wraps up. The movie never gives us something to REALLY think about. The message could've been sugarcoated with more thought and process, but the final product wasn't as bad as my expectations thought it would be.So the film was good. Although it was somewhat of a forgettable comedy, with a somewhat preachy moral message, it entertains and provides itself as a yearly tradition, and a good one at that. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Version of It's A Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about these movies that star Bill Murray in and they are considered a comedy classic? By many, Groundhog Day is considered one of the greatest comedies, along with Ghost Busters (1984), to ever hit the screen. Either I am just hard to get when it comes to Murray's comedy or maybe Murray really isn't the comedian that he presents himself as. I found this movie to be funny but again, not gut busting funny. I think Bill Murray is a very competent actor but somehow his version of comedy is not as funny as Jim Carrey's comedy.The story of Groundhog Day is more or less similar to It's A Wonderful Life (1946). Bill Murray stars as Phil Connors, a self-centered meteorologist who doesn't give about anybody's opinion but his own. In the beginning I was already disgusted with his character, he was such a drama queen. It was quite pitiful to see Bill Murray be that way, which is how convincing he was at being a jerk to everyone. I hated him just as much as his co-stars did for a while too. Along with Murray stars, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot as his news crew.As for the comedy element of this movie, many parts were funny. Obviously more of this comes out when Phil Connors realizes he is stuck in same day, everyday. Some of the best scenes are when he talks to an old school friend called Ned. It's funny because it seems like Stephen Tobolowsky enjoyed playing the part of Ned, who is such a weird geek I might add. Even the Flying Dutchman from Spongebob Squarepants has a role in this film. I won't point out who he is because his voice is easy to recognize. The music was contributed by George Fenton who I'll admit although I've never heard his music before has some emotional parts to this film. It really does work especially when Connors is trying to explain himself to people and they won't believe him. What works out the best is how Phil Connors learns to appreciate life than scorning at it. That is the gift of gold from this movie. Even I as a viewer thought when the movie ended, "Wow, I'm lucky to be where I am right now", as should any other viewer when the movie concludes.Groundhog Day has a good dose of hardy slapstick and a good cast of actors to help the chuckles keep on coming. Besides that, what makes it even better is the life lesson that is learned in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray is an algorithm!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In mathematics an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function.[...] In simple words an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations." That is the definition of an algorithm, and Bill fills the bill for what acting is! Step-by-step procedure of calculations, considering a state of repetition? This is a unique performance, and it seems so effortless! I wish I could say the same for McDowell. She seems a bit less of a worthy amorous object in the film, she has that watermarked quality that here stands for evanescence. I do not know if this works in "Groundhog Day".It is also that the scenario, now that I have watched the film for the third time - not enough! - as the film progresses, to call it that, has some kind of Reader's Digest sense of what repetition is when one takes into account the clichs that seem not so effortless, or organic, as it goes on towards the end. It is as though the conclusion as it moves along has some feel-good undercurrent that comes precipitated in a way; some have talked about the crudity of the direction. Yes, I can sense that. But it would be that one wants a certain sense of subtlety which would mean another film. And I do not want another film! I do not even want another sense of repetition! I got you babe!</fullReview>

In every nook it is a lost image and a empty search, for everyone the secrets are more important that any form of truth."Groundhog Day" is description of an ambiguous search. Not the cure or confrontation with evil, not the exposure to a perverse sick are the principal problems but the way to a chimeric past. The metamorphose of a world without rules or soul may be the seed not for dreams or quixotic hopes but for self -discovery, for clear definition of yourself.It is not a wonderful film or a masterpiece. But it is the body of fundamental message. Exploration of world, real world, with hypocrisies, lies and Damocles sword. The world of the 9/11 shadow, the world of soft crazy and electronic refuges. A world in a strange search of a good identity. World of Punxsutawney, Bucarest or Karachi. The world of Irakian war and Kosovar crisis.</fullReview>

Imagine you have to deal with a certain Holiday or event. But instead of going on to the next day, you end up repeating that same day over again. Only instead of being unaware of it, you show your awareness of it and you end up gaining knowledge and information you didn't know before. Plus you get to start over and over again, so you can be a bad guy in one 'day' and a good guy the next.The only thing I didn't like were the seductive scenes.

		<shortDescription>A truly "Timeless" classic. (Yeah-yeah, you do better!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day takes a sci-fi premise, grounds it with a banal everyday backdrop and then squeezes every last drop of humour out of the premise without obvious sightgags and cheesy jokes.It is, simply put, Bill Murray's best comedic effort, and he doesn't have to resort to hamming it up Caddyshack style, the film that makes best use of his personality by letting him be himself? almost.Bill plays Phil Connors, a local small market weatherman who like most others in the role, must turn up the wackiness to add levity to the normal stoic newscast. Phil has vast delusions of grandeur and feels that he is deserved of a far better career fate, even though he seems content with coasting through the working day.Part of a weatherman's lot is covering crappy small town gimmick days like fetes and quirky events, I guess to show that the network understands and supports the "everyday folks" in Anytown USA. This particular annual event is Groundhog Day in Punxsatawney Philadelphia, I developed a bad case of RSI just typing that name.Before this film Groundhog Day referred to an annual festive event, purely for ceremony's sake, where locals made a big fuss by dragging a groundhog from a box whose "powers" were supposed to include an ability to predict either the end of spring or an longer than usual Winter. (Thanks to this film Groundhog Day now means something akin to dj? vu.) So Phil, his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and the cameraguy Larry (Chris Elliott) cram into a van and head to the venue for a night's sleep prior to next day's telecast.Come 6 am Phil awakes to find the day bitterly cold, and the day's events and weather forecast pan out fairly uneventfully. On the way out of town though a blizzard prevents their departure back to the city and the trio must spend another night in sleepy Punxs-etc, much to Phil's chagrin.The next morning seems somehow familiar to Phil, he finds that for some inexplicable reason he is reliving the events of the previous (Groundhog) day. He has the same encounters with locals, the same discussions with Rita and Larry, he is even expected to give the same weather forecast that he gave (his) previous morning. Phil is a little more than bemused at this turn of events, as everyone around him is oblivious to these new-but-same circumstances. Only Phil is capable of doing things differently; and influencing others to do things differently from the initial day.Kooky ain't it? The strength of Groundhog Day is that it doesn't try to explain how and why the anomaly occurs, but once it is established Phil will be reliving the same day it deals with it in a realistic enough fashion that you accept the situation and wait to see if and how Phil will extricate himself from it. And this is where much of the humour lies, Bill Murray is funny enough to begin with, putting him in a situation where he is able to riff and react to events without much thought of repercussions or responsibility is like letting him off the leash and saying "Go nuts" ? and he does just that, only in the deadpan can-you-believe-this? Bill Murray way.After the second Groundhog Day pans out Phil goes through many stages: 1) Disbelief. Maybe if I rub my eyes enough this will all change back? 2) Acceptance. Well I guess I can't change this, let's ride it out.3) Manipulation. Well I guess while I'm here I might as well have fun with this.4) Misuse. Exactly what can I get away with? 5) Learning / Planning / Scheming. If I put some thought into this I can pull off something big! 6) Resignation. I've had enough, what can I do just to end this? 7) No escape. Well that didn't work, I give up.8) Desperation. You gotta believe me! I'm not making this up.9) Upskilling &amp; Change. Maybe it's me who is broken? 10) Culmination? As Phil progresses through the process he turns gradually from a sarcastic and cynical self-centred b*stard and gradually smooths his rough edges away, sarcasm turns to wit, put-downs to jokes and using people turns to helping people. A little saccharine sounding right? Well perhaps in the wrong hands, but here there is a real sense of achievement once Phil finally gets somewhere. There are down periods too, Phil gets slapped more than a few times, experiences some real loss and failure when dealing with a homeless person, and gives up in the most final of ways many, many times. Other guys with even more time on there hands than I have estimated that Phil spends between 6 and 12 months reliving the same day, that's enough for a lot of crazy moods swings, planning and antics.Aside from all this it must be said that the film is extremely funny, aside from Bill Murray's tour de force as Phil Andie MacDowell plays the straight, slightly bemused love interest role well, Elliott as Larry is OK in a bit role and the people that Phil encounters momentarily, but in the same way every day all add a chuckle or two.Same as Scrooged though not much of this would be as good without Murray, he elevates the material a good couple notches higher, only this time the film was very good before he got involved, his inclusion made it great.Final Rating ? 9 / 10. There are a hell of a lot of movies I wouldn't want to relive again, thankfully this is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phil is in a state of shock when he wakes up at the same time to the same song again and again. He thinks he is experiencing Dj? vu. Once Phil realizes that he can make mistakes without consequences, he uses this to his advantage by drunk driving, stealing money and scamming woman, but made no effort to make changes to his attitude or life. Every day he stepped in the same puddle because he had not made any changes to his life. This quickly turns bad, and he becomes scared at the fact he will never live to see another day so he tries several times to kill himself. He starts to make changes in his life that effects his daily interaction with everyone he encounters on February 2. He begins to become the most popular person in the town. Even so much that Rita pays $339.58 for a date with him. The character Rita is great because she is the total opposite of Phil. She always sees the positive side of things. During the movie it was dark and snowing to keep the viewer in the mindset that it is winter time. So when Phil and Rita are building a snowman and sitting in front of the fire, it is realistic. Rita falls in love with the man Phil became due to the changes he has made in his life. They wake up together and it is the next day. Groundhog Day is closing related to the Book of Eli. They both take a man on a journey through life and all its obstacles. With hard work one will be triumphant in the end. Once you learn why life is worth living, you see it in a new light, like Phil saw winter, "winter is another step in life".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good film which gets one thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a film that so encapsulates the value of our inner self given that time no longer matters. As Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, we learn that given eternity, the only factor that will change is the person experiencing eternity. We see this through him learning French, the piano, ice sculpting. But I think more intriguing than that is the way Phil learns about the people in the small town. I was incredibly impressed by the scene in which he points out several townspeople and tells their stories. Eternity isn't just about one person, but about finding out about everyone else too.I was also intrigued by the small comparison that was made to God. Obviously Phil was nowhere near divinity, but in one aspect I think the movie approached it - the idea of God outside time. Since Phil could just live the same day over and over, he could really get to know every single person in the town, he could figure out what they needed most at certain times and provide help in the best way he could. In a way, this is an incredible insight into the nature of God, and for Christians it is rather exciting since we believe that every day for God is like Phil's day - lasting for an eternity and in that eternity God can give each of us his own personal treatment and help us out when we most need it. Sorry if that sounds a little overly religious, but it really is what attracted me the most to the film.Finally, the film leaves us with the perfect blueprint of how to live life - as if it were to last for an eternity (and for Christians this is true). This means getting to know people and also changing ourselves for the better over time - not superficially like the weather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Groundhog Day. I'm glad I just saw it recently, now that I'm older I enjoy it so much more. I liked GD the first time I saw it as a kid, then I saw it as a teen, and absolutely loved it. I immediately purchased it from GameStop, and have watched it at least ten times since then.Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are both fantastic. Murray plays the lead role of Phil Connors, a prima donna weatherman who fancies himself quite the celebrity. He's doing his hated annual report on the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxatawney, Pennsylvania. Phil goes to bed and wakes up on Groundhog Day. He does the report, and then while trying to leave Punxatawney, he and his crew get stuck in a blizzard. They are forced to go back to Punxatawney.So that they do, and Phil goes to sleep in his nice, warm bed... And when he wakes up the next day, it's GROUNDHOG DAY! Again. He finds it all a little weird.Then he wakes up the next day...And the next day...And the next day...Only to find that it is Groundhog Day again and again. Phil desperately tries to find a solution to this conundrum of his, all while trying to win the heart of the beautiful Rita (MacDowell).This is a fantastic comedy classic directed by Harold Ramis (who has a cameo--he's the brain doctor). Overall, this movie is awesome, and can be enjoyed again and again with the whole family.4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange Sort of Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundhog Day is one of those surprise wonders. It was made intended to be a typical Saturday Night Live-ish comedy (given the presence of Murry, Brian Doyle-Murray, Chris Elliot, and director Ramis who gave us Stripes, Caddyshack, and Vacation, plus co-wrote Ghostbusters). And somehow, the movie goes so much further than that. To many, it's a spiritually significant work.Most everyone knows the premise: a Scrooge-like man finds himself doomed to relive the same day for what apparently will be eternity. After accepting his situation, he goes through several phases: taking advantage of the time loop for hedonistic pleasures, then entering a depressed, suicidal phase, and finally reaching out and becoming a new person. I think it's this last third that stays with audiences the most, as we watch our hero truly transform and care for others.Two things in particular make this a great movie: 1. The original script. It's as if the writer took this premise and thought out every single idea he could do with it. We watch Phil use his situation to take advantage of women. Later he hears news of a man's death, then tries to save him the next day. We watch him commit suicide multiple times, only to keep waking up back on the same morning. He steals money and buys things, only to be back to square one the next day. Several times he makes a connection with Rita, but she will always have no memory of it the next time they meet. It's a wonder when, after seeing her throughout the whole movie, you'll see her in a scene 90 minutes in and she'll once more act like she hardly knows Phil. You have to admire the actors, filming scenes upon scenes countless times, having to give variations on the exact same situations that we keep seeing repeated.2. Bill Murray's performance. Like his character in Lost In Translation, he plays someone who is funny and tired of being funny, and grows as a character throughout. Even when committing multiple suicides, Murray keeps the scenes darkly humorous. In fact, one has to admire the way the film never steps out of being a comedy. What if the script had been completely revamped and made to be a serious drama, with a non-comedic actor in the lead? Perhaps it would've worked, but it wouldn't have been THIS movie.The story never explains why this curse is happening to Phil, nor does it need to. The result is a film with a number of good laughs, and something more. You can analyze it further, but you must watch it. Groundhog Day is a true achievement, and Murray and Ramis at their best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Groundhog Day": Philosophical/Spiritual Messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to classify this film, I think I'd call it "Romantic Comedy/Fantasy". But that hardly does it justice. Bill Murray, as the obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, is hilarious, as usual. He was the perfect choice to play the self-centered Phil. To sum up the plot, if you haven't seen it: Phil travels to Punxsutawney, PA with producer Rita (Andie McDowell) &amp; cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) to cover the Annual Groundhog Day Celebration. (A real-life event, by the way.) After covering the celebration, they're stranded there by a blizzard. Phil awakens the next morning, or so he thinks, and soon learns a terrible truth: He's entered some kind of time loop &amp; must live the same day over &amp; over, again &amp; again &amp; again... Phil realizes that he can work this to his advantage. At first, he uses it as an excuse to abandon self-control &amp; avoid responsibility. He takes up some unhealthy &amp; risky habits, knowing that he can start over each day. He soon becomes despondent, however &amp; tries to kill himself several times. Of course, he fails for obvious reasons. Eventually, he starts reaching out to help others in the community, which earns him their respect. In the process, he becomes a better person. But more to the point: Beneath the surface, Groundhog Day has a deeper meaning. The basic premise, in itself, raises the question: What power created the temporal loop in the first place? Was it God, karma or some unknown cosmic force? How long was Phil actually in the loop? Days? Years? Centuries? Would time have any meaning while he was in there? I think the movie purposely leaves these things to our imagination. Why has Phil been "sentenced" to relive this day indefinitely? Is it a divine judgment on his character? Is this his "Hell" or "Purgatory"? Is his karma catching up with him? Let's look at how Phil's life is changed by his experience: In the beginning, he's rude, obnoxious &amp; self-centered. Being trapped in the time warp, at first, brings out his negative personality traits when he realizes that his behavior can have no apparent consequences. Some examples: He punches out a pushy insurance salesman. He steals money from an armored truck. He uses women, including Rita (on whom he has a serious crush). He smokes, drinks &amp; overeats. He makes rude comments on-camera at the Groundhog Day Celebration. After several unsuccessful attempts at suicide, Phil begins to soften. He begins using the knowledge he's gained to reach out to others. He soon learns how to be in the right place at the right time to help people in need. Some examples of this: He saves the Groundhog Festival emcee from choking. He catches a little boy who falls out of a tree. He changes a flat tire for some elderly ladies. He comes to the aid of a homeless man &amp; prevents him from dying of a heart attack. He even learns to play the piano &amp; takes up ice sculpting. Phil eventually wins Rita's heart. Then he's released from the temporal loop &amp; time again progresses normally for him. We can see, from this, how Phil Connors learns from his mistakes, changes his attitude &amp; his outlook on life, steps out of his self-centered little world &amp; is finally able to show true love &amp; compassion for others. There's a definite theme of redemption &amp; salvation here, which should appeal to Christians. Because Phil is given countless chances to change his ways, this could symbolize God's infinite mercy. This would appeal to Jews, Christians &amp; Muslims alike. Hindus &amp; Buddhists would appreciate how Phil begins to build up good karma through selfless acts of kindness. Phil's eventually release from the time warp may symbolize a rebirth, reincarnation, an ascension to Heaven or some sort passage into the afterlife. In conclusion, Groundhog Day, besides being a great comedy, is rich in symbolism. We could all learn something from it. I highly recommend watching it. If you've already seen it, see it again (&amp; again &amp; again &amp; ...). Yes, I know it was released in 1993, but it's timeless. (Pun intended.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This should have been put in the goofs arena. I tried to find a place to enter this in the goofs section, but could not find it. When the news crew are standing around Groundhog Phil's rising station at Gobbler's Knob, you can see 4 or 5-story buildings behind Phil Connors, and once again behind Rita. I just went to visit Gobbler's Knob. There are no buildings of any significant size at the site -- just one park ranger station. It's mainly woods there. I would have thought that, while filmed in Illinois, the production crew would have at least taken a stroll through Gobbler's Knob in Pennsylvania before they started filming. They could have simply found some woodsy area in Illinois to film the groundhog shots. I took photos of the actual site that show all of this. Too bad I can't submit them for the readers to see. It's actually a very serene place there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To my mind, the most enjoyable Bill Murry movie of all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owning this film - "Groundhog Day" - has allowed me the opportunity to view it many times. And with each additional viewing, I gain an ever-increasing appreciation for it's genius. After a hundred years of film-making, it's hard to find a life-situation or story-premise that hasn't been done adnauseam.But this wonderfully original script deals with a whole new arena of comedy, that of living the same day over and over again,..."Groundhog Day". Once he, (Bill Murry) discovers his life has become a continuous replay of the same 24 hour period, it eventually allows him to grow, and learn to perfect his talents and skills to the Benefit of all, and ultimately in the end, to himself. A truly delightful film, one you'll enjoy viewing repeatedly, reliving the same day over and over again, just like the main character in the film.</fullReview>

I am sure many people wish that they could relive a day in their life and do things to make it better. Even though it is fantasy, and that the movies can make fantasy come true. It has been a wish for centuries. You have heard people say " I wish I could go back in time and know what I know now" and to me this is what this movie represents. I had to see this movie several times before the true theme sank in. And in the end the character that Bill plays does a complete personality overhaul and finds nirvana. I think it is a wonderful picture, along the same genera as "A wonderful life".</fullReview>

Everything is in place for a happy romance. But this isn't all about romance. This about learning to appreciate each day for being alive and having everything you have.Groundhog Day is perfection from beginning to end. The end in particular had me in tears with all of it's sweetness.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accidental Buddhism lesson?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but the movie seems to follow the Buddhist path to enlightenment almost exactly. For anyone who doesn't know, the path is similar to the steps that people go through when dealing with failure or death. First there is confusion, then denial, then anger, then reasoning, and then acceptance. In Buddhism, one has to first realize that there is suffering. Phil does not realize what is happening at first; it's a shock that the day is repeating. He goes to sleep the first few times, hoping the day will change. When it doesn't, he gets angry and begins to kill himself in numerous ways. In Buddhism, this would be akin to living life frivolously. Once Phil realizes this will not end the day, he begins to do good things. This is the bargaining stage. However, this is not true altruism in that he is only doing good in order to escape the day. It is not until he accepts his fate that he begins to do good simply for the sake of doing good, and not for selfish reasons. This is the first real step in attaining enlightenment: accepting that life is suffering, and choosing to ease the suffering of others. Through this idea, Phil is finally able to escape the day, which would be akin to escaping the cycle of reincarnation and attaining nirvana. Essentially, Phil is going through this cycle on a microscopic basis, one day at a time instead of one life at a time. Sorry for the long explanation, I just thought it was fascinating that such a funny and entertaining movie could have such a deep undercurrent, whether the producers meant it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murray at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a rather big movie of I think early 1993. It was one of the best comedies of that year and won over more people on its release on video. I didn't care to see it at first, but watched it when it came on cable and it won me over too. The story has a somewhat grumpy weatherman sent to a city to do a story on the Groundhog there and the festival surrounding it. I know the name of the city, but I am not even going to try to spell it. He hates the idea and wants to get out of there as fast as he can. Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and he has to stay longer (a blizzard he predicted would miss the area). So he stays the night and the next morning starts out eerily the same as the previous. At first he thinks it is just a coincidence, but realizes soon enough that the day is repeating over again. It continually repeats throughout the movie and you get to see Murray begin to loath the town and then fall in love with it. No real explanation is given for why the day repeats, but none is really needed and it is amusing to watch Murray go through the city knowing exactly when and where things will happen and getting to know all the people as well. The movie takes kind of a somber twist near the end when some scenes involving a homeless man come up, but it doesn't stay somber instead going for a more positive, funny conclusion. I love the scene with the kid in the tree. How long he stays in the day is anyone's guess, but I figure he had to be there a good 15 years worth of days...my friend informs me it takes a while to master a piano that well. This is a very funny and entertaining movie that is heart warming as well. I also have to give it a chuckle cause of all the time he spent trying to pursue the one lady played by McDowell...It does take forever to win over the best gals out there doesn't it? Chris Elliot is also in this one, but don't let that scare you off, he is actually rather good and doesn't detract from the movie at all. All in all a very good comedy, bravo Harold Ramis.</fullReview>

His disdain for the town and its customs are further amplified by the fact that he unexpectedly finds himself reliving the same twenty-four hours over and over again. Full of amusing dialogue and situations, sharp, original ideas, and recurring gags that stay fresh despite the redundant nature of the storyline. A great and memorable role for Murray, who's simply brilliant as a man struggling to find his own humanity. A likable supporting cast doesn't hurt. ***</fullReview>

Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas. The script is a delight, always funny, quotable and witty, while the story has a surprisingly refreshing concept and several great scenes.The cinematography is beautiful, and the locations and production values are consistently striking. Also Harold Ramis's direction is excellent, the pace rarely lags and all the characters are credible. The acting is wonderful too, and by far one of the best assets of this film. Bill Murray gives one of the best performances of his career, Stephen Tabolowsky gives a superb turn as the nerdy insurance salesman and the lovely Andie McDowell has never been better.In conclusion, a delightful film that works on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

With so many films just copying each other, sometimes with very little change other than the actors - witness the ripoffs of great foreign films made by Hollywood with sub-par actors - it is refreshing to see something different.Starring Bill Murray in what is probably his best role, Lost in Translation notwithstanding, it also feature a fantastic performance by Andie MacDowell, who grabbed my heart in Four Weddings and a Funeral.This is a film that will keep you laughing and holds up well despite the fact that I have seen it ten times at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that defies its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until now Groundhog Day was one of the few films in IMDb's top 250 that i hadn't had the pleasure of watching, mainly due to the fact that it is often perceived to belong in the Rom-com genre. As this genre in my view produces some of the most torrid films i have ever seen i decided to leave the film for a very long time.On viewing the film i would first like to say that it doesn't belong in the Rom-com genre. Yes it has Romance and yes it is the the driving force behind the film's conclusion, but for the most part the film's narrative doesn't concentrate on this romance. Instead this is a film about how Phil(Bill Murray), and i hate to be clichd, discovers himself. This is why i would be inclined to call Groundhog day a comedy.On to the review. Honestly when i look at comedy films i don't take into account it's 'artistic' merit, e.g. the direction or cinematography. Instead i find that when watching comedy films the plot and jokes should be the main focus.Groudhog Day's success mainly comes down to two factors, the first is it's plot. Being a completely inspired idea it would have been very hard to make a film that wasn't funny. The execution however was perfect which managed to harvest every bit of humour it could from the situation Phil is put into.The second reason for the success of the film can be put down to the brilliance of the acting, in particular in reference to Bill Murray, who is on better form than ever (and that is a high standard). Thanks to Murray i found myself connecting to the character like never before in a comedy, adding to the effect of the humour.Overall Grounhog day is an almost perfect film which fractionally misses out on the title of best comedy ever.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While GROUNDHOG DAY is not my favorite Bill Murray comedy, it is one of three brilliant comedies he made during the early 90s and all three are absolute must-sees. And, interestingly enough, while the film is very funny, it also has some wonderful and poignant moments--something I usually hate in comedies.The plot is pretty simple. Murray plays a jerk or a TV weather man who is sent against his will to cover the annual festivities concerning America's second favorite rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, as he tells us whether or not we'll have a long, hard winter (a very stupid tradition if you ask me). Naturally after having done this repeated times he's less than thrilled, but there's more to it than that--Murray is a nasty jerk and he delights in looking down on all the locals that take such pride in this event. Apparently, the fate is not happy with Murray, as he is oddly punished and made to repeat this same day again and again and again. Why exactly is unknown but his reactions to this exact same day are priceless--ranging from insanely funny to weird to touching.In addition to Murray's excellent performance, Andi McDowell does a good job in support and the film makers really did a wonderful job of capturing the wacky essence of small town America as well as creating a wonderful and quirky script.This film is terrific--you must see this film...now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS One of my favorite films! Just like "It's a Wonderful Life," Harold Ramis sets this quirky fantasy-romantic comedy in a small, snowy town. Unlike Jimmy Stewart's character, however, Bill Murray's (one of my favorite actors of all time-- so, shoot me!) has virtually zero compassion factor at the start. Through an unknown mechanism, our "hero" is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he "gets it right," that moral being in the hands of the filmmakers. On the way from ruffian to sweetheart, Phil Connors gets his face slapped repeatedly, robs a bank, becomes a romantic scoundrel, commits various suicides, and generally runs rampant as he knows that tomorrow is NOT "another day," but the same day! Great fun and loads of laughs, smirks, and "cool!"'s even after seeing more times that I can count. When Phil finally starts to "settle down" after "sowing his oats," the Capraesque elements start creeping in, until you are swimming in Americana, heroism, and sentimentality. Granted, you have to like Bill Murray (which I do), and you have to enjoy the old-fashioned sensibilities that the movie wants to impart (and I do). I give it 10/10. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Funny Movie!! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very funny(since it's starring one of the funniest comedians ever: Bill Murray, who's funny as Hell). It is a story about a man who repeats Groundhog Day over and over again.Phil Connors(Murray) is a weatherman, who doesn't like a lot of things. He has been assigned(once again) to do the news for Groundhog Day at Punxatawny. At Punxatawny, his daily routine is saying hello to a happy man, having breakfast at the hotel he's staying in, refusing to give an old man money, meeting an old man, accidentally stepping into an ice puddle, doing the Groundhog Day report, then trying to get home in the snow, unfortunately for him, getting stuck in Punxatawny because of bad weather. So Phil goes back to the hotel and stays over night. The next morning, he finds that the whole routine that happened on Groundhog Day is happening again. He looks on the calender and finds out it's Groundhog Day again. He does what he does on Groundhog Day again, with uncertainty. Then he goes back to the hotel and wakes up the next day to find it's Groundhog Day again. Eventually, Phil uses his waking up to Groundhog Day again to his advantage. He steals money, gets arrested, and tries to pick up the news's weathergirl who is part of his Groundhog Day crew(Andie McDowell). That's the 'romance' part of this movie. Phil everyday tries to pick up the weathergirl(I forget her name)and uses what she likes and dislikes to his advantage. When he does something she dislikes, he corrects it and does what she likes. The rest of the movie you'll have to find out for yourself.I recommend this movie to everyone. Anyone who watches it will like it and laugh.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films of all time. A wonderful little romantic comedy that is full of quirks, fantastic and zany humor, an eventually touching romantic sub-plot and Bill Murray putting in his best performance in a comedy film (only his recent turn in Lost in Translation is on a par with his performance here), this is as close as romantic comedies come to perfection. While the plot has been done on countless science fiction and fantasy television shows, from The Twilight Zone to The X Files, Star Trek to Buffy The Vampire Slayer, the concept works frequently well and does so here, working brilliantly due to the efforts of Harold Ramis behind the camera and script, alongside Danny Rubin on screenplay duties and the magnificent central performance of Bill Murray as Phil Connors, the egotistical and heartless reporter who, in the grand traditions of Hollywood, becomes a better man due to his predicament. While it is clear early on that this is where the story is going, the journey there is one of the most entertaining and downright funny comedies to be filmed. Phil's journey takes in the the emotional ranges of bewilderment, to confidence in using the time warp to his advantage (getting laid, stealing money from a bank van, trying to move in on his producer Rita (a beautiful Andie McDowell)) to depression that leads to many suicide attempts and eventually to acceptance, where he tries to right the wrongs of the day, from being nicer to Rita and his camera man Larry, to saving lives successfully (Buster, the Groundhog keeper) to sadly the not so successful (the old man in the street). Murray has always cornered the markets of either being sarcastic but lovable (Ghostbusters) to just plain nasty (Scrooged), but here he mixes in many personalities in his performance. How he goes from being sarcastic and nasty to a really nice guy is believably done and marks this out as his finest performance. How he genuinely comes to love Rita would have been hokey and sentimental in the hands of any other director or actor, but in the hands of Ramis and Murray it becomes a touching and life affirming comedy that is well worth repeat viewing. Adding to this wonderful mix is a terrific little music score from George Fenton (genuinely romantic and emotional in some cases), a lovely supporting role for Andie McDowell (who wouldn't fall in love with her after watching this film) and some of the finest comedy scenarios committed to film. Check out Phil reciting the answers on Jeopardy before the question is even asked, the repeated suicide attempts and not forgetting the car chase involving Phil allowing the Groundhog to drive. This is as close to perfection as a film can possibly be and is perfect for repeat viewing.</fullReview>

The cast is uniformly excellent, with Bill Murray giving an Oscar-worthy comedic performance (he wasn't nominated, probably because he makes pictures like this seems easy and lightweight); Andie MacDowell gives her freshest, loveliest performance as a woman Murray intends to win, if he can just modify his bad manners. Cantankerous leading characters can sometimes be a drag on the screen, even if their slow-building rehabilitation is done with a gentle touch, but here Murray and director Harold Ramis create an immensely flawed human being and make him funny and endearing. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another nice concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's concept for its main conflict is really nice. Able to relive the same day over and over again magically seems to have it's own perks of repetition and learning from mistakes. Too bad that the concept is only developed into a meagerly interesting final product. I've seen Edge of Tomorrow, which uses the same concept, but it ends up better for me due to it took the concept into a more serious matter. Nevertheless this movie can still have good grip on its main concept and took it into quite a good story with nice repeated scenes. Too bad that the ending is only about love and nothing else. The acting overall is quite good for me. Bill Murray's acting is really suiting to his character's reluctance at things. Andie MacDowell did well to provide the balancing angle for the story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult Classic That Lives Up to Its Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally got around to seeing "Groundhog Day," the cult classic about a jerk of a T.V. weather man (Bill Murray) who finds himself stuck reliving the same day over and over.I was afraid that the very premise of the film would force some predictability on the screenplay: he has to first figure out he's reliving the same day, then finds it cool that he's reliving the same day, then gets sick of reliving the same day, etc. And it does tick off these boxes, but in a way that's much more creative and less formulaic than it might otherwise have been. Murray is perfectly cast as a misanthrope who gradually learns how to become a better man when he's forced to practice, and Andie MacDowell, who I don't particularly like (and of whom this film didn't make me a convert) is fine if bland as Murray's love interest.The film does actually make you think about what you would do with yourself if you had to repeatedly live the same day. Would you be maddened by the sameness, or would you embrace the possibilities? Kind of like life itself, no?Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film can sometimes escape the expected blas critique of a movie. Groundhog Day is a beautiful fable that will teach generations to come a very valuable lesson if they have not already opened up to its theory.However, I do find that it is highly relevant to a Westernised way of life. If you were born in Syria 13 years ago, today sadly you may not have the opportunity that our protagonist has here to evolve his point of view.But if you do, it asks you to make the very most of what you have innately within you, and demonstrates the theory that only then can you truly experience the emotion of love.

		<fullReview>I had seen this movie when it came out in the beginning of 1990ies, but I did not remember much of it. Only the fact that Murray and MacDowell are great actors. I am still of the opinion, although Murray's role in this movie is more significant - more than in his other movie where he stars excellently - "Lost in Translation". However, at times, windings of the plot are difficult to monitor and there are not too many scenes you can really laugh - and they are all related to Murray's lines. The best scene is where Murray is driving mad the car with two local rednecks and gives his views on life and future. The romantic angle with MacDowell is similar to most of movies with Meg Ryan. In short, recommendable within an intelligent community, not to be watched as a comedy in a loud and drinking group :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GROUNDHOG DAY (Harold Ramis, 1993) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I had always been aware of this film's considerable reputation, it took me this long to get acquainted with it; in retrospect, I feel the picture to be deserving of the epithet "modern comedy classic". It deals with an original ? and for the genre, singular ? concept: a literal case of multiple deja'-vu experiences (in all fairness, the minor sci-fi entry THE TIME TRAVELERS [1964] had already delved into the theme, though obviously lacking the skill and polish realized here). Bill Murray tackles one of his best roles, actually a variation on the actor's own characterization in the much inferior SCROOGED (1988), which I watched only last week; now he is an arrogant (can he play any other way?) Weather Man assigned to the unexciting titular event in Pennsylvania ? eager to get out of there, he not only finds the passage blocked by a snowstorm but, by some unexplained quirk of nature, finds himself reliving the same day over and over again! At first, he is understandably baffled and frustrated by all of this ? especially in the face of the obliviousness to his predicament shown by colleagues and townspeople alike; then, he is amused by the sheer predictability of the day's proceedings; gradually, however, he learns to take advantage of this state-of-affairs ? not only involving himself in the everyday life of the town, but also striving to better himself (such as becoming an accomplishment piano-player or a hand-craft artisan seemingly in the space of single day); most of all, however, he works at cultivating a loving relationship with Andie McDowell, the producer of his TV program who, normally, cannot stand him! Apparently, Murray and director Ramis (co-stars in STRIPES [1981], another recent viewing, and the GHOSTBUSTERS films) fell out during the making of this one because they had contrasting opinions about the prevailing tone of the script: Murray wanted it to be of a more philosophical bent, while Ramis thought better of extracting the comic potential out of the central situation; in the end, I feel the film strikes a good balance between the two (with plenty of visual gags and assorted mayhem but, at the same time, having a definite bittersweet side to it ? in view of the above-mentioned budding romance and also Murray's numerous failed suicides!).</fullReview>

This film is also a great romantic comedy between Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. I also like the fantasy feel with the time revolving plot.One thing I find tireless in the film is of the day going over and over again. You would like it the first couple of times but it gets really tiring. I actually wanted the days to stop going over and over again. It felt like a three hour film.The acting by Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are great, having great chemistry. Chris Elliott's performance is pretty funny.If you like fantasy comedic romance, with some great scenes and presents a great moral of the story, you'll like this film as much as me but probably get tired of the repeating days.</fullReview>

But I really think this movie is about being a better person overall.The thing that bothered me was as follows...I wanted Bill Murray's character to stay up all night until 6:00am and then see what happens. He would be awake during that time so it would be fun to see what unfolds. That kept on nagging at me when I watched this movie recently.

		<shortDescription>Cheap laughs and over-sentimentality wrapped up in an interesting concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience. Though in the surface a good vehicle for Bill Murray, the cons outweigh the pros.There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world? The only possible solution to this, considering no one else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory. So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see. So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world. And each Phil goes onto the next day with everyone else in the world. So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more.So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd? The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him. In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives. So what could account for Phil? Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours. The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish. The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory.Now, much of the dialogue is strictly cheap laughs ("ever had Deja Vu?" "I'll see if it's on the menu" and such). But as far as any overall message it gets lost in over-sentimentality, especially at the end. The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use tricks to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes the tricks as to impress her beyond belief. Remember that close to t helast night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last "perfect" day. On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so. So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want.If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a great film. As it is it a mediocre comedy with a twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those movies ...which could have been much better....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shall not try to conceal my disappointment when it comes to this movie. In a way though I knew something like this would would happen. A seriously well thought out plot and some good performances by the cast weren't enough to raise this movie's stature in my eyes to the extent that it be voted among the top 250 movies of all times.All said and done though , I shall commence my analysis.The DirectionA typical early 90's flick and hence had that pseudo feel good vibe around it, found in most light romantic movies of that time. The director could have done much better with the story handed out to him . Some parts were hastily executed were others were rubbed on for too long . The ScreenplayIt was the screenplay which disappointed me the most. The dialogues were sparingly funny. Wit was evidently absent . Many lines were repetitive and proved highly unbecoming for the plot. I mean , none of the actors had show stealers given to them.The ActingBill Murray is a veteran . But that fact does not by itself imply that he is extraordinary . A fine actor with good facial expressions and body language , he surely is. The driving force of the movie , undoubtedly.Andy McDowell does fine as a clichd yet for some reason attractive leading lady .The support staff is equally decent (not more not less).The StoryGood. Actually great. In that it captures all those finer emotions of a life ; It deals with actual dilemmas and Bill Murray's acting and Make Up actually serve the story well. Most Importantly , only faint references to sex. No Nudity or any overtly sexual scenes , no profanities. Perhaps this is why it is so popular. A clean and neat family movie. Why I gave it 7 .For me the movie is undoubtedly neat and clean ( a relief , after a long time) and that is important. The fact that the movie pulls along at a nice rate and tempo without the use of profanities or explicit scenes (despite being a highly rated comedy movie) is itself commendable.On the whole a decent family flick but according to me could have been better , for the position it occupies in the Top 250 list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Murray has the role of a lifetime as snide weatherman Phil Connors, going to Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the groundhog seeing/not seeing its shadow. But after bad weather forces him and his cohorts (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott) to stay there, he wakes up the next morning and it's still Groundhog Day! And so is every day after that! To make matters crazier, he's the only one who even notices this! While most movies would probably try to use this premise as an excuse for a bunch of silly gags, "Groundhog Day" uses it to show how Phil changes: he starts out a sour, cynical jerk, and slowly but surely grows more human as the movie passes. That's not to say that the movie doesn't allow for some goofy scenes. Among other things, Phil memorizes every event that's going to happen every day ("I am God! I know everything that's going to happen!"), and he has a really funny encounter with the groundhog in one scene. Harold Ramis created a perfect comedy here.</fullReview>

So it's taken me something like thirteen years to get around to Groundhog Day and on balance it was worth the weight. It's a classic example of shadow over substance - in this case the shadow of the groundhog that will theoretically determine the end of winter and start of spring - one of those where the performances and feelgood factor triumph over sloppy plotting - like WHY, out of nowhere does someONE or someTHING single out Bill Murray and tap him as a modern day Flying Dutchman doomed to live the same day over and over and equally pertinent WHY is he finally released. These plot holes remain unaddressed and remain in the middle of the script waiting for the cast to fall in. Having said that the acting is great as is the feelgood factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to watch "Groundhog Day"...again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are enjoyed by millions and even critically acclaimed when they are first released, but end up being largely forgotten. Then there are those movies that are so original, so well-done, so reflective of their times, or so impactful on the culture that they never leave our memories. These are the films that seem to constantly hover in the back of our conscious minds, available to be instantly brought to the forefront when we encounter a situation, a phrase or even just a mood that reminds us of the first time we saw it. "Groundhog Day" (1993) is such a movie.It made a good profit during its initial run (according to Wikipedia, earning $70.9 million in North America, making it the 13th highest grossing movie of 1993), but the movie has become even better appreciated and loved over the years. It has made many "Best of" movie lists and has been preserved by the Library of Congress. Even the legendary critic Roger Ebert, in his "Great Movies" essay, according to Wikipedia, wrote that "he had initially underestimated the film's many virtues and only came to truly appreciate it through repeated viewings." But the film's impact is even deeper and broader than those facts suggest. Think about it. When people refer to a case of seemingly never-ending repetition, they often refer to it as being "like groundhog day". They're not talking about the annual event in Pennsylvania and various other locations around the nation. They're talking about the movie. THAT'S significant impact. When was the last time that YOU checked out this cinematic gem? If it's been awhile, or if you've never seen it, read on.Bill Murray stars as Chuck Connors, a clever, but arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is dreading his annual trip to nearby Punxsutawney to cover Groundhog Day, or as he calls it, "a large rodent predicting the weather." His new and vivacious producer, Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) does her best to keep him happy and help get the job done, while their cameraman, Larry (Chris Elliott), has learned to just put up with Phil. On his way from his room in a cozy B&amp;B to his on-camera gig, Phil encounters a number of people whom he writes off as "hicks", including a friendly hotel guest on the stairs, the proprietor of the B&amp;B, Mrs. Lanchester (Angela Paton), and an old high school classmate named Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) who tries to sell him insurance. After running this gauntlet, he gets to the site just in time, does a brief, sarcastic on-camera commentary and gets ready to get the heck out of Dodge. To Phil's consternation, their van gets turned around on the highway by a blizzard moving in, a blizzard which, ironically, Phil had predicted would miss that area. But a botched weather forecast and an unexpected return to Punxsutawney are only the beginning of Phil's problems.The next morning, Phil wakes up in the same room as the day before, to the same song on the radio, with the disc jockeys saying the same things and meeting the same people in the same places saying the same things as the day before ? because it IS the day before! As Phil says in his on camera report, "It's Groundhog Day?again." It soon starts looking like it's going to be February 2nd for the rest of Phil's life. As Phil goes through the cinematic equivalent of purgatory, at first, he's confused, and then he's frustrated. Then he expresses a desire to get stuck in a better day? but starts trying to enjoy the consequence-free nature of this one, even to the point of manipulating people (especially Rita, whom he wants to fall for him). Soon, Phil despairs to the point of trying to kill himself and then he resigns himself to what seems to be his fate. It's almost as if he's going through the classic stages of grief ? grief over the life he has lost ? the kind of life we all take for granted, the ability to wake up tomorrow and actually have it BE tomorrow. "What if there IS no tomorrow?" Phil once shouts in frustration. "There wasn't one today!" Eventually, after untold numbers of years stuck in the same day (the actual number of re-dos being the topic of much debate), Phil begins using his virtual omniscience for good and becomes a better person for it. (Just in case anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie, I won't spoil it by telling you whether Rita eventually falls for Phil or if he breaks free from his cycle of February 2nds.) The late, great Harold Ramis co-wrote, directed (and briefly appears in) this classic comedy, which is much more than the sum of its parts. The script is sharp and witty, the direction and editing are skilled and the film is perfectly cast. This movie is original, clever and very funny, but is also very meaningful. I won't over-analyze the movie and ruin it for anyone, or deprive you of your own interpretations, but I will say that there is a lot of symbolism in this movie and some lessons on the importance of having unselfish priorities. Now, as long as this retro review is already, I could say more, but I'm writing this on the evening of February 2nd and I'm excited about what that means. It's time to watch "Groundhog Day"?again!</fullReview>

It does have a philosophical conundrum buried in it, but at heart this is a romantic comedy with a twist. It is not philosophy sugar-coated as romantic comedy. In other words, if you want a good philosophical think, read some Bertrand Russell instead.There are some very entertaining scenes - the bowling alley debate and the "Thelma &amp; Louise"-esque scene with Bill Murray and the groundhog especially coming to mind as "laugh-out-louders".If you haven't seen it, then treat yourself to an hour-and-a-half of escapism and laughter, because that's what Groundhog Day is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not saying that this movie isn't funny... quite the contrary. But so many claim that it's great, almost a masterpiece... why? It starts out very good, with Bill Murray being his typical, sarcastic, at times deadpan self, and continue being so for a good while... but somewhere, about halfway through the movie, the films pace suddenly slows ridiculously down and we're suddenly not watching a comedy with Murray's sharp wit and excellent delivery, but rather a typical early 90's romantic comedy. Why couldn't this film break that damn barrier? Why does there always have to be romance? I know, I know, us humans have quite an insatiable lust and longing for love, but can't we think of something more original and constructive to put in movies? The film gets better a little later, with Murray doing more fun stuff again... and the plot is now turned around. The first half of the film is Murray doing what he feels like, pleasing himself, the latter half if him serving other people, pleasing others. This works well, and there are some funny moments in both parts(though there are far more in the first). But the whole romance subplot... I don't know, maybe it's because it's Andie MacDowell, the queen(well, one of them... another good example would be Julia Roberts, but she's done more versatile roles) of annoying romantic comedies. Why, oh why must there always romance in movies like this? Hell, the movie could have gotten an 8 from me, or possibly even a perfect 10, if it had kept up the great entertainment of the first half. Some of the movie also seems to drag a bit, since we're basically just watching the same thing over and over again... but with tiny alterations every once in a while. The plot is good, but the romance subplot sucks. The pacing is OK. The acting is somewhat good... but the only actor that impressed me was Bill Murray... and even he was portraying the exact same character that he always does. The characters are well-written... to a extent. The humor is good. All in all, the movie is worth watching and good, but it's by no means great. I recommend it to fans of Bill Murray and *shudder* romantic comedies. 7/10</fullReview>

It has a lot of slap stick I do not care mush for slap stick. I think it is simple and not that funny. It is kind of a good concept. But not a very good movie. Don't see it don't see it don't see it don't see it don't see it. Not funny not funny not funny not funny. Pooh pooh, pooh pooh, pooh pooh, pooh pooh, and pee pee to. I need more line and I don't know what less to say. This and an awful movie. Awful movie awful movie awful movie awful movie. Bill Murray clowns around to try and make better. But the script is so week it still is a very bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phil Connor is a weatherman who travels every year to Pennsylvania to film the Grounhog day. He hates this day and now it's his third time. Now the day begins to repeat and repeat. It stops repeating when he changes his character. We watched this movie in our culture class. I lerned a little bit more about the American culture. But we didn't have popcorn because our teacher don't like it. It was very special to watch a movie in class. We saw a man who sang for a woman during the film. Now we have new people in class and they didn't have very much fun because they didn't see the film. Today I explained the new people what the film is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every day like the one before...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GROUNDHOG DAY is really a jigsaw puzzle of a film. Are we supposed to believe that somehow fate decrees that for punishment you must relive every day like the one before--if you are judged to be a rude enough person in need of redemption? A pretty shaky premise for any comedy/fantasy--and yet, the amazing thing about GROUNDHOG DAY is that it succeeds despite the flawed premise.There are numerous twists and turns in the plot--totally unexpected and welcome--otherwise, with the story heading in the same direction day after day, things could have become pretty monotonous. That pitfall is avoided by spicing up the story with just the little differences that make for some brilliant comic touches.BILL MURRAY is quite acceptable here as the unprincipled weather man who decides to change his ways--rather improbably, I might add--and alter the course of his life. ANDIE MacDOWELL is pleasing enough as the woman he falls in love with, although never one of my favorite actresses. And others in the cast keep the comedy on a high level throughout much of the running time.Summing up: Improbable fantasy never explains why Murray suffers this strange fate--but it maintains interest and the screenplay has enough originality to keep it fresh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might have seen this film once, but not paid full attention, and I am very glad I tried it again to understand and appreciate it, from Ghostbusters star Harold Ramis directing (Bedazzled). Basically TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the news story of Groundhog Day festivities in the town, with his producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott). The day seems pretty dull and ordinary for Phil, with some irritations along the way, but the next morning, the same 6:00am alarm playing Sonny and Cher's "I Got You Babe" repeats, as do all the events of Groundhog Day that Phil experienced. It happens again, and with all memory of his previous events, Phil is convinced he is stuck in a time loop, and for a while he takes advantage, including trying to woo Rita, which he fails at consistently. It becomes obvious he may be trapped like this, so he kills himself, but he is still alive, and tries again and again, but he still lives the same day. But with his knowledge of the same day events, Phil learns new skills and makes more friends, in order to become a saint to many people, including Rita. It is only when Rita finally agrees to stay with Phil through the night that Phil finally wakes at 6:00am to the next day, so your probably thinking that all along he was living the same day in order to be with Rita, a sweet thought. Also starring Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned, Brian Doyle-Murray as Buster, Marita Geraghty as Nancy, Angela Paton as Mrs. Lancaster, Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun as Gus and Rick Overton as Ralph. I can see how this could almost be a one joke comedy, but both the fantastic Murray and director Ramis do everything to keep you engaged. It won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. It was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 13 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful out of 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TV meteorologist Phil Connors, his producer Rita, and cameraman Larry from the fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania (which, in real life, as in the movie, holds a major celebration for Groundhog Day) to cover the annual festivities with Punxsutawney Phil. After the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone service, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney. Connors awakens the next morning, however, to find it is again February 2, and his day unfolds in exactly the same way. He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 exactly the same way and for the first time. This recursion repeats the following morning as well, over and over again. For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., with his waking up to the same song, Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe", on his alarm clock radio, but with his memories of the "previous" day intact, trapped in a seemingly endless "time loop" to repeat the same day in the same small town.This is the worst comedy ever to be made ever. This is a piece of garbage, repeated script, bad actors, horrible dialogue. Nothing to hold your interest. Avoid it.Rated PG-13 for Profanity.Awesomely Bad Scale: * * * * out of 4.</fullReview>

Phil Connors is mysteriously forced to relive the same day over and over again---It presents this situation to the audience, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. He could rape all the characters, and even impregnate some of the female ones (he doesn't by the way), but it wouldn't matter because "tomorrow is not another day," it's the same day. He could actually apologise for raping them, and they wouldn't know what he was talking about. We have to believe that he is prevented from permanently touching anyone else's life, that he is in the world, but not of the world, so to speak. So to speak!! Many people seem to have got a message from this film, Some even quoting Socrates. Wow! O.K. I'll forget the "message", and the rest, and give it 6. Some of the very humorous, situations deserve a 10, and I had a few great laughs, but I just couldn't get away with the stupid idea. I found that the best way to watch this film, is to watch it on tape, and every ten minutes, rewind the tape five minutes. and press play. I think the film has had its day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...in some places a little annoying. Luckily, there's only a few annoying places, but on the other hand, can you make a movie, where you must repeat the same day, over and over without getting boring? Hard one, huh? Harold Ramis did that part quite O.K., not to mention, he had the two top-notch actors Andy MacDowell and Bill Murray beside him, who also did their part O.K. Just O.K.? Or could this movie become a classic. Well, it's got it's funny moments and some romantic ones (scene where Andy MacDowell offers 339,39 dollars is one of my favorites), but on the other hand, watching this movie for the third time, just wasn't (that) great experience and that's why mediocre, but still great mark.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like seeing the same thing over and over again, you will LOVE this movie. For me it was about as tedious and boring of a movie as you can get. I like Bill Murray but I could not stand this movie as the synopsis states it repeated Groundhog Day over and over again. I am not sure what the people that gave this 10 stars or near 10 stars were watching but next to Ishtar this move really sucked. The same thing happens, the same thing happens, the same thing happens, the same thing happens, get the point? Till basically the end. I was ready to shoot myself but then it did finally end. I just remember thinking it would be the last time they would repeat Groundhog day but it kept going till I finally made it through the movie. If I would have known how many times they were going to repeat it I would have turned it off after the second time. Well, I think you get the point I am starting to sound like the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightweight comedy which becomes patronising and unfunny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What should be a winning formula, with Ramis directing and Murray starring, manages to turn into one long drag.Murray plays a cynical TV Weatherman, reporting in a small town on their Groundhog Day celebrations. He finds himself stuck there, reliving the same day over and over again, and therefore able to manipulate the events he knows are coming.If this had remained a straight comedy things may have worked, but the film decides to cloak itself in a social message aura and tries to make some far-reaching preachy comments. What life was in the basic premise soon wears thin and the film drags itself along for the remaining hour or so.The film seems to be universally admired so maybe I'm not enlightened enough to fully appreciate it. It presumably has an element which hits a nerve with a certain audience - with me it didn't just miss the mark, it missed the entire block.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I somehow missed "Groundhog Day" until today (July 8th, 2010 - a day I DEFINITELY do not want to repeat, especially after watching this), but I didn't miss the ridiculous praise. I've heard it's "The best movie EVER" so many times now I'd think I was caught in a time-warp myself. Har har!That last joke was about as funny as anything in the movie. Not only did I barely chuckle, but Murray, whom I used to love, was grating, annoying, and not sincere for a single instant. I honestly thought I caught him winking at me during the "serious" "character-arc" scenes. That's not acting. That's mugging. That's masturbatory and insulting. To quote the movie itself, "I want my money back." Not to mention my TWO HOURS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundhog Day has a great deal of potential, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise. It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original. Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . .. . . . . A storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well. Due to the inherent comedy Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition. Although this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'. The film's biggest downfall is its predictability. Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy. Overall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, when the whole world is pouring accolades on the movie. Going by the reviews I too ventured to the movie with the whole family. In return what we go was crude jokes, tasteless scenes, senseless situations. The climax aptly summarizes the misery.At the end we realized that they almost re-made Munna Bhai MBBS all over again. This time around they just replaced Doctors with Bill Murray, Medical college with a weatherman &amp; Munna Bhai with Elko, Nevada. However at least the former was a clean comedy.If you are still curious about the movie, I strongly disagree with those who think this movie is a masterpiece. it is not.</fullReview>
