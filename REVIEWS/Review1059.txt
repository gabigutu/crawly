		<fullReview>What a pointless and racist review. Yes, Edward Snowden is a "WHITE MALE", oh the horror. If a movie or story is based on someone, they should be accurate as to who the story is about and not change it do to p.c. garbage. I find it pathetic and offensive that the only things you focus on is his race, gender and some how religion. How can we ever get passed racism and other bigotry when garbage like you focuses on it immediately.How can you say you want to instill a positive message when all you can do is focused on race, gender and hate?You then lead on to say "We need to end the evils of blue-eyed whiteness" So, are you saying to kill all whites?Scum like you should be put down like an infected and cancerous animal. You truly are what's wrong in this world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired of seeing scum like Sven B. with his racial propaganda on a film site."Snowden is unfortunately Caucasian" Really?! Unfortunate? How fortunate are you to be able to express your racist thought on the internet freely? Should consider yourself lucky. It is based on true event, dimwit. Thus, they are trying to accurately represent the person in accordance to his race and gender. If the heroes happen to be Black or Asian, women or whatever, then yea the character should be portrayed the right way (In fact, there area already plenty of foreign films like that). But in this case, Snowden is white. Deal with it.Interracial relationship along with other gender/race issues can be tackled in fictions, not story based on true events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Response to Snowden was a white guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen Snowden yet but I am responding to the review by Sven B. The comment that there is nothing to stop the character from being black, Muslim, woman, etc. This is a stupid comment. SNOWDEN is a white male. Get over it. You have a gay actor playing the reporter Greenwald so why are you complaining? Why should reality be changed just to soothe someone's identity problems? I have the same question about making Hamilton a black guy in the Broadway play when Hamilton was a white guy. To rewrite history? To spit in the eye of truth and reality. Get over it. I plan to see Snowden September 14th and will make a comment based on the writing and the portrayal of Snowden as, yes, a skinny white guy. Not as a guy who could have been black or a woman or a Hispanic or Muslim or any other minority.Wiener</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe just maybe if they changed all the names in this "BIO PIC" then it may make a good Netflix original. This movie based on the "real" life of Eddy Snowden proves to be embellished on by the film makers. Starts out realistic enough but then plummets into the world of make believe. It's bad. Even E.S. will be ashamed to watch this movie. I bet NSA has already seen it. Ha...Really I don't care if you want to watch it or if you think he is a "hero" or not. My two cents are that if I have to let NSA look at all the porn on my laptop as they want if it keeps planes from crashing into building killing countless numbers of people. Pease be with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are the epitome of RACIST! By your standard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have portrayed Dr. Martin Luther King, JR. in Selma..only fair, right?Racist copy:We know that Snowden is unfortunately Caucasian, but he could also be Black, Latino, Indian, Muslim or Gay.There is nothing in his story that prevents him from being a woman too. His story is very generic. This would also give rise to tackling aspects which are still considered to be taboo after all these years. Interracial relationships could be explored here and lessons could be taught around this. So, why not instill a few positive messages and concepts within the movie? It could help others not see color or gender, as many of the previous generation do. Instead, they could see a Black Muslim hero they can believe in and aspire to be irrespective of the color of his skin or his race. We need to end the evils of blue-eyed "whiteness".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have descended to this lowly website, and have graced us with divine baiting skills.Those who are not properly initiated may hate you, but those of us who understand your divine glory can see the wisdom which you have bestowed us with.In the end, you have successfully turned all these heathens into seething, triggered haters - all thanks to your heavenly troll skills.PRAISE BE TO SVEN B. HALLELUJAH!Ahem, getting back to the movie, this was Oliver Stone at his weakest. The plot went from boringly realistic to excitingly implausible. If Stone cannot portray real events in an entertaining manor without flying into the realm of fantasy, then he should stop basing these films on real people and events. Very disappointing</fullReview>
