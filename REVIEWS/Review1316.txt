		<shortDescription>A lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film has those Spielberg edges!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in "A League of Their Own" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400! Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty con man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, especially DiCaprio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Leonardo DiCaprio's 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn't realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on 'Growing Pains'--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn't see much to like about "Titanic" except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, 'Romeo and Juliet' was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.But if he could be nominated for his 'Aviator' performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in "The Fugitive", or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in "Smokey and the Bandit". The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.Frank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.Tom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.I loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from 'To Tell the Truth' was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn't feel I had time to watch the new version).This was Oscar-caliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didn't seem to agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and enjoyable story telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his parents file for divorce and he has to chose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jnr runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.Based on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.The presentation is good. Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick. Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth. But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.The cast is good even if they aren't all used well. If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy. Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio. Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-notch, brilliantly crafted entertainment, rich with fascinating details, memorable incidents and engaging performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a terrific piece of film-making! From the charming animated title sequence (featuring John Williams's delightfully sneaky score) to the end, this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman, Steven Spielberg, who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his "manipulation," i.e. his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama.Leonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I've seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy's selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fiancée and on down to the tiniest role. I'm especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.Spielberg's movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible. This is top-notch entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating DiCaprio, engaging story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002) **** Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Frank John Hughes, Brian Howe, John Finn, Jennifer Garner. DiCaprio gives a grandly charming performance as Frank Abagnale, Jr. a teenager who adopted the professional guises of airplane pilot, physician and lawyer to front his check kiting schematic modus operandi during the 1960s and eventually making the FBI's most wanted list by bilking millions until his capture and imprisonment. Based on Abagnale's best-selling memoir and adapted with lean storytelling by Jeff Nathanson, the film never lets up in the giddy cat-and-mouse/Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote relationship between fugitive DiCaprio and amalgamated FBI square Hanks (replete with thick as clam chowder Boston accent, dorky specs and porkpie hat) one step behind his two-steps ahead prey and a unique dynamic of a father/son esthetic. Walken gives an Oscar worthy supporting turn as the elder Abagnale whose financial woes and tanglement with the IRS acts as his son's catalyst. Once again filmmaker Steven Spielberg makes popular entertainment into a work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch It If You Can!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.There's no real plot to go into, as I have already given it to you. Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, "Catch Me If You Can" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role. I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom. If you just want to sit back and relax, "Catch Me If You Can" is the perfect film for you. There's nothing all that special in the film, but the film kind of becomes special because it is so easy to watch. I recommend "Catch Me If You Can" to anyone who can enjoy a movie for what it is."Catch Me If You Can" is a true popcorn flick, and maybe a little bit more.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good popcorn movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all-around good movie worth seeing. The plot is pretty basic: Quick-thinking kid from a broken family that he loved. He spent the next few years playing a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Think "Pretender" (the television series) but based on real events. The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe. An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru "Gladiator", "Shakespeare in Love", "Elizabeth", and the "Fellowship of the Ring" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest]. So if your date is the discriminating-type, he/she should be able to sit through this movie and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! Much hyped as a true story on its release CATCH ME IF YOU CAN tells the tale of con artist extrodanaire Frank Abagnale Jr and FBI agent Carl Hanratty's attempt to catch him but the cold facts are this is not a true story - It's a Hollywood story inspired by real events and therefore the audience are required to do nothing more than pay their money at the box office , sit back and be entertained . Certainly they won't be expected to ask questions such as why is con man Abagnale being portrayed as some sort of misunderstood little boy lost Right from the outset we're shown Abagnale's ability to con people as being a force of good . Check out the scene in the school where he takes the class bully down a peg or two " Ah " thinks the audience " Frank's a good guy , he's a man of morality " but I'm afraid he's not because he's a con artist and the story telling technique doesn't allow much thinking to be done by the audience . What about the scenes where he passes himself off as an airline pilot . Can anyone explain to me how he did this for many months and was never ever suspected of being a fraud ? Didn't anyone ever ask him seriously technical questions about flying a jet that caused alarm bells to be rung ? These questions are never answered Abagnale also passed himself as a doctor where he falls in love with a young nurse lacking confidence called Brenda and this sub section of the story caused a few alarm bells to be rung in my head , so after I saw the movie I conducted some internet investigation only to find that while Abagnale was posing as a doctor a baby almost died under his care due to his own lack of medical knowledge . I ask you if the screenplay included this scene how would you feel about Abagnale then ? Exactly . All through the running time we're shown Frank Abagnale as some kind of cheeky chappie , a little bit naughty but hey he's a young good looking kid with no real harm in him . As John Ford said - " Always print the legend " I can certainly understand why people enjoyed CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and won't criticise them for it and I can also understand why Spielberg and company decided to make an entertaining movie that doesn't dare get involved in any type of morality . It is unfortunate however that the director and everyone else involved are involved in fundamental dishonesty themselves</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of "Catch Me If You Can" convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.Indelible impressions are the sort of thing Frank Abagnale Jr. is good at, especially on the kind of phony checks that fool bank security. After his parents' divorce, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off in the Big Apple, making his way as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an assistant district attorney, all by means of fraudulent credentials and irresistible charm, not to mention the ability to stay one step ahead of the law, as represented by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).A film that owes a debt to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Henry Mancini, "Catch Me If You Can" zips along on its own kind of sneaky charm, making us root for a character who would probably steal our life savings if given half a chance. At the same time, Spielberg avoids the pitfall of relativism by making sure Hanks as Hanratty keeps some amount of our rooting interest, however much we feel for this crazy kid with his naive belief that, like the mouse stuck in a bucket of cream, he can churn his bucket into butter and crawl out. It's a trick every bit worthy of the subject of this engaging tale.From the opening moments of this film, featuring the best-ever Spielberg titles sequence (courtesy of Kuntzel-Deggas) and a very unusual but entrancing John Williams score that uses shushing sounds and finger snaps in place of his normal bombast, we realize we are in unusual territory for a Spielberg film. Right away, the theme of mistaken identity is introduced courtesy of a "To Tell The Truth" clip with host Joe Garagiola giving us three Frank Abagnales to choose from. We think we know which one he is, but we don't know as much as we think."You know why the Yankees always win?" asks Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). "It's because the other team can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes." Walken, like Spielberg, works against audience expectations. Sure, he's a criminal, much what we expect from Walken, but he's got a good heart and a beguiling innocence. He believes in the American dream, even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry to get what he wants. Ultimately he's a victim, and a lesson to his son about why the straight and narrow isn't the way to go.DeCaprio gives a solid, impressive performance, the best I've seen from him, playing a consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims. He finds the drama in his character, but also the comedy, in a film that shows Spielberg can be funny even when he involves us in a dramatic story. As we watch him fake his way aboard a cockpit, in an operating room, and even in a bedroom with an expensive callgirl played by Jennifer Garner, we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because he's succeeding.The film also benefits from an immersive sense of the period in which it is set. Williams' score, along with the costumes and set design, present us with a view of the 1960s in its more sophisticated adult form, with Dusty Springfield and Frank Sinatra providing the music rather than the pop and rock acts we think of when we think of the time.Does "Catch Me If You Can" go on longer than it should? Yes, I think tougher editing would have made it better. But I don't miss the mawkish attempts at uplift that pock Spielberg's lesser work, and the few poignant moments Spielberg throws in amid Abagnale's ruses ring true, especially a moment involving Frank and a little girl at a window near the end of the film that only Spielberg would try to get away with, because he can and does.No, this is not a great film, just a very good one that might have slipped past a few people on its first release, as it did me. But give "Catch Me If You Can" a chance, and you may find this as a con you not only enjoy being taken by, but wish to experience again just to see how the masters, Abagnale and Spielberg, make their plays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alternative World of Torn Labels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Yesterday, I saw the first watchable Scorsese film in decades, and the same today with Spielberg. Something weird is in the wind.And yes, I know this isn't a `real' Spielberg movie and that he only stepped in after paging through a half dozen directors, and only to protect his investment as a producer, and only because he has no real project underway. Still, I'm surprised. The compact Spielberg usually demands of the viewer is that in return for allowing him to turn us into children, he will expertly push children's buttons. He has been consistent in this even as he plowed through `serious' matters of war and holocaust. All are steeped in juvenile sentimentality. His recent `AI' and `Minority' were solid attempts to escape himself. After all, he knows he will not be remembered well and wants to be before he dies.So even though this is something he stepped into late, I count it as a solid victory for the pressures from his peers to make a real movie, with an intelligent stance. He does. Its not a great movie, but it has smarts. And it is relatively original.The first thing is how he adopts the notion of making the film itself a character. Lynch did this first (to my knowledge) with `Velvet.' Most recently, Haynes did so with `Far from Heaven,' where the dynamics of the story occur not in reality but in the artificial reality of films of the era. So the limits of `society' were the action of the film as a force within the drama. So too here -- to denote this we have the colors of the stock of the era, we have the very air of the film world invading as smoke. And we have the director asking the actors to discard modern irony and act as if they were Michael Caine in the early seventies. `Pleasantville' was another in this line -- the production designer is from that project.The film is set up as a reverse con. We know in the first couple minutes what he did and how the con ends. The traditional con story is a film within a film, which gives the opportunity to make the inner film the character as already noted. It is a clever idea that only could be conceived by someone intimate with shaping film. It makes the outer film more genuine by making the inner one more counterfeit.Then we have the actors. The con artist is the most sought after role in all filmdom because the actor plays a character who is acting, something that allows them to exploit their own experience (often the only real experience these stunted lives have). Decaprio doesn't quite rise to the challenge. We've had one wondrous performance in `Gilbert Grape,' and another intelligent turn in Luhrmann's `Romeo.' Nothing of note since except occasional competence. He is competent here. Hanks gives us his regular routine: he's sinking fast, turning into another Morgan Freeman.The real acting here is by Walken, who exceeds Spielberg's shaping of the project so much that we suspect no one really noticed it made the others look bad. Amy Adams has a passion that Leo lost long ago.Incidentally, we have another filmworld jab at the French here. They really do have thuggish police who brutalize Americans when possible. Film `police' too. And the Mom in real life was a real tart who played a dumb soldier for US citizenship then sold herself to a higher bidder. But why introduce all this without developing it? The man in charge here has a special ax to grind, I think.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light hearted yet polished film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I was far from excited but I was utterly impressed by how this movie was executed. I knew the acting was going to be solid, you can never go wrong with Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, but they weren't the only superb things about this movie.I was most astounded by how entertained I was during this film. It was brilliantly put together and wildly engaging. To say I was surprised by the bouncy and vivacious screenplay is an understatement. There are scenes that are truly playful, lively and to my surprise, comedic. DiCaprio executes his perky and charming character flawlessly; he handles the vibrant persona with ease. Do I even need to talk about Tom Hanks, I mean, we all know he's a remarkable actor. Amy Adams has a small but very spirited role.I came into this movie because of the actors and came out immensely delighted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brill movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished this movie and I can honestly say this is such a addictive movie!! once you have watched it you want to watch it over and over again!!! It is so funny how Frank passes himself off as a Pam Am pilot, a lawyer and a doctor all before he is 21. It is also a shame at the end where Carl tells Frank his father is dead and he doesn't believe it. It is funny at the beginning where Frank says he is dying and they take him to the hospital and he escapes and when he pretended to be a substitute teachers and calls himself Mr Abagnale and when he embarrasses the bully in front of the entire class!!!! He looks so cute as a boy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10. I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected. Leo plays the roll very well - give the man an Oscar already! I'm also thinking that Leo and Tom Hanks must have had a lot of fun filming this.There were many famous actors and actresses in smaller rolls, which I liked. Perhaps some of them weren't so famous back in 2002 (I'm a bit too lazy to do the research at the moment) but seeing for example Ellen Pompeo and Jennifer Garner made me even more interested in the movie. Sometimes, movies with too many movie stars falls flat, for some reason. But this one certainly did not!I'll definitely watch Catch Me If You Can more than once, more than twice! Loved it! &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caught me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included "A.I. Artificial Intelligence", "Minority Report", "The Terminal", "War of the Worlds" and "Munich".Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her ? we know something she doesn't.Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or "concurs" with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch it if you can. I concur this movie is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story" in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel &amp; Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym "Sean O'Reilly" in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch. So catch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone see movie and try to find out a part of stories that match their own, I mean personal life. Some stories more or less similar their personal experience. There are something inside of everyone that can not be reveal for some social reason. This thing and whatever it is like pain, past, situation, dream, mistakes all that you can not tell to someone makes you alone. You have everything around you that can make you happy related to material. But the thing inside of you makes you condemn. Because you can not say it out loud to others to accept. It is very hard to tolerate to bear. You know a simple incident could happen to many of you but you can't confess or sometime hide. When you find the similar thing also happen to someone else then you will find that it's not only you there are someone else who are like you. It seems like someone share your burden and feel much better. The story of the movie tell you that you are not alone and of-course teaches you not to take a role of the same mistake. The effect of the relation between parent on their children is very meaningful. It motivate your children.It's my personal aspect of seeing movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie that personally convinced me that DiCaprio had a future as an actor beyond Titanic. People used dismiss him as that kid from Titanic, I did as well, but he has grown to become one of Hollywood's top actors and I personally saw this coming while watching this film.Catch Me If You Can is also one of those films that I'd recommend if someone had no idea who Steven Spielberg was and wanted to give one of his movies a try. Because in many ways it has a lot of his characteristics in it. It's seemingly light-hearted, has an A-list cast, has a great score and the story is pure entertainment, yet the movie also takes it time, here and there, to address slightly darker themes - in this case the reason why Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) grew up to become such a trickster.The movie rides heavily on the charisma and acting abilities of its two main stars, DiCaprio and Hanks, and in this case there's really nothing wrong with it. The story is decent enough to support these two and it's a valid choice to have your movie focus on the characters, especially if they're interesting enough, like they are in here. That's the essence of a heist movie, which this movie really is, even though it's not about a single con.And that's this movie. Its focus on entertainment keeps it from being a solid nine or ten star film, but only just. As it is, it's a fun little romp that you're sad to see come to an end. Heavily recommended to fans of heist genre, and for those that like charismatic performances and fun little twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me if You Can is a fast-past adventure, but a major departure from Spielberg's usual films involving dinosaurs and aliens. Spielberg shows in this film that he is more than capable of creating an entertaining film without the use of expensive special effects. The film is a biographical true crime film depicting the life of conman and counterfeiter, Frank Abagnale. As a teenager, Abagnale began a crime spree that would result in him cashing over $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and take on the false identities of a pilot, pediatrician, lawyer and college professor. In the film, Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins his crime spree after his parent's divorce. When he is faced with deciding which parent will retain custody he decides to run away. Throughout the film, Abagnale uses various identities including that of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer to facilitate his check cashing schemes. It's clear that Abagnale hopes that with enough money he can somehow reunite his separated parents. Throughout the narrative, Abagnale is hounded by FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows a begrudging respect for the young con artist. The development of their relationship is very believable and adds a lot of depth to the overall narrative of the story. Leonardo DiCaprio masterfully takes on the challenging role of Abagnale simultaneously illustrating to the audience Abagnale's genius (albeit misguided) and his naivety regarding his family. Christopher Walken provides great acting as Abagnale's father while Tom Hanks provides his usual great acting acumen portraying an FBI agent who becomes a father figure to the troubled Frank Abagnale. If there is one aspect of where the film fails is its failure to truly analyze the real Frank Abagnale's motives. The motivations of Abagnale are romanticized throughout the film as a young boy who naively believe he can bring his parents back together. The real Abagnale wasn't so innocent and was far more motivated by women and using his ill-gotten wealth to meet beautiful young women all over the world. This weakness is rather small and takes away none of the entertainment value that the film has to offer. This film is incredibly well acted and is a rare true crime film that deviates from the expected blood and gore of the drama usual of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and charming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie that's lighthearted at times, sad during others, and charming overall, this definitely meets those requirements. I was laughing throughout most of it, but there were certainly some very poignant scenes in which the strong emotions felt by Frank, Jr. (played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio) were illustrated perfectly.I thought one of the things that Steven Spielberg does a good job of with this film is providing the audience with a psychological understanding of why Frank does what he does. Spielberg gives us Frank's past and background through the use of flashbacks throughout the movie, and this really helps the audience sympathize with the young con artist to the point where you're almost rooting for him albeit his illegal criminal activity. Another thing Spielberg also does well is the emphasis he puts on how much effort and time the clever Carl Hanratty (played by the incredible Tom Hanks) puts into capturing Frank, and by showing how similar they really are despite the cat and mouse game they play.Overall, the film is great. The acting is superb, but with an A-list cast such as DiCaprio (whose baby face fits the role of young Frank, Jr. perfectly by the way), Hanks (who gave excitement and life to a potentially bland character), and Christopher Walken (Frank, Sr.) with a quick appearance by the always wonderful Jennifer Garner, this is to be expected. The charm that DiCaprio brings to his character is fun to watch as well. I gave it 9/10 because I do think it runs a bit long, and the flashbacks sort of take away a bit of the suspense, but the film is exciting and certainly makes up for it in other areas.</fullReview>

There was not a part that dragged on for too long, the entirety of the movie was spaced out perfectly and the acting of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks was splendid. They both have acted perfectly in many films, but so far, this is my favorite.The movie simply is about a 16 year old boy (DiCaprio) who when finding out his parents are getting a divorce panics and runs away from home. Trying to survive on his own, he takes on the role of many professional jobs, and forges himself paychecks along the way. He has a detective (Hanks) hot on his trail, but always a second too late.The fact that this movie is based on a true story really shows how fantastically smart and cunning some people truly are.The movie plays on many of your emotions, and is a movie you can watch over and over, and still marvel at.A fantastic movie that I would recommend to anyone and everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One To Keep You Engaged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.The inspiration of the movie "Catch Me If You Can" must have lingered in director Steven Spielberg's mind for decades after knowing the amazing misadventures our protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. encountered throughout his very highly interesting life. Spielberg who as a youth in the 1960's used to get past security at Universal Studios just to sneak in and marvel at the art of filmmaking.Leonardo Di Caprio as Frank Abagnale Jr. is seen in the midst interviewing a Pan American supervisor to get a full report on the careers of airplane pilots for the purpose of writing an article for his high school paper. What's really going on is he's seeking knowledge on the many activities Pan Am pilots as he tries to successfully do everything he could to mimic them. Along with his savvy ways of impressions and conjuring up bogus cheques, the FBI is left high and dry as Abagnale Jr. leaks out millions of dollars from the banks. His pilot uniform gives him the advantage to cash in cheques globally.Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale Sr. who at one time was a thriving businessman from New Rochelle, New York and is now been reduced to eating very little but his pride. The Internal Revenue Services has been giving him hell which resulted in him owing them a bucket load of cash. The Abagnales must leave their posh mansion to a small low budgeted apartment. If that wasn't bad enough, Frank Sr.'s Franch wife for many years has added flames to the fumes by divorcing the poor hard-lucked individual and goes off to marry Frank Sr's attorney friend (James Brolin) and Frank Jr's world is taken upon him.Frank Jr has often seen his father used shady techniques to get the upper hand of people, so he makes the attempt to follow his father's legacy and enhances a few tricks of his his very own. It's soon revealed that Frank Sr. was rather subtle in his manipulative tactics compared to Frank Jr. who seems like a prodigy in in white-collar criminal activity.The real turning point of the movie that will keep viewers on the edge of your seat is the exciting battle of wits between the slick con-artist as he escapes going to jail while hard-nosed FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Ranks) is hot on his trail. and would love nothing more than to see this kid eat prison food. Carl is divorced, but he is truly devoted to his job and even tried to call him at his office on Christmas Eve. They develop a bit of fondness for one another as the film progresses as Carl is impressed with Frank Jr.'s methodical suave demeanor and the game of cat and mouse is proved effective because every chance the FBI catches on to him, he seems to full a fast one on them each time. Frank Jr. admires the devotion and never give up attitude that Carl possesses in his work ethic.The film is based on the true escapades of Frank Jr. who unfortunately gets arrested in a very dramatized situation in France. However, the FBI later in the film admire the white-collar criminal's tactics to catch other potential criminal minds.After Abagnale Jr. served his sentence,he no longer continued his craft and made a butt-load of cash as a security consulter in a corporate world. In a strange twist of irony, he owed millions all the while he ended up saving millions. I guess true stories do have happy endings.Martin Sheen has a supporting role as the father whose daughter wants to marry Frank Jr. but does not seem fond of his daughter's request. The unpredictable kid with a plethora of numerous alter-egos meets her as he's seen as an E.R. medical intern and before you know it, he's now a young lawyer who passed the State Bar in Louisiana. And next we see him as an assistant junior attorney working in his future father-in0law's firm.</fullReview>

I caught myself grinning from ear to ear many times throughout the movie. DiCaprio turns in his finest performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape &amp; The Basketball Diaries. Even though the story is based on a true story/autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr., it all seems like some crazy Hollywood plot that's just too irresistible not to love. As for the rest of the cast, Tom Hanks is (as always) thoroughly reliable as the G-man set on catching Abagnale. Christopher Walken steals every scene he exists in as dad Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank Jr.'s impetus and inspiration for his outlandish check fraud spree. Like father, like son indeed. Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner make delightful appearances in key scenes and John Williams' score is top notch, perfectly catching the snappy-cool kitsch of the 60's in every note. It's all a refreshing mix of everything we've come to fall in love with the movies. Some may be taken aback by the lackadaisical pacing, expecting some action set piece to pop up - and thank Odin there weren't any to be found</fullReview>

The ensemble cast in a Spielberg movie which happens to be a biography would be nothing less than good, true to keeping the name high, Catch me If u can is a terrific watch for those who love biographies and for those who enjoy quality movies.Leonardo Caprio And Tom hanks teaming up with Spielberg was more than enough for me to watch it way back like a decade ago. And never feel tired watching it even today, for its all handsomely shown, those life pictures of a con man from real life. Frank Abagnale JR would be your real life hero instantly, cant think of another person portraying Frank than Caprio, hes just handsome and his behavioral acting would have helped a lot in it. The music was tricky with a mystical feel adding tempo to the chase and tricky parts in the movie.When a hearty biography is directed by Steven Spielberg cant complain about a flaw anywhere, but to be fair, it wasn't that engrossing as a Schindlers List - i know its stupid to even compare- and would be able to give only a 8 though i thoroughly enjoyed it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love sitting down to watch a movie, not expecting much, and then being pleasantly surprised by what a great movie it was. That is just the case with Stephen Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the most successful and intelligent con men of all time. When Frank is sixteen his father runs into problems with the IRA and loses his entire fortune, which also prompts his wife to leave him. From then on Frank vows to earn back his father's savings. He does so through a slightly (i.e. extremely) illegal manner. Check fraud. Frank travels the world taking on different personas, faking work as a pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc. But once the money he is illegally earning starts to build up, red flags go up for the FBI and Agent Carl Hanratty, played so well by Tom Hanks, sets out on an obsessive quest to chase down and capture Frank.The film is clever, quick, and an absolute blast.The nice thing about Catch Me If You Can is that it doesn't take itself too terribly seriously. It is more of a lighthearted film with a serious undertone. This film is actually really funny at times before it grows into a more serious story of character development and winding plot progression. But from start to finish it manages to retain a feeling of witty intelligence that stays smart and intelligible, but also entertaining and fun. The film never gets unbearably boring, even when it slows down for more serious plot points. It is 140 minutes long so certain things are a bit drawn out and I can't say that every scene has a major purpose, but it's always fun and always entertaining.I have a certain asphyxiation with con and heist films, so Catch Me If You Can is sort of a dream come true for me. It is every single thing about great and clever cons wrapped into one film. Watching Frank Abagnale work is like magic. The situations he talks his way out of and the ways he manages to get around certain things is uncanny. The film is based on a true story so I'm not sure what about his cons is true and what is exaggerated, but it all makes for great entertainment. There's something so inherently fascinating about the way he manipulates people through ingeniously subtle psychology and the way it works seamlessly, most of the time at least.The film also succeeds by adding a new layer to a typical con film. It makes its incredibly clever and devious protagonist human. A lot of films portray the con man as a flawless machine that works everything out so perfectly and executes every minute detail without a single issue, so much so that they are more of a gimmick than an actual character. The character of Frank Abagnale is truly human, complete with all of his inner turmoil and realistic flaws. Throughout the film he grows more and more troubled as the law gets closer and closer to him. We see a very human transformation that is as touching as it is fascinating. By the end of the film we love this character not because he is a clever genius, but because he is human.If I had any tiffs with the film they would be that it runs a little long and some of the logic doesn't always add up. But it's nothing to make me dislike this film in any way. It was a blast to watch and a joy to reflect on. Strong performances helm the film while a great atmosphere and wonderfully intelligent character development make its roots run deeply sincere. This film is one of the most human con man stories I have ever seen and for that it deserves a hefty amount of credit. This is a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When his parents announce they are going to divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) runs away from home and embarks on a career as a conman. Originally only armed with some blank cheques, Frank cons his way into being airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and into a couple of million dollars. But hot on his trail is dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).Frank Abagnale Jr. a real guy, who did these real things. Sure there's some liberties taken with the adaptation from Abagnale Jr's own book, but regardless it's a fascinating story that transfers very well to the screen. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is perhaps a touch overlong as he slots in an on going father/son relationship that didn't happen, a classic broken home theme close to his heart of course. But this is no popcorn fodder piece. It's a black comedy that's tender at times but also also rather moving, even as the humour starts to kick in, we get plenty of reminders that Frank is running not just from the law, but also his unhappy past. There's no shirking from some of the darker aspects in the tale too. Infidelity, abortion and parental pressure all show their faces, never mind the troubling point of airline security eh!.Clocking in as it does at over two hours, the plot and its little thematics required the highest calibre of acting talent to keep the audience interested. Here's Spielberg's trump card. A fine ensemble gather and reward the bearded one with some of their best work. Certainly DiCaprio hasn't been this good since Titanic, while Hanks continues to live up to the Jimmy Stewart of his generation tag with another, yet different, everyman performance. As for Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Senior, well, get the hankies ready for you will have to have been cut from granite to not let Walken pull your emotional strings. Good support comes from Martin Sheen &amp; Amy Adams, while Jennifer Garner pops in for a sultry and sensual little cameo.A great story is given exceptional treatment by some of Hollywood's biggest hitters. Score! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is running from a crumbling family life. Frank sets out reconnect his mother (Nathalie Baye) and father (Christopher Walken). Frank Jr.'s mother leaves his father because of some financial difficulties. Quickly Frank finds out that the real world doesn't come cheap and pays for his new lifestyle with fraudulent checks. Only being 16, Frank finds out that all the money in the world cannot bring back the past. Pushed by his father, Frank desperately tries to buy his parents reunion. A great true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., Catch Me If You Can shows the lengths a young man will go to in order to get back what he holds dear.Hot on Frank's heals is the smart, but often mistaken, FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). While trying to reconnect his parent's lost marriage, Frank finds something he isn't looking for in Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). The two hit it off and quickly fall in love. A reoccurring color and lighting motif appears in the meeting of Frank and Brenda and suggests the possible downfall of Frank's new life. (It's always a girl.) Director Steven Spielberg manipulates lighting and color to show the glamorous lifestyle of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer, all careers Frank cons his way into. The contrast to the brightness of the glamorous appears in a drab, dark palette when young Frank's life isn't heading where he would like.Like Max in Where the Wild Things Are, Frank creates a new world for himself in order to deal with what is taking place at home. DiCaprio does a phenomenal job of creating empathy from the audience for his character. Although Frank is breaking the law, it is hard not to root for him.Frank manipulates people to get to his goal, an elaboration of something he learned early on from his father. Little did he know at the time, Frank's lifestyle gave him the education to now be the world's foremost leading authority on check fraud.Frank sets out to re-establish his childhood, but ends up growing into a lifestyle all his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth catching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Abagnale Jr. (Di Caprio) makes his way across America posing as a lawyer, a pilot, a doctor whilst all the while being chased by Carl Hanratty (Hanks) Based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. this ambitious crime caper is a turn for excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts of comedy in a dramatic construction of a man looking for a sense of mayhem and wealth, to live in his father's footsteps.Flowing with the energy you would expect from a Spielberg project alongside Oscar nominated scorer John Williams you would expect a ferocious appetite of crime shindigs and sharp tantalising scenarios across America and for the most part we see a relaxing and remarkable story that is hard and equally remarkable to believe really happened.Leo Di Caprio, in his first paring with Spielberg, stars as central character Frank, giving the conman an elusive personality whilst aiming to be na?ve of the difficulties at home between his parents. Encoding uses of his father's charm and wit may seem corny but the resemblance between Di Caprio and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken is mirror like, giving the film a formidable consistency.Tom Hanks, in more of a supporting role, has his moments as the stubborn and driven FBI agent determined to catch Frank. Hanks uses the character's intelligence to his advantage to make his acts seem fruitless whilst all the while maintaining a key objective. Hanks even slides in some delicious deadpan expressions, the knock knock joke in the car for one arguably one of Hanks best ever comedy moments, which is quite something given the American's CV.The plot is the main drawback of the film's potential. Whilst the story itself is based on true events, there feels a lack of consistent believability, which is purely down to the messy structure placed upon it. Starting on a game show, it jumps back to Frank's youth, then to prison then forward to school years, then his fleeing, then forward to present and so forth and because of these Kangaroo style jumps there feels a reluctance to let us into the moment of the character and situation. We are just getting used to Frank being a pilot when the film shunts us to present day dealings and it is a real pain as if this film was portrayed in chronological order we would have had a flawless foundation for an endless chase without knowing the outcome.Williams' score is brilliant, especially the title sequence and Oscar nominated was a truly deserved. The title sequence matches the feel of the music so poignantly we are instantly engaged and ready for the off.The film collaborates usage of career mastery and unanswered questions to the eventual finale, that is worth catching and as mentioned, had this film gone from past to present with no flash back/forwards it would have been perfect. As it is, this is a charming often funny crime drama that is an enjoyable ride of a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flash of Lightning from Leonardo DiCaprio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Flash" comic book reader Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) is devastated when he learns loving parents Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye (as Frank and Paula Abagnale) are divorcing. Unable to choose whom he'd rather to live with, Mr. DiCaprio decides to run away, like DC Comics' "The Flash". A natural impersonator, DiCaprio assumes a secret identity, and develops amazing check-forging skills. This attracts the attention of FBI agent Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty), who is determined to put DiCaprio behind bars. Incredibly, DiCaprio gets jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. But, Mr. Hanks is hot on his trail? "Catch Me If You Can" finds Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks team in the middle of an incredible string of well-produced films. When seen in context, their success secret may be offering the public a variety of entertainment, alternating the familiar with the unexpected. "Catch Me If You Can" isn't rollicking, inspirational, or filled with special effects; it's just wildly appealing. Spielberg regulars: cameraman Janusz Kaminski, musician John Williams, editor Michael Kahn, etc are "state of the art" in film-making. The cast performs exceptionally. Most valuable player Williams is especially noteworthy, helping an incredible opening "credits" sequence start the film.In hindsight, this may be considered one of DiCaprio's very best performances. Certainly, it's one of the only times when casting a 10-years-too-old actor in a part makes perfect sense, as you'll see upon viewing this film. DiCaprio fits the role like a glove, handling his character's charming to disillusioned development with precision. The character is extremely likable. Spielberg sets the perfect mood by opening the film with a "To Tell the Truth" game show appearance, and flashback. We know approximately how the film will end; but, like a "Flash" comic book story, we enjoy the adventure, and feel the danger.Obviously, they were going for a "PG-13" audience; and, the sex scenes aren't offensive. The one following DiCaprio's viewing of the James Bond film "Goldfinger" is particularly well done. It involves his encounter with a high-class prostitute. By returning to DiCaprio viewing the film, back in the theater, the entire sequence could be artfully turned into a fantasy. This would support the very idealized way DiCaprio views relationships; they should be like comic book couple, like Barry and Iris Allen. Our hero fantasizes he's "James Bond", but he's really very "old-fashioned". He can't accept his parents' break-up; and, has idealized, failed relationships with women.There is some thoughtfulness as "Catch Me If You Can" explores the relationships DiCaprio's "Frank" has with his parents and Mr. Hanks. The film would be stronger if the protagonist's innocent idealism and ideology were more developed. A key moment, for "Frank", is when he discovers his parents are not the perfect couple he (and we viewers) have been accustomed to seeing. Later, after a period of promiscuity, our hero has his failed relationship. He learns couples are not like idealized; but, this thread of the film lacks a proper conclusion; a scene with mother Baye, or the introduction of a new romantic interest, would help.******** Catch Me If You Can (12/16/02) Steven Spielberg ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good. It really told the story of what Frank Abagnale Jr. did back then. Leonardo DiCaprio did really good and so did Tom Hanks. This movie turned out to be a dramadey including such scenes like how when Frank became a pilot for Pan Am, he seduced an older woman! That man is a player. It turned out to be Ellem Pompeo, who I think is hot. This movie told the story of how he became a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer. Not very many people can do that. This was a good movie. I saw it in theaters and, believe it or not, I thought it would sort of be like a funny action/adventure about how somebody is after somebody because something happened or something. But, boy was I dead wrong? But I like what I saw. This was a good movie. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, DiCaprio is perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS BELOW This is one of those movies that you're not sure you are going to like, and you watch it, and you end up loving it. It's fast paced, well acted and directed, and great fun.Leonardo DiCaprio is utterly charming and endearing as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who in the 1960's posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer-all the while evading the FBI who wanted him for check fraud. Tom Hanks shines as Carl Hanratty, the fed who first wants to nail Frank, then ends up taking him under his wing and giving him new direction in his life. Christoper Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank's star-crossed parents also give fine performances. Amy Adams nearly steals the movie as the young woman who steals Frank's heart.The film is about a young man who is traumatized by what the US government has done to his family so he decides to literally become other people to escape from whom he really is. Frank is a charming smooth talker with an uncanny knack for forging checks and documents. He's so angelic looking and unassuming that none of his victims are aware they are being conned. As he has proved time and again in films like "This Boy's Life," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and "Titanic," DiCaprio is more than just a pretty face. He has the talent to back it up, and this role is tailor-made for him. Under Spielberg's direction, he's taken that talent to another level. Ultimately it becomes about a surrogate father/son relationship between Frank and Carl. While he's trying to outwit and outrun the sometimes curmudgeonly FBI agent, Frank admires him at the same time. Carl, for his part, does hold a soft spot for Frank, and he leads him down the path to redemption.The sets, the costumes, and the music all capture the essence of the sixties, when anything was possible and nothing was out of reach if you wanted it.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this film-I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me if You Can is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is without a doubt the most underrated movie I have ever seen, especially with the all star cast it has.Directed by Steven Spielberg, I know this might not be a popular vote but it is my favourite Spielberg film he has made. The acting is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio is Oscar worthy, the fact that he didn't win Best Actor at the Academy Awards is amazing. Tom Hanks should have also received Best Supporting Actor and Steven Spielberg easily Best Director.The script is one of the best scripts I have ever heard with some of the best dialogue ever. This movie is so funny. There is one scene towards the end were Tom Hanks is on the phone at the airport and you just see Leo and the stewardess' walk write by him, that had me on the floor laughing.The ending is a perfect wrap-up to a perfect movie. 2 hours and 20 minutes of perfection10 out of 10 stars.Perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about the making and doings of an incredible con-man. The movie should NOT be seen as a biography of the real con-man (assuming that his co-authored autobiography is for real), since the interesting psychological background is made up and some of the incidents are fictitious. The movie uses a couple of framing devices to get started: the hunter goes to a French jail to get the hunted and take him back to the United States; the hunted is introduced on "What's My Line" ( a popular mid-century U.S. t.v. show). Then there is a flash-back to the hunted's childhood, and we watch his development into a con-man.The pacing and characterizations are well done, and the viewer is kept pleasantly off-balance by both situations and switching empathy for the hunter and the hunted.The period items (like the "What's My Line" bit, clothing, cars, ways of talking) do more than just ring true: they draw viewers back into that time and place.Although the film is primarily entertainment, the story it tells gives one pause more than once. What does it mean that a teen-ager could pass himself off as a professional in various fields? Was he really driven to do what he did, or was he simply a rogue? (This latter question might be answered differently depending on whether one is discussing the movie or the book).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is the screen adaptation of the autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), renowned as one of America's youngest and most successful con men. The story tells how Frank Jr. steals over four million dollars by forging checks while impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, all before his nineteenth birthday. The film also stars Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI special agent assigned to track down Frank Jr. By telling this cat-and-mouse story from both the perspective of the cat and the mouse, director Steven Spielberg shows that hard work and honesty are more rewarding in the long run than any get rich quick scheme.The theme of Catch Me If You Can is best illustrated in scenes involving Frank Abagnale Jr. and Frank Sr., played by Christopher Walken (nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor). In one scene Frank Jr. treats his father to dinner in a fancy restaurant, where he tries to make a gift to his father of a brand new Cadillac. Although Frank Jr. has been forging checks and only posing as an airline pilot, he lies to his father and tells him that he has become a co-pilot for Pan-American airlines. By lying to his father, Frank Jr. shows that he understands the values his father has tried to teach him, even if his actions don't reflect those same values. Although he has stolen everything he has, Frank Jr. knows that he can only gain his father's approval by posing as someone who is hard working and respectable.In a later scene Frank Jr. meets with his father to announce that he's getting married. When Frank Sr. reveals that he knows that his son is wanted by the FBI, Frank Jr. begs his father to make him stop. Frank Jr. storms out of the bar when his father encourages him to continue running from the law. Frank Jr.'s reaction shows that he regrets his choice of a life of crime and wants to stop running.By showing Frank Jr. as regretful and ready to stop committing crimes, the audience is allowed to develop some small amount of sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic character. This ploy has been used by writers of the heist and con-man genres for years, for example 2001's The Score, and 2003's Matchstick Men.Spielberg uses many film elements to illustrate the theme in Catch Me If You Can. For example, When Frank Sr. is accepting an award honoring his hard work, he is filmed from a low angle. In contrast Frank Jr. is filmed from a high angle in the same scene. The combined effect of these two angles is to place Frank Sr. on a pedestal in his son's eyes.Catch Me If You Can is a twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a smooth-talking con man who stays several steps ahead of the plodding FBI agent who pursues him. But by the end of the film we see the tortoise's deliberate effort pay off as he finally catches up to the exhausted hare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent piece of entertainment from Spielberg,as I throughly enjoyed it, with an engrossing story and amazing performances!. All the characters are awesome, and I really liked the ending, plus Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are simply amazing in this!. All the characters are extremely likable, and it's often very suspenseful and hilarious, plus Martin Sheen cracked me up as Brenda's dad!. I thought the ending was really neat, and even at 141 minutes it was never overlong, plus I wish they gave Jennifer Garner more to do. Christopher Walken is wonderful as the dad, and I felt bad for DiCaprio's character when his parents were getting a divorce, and he ran away, plus it's extremely well made and cleverly written as well!. The opening was quite creative, and the dialog was quite awesome as well, plus Tom Hanks knock knock joke was very funny. It keeps you guessing throughout, and Tom Hanks and DiCaprio had some wonderful scenes together, plus this deserves it's 7.6 rating!. This is an excellent piece of entertainment from Spielberg, as I throughly enjoyed it, with an engrossing story and amazing performances, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is top notch as always from Steven Spielberg. The Camera work, is awesome, the angles are fantastic and he kept the film at a very engrossing pace. The Acting is amazing!. Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing here, he really had a brilliant character, and had plenty of charm and likability, and while I admit to not seeing a whole lot of his movies he was really amazing here, and managed to carry the film with ease, as I absolutely loved him!. Tom Hanks is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable,even funny when he was mostly serious throughout the film, has some great scenes with DiCaprio, had a very cool character, and some terrific dialog! (Hanks Rules!!!!!). Christopher Walken is wonderful as the Father, he was funny, extremely likable, was perfect for this role, and just did a wonderful job overall, I just wish they gave him more screen time(Walken Rules!). Martin Sheen is hilarious as Brenda's dad, he clearly was having a hoot, and as a result I did too! (Martin Rules!!!!). Nathalie Baye is good as the mother I liked her. Amy Adams is cute, and was quite perky as the love interest I dug her. James Brolin is OK in his small role, wish he had more of a part. Jennifer Garner is incredibly gorgeous, but what was she even doing here??, she was totally wasted, as I was angry about that, it was still great seeing her though! (Garner Rules!!!!!!!).

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Gets Back to the Basics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg got up from a short slump ("A.I.--Artificial Intelligence" and "Minority Report", which were both minor disappointments) with this enjoyable little film that is a lot darker and more dramatic than it appears on the surface. Teenager Leonardo DiCaprio is going through a crossroads in life as his parents (Oscar-nominee Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) are about to divorce. Baye wants a divorce to marry James Brolin (who DiCaprio does not care for at all) and it seems that the youth must decide himself who he wishes to live with. DiCaprio instead decides to run off and quickly gets an idea to be a con-artist. Thus he has a long run throughout the majority of the 1960s as he cons his way towards $2.5 million over 26 countries. He poses as a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer as the years pass by. He falls in love with the naive Amy Adams, has a run-in with her hard father (Martin Sheen) and continues to elude the pesky agent on his tail (another brilliant turn for Tom Hanks). Through it all, DiCaprio continues to keep tabs on Walken (who dramatically changes economically and personally as the film progresses) and grows to respect and like Hanks and the challenge he poses. "Catch Me If You Can" is another film about the strong bond between fathers and sons, much like the superior "Road to Perdition". Spielberg's solid direction and an interesting screenplay just adds to the performances of DiCaprio and Hanks. However, it is Walken who steals every scene and adds the heart the film desperately needed. Although his screen-time is not overwhelming, he dominates when in action (not an easy thing to do over the two superstars). Overall I did like the film very much, but the tone and pacing is imperfect. Still a very successful venture in the end. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

I thought the chemistry between Leonardo's character (Frank Abagnale Jr) and Carl Handraty played by Tom Hanks was great to watch.

		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is one of the Steven Spielberg's gorgeously crafted real life adaptations, along side with "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan". The only major difference between "Catch Me If You Can" and the other two is that this is obviously the only one with humorist moments, but not because of intended comedy, which is none, but due to one of Leonardo Di Caprio's most interesting and charming characters, Frank William Abagnale, all combined with the hilarious moments.This movie also features Christopher Walken in almost his best acting performance, as Frank Abagnale. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction", Walken touches us only by saying a few words, and so, he is simply magnificent. Furthermore, we have Tom Hanks, which fits perfectly in his role. A no-sense-of-humor federal agent, devoted and implicated in finishing his task? Hanks is definitely the best choice.To conclude, "Catch Me If You Can" is another entertaining, effortlessly watchable Steven Spielberg film, that catches us in a lot of positive ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Original Score: 4/4, Movie: ***** (5/5), Quality: ***** (5/5) My first thoughts were: "Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio? Starring together in a film?" Well, that and the title got me interested.The title alone will have you interested to see if this is a chase, espionage thriller infused film, not entirely this film is defined as that way. Actually, unlike Kingsman, or Mission Impossible, or any of the Spy thriller films, this one's different. With outstanding performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. And a story and plot which is slightly modified from the original, true story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. that this movie is based upon. The film is a brilliant, entertaining, memorable, ultimately uplifting, and (Maybe) slightly philosophical one. You might be able to take home a few themes from the film after you finish it, and maybe consider catching it once again, and again, and again, if you can, on DVD. (Now please make sure that it is an original certified copy! DVD piracy is also a crime, you know.) Opening the film with colorful and entertaining title sequence joined by a sly score from John Williams, which in turn also crafted some superb music that keeps the film going, we are then taken into a film that is inspired by the true story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. . Who successfully conned millions of dollars worth of bank checks, and all before his 19th birthday. Which is the reason that he was pursued by an FBI agent, but Frank always stays one step ahead of him, leading to a chase spanning several years, states and countries.Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank William Abagnale Jr., son of Frank William Abagnale Sr.(Portrayed by Christopher Walken). When Abagnale's parents filed a divorce, he ran away from home and started his life of crime, as a boy alone in this world, forging checks while posing as a Pan Airline Pilot, a doctor and a legal prosecutor. The impact of the divorce of his parents was the guilty for starting the boy's life of crime. Parents have their duties to their children, to keep them on the right path and never falling onto the wrong path.Lacking the chase sequences that is expected in many espionage thriller films, this one utilizes both smart dialogue, witty humor, and finally some positive messages to enable us audiences to connect with the characters of the film, in which some are real, and some are fictionalized, alongside several of the events depicted in the film. But regardless, it is just a movie, and it has got something to say before it wraps up and allows you to absorb the experience that is has provided you and later ask you some questions about what good things have you learned from its part fictional, part real story.Bear in mind that the film is inspired by true events, its just a movie. Even so, it has become a brilliant, entertaining, and ultimately uplifting film. Themes such as "Family relationships" and "A Second Chance" are present within. The latter being said because the film has its ways of expressing that everyone who has done wrong before deserves a second chance if they are willing to change for the better. Rather than directly mentioning the reason to these statements made above, I'll leave it to the unfamiliar and unsuspecting audiences to discover the rest of these things in the film itself. I did, because I was formerly one of those audiences, and now I have officially become a member of the audiences who have already finished, and perhaps being uplifted by this film itself.I have seen it on an online streaming service (Licensed, of course.); it entertained me and made me smile in its climax-ending card. In addition, I had a wish to catch it, over and over again, in the future. It fascinated me about this particular story, and I shall conduct some more of my own personal research into it.I shall say no more about it, instead it is entirely up to you to see what it is all about, and I hope you be as entertained and uplifted by the film as much as I was. It is sure to become a film to explore over and over again, could be defined as a classic. Catch it if you can! Over and out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg frequently adds the father-son element into his films, but rarely is it as strong as it is in this movie. It never stops being flashy and fun as Abagnale embezzles and defrauds his way around the country, but Spielberg wedges that family angle in there and suddenly the film changes. It becomes about a boy in denial of his parents breaking apart and he thinks that by getting all this money he can push them back together. For all of his fake titles and wealth, he's just a sad kid trying to make his father proud of him.DiCaprio's performance is essential to that focus. He's a perfectly glitzy casting choice to play someone who weaves his way through the world on his charms, but his emotional distress at the shattering of his world is much more important. Of a hefty supporting cast, Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr, an infinite sadness appearing in his piercing eyes as he observes his renegade son during their many meetings. Amy Adams is a delight as the bracey, ugly duckling Brenda, and Martin Sheen adds considerable heft to the film as her father. Tom Hanks goes toe to toe with DiCaprio all throughout and makes for some of the best moments.All of the con scenes are superbly written, directed and shot, with lingering shots on DiCaprio's unblinking charm and clever movements disguising things to be hidden. The first meeting between Hanks and DiCaprio is a classic scene in its own right. The dialogue is so clipped and so well-written that it seems perfectly reasonable not to, say, open a wallet or trust a man's word. The scene in which DiCaprio escapes through a police blockade is superb, with the camera focusing on all the minute clues and then ending with that plane takeoff. The whole thing is timed to perfection.Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can (2002): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams: Clever true story of the things that compel us to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the youngest person to appear on the F.B.I. most wanted list. His father was arrested for tax fraud, which led to the loss of their home and a divorce soon afterwards. Frank splits and learns the art of impersonation and becomes an airline pilot, a professor, and a medical physician all while dodging the law. Great work by Steven Spielberg who also scored with Minority Report the same year. DiCaprio is superb with the impersonations and lifestyles as he attempts to elope as well as stay ahead of authority. Tom Hanks is funny as an F.B.I. agent propelled by his unwillingness to be outsmarted. This leads to a lot of humour and an unlikely respect. Christopher Walken is terrific as Frank's father whom himself was a fraud but not as successful as his son. His wife is having an affair, which trails to his unfortunate fate. Martin Sheen appears as a potential in-law who sees through DiCaprio. More of Sheen would have been great. Amy Adams plays a nurse whose abortion caused a division between herself and her parents until DiCaprio enters their lives. It seems to reference old spy films, and is styled similar to The Pink Panther and equally curious. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked almost everything of this movie. Acting is superb (Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Walken: do I need to say more?), Spielberg's direction is flawless, music is interesting and adds the right amount of tension.The story tells of (real-world) con artist Frank Abagnale, of his complicate family and the reasons pushing him into a criminal life while still very young. The movie is brilliant, at times entertaining in showing how our reality is partly made of paperwork and false perceptions. At other times, I found it intense and emotional in representing the struggle of Frank's father to emerge from his low social condition out into the "little club" of those "who have everything". Overall the movie is very balanced and I would not have minded watching some 30 minutes more of it.My advice: absolutely watch it, even multiple times to spot some more visual details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you concur?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio occupies the role of Frank Abagnale with such ease that it is easy to forget that he is just a teen at the beginning - and barely an adult when it is over. I suppose it is easy for him to forget this too; slipping into these alternate identities lets him live the life he wants, get back the money they took from his father, and escape from a broken family. When he mimics the famous two mice in a bucket of milk speech when asked to say grace, it is funny, but also contains a hint of melancholy like Walken's sparse appearances throughout his con life. The suit, the cadillac, the money...all just items to show off to his father, to show that he has made it, to try and piece this family back together again. How many windows has he peered into to see happy Christmas celebrations? How many half-sisters has he waved at?Momentarily, he distracts himself with the thing he is good at. A little folded note, a little substitute teacher impersonation. Then onto bigger things, and although we know how the story ends, we are nevertheless fascinated. Spielberg's direction is visually captivating - the peering reveal over to the bathtub full of model air-planes, the swing across to the frightened bank teller informing her manager (to signal one plan that doesn't work - so he learns and adjusts his cons), the way he racks focus from the fine print of the check to DiCaprio to indicate just how precise and alluring his charms and deflections are. Williams is great too - the way he builds momentum and confidence as Frank becomes more adept, and twinkles when we see closeups of the favourite trick that he inherited from his father. Completing the effect are those endearing voice-overs of faux-success and worldly experience to his father - no doubt a very important part of his motive is to impress him. This is one of DiCaprio's better performances. He doesn't have a whole lot of emotional range to work with (for example, the real Abagnale left his medical supervisor position because he realised he was putting lives at stake - in the film it is completely comedic) and even when he does emote it is somewhat an act - see the bait and switch where he seems to confess to Roger Strong, but becomes a soppy romantic instead. His best moment is the way he slides effortlessly into the Secret Service Agent 'Barry Allen' only after a tiny second of realisation of what he has been caught in - the way his approach disarms Hanratty so subtly ("Here, take my whole wallet"), the way he mimics his tactics to build authenticity ("Mind if I see some identification") and how he is able to uses his own knowledge to pose as someone who has been diligently chasing himself down. Hanks' Hanratty is decent as the straight man who is initially consumed by the chase; there are some juvenile moments including a harsh cackle over the phone at Christmas which doesn't quite work because Hanks is not mean enough for it and because their dynamic works so much better when they are ribbing and teasing - Hanratty not falling for his whole sickness routine in jail, and constantly trying to pry his methods for passing the bar exam. It even manages to be a little poignant at the end between the two. Feeling suffocated by the never-ending sentence to bust the scams he once mastered, he takes off and even makes it to the airport to seek that life of lies that seems to be easier than confronting the truth; the death of his father, and the new marriage and family of his mother. Hanratty is all but ready to let him go, but reminds him that no one will be chasing this time. Perhaps he was right when he realised that Abagnale had no one to call at Christmas. DiCaprio's frenzied reaction to seeing him deep in hiding in France suggests that he is most at ease constantly moving from place to place and busying himself with the thrill of the chase. Even James Bond had to call it a day when his time was up, and Frank is now ready to accept it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch me if you can is a movie about a con man played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The story portrays how he is close to his father, also via incidents where his mother takes him out via bail in bits and parts. The nature of con that he is an expert at is fake paper work (mainly bank cheque's). When it comes to be a con his talent is unparallel. He cheats students, women, his family and government particularly. He is finally arrested and is freed in returning help to government. Officer who gets him caught adopts him as well.Pros: Superb direction by Steven Spielberg as always, his movies with emotional content are worth praising (extra marks for that). Superb acting by all leads, highly powered -emotions and thrill between Frank Abagnale Jr. (con) and Officer Carl Hanratty, raise height of biography.Rating: 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This game is good fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cat and mouse game repeated over and over sounds a tad dull, but not when it's directed by Steven Spielberg! Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abagnale is deceitful and deceptive, but not nasty. Instead he's huge fun to be around. Same goes for Tom Hank's catcher, who incidentally, finds it difficult to do the catching. Catch Me If You Can, to not seem too rigid or sound mundane, splices the story from when Abagnale's already captured, to the how and why, the very beginning, up until Abagnale's inevitable capture. It's a slick, cool process held strong by its two leads. I wish there was more room for Hanks to thrive, as DiCaprio fills the screen with his charm and intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Time Reviews "Catch Me If You Can (2002)"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is a film Directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002"A true story about Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor."Catch Me If You Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a young con artist being chased across America by the FBI investigator Carl Handratty (played by Tom Hanks) as he is chased across all 50 states in America for stealing over $4 million in fraudulent cheques. It really is a movie that you can re-watch over and over again, however although I found it very entertaining and fun to watch, like all movies it had it's flaws. Obviously the movie is an adaptation of the life of the real con artist Frank William Abagnale Jr. and the events that took place during his life when he was growing up. From impersonating a substitute teacher at his high school to becoming a lawyer just to marry a girl whom he fell in love with, the movie follows Frank's life and engages the audience by keeping them entertained. The biggest flaw that the movie had for me was the significantly huge lack of Christopher Walken in it. Although he was a very influential and important figure in the movie, specifically for Leonardo DiCaprio's character, I personally would of liked to see the majestic works of Walken more frequent throughout the film. On a more serious note, sometimes the scenes can feel detached from the Actors and it creates a feeling of confusion as some things feel less believable than others.The acting is to be applauded though, with such an amazing cast it's hard to make a movie like this not enjoyable. Most credit should be given to Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken for their characters and the interactions that they make with Frank. It is these relationships that engage the audience as they show the feelings between a struggling father and his son, along with the relationship between a criminal and the man chasing him down. Watching a young Leo cheat his way through life and avoid any confrontation with the FBI is both thrilling and entertaining as we truly get to see the retold events of Frank Abagnale on screen. We sympathize with him and understand the struggles he is going through. Leo's character is a prime example of an Anti-Hero, we know what he is doing is wrong but we don't want him to get caught because we want to see what he does next. Yet again Steven Spielberg combines a good cast, well written and entertaining script along with the magnificent music created by the phenomenal John Williams to create an exciting adventure inspired by real events. The setting of the 1960's is captured well and the audience really gets a feeling of the era that this took place in.Overall Catch Me If You Can was an enjoyable experience with a lack of my on screen time for Christopher Walken, but made up for that with it's easy to follow and engaging plot.8.0/10~Reel Time Reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is incredible to think that this film is based on a true story, and that a high school student was able to deceive so many people. What an ingenious and innovative kid - for the wrong reasons of course. I am unsure of the accuracy of the film's portrayal of the actual events, but Frank Jr. does seem to be quite mature for his age - at least his persona does. Adding to that, I feel like the romantic encounters (save for Brenda) was probably the influence of Hollywood, or dramatized at the least.Leonardo DiCaprio perfectly encompasses the emotions of an emotionally troubled teen to the T. He portrays his character's naivety well, depicting both Frank's fake confidence and emotional turmoil. Supporting actors and actresses did a good job too. Walken as Frank's father and Hanks as Hanratty both support a kind of father figure to Frank though one is encouraging him not to stop and the other is trying to catch him.The editing is well done with two different timelines juxtaposed against each other. At first it is a little confusing and hard to discern which time period is being shown, but it gets better as the film goes on. What I do not get is the very first scene of the film which shows a kind of game show. Not only is it a weird way to introduce the film it does not fit into the story at all. The film doesn't end with the game show, and it is not mentioned or seen again for the rest of the movie.The designs of the set and the costumes are nicely done and adds to the atmosphere of the film. Also, I liked how there are quite a few cameos with well known actresses (although probably not so well known back then). Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Serious, Thoughtful, Low-key film - Spielberg Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Catch Me If You Can, based on the real-life story of Frank Abagnale. Abagnale, portrayed beautifully by Leonardo DiCaprio), is a young kid who runs away from home and uses his guile, wits, charm, and good looks to con his way into real-life professions that take years of training. Pilot, Doctor, Lawyer, this 19 year old kid can do all theses things, or pretend to. What made him want to do this?The film centers around the father-son relationship. Christopher Walken is outstanding as Frank Sr, a down-on-his-luck entrepreneur who has problems with the IRS coming after him for tax violations. But nothing bothers Frank Sr. He always keeps saying how he's the mouse who is going to survive by working harder. Yet, he seems to survive using smoke and mirrors, sweet talking people, and teaching his son that the image is more powerful than substance.Frank Jr learns all these lessons and applies them to all aspects of his life, chasing women, jobs, and all the money and benefits these bring. But it seems he really just wants a happy family, something he didn't ever seem to have. His mother, played by famous French actress Natalie Baye, doesn't seem to really love him. She mostly ignores his existence.Why should you see this film? The story is terrific, just the right pace of action and suspense. Is he going to get caught now? How is he going to pull this one off? The direction from Spielberg is right on. He tied everything together with no questions lingering at the end.The acting is terrific too. Tom Hanks delivers a masterpiece as an obsessed FBI agent Hanratty who is in charge of capturing Abagnale who ends up stealing millions of dollars by the time he is through. The relationship between the pursuer Hanratty and the pursued Abagnale is great, and the movie portrays them as developing a relationship of friendship. Other characters play strong roles too, including a young Amy Adams as as love interest for Frank Jr.I also loved the historical aspect of the airlines and the 60s, when pilots and flight attendants were considered glamorous positions. The old cars, the old uniforms, the costume designer and the cinematography really made the old times come to life with vibrant colors and a pizazz that maybe it didn't have, but it was nice to relive.Story, Director, Acting, Cinematography - Catch Me If You Can has it all. I highly recommend you catch this movie if you can. Enjoy.</fullReview>

And Walken manages to come because he transpose his emotion in your life with a lot of problems. Tom Hanks had a good performance, but when I think of his performances in The Terminal or Forrest Gump, which were sensational, in Catch Me If You Can not seem so great, but also is very good.The direction was very good. I'm no fan of Spielberg in particular, but I recognize that he has great movies, so that i've watched a lot and I liked the most. This was no different a light direction, which does not force the bar to the viewer. Knowing how to be smart, know how to be subtle, knows how to be funny. Although I found some unnecessary scenes on the life of Frank Jr., which lengthened a little movie, but nothing that hinders the viewer, the film still holding you from start to finish, no doubt.Overall, this is it, it is nothing revolutionary in the cinema, but still, it's a great film by a great director, is very light to watch and you probably do not feel the time passing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens up very very uniquely. Using the old show as a frame, it takes the audience's already owned recognition of DiCaprio to start telling the story chronologically. I really like how the movie immerses the audience in Frank's story. The movie moves forward nicely from event to event to depict the milestones in Frank's check forgery career. Also the cinematography at times indulges the audience with great moving shots. The acting work in overall is a great work. Having the cast comprise of an ensemble is a good thing to balance DiCaprio's acting in the scenes and also grab attention for them. Leo DiCaprio, despite his older age, managed to grab the youthful energy as an adolescent here. Tom Hanks did also well in portraying the relentlessness of the agent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch me if you Can Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came out in 2002 and was directed by Stephen Spielberg. It's about this guy Frank W. Abagnale Jr. coning as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer in the 1960's. The thing here is that he did all of this before he was 21. The movie starts off with a game show talking about why he did all of this. Then it goes to Frank in French prison in 1969, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He tries to escape but the flashes back to 1963 with his father, played by Christopher Walken, winning some kind of award. Later his father is investigated for tax fraud. As his father slowly loses his fortune and gets divorced Frank runs away. He learns coning from some tips his father did earlier in the movie. After coning as an airline pilot he starts to get the attention of an FBI agent Carl, played by Tom Hanks. Carl almost gets Frank but he gets away the first time they meet. Then he cons as a doctor to throw the FBI off and then a lawyer. You probably know from the opening Frank will get caught eventually. Thought after he gets back to America the ending is actually pretty good and satisfying. I think this movie also started to create the 60's craze until Mad Men perfected it a bit later. Anyway this movie is pretty good as a biopic about Frank's coning and struggle to get back his fortune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near Perfection of a Masterpiece - Always Worth Revisiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary "Catch Me if You Can" tells the story of con artist, Frank Abagnale Junior through the acting chops of Leonardo DiCaprio. His character is born into what is a fortunate life in terms of riches as well as one of love and compassion between his family members (though the latter is truly all her cares about). He's a more than intelligent young boy and all is well until the day his parents get a divorce and he's told he must choose who to live with. He can't deal with the pressure of having to choose one parents to be with over the other so he runs off into the world with nowhere to go. Eventually he finds that he has a knack for making fake checks and our story begins as we follow his career from beginning to end.Writing The story is based heavily on a true story of a protagonist by the same name. It's rich in content and a fantastic base for a fantastic movie. Really, there's nothing bad that you could say about the writing in the script. It takes great material and makes it better. This is true because the film adds an extra layer of drama as we find that our protagonist isn't really after money, but simply the love he lost from the shattering of his family picture. Every Christmas throughout the movie has him seen alone to remind us, the audience that he's in this journey of life with no one to support him. And when he finally finds someone he believes might be the one; it doesn't end up working. At a certain point we find that the cat and mouse chase between Frank and F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty goes on chiefly for the amusement of Frank. The only person paying any attention to him in this world is the man who wants him in prison, and while it may not be a perfect relationship; it's the only one he can keep for a more than decent amount of time.Cinematography"Catch Me if You Can" is no revolutionary picture in terms of cinematography. It does a simple job and does it incredibly well. Throughout the film there are for the most part, two main color keys: blue and gold. The blue keying makes its appearance during times when the F.B.I. is in control and either doing well or just doing it's job. When our protagonist is under the thumb of them, when they're on a hot trail and so close to getting closer to his capture, that is when the blue, beautifully pollutes the screen. The gold, however, occurs when we find characters happy and enjoying life (even if it's not the case for every character). When people dance in their homes, when the father and son meet up for the first time in years, when the cons begin to start working out, etc. It is safe to say that the film portrays whom we should protest with blue and whom we should rally for with gold. There are times when neither color key is extremely specific, but those are seldom in number.ActingThe acting is above stellar and this much - we shouldn't be surprised by. We have the acting talents of some of Hollywood's finest (Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Walken) and all at the helm of legendary director Steven Spielberg. The portrayal of these characters are as impressive as the writing that holds them and at times left myself in tears. You can have a beautifully crafted piece of writing for a film, but if it's preformed by person(s) who are incapable of matching up the acting quality to that of the writing; it's all-better off in the toilet. By not even a stretch past ten minutes into the film, you're completely immersed into the experience and truly believe all the characters.DisappointmentsThis film is one of those which is extremely hard to nit-pick although I did have a bit of an issue with a scene, roughly half way through. In it, Frank arrives to a hotel in his newly acquired suit and car where he proceeds to speak with a prostitute and do what people do with people of that profession. The scene adds nothing to the film other than a mild chuckle at how he cons even the prostitute out of some money. Paraphrasing Chekhov's famous rule of removing irrelevancy from a story: "if there is a gun hanging on the wall, the gun must go off". There is a gun hanging from the wall and it most certainly does not go off. While yes a minor flaw, it's still a flaw nonetheless and quite honestly has taken me out of the immersion of the film in previous viewings.In ConclusionAt the end of the day, "Catch Me if You Can" is a masterpiece with a lot of heart. It'll take you places you don't expect, from comedy, to romance, to action, to drama and provide the epitome of butterflies in the stomach (from end-all excitement. It's rather unpredictable, incredibly crafted with the finest of actors, filmmakers as well as writers and it's a wild ride.Rating9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike it's main character, this film is exactly what it wants to be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of classics i have been wanting to see but haven't got the chance. I have had a lot recommended to me, whilst i watch a hell of a lot of movies i haven't seen them all. I recently got my hands on a copy of Catch Me if You Can and had high hopes. Afterall, i've heard nothing but praise for the movie and the two main stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are two of my all-time favourite actors, how could i not love this?! So i watched it.. and i love this film! It had me hooked in from beginning to end and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. It was a fun movie as well as one that just keeps you wanting to know more and guessing how it will end for the characters.. especially Leonardo Dicaprio's Frank Abangale Jr.The plot follows Frank who leaves home at 16 after his parents divorce and poses as a pilot.. then a doctor.. then a lawyer.. all before he turns 21. I tell you, this guy has lived. Hot on his tail is an equally brilliant Tom Hanks as FBI detective Carl Hanratty who figures out Abangale's tricks through a series of fake cheques he is cashing out. This leads to an entertaining cat and mouse type movie full of twists and turns. The two actors play off of each other perfectly and are two completely different characters. What i like about Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal of Abengale is that he is an incredibly smart guy and he is so good at showing this without completely overplaying himself. Christopher Walken also does great as Abengale's father and adds some moral backbone to the twists and turns and we get a young Amy Adams who is also great as Abengale's love interestEverybody in this film does great.. in fact.. even a Jennifer Garner cameo was awesome!In the end, from the fitting music in the soundtrack to the animated opening sequence to the climax of the film everything was almost perfect and i will be watching this film a lot more times in my life because i had a great time and it really showcases why these 2 actors are 2 of the best working today. It comes highly recommended with the perfect blend of humour and entertainment.. if you haven't seen Catch me if you Can then see it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Story of a Fascinating Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, one thing you need to realize is that this is a true story. Is it a little overdramatized with some of the details fudged? Of course, but from what I've found it comes pretty close to the real thing. The film is about Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (played by DiCaprio) a teen who started committing fraud when he was 15 and before he was 21 years old he had stolen millions, created alibis, worked as a doctor, a pilot, and a lawyer for extended periods of time even though he wasn't actually any of them. He eluded the authorities all around the world for years eventually getting caught but not before escaping from custody twice. Tom Hanks plays the F.B.I. agent trying to catch him in this wonderfully entertaining film.There were only a few problems I had with the film. Leonardo DiCaprio was around 27 when they filmed this and while he does look young for his age at one point they try to pass him off as a 12 or 13 year old which clearly does not work. Tom Hanks is not good with accents. In the movie I don't even know what he was trying to impersonate but it came out sounding more like a speech impediment like Elmer Fudd or Barry Kripke.I'd give it a 9/10 just because I think it deserves to be higher than the 8.0 that it is currently at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a helpful movie. It shows the viewer that not all people are honest, despite Leonardo's character being likable. His world-view that most people were selfish encouraged him to trod down the path he had taken before getting arrested. The film also demonstrates how divorce affects people. The scene which sticks in my mind the most happened at the end of the movie; he met his younger half-sister for the first time. But he also discovered his French, biological mother reading a book, happily remarried and unconcerned with the troubles of his own son. The film is a wake-up call to me because it shows you that others often are generally not concerned with your problems. DiCaprio's character redeemed himself at the end of the movie by becoming a man in charge of dealing with check fraud. Overrated movie but highly recommended.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch this if you can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" featured 3 big names: Spielberg, Hanks and DiCaprio. So it was a bit surprising the film scored only two Academy Award nominations despite great reviews. Christopher Walken (playing the main character's father) lost a probably very close race against Chris Cooper. Spielberg had worked before with Hanks ("Saving Private Ryan") and worked with him afterward again ("The Terminal"). In terms of Spielberg/DiCaprio and Hanks/DiCaprio it stayed the only collaboration. The book that this movie is based on was actually written by Frank Abagnale himself and he even has a small cameo playing one of the French cops who arrest "himself"."Catch Me If You Can" is a true quality movie. It delivers in terms of comedy as well as drama (the scenes with his girlfriend's dad, the talk about the dogs name, his mother's cheating, the divorce scene, the scene at his mother's house at the end...). Even if it is illegal, it is so much fun to watch Abagnale Jr. trick the FBI and also everybody else. Scenes I found particularly funny were the French class scene very early in the movie, the prostitute scene, the first meeting with Hanratty or the scenes at the hospital where he gets sick just like he does in the cockpit. Oh and lets not forget about Abagnale's first appearance at court and the judge's reaction to his actions. I laughed a lot. And even, when there is no DiCaprio on screen, there is occasionally some humor despite Hanratty being such a serious character, like when for example Abagnale's mother wants to take care of her son's wrongdoings with a quick check. The quiz show intro was a nice idea too.There is so much details in this movie that you could watch it a dozen times and would most likely still find something new. Abagnale is a fascinating character. Despite his illegal actions, he is likable to the audience just like he is likable to the newspapers mentioned in the movie. Maybe that is because all he actually wants is piece within his family, first his parents, than with his girlfriend. Every time he erupts and commits a crime, there was some trigger before that disturbed the peaceful family life. It all starts when his father and mother get a divorce. The way he runs away and hopes for them to make up throughout the whole film reminds me of the scene early on when his mother spills some wine and there is some trouble. He leaves the room to get something to clean it up and when he returns his parents are dancing peacefully. When he is about to have his own family much later, he does not want to do anything illegal again, but is haunted by the ghosts of his criminal past. He even tells his girlfriend his real name when she asks him to. The "Has anybody here seen Kelly"-scene is one of the most memorable of the movie. This is when Abagnale lets loose, loses his restlessness and truly transforms into a family person.I liked Amy Adams here a lot and despite everything she has done afterward, this may very well be my favorite performance of hers. Another very good performance here comes from Christopher Walken, who plays maybe the most interesting character here. He definitely brings the best quotes to the table (why the Yankees win, the mouse metaphor). You cannot look away when he is on screen. You could almost call him a partner in crime to his son. His look at his son after the school principal tells Abagnale's parents about his son's pretending to be a teacher says it all. Later on, he tells Abagnale to keep going with what he does as he really caused trouble to the FBI big guys. Reason is probably his own struggles with financial authorities and he loves his son bothering them successfully. Apart from that, he is a really caring father and husband. While his wife immediately tells the FBI guys about her son, the father tells Hanratty he'd never do or say anything that could hurt his son. Sadly, at the end, we find out that the father was in fact the first mouse, the one that drowned and not the second who lived. The way he died is interesting too given the father-son talk about the car/train choice earlier. He fell down the stairs at the train station and broke his neck.Finally, there is the relationship between Abagnale and Hanratty. Even if Abagnale becomes more and more Hanratty's Moby Dick, there seems to be a strange bond between these two. They talk to each other several times on Christmas as they both have nobody else to talk to. They are both slightly tragic characters. The prostitute scene against the launderette scene was pretty funny as it summarized their lives in a nutshell at that point (and how they got into contact with female underwear). And then there is the ending of course where we see how Hanratty saves Abagnale's life and even makes him his employee. He really seems unable to build up a relationship with his colleagues, but with Abagnale somehow it works at least to some extent, maybe because they are so good at what they do, even if their approaches are completely different and initially even at the opposite sides of the law. And they both have a sense of family as we see by Hanratty still with his wedding ring on and Abagnale asking him near the end to swear on his daughter.There is really not much about this film that could have been better. I might have liked it even more if it had been completely chronological, but that's just me. I highly recommend watching this film. One of 2002's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch Me If You Can and my nostalgic, retrospective thoughts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of us have different opinions, especially about movies and women.. but this film is definitely an all time favorite of mine.Every now and then you probably feel like me, watching the collection of your watchlist movies again and again, over and over, never feeling bored of the past, craving to go back in time, and wishing that you could just see it again for the first time. The years go by and we get older, and your watchlist grows. At least that is the case with mine. Ever since I joined IMDb I have added some films that I saw to my watchlist. Although I do admit sometimes I forget to add films that I already saw. So far during my lifetime I have watched over 1400 movies if not more and I can tell you with confidence that this film is not something that is going to disappoint you. Retrospectively, 2002, seems a long way back even if some people say 'Darling, its as if 2002 was just 'yesterday'. I cannot put it into the span of this box how much happened since then...But the one I recall most recently, is that I have lost one of my favorite actors and I still sometimes feel like crying when I watch his movies, speeches, and stand-ups...Robin Williams and also the Hungarian equivalent of him an actor called Imre Bajor. I tend to get nostalgic from time to time; if most of you would know my age you would probably say I am still very young for that.. However, I cannot forget the joy some of these films like CMIYC gave me and the feelings that it conjured up in me as I was growing up. Catch Me If You Can ensures that the viewer is experiencing never ending excitement, thrill, and pure entertainment. This is mostly due to the fact that the script is extremely well written and tailored immaculately to the characters, and it all becomes realistic. The performance by the three major actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken is truly off the charts. You know when sometimes you have a movie or TV-show where the cast just fits exactly like a puzzle? Well, I do and these three are meant to be on screen together as it is in Catch Me If You Can. In this film Tom Hanks is persevered,Christopher Walken is Mysterious as usual, and Leaonardo DiCaprio.. the lad who is an adventurer.I do believe Hollywood should aim to go back towards making movies like this, I personally despise the fact and find it vile that we have all these supernatural, fantasy, space movies. I was never really a fan of Star Trek or any other 'battlestar galatica' movies...and hopefully, someday they will indeed produce films that are of such quality as CMIYC.If you have not seen this movie yet...then waste no more time searching for another film to watch this December, or on this Sunday afternoon... and if you already seen it then you know how it is good and the environment which it should be watched in. To make it ideal...I usually get some wood logs from outside, put it in the Fire place, get a hot chocolate, some popcorn/pistachios and lay back in your usual seat on the couch. For me it just matches the movie to watch it during the winter season... and if there is snow outside and you can hardly see out from your windows then you know its time.I know that I did not provide any details to the plot or described what the movie is about, but I hope I got you into the zone of having a relaxed afternoon and I shared true honest feelings with you about how I feel when I watch movies.Thank you so much for reading this 'review', (More like a 5 minute monologue) BD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I wait so long?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has an astonishing record as both a director and a producer and, since he burst on the scene with "Duel" in 1971, I have seen most of his work, but somehow I managed to miss the 2002 "Catch Me If You Can" which he both directed and produced and only caught up with it 12 years later following a recommendation. I suppose I saw it as one of Spielberg's smaller and lighter works, but it does have a great cast and a cracking story and, at its heart, it has Spielberg's recurrent sympathy for the confused child ("Empire Of The Sun") often from a broken home ("E.T."). Most surprising of all is that essentially this is a true story about how the teenage Frank Abagnale Jr managed to adopt a series of professional personas in order to hustle his way into people's respect and even affection while cashing more than $2.5 million in fraudulent cheques all around the United States and in a couple of dozen other countries.Leonardo di Caprio - who has played a number of real-life people in his career ("The Aviator", "J Edgar", "The Wolf Of Wall Street") - is excellent as Frank, bringing both charm and cunning to the role. The breathless narrative of the movie was reflected in the shooting schedule (it was filmed in just 52 days), but Jeff Nathanson's screenplay gives the story an emotional thread by repeatedly focusing on the relationship between Frank and the FBI lawman leading the chase Carl Hanratty who is played by Tom Hanks as both the mirror-image to Frank in style and motivation and increasingly a father figure to the teenager who has lost his real father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in my childhood I watched a movie where the bad guy, a thief wins at the end and police remains hopeless finding him till ever. I didn't like the film not because I wanted the thief be punished, but because I was unhappy for the disappointed cop. Here the story is a little different since at the end both sides win. Life of Di Caprio is narrated from the childhood to the time that he learns to fake being teacher/doctor/secret service agent till his love story. These details makes the viewer sympathize with the cute and sexy thief who is on FBI's wanted list. On the law side there is a detective(Tom Hanks) who is often downplayed by his colleagues.during time, a special relationship forms between them; Something like attachment added to hide and seek. This attachment grows to a level where Di Caprio should call Hanks because he is lonely and needs to talk to someone, his hunter, and then his friend. As a film based on real events, the director should be praised for his great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great movies. Great actors. The best thing about this movie is that it is based on a true story. It is about a kid who is good at making fake checks and earning millions of dollars by pretending to work in different jobs. The first job was that he pretended to be a sub teacher at age 17. Then his father lost his business and the family had lost their house and became broke. When that happened the parents got divorced and the kid wasn't happy about it. So he ran away and depend on himself. He became so professional at making fake checks. He once pretended to be a co-pilot at Pan American World Airways. Then he pretended to be a doctor and a lawyer. While making fake checks the FBI started to notice that the kid had stolen millions of dollars and FBI started looking for the kid. That is why the name of the movie is Catch Me If You Can. Because all this time the FBI had been trying to catch him and they funny thing is that he got caught not in the United States, he got caught in France. I recommend this movie to everyone who are a fan of Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete laughter and entertainment dose !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remarkable work by Spielberg. It is based on the true life story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. who himself plays a minor role in the movie as a French policeman. This only adds to the fascination and awe while watching the movie. The movie depicts how Frank disguises first as an Airline Pilot, then a doctor and later as a lawyer without any professional training in any of these fields. He was able to con a huge sum of money from various government authorities all around the world through his fake degrees, qualifications, payroll cheques etc. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Frank in the film was terrific and Tom Hanks' role as an FBI agent only adds to it. Frank's character in the film makes it seem absolutely believable that a man like him can lie, deceive and con almost everyone he meets. The most interesting part is to watch Frank disguise as a school teacher in high school so effortlessly . It is also amusing to watch him get away from the Airport so easily with eight of his selected stewardesses despite the presence of over a hundred officers at the Airport.Overall, it is an exciting movie to watch that kept me engrossed throughout the movie. However, I feel that the movie very quickly digresses from the serious topics such as separation of the family, divorce, bankruptcy and their impact on the character of Frank although these were the real driving factors due to which he resorted to such a deceitful lifestyle. Also, the fact that Frank ends up well off in life even after he was caught, sort of glorifies his lifestyle. It is always a very pleasant change from the usual serious films to watch a bit of escapism and complete unrestricted freedom without instigating an inward desire to lead such a lifestyle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You CanListening the name of the movie at first, it didn't interest me much. But I had a damn keen interest in it. Tom Hanks +Leonardo DiCaprio and you get a direction from Steven Spielberg as a topping. What better a serving can you ask for.First things first. Creativity of the movie takes you from the very first moment, when credits are shown. I mean thats what I love about Hollywood. They take their jobs so possessively. Even something as minor(in comparison to the hell lot of other things a movie includes) as starting credits are designed so creatively, so attractively, that you rarely see such stuff in the East. Then, talking about screenplay it was none the less just fabulous . You know movies of such kind..they make you feel right between those characters. You never feel you aren't a part of that movie. Such is the beauty of all the hard work, that even though watching it at mid night with college the next day,you don't feel to pause it for a moment. The guts of Frank William Abagnale are what took me by awe. His confidence he puts into whatever he says or does. Bravo to the thought improvisation in the script. And what brilliant execution.What next hit hard was the relation between Carl(Tom Hanks) and Frank (Leo).When you are an ace thief the most faithful and trustworthy relation you can and you have is with the agent chasing you.It is true and is strong. Both of you stay committed to each other yet against each other.Also, this one really shows that you are what you believe at that moment.! Nothing else.The end again had its complete touch and the few facts shown at the end about Mr. Frank added even more to what the movie had successfully portrayed. Loved it totally. And glad watched it.. ;)Tom Hanks as always is lovable and even though you give him lesser screen space, he makes his presence felt so serenely. Leo . Well, watching his movies till yet and now this one, I'll just say he is one of those actors who are of a different league and always keep evolving themselves. Always Always fascinate you.! You just feel happy about yourself for watching them doing what they do best.! Glorious movie.Must watch!!Steven Spielberg has done yet another simply amazing work directing this one.!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>catch me if you can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Release date: 25 December 2002 Lenght: 141 minutes Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken &amp; Martin Sheen Director: Steven Spielberg Producer: Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes Distributor: Dreamworks SKG Music: John Williams Screenplay writer: Jeff Nathanson, Stan Redding &amp; Frank Abagnale'Catch me if you can' is a crime drama film based on a true story. The movie is about the life of Frank Abagnale who had a very complicated life. There is a lot of action in this movie and it's really not boring. The movie was a success and also the real Frank Abagnale really liked the movie . The movie is about a young man (Frank Abagnale) who is good at pretending to be someone else. One day his parents decide to divorce and Frank need to choose with which parent he wants to live. Frank doesn't want to make that decision and runs away. He doesn't have a lot of money so he starts to forge checks. He is very good in forging stuff so he forged his pilot certificate and became a co-pilot. The FBI discovers all the forged checks and they start to look for him without knowing who he really is and what he looks like. Carl Hanratty is an FBI fraud bank agent and he really wants to catch Frank, but catching Frank is not as easy as he thought. Meanwhile it gets a little risky for Frank to be a pilot so he decide to change jobs and he becomes a doctor. Frank is not afraid of the FBI and keeps forging checks and papers, but can he keep doing that? The leadactor in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio has played a role in many movies like 'Titanic', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'The great gatsby' ? Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Frank Abagnale in the movie and I think he is the perfect actor for that. The other leadactor is Tom Hanks. He has the role of the FBI-agent. Also Tom Hanks plays his role perfect, I think DiCaprio and Hanks are the perfect combination to make a movie together. 'Catch me if you can' is the perfect movie for people who like a little bit action, the movie is easy to understand and besides it is based on a true story! The storyline is really good and the actors are perfect for this movie, I would recommend this movie to everybody that I know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Story of A Real Fake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired from a true story, Catch Me If You Can is the biopic of Frank Abagnale Jr., a mastermind conman who succeeded in forging millions of dollars worth of checks while disguised as an airline pilot, doctor &amp; lawyer, all before turning 19 years of age, and apart from capturing the methods employed by this young &amp; brilliant con artist to get his job done also covers his stint with the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who eventually hunts him down.Although Steven Spielberg is yet to give a true cinematic masterpiece in the 21st century, Catch Me If You Can comes pretty close with nothing much to complain in any of the filmmaking departments and is one of his most enjoyable &amp; entertaining films. The direction is dynamic, the script is lively, pacing is relentless with no dragging moment &amp; music by John Williams suits the Spielberg's story just the way it always has in the past.Amongst the performances, Tom Hanks is seriously good as the FBI agent who is trying to track down our conman but is also fond of him. Christopher Walken chips in with another good work as Frank Abagnale Sr. &amp; Amy Adams as Brenda Strong has an innocent presence too. But the one who impresses the most is Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenaged con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr., and delivers an energetic, confident &amp; versatile performance.On an overall scale, Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted work of quality entertainment that is smartly directed, smoothly paced, ingeniously performed, firmly edited &amp; nicely scored but benefits most from DiCaprio's show-stealing performance under the assured direction of Spielberg, and is as charming as its lead character in spite of all its flaws.</fullReview>

Walken in a wonderful sympathetic role was my reward to take it all in without hesitation on first viewing.... Hanks unremarkable in the duality of his love/hate for Frankie... many laughable moments unexpected i.e. university of Ben Casey and Perry Mason, table blessing of the two mice, knock knock joke, prostitute paying customer, Ian Fleming fitting, necklace recovery, not Lutheran?, french class substitute, to name a few... perhaps only 50% of the 80% claimed by the real Frank for the events in this film is enough to impress and I was... loveliest scene of Judy Garland's Embraceable You kitchen sway with Martin and wife, ahhhh vive l'amore!! high recommend for chase thrillers in world wide locales, cheering for the bad guy theme with happy endings, Steven knows what most of us want.... kudos!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Satisfying Ironic: A Critical Review of Catch Me If You Can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a thoughtfully arranged drama-biographical narrative based on the life story of Mr. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. that tag-lines as, "The true story of a real fake". Although this story lacks violence, blood, murder, and other stereotypical understandings of this genre, this film reinforces its true crime integrity through the criteria use of narrative style, the text at the finale, the explanation for the evil, and the psychological understanding of this true, blue collar crime. All in all, this 2002 film, Catch Me If You Can, directed by Steven Spielberg cleverly captures the loopholes found in the criminal justice system, not only in the police force but the Federal Bureau of Investigation, making this film a true crime reflection as well as an explanation as to why the accessibility of actual criminal minds is necessary in these judicial forces to ensure safety and justice. This film is not only well written, entertaining, and includes a star-studded cast, but it also has a deeper meaning, a real life application, and new ideas for the viewer to think about after the credible finale; therefore ultimately earning my vote of a full, ten out of ten production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much, it was entertain and suspenseful and had a very humanitarian message to it in the end. I felt that all the base were covered extremely well and the the movie actually had a good sense of humor about it as well. the casting was excellent and the Details in the costumes were executed with fantastic accuracy. the was a big swagger to the way DiCaprio played Abgnale and It made him the most endearing con man ever to hit the silver screen. Tom Hanks was a Hilariously Grumpy and feeling Carl Hanratty He made The Triumph of justice just as cool as the con man escaping the law. If there is one thing that I would like to see the movie do more of, It would be adding more grit to the tone of the movie. Not a lot The movie doesn't any disembowelment scenes but just to give the feeling that he really was criminal. the tone of the movie i feel just dampens the severaity of what he has done. and that really is my only complaint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie worth catching? and watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on real story . Since this is a Hollywood movie probably some things were changed , but that doesn't really matter . What is important is this movie entertains . It's long , 2 hours and few minutes , yet it's never boring . It's set during the 60's and 70's and the humor in "Catch me if you can" reminds me humor from movies from that time. My favorite joke is the "knock, knock" joke from Hanks.The opening credits sequence is brilliant. It's one of the best opening sequences ever. DiCaprio fits in his role well with his boyish look .Tom Hanks is nice as the grumpy FBI agent. Christopher Walken steals the show with his performance as the charming , always optimistic father of our hero. He deserved Oscar nomination. It was also good to see Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. Jennifer Garner appearance was rather pointless.The tricks that DiCaprio uses look believable . I can only complain that he acts a little bit stupid during the second half of the movie , but maybe that's how it was in the real life ? Anyway the movie provides good fun . There is some depth here . Both DiCaprio and Hanks are lonely people who have nothing more than their jobs . Spielberg also tries to explain why Frank Abagnale Jr. started his criminal career . His explanation sounds logical ? he was running away because he couldn't deal with his parents marriage problems (He was 16 years old then). "Catch me if you can" is a well made fluff entertainment. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- This review contains spoilers. - I've watched this movie several times. I remember seeing it the first time. Being astounded by the brilliance of DiCaprio's character and by the intelligent storytelling, I directly decided to write this review.Frank is a rebel. He thinks outside the box and therefore realizes the weakness of the system. With a morally questionable attitude towards authority and routine, he decides to live a dangerous and permanently altering life. The life of a genius, however a liar - an ambivalent personality whose actions can be evaluated and assessed controversially.The story is developed nicely. Starting with a funny exposition in which Frank's unusual, yet clever behavior is shown, Spielberg continues by illustrating the inciting incident to a rare career. A divorce! This is the aspect of this movie that is the most interesting one. Divorces have become such a regular thing. Why would such a daily happening event effect so greatly on an intelligent person? This circumstance can only be reasoned by the idiosyncrasies of Frank Abergnale's character. Although his brilliance and his rebellion let him appear as an emotionally cold, completely rational person, the cause of all his decisions lays in a very psychological and emotional event. Suddenly this movie seems to be rather a psychological study on an insurrectionist, than a regular crime story.This is the point where Hanks' character comes into play. This character implies antagonism, thus adds a whole amount of suspense to the story. Let me ignore all the often discussed coincidental scenes of confrontation in this film at that point. Hanks' occurrence adds a duality to the story. And at the end, somehow Hanks and DiCaprio become friends and partners. Despite the fact that they act against each other, there never is hatred or greed in their relationship. They just play their social roles as a rebel and as a detective. It's a socially required rivalry. This is also the reason for which they are able to peacefully work together at the end. The movie documents the genesis of a rare friendship, which was used to be avoided by the existence of social roles.I comprehend this movie as a sociological study, due to the fact that it shows extraordinary characters in typical social roles, as well as social dynamics that we all know.Visually this movie is well made. Well directed, well written, well acted - but cinematically there is no specialty that needs to be pointed out especially. The brilliance of this piece consists in the topic it deals with.Thanks for reading, watch this movie and relate yourself to the characters and it will inspire you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome departure from Spielberg's usual style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of perhaps the biggest American fraudster in history, and the cat-and-mouse chase to catch him. A hunt that in many ways brought Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) together, since in many ways they were each other's lives at the time, and culminated in a lifelong friendship. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s story is an incredible one. By the time he turned 18, he had successfully played the roles of an airline captain, a doctor and a lawyer, and cashed in false checks for over $2.5 million. This is the film of his story, based on Frank's own accounts of the events. And it is an exceptionally entertaining film. Cocky con artists succeeding pretty much always make for a fun film, and when it's based on the true events of a young and likable man, it gets even more fun. It's amazing what you can get away with a little ingenuity and enormous amounts of nerve. But there's of course a price to pay when your whole life revolves around living a lie.Catch Me If You Can is actually a rather unusual film to bear Spielberg's name. The usual Spielberg trademarks are mostly absent from this film, without that necessarily being a bad thing. Initially Spielberg didn't intend to direct this film at all; it was Gore Verbinsky who first got the job. But when Leonardi DiCaprio was called back to film more scenes for Gangs of New York, delaying the shoot, Verbinsky had to withdraw. At that time James Gandolfini was lined up for the role of Carl Hanratty. It could've been interesting to see how the film had turned out with them, but looking at the film as it is, it is hard to imagine it being better than the Spielberg/Hanks collaboration it turned out to be, their fifth at the time.Along with Spielberg's departure from his usual style, there's also John William's soundtrack, which is very different from the pompous soundtracks he's most known for. It's jazzy and beautiful, and fits the 60s setting perfectly. The acting is first rate, from the leads of Leonardo DiCaprio, who started showing at the time that there was more to him than just being a heartthrob, and Tom Hanks, both delivering top notch work, to brilliant supporting parts from actors like Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. It's a well crafted and playful movie overall, delivering the goods across all lines. It's a highly entertaining movie, that I'm sure will stand the test of time. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of the movie may suggest a cat and mouse game between two individuals, but there is more to it! This a movie that portrays the relationship between a young boy who yearns for parental love &amp; care and a middle aged police officer who is away from his child. Although the basic plot is the conflict between a young, brilliant con man and a cool &amp; composed police officer, the emotional struggle both of them endure as a result of their troubled relationships with their respective families is beautifully woven around the plot by the virtuoso STEVEN SPIELBERG!

		<shortDescription>Breezy Fun, and Surprisingly Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's certainly been a while since I've seen a film so easy to like and purely entertaining as Catch Me If You Can. Fun and well paced, though not lacking in intelligence, Catch Me If You Can is ideal film. It doesn't reach the masterpiece status many proclaim it has, but it's a confident and enjoyable ride, that even boasts some surprising emotional depth.Inspired by actual events, Catch Me If You Can follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., who runs away after his parent's divorce at the age of 16. Following in his dad's footsteps, Frank becomes a masterful conman, stealing millions of dollars. However, Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent, is hot on Frank's heels. As Frank continues to successfully evade the law, he also faces difficulties of his own, such as old wounds from his parent's divorce.While not as fast paced as one might expect from such a film, Catch Me If You Can never feels long or boring, despite the lengthy run time; nearly two and a half hours. The film's consistent cleverness, and intriguing plot keeps the audience completely captivated for the entire duration.The film works as a number of things. It makes for an excellent comedy. Frank Abagnale Jr. is fiendishly clever, and gets into some interesting (and humorous) situations by faking his identity. Catch Me If You Can also works as an action film, due to it's "chase" premise.Perhaps most surprisingly, Catch Me If You Can also works as a drama. While providing breezy fun, this is also a surprisingly touching film. All of Frank's schemes and cons are done to make his father proud. For despite the devastating divorce, Frank really loves his dad, and this adds an emotional element of the film. Catch Me If You Can would've been a pleasant and enjoyable film without this element. But this extra layer makes Catch Me If You Can memorable, and helps separate it from the dozens of other similar films out there today.Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent in the leading role as Frank Abagnale Jr. His love for his father, and his easy confidence makes him a surprisingly likable character. Tom Hanks as the persistent FBI Agent, Carl Hanratty is also well done (the amusing Brooklyn accent helps). In a role that's similar to DiCaprio's, Christopher Walken portrays Frank's loving father, who's also a bit of a conman himself. Walken's performance really boosts the emotional umph in this film, making his role the standout in the film.John William's score is very playful, and is also delightfully jazzy. The child-like main theme and heavy use of the saxophone are memorable staples of the score. The music truly enhances the film, and makes up one of William's most underrated scores.Catch Me If You Can isn't your average action flick. It's emotional depth and intelligence distinguishes it from others of it's kin, while it's cleverness and humor ensures that it's a fun ride for all. While there are brief moments of genius, Catch Me If You Can isn't a masterpiece, or even close. But it's extremely memorable, and well made, and a lot different than most films of the same nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a great director such as Steven Spielberg who has directed some of my favourite films and great actors such as Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio I expected this to be a good film, but after watching it I discovered it was greater than my expectation, this film was not only well directed but contained great acting and a super complex plot which Steven Spielberg managed to pull off perfectly. This film has a great rating and it fully deserves it. I found that as it was based on a true story it really gets you indulged and makes you think thoroughly, the fact that they put a nice little twist on the film made it that much better. The fact that a 19 year old managed to pull all this off and managed to become so successful and rich really makes you interested, although it wasn't very dramatic and for a film of its time the special effects were not great. Overall I would defiantly recommend this film 100%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch Me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic movies like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and E.T., yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in "A League of Their Own" and his mere presence adds more to this film, perhaps more as we see him in 2nd lead Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly. When his parents file for divorce and he has to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each step he takes. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. He is able to do all these sort of crimes inspired by comic books and experiences he got from things around him. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse. Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the entire film length!! To be fair ? the film didn't sets out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.My Rating ? 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He wasn't a pilot, a doctor a lawyer but he posed as all three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening scenes we see protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. as he appears as a guest on a television show; then we flash back several years and see him being extradited from France by FBI agent Carl Hanratty? we then go even further back and start to see how an apparently ordinary teenager would become the most wanted fraudster in America. He leaves home when his parents' marriage fails then tries to cash cheques but nobody will except a cheque from an unknown teenager; then he hits upon an idea; he will become an airline pilot! Not a real pilot of course but with a uniform and a fake ID getting cheques cashed is easy; he also learns that it can get him free flights on other airlines. As he racks up the miles and cashes more and more cheques Agent Hanratty takes an interest in him and at one point almost catches him. It is time to hang up the uniform but Frank isn't going to stop his game; he spends time working as a doctor and then a lawyer before he is forced to run; eventually he is caught of course? we'd seen that at the beginning. That isn't the end of Frank's story though? .This is essentially a caper movie with Frank trying one scheme after another; if we weren't told it was based on fact many parts would be unbelievable if it weren't for the way Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank as a person with extreme confidence. We get an hilarious example of this early on when Frank arrives at a new school and passes himself off as a substitute teacher? for two weeks! Equally good is Tom Hanks' portrayal of the dogged Agent Henratty. There are well known actors doing fine jobs in minor roles too; these include Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. The story contains plenty of laugh out loud moments and little to offend? although some may consider it somewhat amoral as Frank is such a likable character it is easy to want him to get away with his crimes! Overall I'd say that this was well worth watching; it may be over two hours long but that time just flew by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually there is not very much in the movie to be spoiled. What the movie is about is expressed in the beginning. Based on the true story, it covers the the life of con man and how FBI Agent hunts him down. The con man is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who impersonates a pilot and few other personalities while FBI Agent is played by great actor Tom Hanks.Movie has all the elements that makes it a must watch. Even this more than 2 hr long movie, it is too much fun. It is very different from all the Steven Spielberg films that you will see. It has a distinct type of humor in the scenes of the movie, kind-of situation based.As far as acting performance is concerned, all the viewers will be amazed. DiCaprio's performance is so good that you will want for his character in the to succeed. Tom Hanks as always gives a stunner. He is a kind of actor who plays different characters every time giving the audience a variety.To sum up why you should see this film:1.If you are fan of DiCaprio or Tom Hanks there is no reason why you should not see the film. 2.If you are tired of watching movies based on serious subjects, then this will offer you something different as well as pleasant. 3.It is a " Steven Spielberg " film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really know what to expect when I started to watched this movie. Probably something interesting and fast, based on a true story, benefiting from spielber's experience, but, I just wasn't sure it it would be good.and in my case it was a good surprise.Di Caprio and Hanks are playing at a good level. Most of situations are credible, this could haven happen more or less this way. The secondary carachters like di caprio's mother and fathers are not much developed but that give chance to faster pace and doesn't really harm the viewer involment with the main character. We can kind of understand what pushed the situation to start and develop this way.There is also no glorification of crimes or criminal, Tom Hanks also doesn't represent a model saint cops leading a crusade against check forgers.All in one, the story of two opposite personalities, with somehow similar wound and weaknesses, a "smart" crime movie, shown in a fast pace story telling and realistic environment made me arrive at the end to think "is that already finished", which doesn't happens often in my case.Would recommend it without hesitations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Based on a true story" as a selling point has gone severely downhill. Because it's a marketing term and by no means verifiable, there has been an influx of movies with the 'salesbait' (which is my own term) attached. But this is a movie which really defines "based on a true story". As I read in the trivia, there are several parts of the movie which were redone or removed to keep the film as true-to-life as possible. Of course, this is going off Frank Abagnale Jr.'s own word, so you should take that with a few grains of salt.About the movie itself: it's longer than it probably needs to be. I don't have anything against long movies, but eventually this turned into "who else can Frank prank?". Tom Hanks is perfect, Tom Hanks' accent is beautimous, and Tom Hanks' attitude is a close third for my favorite actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was fine as a main character, but I couldn't help imagining this turning into "Inception". Oh well, I guess that's just a testament to his acting style.All-in-all, one of my favorite movies. Definitely take the time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when lies grow out of control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story begins with the pathetic daring do and fall of a father (Christopher Walken) and the equally disturbing ways of a cheating mother. Clearly, Leo DiCarprio's young Frank Abignale Jr, was both as innocent as he was desperate, as cunning as he was naively idealistic. This fascinating watch wonderfully captures the late 1960's and your imagination. From New Rochelle, NY to a worldwide impostor on the run, we see Frank on an amazing journey all the while being chased by FBI paper hanger agent Carl Hanratty, who is marvelously enlivened by a frustrated but determined Tom Hanks. Knock knock! This game of deception is a lot of fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we were children, we used to imagine who we want to become: astronauts, firefighters, top-models, whoever. Apparently some people live their lives as if they are still playing in the courtyard; they easily change their occupations, looks, even characters. Catch Me If You Can is about such a man.This is a true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor. He admires his father and from him he learns how to manipulate people and systems. Of course, he attracted attention of the police forces, and in particular of Carl Hanratty, man in charge of falsifications in the US. The pursuit that ensues is the main focus of the movie.The plot is based on the autobiographical book by Frank Abagnale Jr. himself, where he describes his adventures, and despite the huge potential that the book had to offer to the movie makers in terms of the characters, relationships etc, the movie turned out to be nice extra rather than the stand alone piece of art.The movie lacks personality. Charisma of real Frank Abagnale Jr. did not allow Steven Spielberg to put anything personal in the movie. It is simply re-telling of the book; the director or the screenplay writers don't have their own opinions on the matters going on, they simply take the back seat and show us what happened to the main character. This approach made the movie automatically inferior to the book ? the audience still needs guidance; good movie is always a dialogue, not a monologue, not a dry ascertaining of facts. It is still amusing and interesting to watch, but poor Frank and Carl look like animals in the zoo rather than humans with human feelings and emotions. It starts to feel artificial game of cat and mouse.The famous director failed to inhale life in the characters. Little surprise that the star cast didn't manage to do it either. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks clearly do their best. DiCaprio convincingly plays immature kid with little understanding of consequences of his actions. Hanks convincingly plays workaholic cop. But the lack of conflict, lack of deep interactions means that the characters don't evolve, and in the end of the movie we see the same two chaps that we saw in the beginning. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams ? they all play their parts perfectly, creating exactly the characters they were asked to create. Shame they still look unnatural. And in the end, all the action around the master of reincarnations simply leads to the thought that maybe exciting, fulfilling life doesn't need to be full of action and pursuits and God-knows-what. Maybe what people actually need to live truly interesting lives is the presence of other people, who would guide, teach and just talk meaningful talks. Who needs all the checks and all the millions if there is nobody around to tell you where to spend it? The story of the man who never stopped being a small child is worth watching only for the sake of this idea.VERDICT: Good illustration to the book, amusing and interesting, even though it fails as the movie.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg, Hanks, DiCaprio: Catch this film if you can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review first published on Dec. 27, 2002.The one thing we do not see enough in movies today is a good animated opening credit sequence. That's why when "Catch Me If You can" began with such a treat, I immediately knew this was going to be an exceptional motion picture.And my prediction was correct.Starting off with the clever cartoon opening and the quick, jazzy score by John Williams, the perceptive observer recalls films such as "The Pink Panther," "Around the World In 80 Days" and "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.We are then swept into the world of Frank Abangale, Jr., taken from his book and adapted for the screen by Jeff Nathanson. In a nice opening scene, Frank, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man ? who because of various situations in life ? impersonated a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a Secret Service agent (and almost gets away with it), is introduced on an episode of TV's "To Tell the Truth." In addition to fooling hundreds of people over the years, he cashed over $4 million in fraudulent checks. During most of his escapades, Frank is hunted by an obsessive FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (a wonderful performance by Tom Hanks).In almost a Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner fashion, the impersonator pulls off several miraculous escapes, leaving the law with a fresh coat of egg on its face. While DiCaprio's Abangale is clever, free-spirited, charming, sexy and charismatic, Hanratty is a lonely divorced father, dull, sour and doggedly determined to catch his thief.Both manage to communicate with each other over the course of several Christmas Eves because they know each others' minds. Both are also pathetic characters in their own way, although poles apart, personality-wise.While Frank's choice as a pilot (he only flies free as a "dead-head," never actually attempting to control an aircraft), is to attract women, he is forced into the medical and legal professions directly because of Carl's detective work.Hank's character ? complete with a perfect Boston accent ? can get close to his prey, but can never quite bring him in. Meanwhile, as a doctor, Frank (who watched episodes of "Dr. Kildare" to bone up on his surgical technique) attracts a naive young nurse in braces (Amy Adams) whose father (played by Martin Sheen), is a District Attorney in New Orleans.Studying for two weeks ? and watching "Perry Mason" ? he passes the Louisiana bar exam on his first try and becomes Sheen's assistant. Playing it super cool, as well as picking up professional jargon and vernacular, Frank bluff his way through several hilarious situation, including making $400 from a prostitute who thought SHE was ripping HIM off.Later, though, things become very dark, indeed, as Frank's constant dodging the law is less and less fun. During the masquerades, his mother (Natalie Baye) divorces his father (Christopher Walken, an Oscar winner for "The Deer Hunter" and who will probably get a nomination for this role, as well) after an affair with a lodge buddy (James Brolin).Frank's father, hounded himself (by the IRS), sees through his son's fraud, and while secretly envying him, knows it can only lead to misfortune. Finally captured, Frank is given an entire new career in a nice twist of an ending."Catch Me If You Can" is a major departure for director Steven Spielberg, whose last several films ? "Schindler's List," "Saving Private Ryan" and "A.I." ? have been of the utmost seriousness. This almost lighter-than-air picture still manages to tug a few heartstrings here and there, but maintains its cheerful look or the most part.Sometimes, a bit too long (at two hours, 20 minutes), audiences will nevertheless find the humor and breeziness of this movie too irresistible to let this bother them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch Me If You Can (2002) - I Think The Title Just Says it All! Way to Go for Making Obvious Titles, Spielberg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the biographical true story and novel of con Frank Abagnale, Jr., this comedy-drama, directed by the amazing Steven Spielberg, is a look in the process of cons, criminals, and money scams. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, giving the best performance of his career, as Frank Abagnale, Jr., who successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars, way before his 19th birthday. He was able to accomplish this crime by posing as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, and a prosecutor. Since his primary crime was check fraud, Tom Hanks and the rest of the FBI are trying catch this maniac. This is truly one of Spielberg's best films, and I think I already knew that I would love it. Steven Spielberg delivers a fine directing job in this movie, and he truly knocked the ball out of the park once again. As for the acting, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the entire movie as Frank Abagnale, Jr., and he should have received a Best Actor nomination. Tom Hanks is just awesome in this movie, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who tries to catch Abagnale and throw him into custody. Amy Adams is pleasant in this film as DiCaprio's nurse girlfriend, and Christopher Walken brings his classic "nice guy" attitude in an Oscar-nominated performance as Abagnale's father. Once again, this is another classic Spielberg collaboration, and it has never looked better. John Williams makes a classic original score, Janusz Kaminski creates fine cinematography, Michael Kahn delivers unique film editing, and Jeff Nathanson has created such a brilliant well-written script that really recreates the life of this regular criminal. This movie is filled with surprising drama, some funny laughs, and some brilliant touching moments that only the greatness of Spielberg can provide. This movie was so brilliant, that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. This is one of Spielberg's finest films, and it's a memorable favorite. "Catch Me If You Can", in my review, "a true and original concept, Spielberg at his best".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were sixteen and ran away from home, what would you do? Work an honest job with lousy pay? Go crawling back to your parents? Or would you do what Frank Abignale did? fly all over the world and cheat banks out of millions of dollars.Catch Me If You Can tells the incredible true story of the kid who became one of the most wanted con mans in American history. Starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio this is a slick, good looking, and intelligently funny movie that ranks up with some of Steven Spielberg's best work.Frank Abignale (Leonardo DiCaprio) lives what would seem like a perfect middle-class life, but when his father is convicted by the IRS for bank fraud things start to fall apart. His parents file for divorce and he has to choose whose custody he is going to be put in. So what does he do? he runs, and with high intentions of getting his family back together, after all isn't that what every kid wants? Frank went from forging fake cheques to eventually becoming a co-pilot for PanAm American Airways, a supervising MD, and assistant prosecutor, by the end stealing up to 5 million dollars. For a time he thought he was untouchable, but FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is keen to put him behind bars, and so the story of the cat and the mouse begins.While the two are hardly on screen together they do share an amusing relationship. The cat and mouse are two very different, but also very similar creatures. Both had lost families to a divorce and as much as they wish they could have it back they both realize that you have to grow up. DiCaprio pulls of the best performance since "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", another recommendable movie. Tom Hanks excels exceptionally well as the uptight agent in heavy pursuit of the criminal and Christopher Walken plays the very good optimistic father figure.One thing I found ridiculous was Steven's depiction of how easy it was to get a job in the 60's. Frank would simply observe the terminology of various occupations presented in movies and perform them in the facility where the practice is conducted. This gets me thinking of how much of this movie is actually fictionalized.However in spite of that this is still one the most outrageous, scandalist, funny stories I have ever seen, and what makes it even better is knowing that it actually happened. A bit too long a movie considering the plot line, but that can easily be forgiven when you're watching it because those 2 hours will just fly by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio in this film. Tom Hanks was so funny, even in his overly serious character. "Knock Knock" -- "Go f*** yourselves". He looked so foolish when he was beaten by the Secret Service act, and yet so smart and accomplished when apprehending Abagnale in France. In fact, talking of France, DiCaprio acts that scene so naturally, you don't feel, but you understand his willingness for all this to end. The music added to the fun, Spielberg was fantastic, I was shocked that the film came out in 2002, he actually put the watcher in that 19'-something world!!! I love DiCaprio most, not because of the class of his acting, but the youth he managed to put into it. He makes Frank so young and smart at the same time!! He isn't serious, he is a smiling, loving, playboy, and he really gets the audience hunting for what his next stunt, next quick escape is going to be. Film is good, highly recommended. Nice storyline e.t.c. The truth is, i don't know exactly what to say, but you should go watch it and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie is not in IMDb Top 250?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This films belongs to Di Caprio. The portrait of Frank Abagnale Jr. by Caprio is amazing and interesting. The movie begins with three impostor of Frank Abagnale with Caprio being the one. Then it shows how Frank becomes a criminal by forging checks after the divorce of his parents. Frank poses as a co-pilot and forges payroll checks and succeeds in stealing over 2.8 million dollars. He also impersonate as a doctor and an assistant prosecutor. Tom Hanks plays a humorless FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, who begins to track down Frank. Then begins the cat and mouse game. The scene in which Frank calls Carl for the first time is really interesting. Frank tells him that he is sorry that Carl could not catch him in their first meet, to which Carl replies that Frank has called him because there is no one else whom he can call. The film confirms Di Caprio as a fine actor. Catch me if you can is another jewel in Spielberg's crown.I fail to understand why this movie is not in the list of Top 250 IMDb films. Don't miss this movie. Its a masterpiece with top notch acting and direction. I would go with 8.0/10 for 'Catch me if you Can'. Go Catch it at the earliest if you still haven't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really surprised when I saw this. I wasn't expecting it so be so good. First of all the story is really interesting and really entertaining at the same time- something very rarely seen these days. Secondly, the performances are excellent, Leonardo DiCaprio in this sort of role where he actually acts instead of just looking pretty (Titanic springs to mind) is really a joy to watch. Also, Christopher Walken is excellent and Tom Hanks does that thing that he does which is to pull off an extremely good performance without actually trying. Lastly, I just want to say the music was brilliant- I'm really a big fan of John Williams. So, when it all comes together this really is a joy to watch, it's emotional, emotional, funny, witty, and very clever. An refreshingly not too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-around perfect mixture of fun, drama and suaveness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such an all-around exciting, fun movie that you could watch over and over again and never tire of. It's an interesting, light-hearted look at the true story of an extremely clever con artist, and full of great performances. Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding an honest, bittersweet quality to the movie, and his relationship with his son made for the most moving scenes of the film. Tom Hanks has the perfect dry wit in his role of Carl Hanratty, and his portrayal of the somewhat nerdy, striving foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's smooth character created a lot of comedic moments. And of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr., as he is in all of his roles. He really lets us see the humanity of the character and why he was the way he was, as well as does a great job in a more comedic role, different from the dark ones he usually tends to take on. He's the perfect mixture of suave, boyish and troubled that this character needs to be believable, and he pulls it off amazingly.In brief, this movie is something really different and incredibly interesting. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating, intelligent man with a true story that is both funny and full of real emotion, and these actors and director take it into their hands in the most perfect way. Definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's be Frank, you should catch it whenever you can.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg directs, and Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead in, this bizarre and entertaining film based on the true story of audacious fraudster, Frank Abagnale Jr.After his mother (Nathalie Bay) and father (Christopher Walken stealing every scene he's in) get divorced and try to make him decide who he wants to stay with, young Frank runs away and begins his adventures in the big, wide world. Adventures that would see him fraudulently gain millions of dollars, pretend to be a Pan-Am pilot, act as a doctor and also end up practising as a legal prosecutor. All while being pursued by the doggedly determined Carl Hanratty (a superb turn from Tom Hanks). You just wouldn't believe it if it wasn't actually true.Considering the fact that the material is somewhat lightweight in comparison to Spielberg's other movies of this time, it's good to see that he doesn't approach things without his usual professionalism and expert touch. From the great title sequence to the structure of the movie to the relationships between Frank and his father and, subsequently, Frank and Hanratty . . . . everything is superbly handled and lifted above what could easily have seemed unbelievable and trite, despite being based on real events.DiCaprio oozes confidence and charm and is perfect in the lead role, a likable young man you can actually believe would have the ability to pull off such audacious feats. Hanks is gruff and focused as Hanratty, a man intent on doing his job but not necessarily wanting to hurt anyone else who gets in the way while he pursues his main target. Walken, as already mentioned, steals every scene he's in. Then we have the likes of Martin Sheen, Amy Adams and even small roles for the likes of Elizabeth Banks (before she was so well known) and Jennifer Garner.This stands up as yet another great movie in Spielberg's canon and one well worth watching for fans of quality cinema. It's filled with tension, humour, great performances, a sense of buoyancy offset by underlying darkness and emotional imbalance. There's also the vicarious thrill provided by accompanying such a charismatic lead character doing what he shouldn't. Halfway through the movie, I doubt that any viewer will be hoping for justice to finally catch up with Frank.See this if you like: The Terminal, Matchstick Men, Heat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Most Successful Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films directed by Steven Spielberg tend to fall into two categories. On the one hand we have large-scale action blockbusters like "Jaws", "Jurassic Park", "War of the Worlds" and the Indiana Jones films. On the other, there are those would-be Big Movies about Big Subjects like racism ("The Color Purple", "Amistad"), war ("Empire of the Sun", "Saving Private Ryan"), the Holocaust ("Schindler's List") and life after death ("Always")."Catch Me If You Can", however, does not fall easily into either category. It is a light-hearted comedy based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who, while still in his teens, successfully impersonated a Pan-Am pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and who managed to dishonestly obtain millions of dollars through cheque fraud. He was so skillful that after his arrest and imprisonment the FBI secured his release on parole so that he could work for them as a counter- forgery expert. He is today a millionaire, having made his fortune as a consultant advising banks on how to counter cheque forgery.This was the first film which really convinced me that Leonardo DiCaprio could act. Previously I had not always been his greatest admirer; he struck me as an untalented pretty-boy when I first saw him in "Titanic", and there was little in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", "Romeo and Juliet", "The Beach" or "Gangs of New York" to persuade me to change my mind. Here, however, he was able to turn his boyish good looks to good use. He was 28 when the film was made, but always seems credible as a teenager- an important point, as Frank's youth is a vital element in the film.The film is set in the 1960s, the period which has gone down in popular culture as the Age of Youth or the Age of Rebellion. (This is emphasised by the animated opening title sequence, a witty pastiche of those favoured by sixties filmmakers). Frank's form of rebellion, of course, is rather different to those who were protesting against Vietnam or in favour of the legalisation of cannabis, but he can nevertheless still be seen as a youthful rebel. The main influence on him is his father Frank Abagnale Sr, a businessman who has got into trouble with the authorities because of a series of tax frauds, which have led to the family living in poverty and to the breakdown of his marriage. Frank Jr sees his father as being the victim of unjust persecution by the authorities, and resolves to continue his father's war against "the system". It is notable that Frank Jr is from a broken home, as divorce and family breakdown seems to be something of a Spielberg trademark. (Ray Ferrier, the protagonist of "War of the Worlds", is for example a divorcée).DiCaprio here succeeds in the difficult task of making a criminal seem sympathetic. It helps, of course, that Abagnale's crimes were non-violent and that his main victims were large corporations, but the main reason why he is the hero of this film and not the villain is his youth. What in an older man would seem like rank dishonesty becomes, in a teenager, an almost admirable nerve and daring. Frank carries off his deceptions with such style and aplomb, remarkable in one so young, that we see him as a likable rogue rather than a villain.There is a curious relationship between Abagnale and Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent charged with tracking him down. Whereas Frank is quick-witted and formidably intelligent, Hanratty seems slow and plodding. Although Frank outwits him on a number of occasions, Carl continues to pursue him with dogged determination. Although the two men are on opposite sides of the law, there is nevertheless a bond between them. Both are loners; Hanratty is obsessively dedicated to his work, although he is well aware that bank fraud, his specialist area, is not regarded as glamorous or particularly important by his colleagues in the Bureau. A curious ritual develops whereby Frank calls Carl every year on Christmas Eve. It is perhaps unsurprising that the two eventually become friends after Frank's release from jail.DiCaprio receives good support from Tom Hanks as the dogged Hanratty, Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen in a cameo role as the father of Frank's girlfriend Brenda. (She is a nurse in the hospital where he is posing as a doctor). The film may not have the moral worthiness of some of Spielberg's Big Subject movies, but it is witty, stylish, fast-moving and often amusing. In my view it is Spielberg's most successful attempt at comedy. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Steven Spielberg-Tom Hanks pair are known for making one of the most entertaining movies on Earth. Their movies are generally long in duration, very narrative, simple and most importantly very entertaining. Some of the great examples of their movies are: Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal and now Catch Me If You Can. Steven Spielberg's unpredictable story idea together with Tom Hanks raw talent make an Oscar worthy combination.I had always wanted to watch this flick ever since I read about it back in 2002. I never came across any of it's television broadcast. So finally out of frustration I bought the DVD. Catch Me If You Can is about a character called Frank Abagnale Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who starts cheating on people and in the course of time becomes the biggest conman of USA. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an FBI detective who is determined to put an end to Abagnale's activities. After being duped by Abagnale at a hotel, Carl gets an idea about the perfection of Abagnale in duping people.Every actor in this movie is flawless. I was really impressed by Leonardo's performance first as a troubled young student and later as a full blown conman. Tom Hanks together with Christopher Walken adds spice to the movie. Tom's presence in any movie sets the mood of the audience. Martin Sheen is good too but his screen time is very less. Amy Adams was very natural in her acting. Spielberg really picks up the right actor for the right role.Catch Me If You Can is a great light popcorn flick with heavy emotions. It sets the tempo right from the beginning.</fullReview>

Especially I liked Leonardo so much! I just couldn't stand him before, you know! So, this movie completely changed my mind about both Leonardo DiCaprio and 50-60's movies.

		<shortDescription>Fun Movie with Great Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't really go wrong with a film from Steven Spielberg. I can't really think of a bad film the man has ever made, so you know to expect quality when you watch his movies; this 2002 Christmas release is no different. Inspired by a true story, the film follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the greatest con artists the United States has ever seen. Abagnale had posed as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer before he turned 21, cashing more than $2 million in fraudulent checks.Jeff Nathanson based the screenplay on the book of the same name, written by Abagnale himself. The story covers so much and moves so fast, yet it never loses the audience or stumbles over itself. In the capable hands of Spielberg, the movie drives on at a good pace and keeps the audience interested throughout. In the end, it's the character of Abagnale that makes the movie so entertaining. At the time, I hadn't cared a whole lot for Leonardo DiCaprio in the past but this movie changed that a bit. DiCaprio was a fan of Abagnale's book before the film ever came about, so his passion for the material shines through his performance. He also had great chemistry with Tom Hanks, who plays the FBI agent on his trail. We also get a strong supporting performance from Christopher Walken as Frank's father; despite his minimal screen time, it was enough to make an impression (and win some awards).Knowing Spielberg spares no expense, you can also expect great production design. With the film set in the 1960's, it made for some colorful scenery. The movie does run a bit long (a little over two hours) but it isn't painful. It's a fun movie and Spielberg doesn't let you down; all I can do is recommend you check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DiCaprio + Spielberg = Sheer brilliance. Catch Me If You Can is another awesome flick by the legendary Steven Spielberg. And DiCaprio's top notch performance as the brilliant con master combined with Tom Hanks' amazing performance as the committed FBI agent illuminated the already shiny film. The film from beginning to end is filled with suspense and tense chase scenes. And the fact that it was set in the sixties gave it an archaic and classical touch. I admire and respect DiCaprio even more now. His tremendous acting skills are advancing with each passing film and we expect to see more from him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways a rather slight film, Catch Me If You Can takes on considerable weight by virtue of the quality of the contributions made to it by its actors, writers, and director.Tom Hanks and Leonardo di Caprio are always credible as the young fraudster and his dogged FBI pursuer and deliver performances of solid commitment, only to be outshone by Christopher Walken. The relationship between Walken (father) and di Caprio (son) is at the heart of this movie. The other cast members are all very good, too.Which is not to say that the events covered aren't attention grabbing too. One watches open-mouthed at the effrontery, nerve, ingenuity, and sheer gall exhibited by someone who realises at a very young age that, if you're going to lie, lie big.The 60s period detail feels authentic throughout.This film was engaging, both in the everyday sense of being entertaining, but also in the sense that it fully engaged me throughout its 135 minutes running time. It wasn't a film I was in a hurry to see, but I now wish I hadn't waited so long! Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy, stirring drama - well done Spielberg, Di Caprio and Hanks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken star in this clever comedy by Steven Spielberg, based on the somewhat-true story of Frank Abagnale, a young American con-man.I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film! I have never heard it praised in conversation, although I haven't heard it condemned either. It seems merely to have been released and then quickly faded into the dominant space of popular consciousness - sheer indifference. My low expectations were blown out of the water, however, as I found this film very engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking.Di Caprio, as he so often does, provides a great visual hook in this film. Don't watch it expecting eye-candy; he plays a very lost 17 year old boy for the most part, and even if he is very successful with the ladies on screen, the camera views him as the boy he is, and therefore so does the audience. His performance is wonderful, and certainly pulled at my heartstrings. The character is brazen, reckless, selfish, irresponsible and deceitful, and yet never fails to win our sympathy. Likewise Tom Hanks is extraordinarily likable as a cop with no sense of humour, charisma, or incredible intelligence. Full credit to the actors for their ability to play deeply flawed characters with perfect empathy.Catch Me If You Can is also thoroughly enjoyable for its charming visual style. The film is set in the 60s, and the immersion is complete. One of the bonuses of watching a tried-and-true director like Spielberg is that no expense is spared, and the bright and colourful sets and costumes are a great compliment to Frank's bold attitude, as well as being useful in their absence when muted down for more intimate scenes.This film is charming in its humour and moving in its empathy, and really highlighted the subjectivity of our sense of justice. I think this is a great testament to the wonderful diversity of Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating story made more so by the fact that it is based on actual events in the life of an actual person. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in this film - his first complete display of the truly sophisticated acting for which he has now come to be known, playing Frank Abagnale Jr.'s youthful awkwardness &amp; uncertainty seamlessly beneath his cunning conman facade. Tom Hanks plays the perfect foil, giving his character believable tenacity, smarts, and the gritty pallor of a long-suffering public servant. The score was just wonderful - and the cinematography is easy to overlook in a story as compelling as this, but it would not have been so compelling without it.Brilliantly played &amp; written, based on an utterly fascinating life. I can't recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Catch me if you Can, (Christmas 04) I was a little put off by it. My Dad said he didn't find it an enjoyable film, and that it was not one of Spielberg's better works. However, I am pleased to say I found the film immensely enjoyable, and would class it as one of my favorite films of all Time.The cinematography is great, acting is superb, and the music is a lovely piece.Although not sounding like your typical John Williams score, the music is another fantastic delivery from Mr. Williams. Not only does it make a great movie score, but it also makes good music to listen to in general (As opposed to pieces such as Star Wars and Superman.) Spielberg still continues to make good films, fun for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I had watched this movie I was really surprised because it is a nonfiction. The real person who is the main character had lived long times ago. This movies talks about the story between a detective(Tom Hanks) and a smart criminal(Leonardo Dicafrio). This criminal is genius. He just passed the bar examination and the medical one even though he had not studied for it. Before he took these tests, he just had saw the movie which is based on the lawyer's life. And also he became the pilot of airplane company which was very famous at that time. As he was a genius, he knew how to make the fake money so, he did it in German. In his life there have been always a detective. In spite of that a detective tries to catch him, he was used to flee out except for once but, anyway, a criminal was released from prison. At the final, detective finally caught him, from that time, a criminal got a new job which to classify the fake money in the police. Yes, it is unbelievable. How could he become the one of police even though he had been a criminal? That is why i was surprised after I had watched it. While I was watching this movie I just said "wow" and I ,indeed, wanted to be like this criminal. He is really smart so I was jealous of him. No matter what other people says, just watch this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I saw it, I was twelve or thirteen with my boss and co-worker at a volunteering job. I didn't like it at first, but now I enjoy it. Leo Dicaprio plays sixteen year old Frank Abagnale Jr., a son of a French mother and an American father. He loves his parents dearly but can't stand the fact of his parents divorcing. The only thing he can do is run away from it. He imitates a school reporter, a pilot, a doctor, and then a lawyer which eventually gets himself caught with the biggest detectives of the United States. Tom Hanks plays the agent who chases him on the run knowing his true identity while the rest of the world thinks he's a thirty something thief.I'd give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a very mischievous person and I like to watch movies like that. Leonardo DeCaprio's character fools everyone. It's not all fun and games though, it has a really good plot with his family and the detective following him around. DeCaprio's character sort of reminded me of Johnny Depp's character on Pirates of the Caribbean. That is only because they both fool everyone to get what they want and it's funny to watch. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean I would recommend this movie. Tom Hanks did another excellent job as the detective. They pulled together a great cast.

		<fullReview>Forget morality. Most people want to see somebody beat the system -- no matter how he does it -- a winner! That why the movie-going world loves a con artist, especially if he's a young Adonis with a soft heart and a winning smile who exudes charm and cool sophistication. This sympathetically told true story shows how one teenager, skillfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio, did it with daring bravado.The unlikely villain in this story is a kid who's traumatized by catching his mother cavorting with another man, which is soon followed by divorce. Unable to choose which parent should be his guardian, he runs away and applies both natural gifts and lessons learned from the playful deviousness of his skeptical father (who's just experienced financial ruin) to become America's most notable impostor, wangling serial employment as a cop, pilot, doctor, and lawyer. The skill acquired from learning how to forge a fake identity and bogus credentials give him the ability to forge checks -- filling suitcases with millions of dollars and a James Bond sort of life to go with it.This film has many interesting contrasts. Pitting the plodding, joyless purposefulness of a rigidly moral FBI agent (Tom Hank's character) against the capricious cunning of a light hearted con gives a nice edge to this story. And the superb roles played by the best of the best character actors, Sheen Sr. and Christopher Walken (the father), add meaning and levity.Steven Spielberg and his star-studded cast lived up to their billing with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Spielberg did an excellent job of developing the characters and the casting of DiCaprio, Walken and Hanks in their respective roles brings this true story to life. You are tempted to feel pity for the father played by Walken but you realize that he is a malcontent who finds it difficult to take responsibility for his own actions. DiCaprio is perfect as the charming young con artist and complements Hanks character as the FBI agent as the plot moves from one twist to another. The plot provides a great mix of drama, tragedy, suspense, humor and fantasy. The soundtrack provides many well-placed tunes of that era including the sexy voice of Dusty Springfield singing "The Look of Love" which in my opinion should have won Oscar for best song in Casino Royale but lost to "Talk to the Animals" in Dr. Doolittle - go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With 'Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unseen Cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has a style, a straight forward telling of a story. There is something middle class and suburban about his films. The temperament of the protagonists, their concerns is essentially middle-class whether the actors are soldiers of D Day or doomed Jews of Europe; their world, the well-to-do burgher world has crumbled. He doesn't write these scripts, but he certainly puts his stamp on them.DiCaprio is very convincing, playing a teen, and then in turn, playing an older man whether doctor or pilot. I think that is a neat trick. I've always thought that actors are the weirdest of all artists and possibly the dumbest in real life, but I digress. Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con. The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle. His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life. DiCaprio is attracted to criminality, a "Paper Hanger," living in the swinging late 60's with a suitcase full of ill-gotten cash. Tom Hanks, the stodgy FBI man is on his trail, but the boy is just too fast. He can only be caught if he wants to be caught. I digress again. Mr. Spielberg is not Alfred Hitchcock, but he learned a lot from watching Hitch's work. Keep the plot moving by the illusion of unseen cruelty, the shaking chandelier or invisible shark. Hitchcock fans know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming film, with superb performance by Walken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From 1963 to 1969 Frank Abignale Jr made the FBI ten most wanted list by performing awe inspiring confidence scams and stealing millions of dollars by forging cheques.Catch me if you can tells the story of teenage Frank (Dicaprio), as he flees a broken home and sets off to gain enough money to rebuild his family. Frank sees the respect that certain professions command and manages to successfully pass himself off as a Pilot, Doctor and a Lawyer, (all, in part, to impress his father). He soon gains the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty, (Hanks) who hunts him for years and gradually develops a near fatherly fondness for him.Dicaprio gives an outstanding performance that firmly establishes him as perhaps the finest actor of his generation. He perfectly blends a charismatic, cocky teenager with deep down fragility and emptiness that was caused by his parents split. The gut wrenching choose a parent scene strikes home to all of us how traumatic a parental divorce must be. The character development is spot on, from goofy teen to a worldly con man that can no longer distinguish between truth and fiction.Hanks does well, playing a bookish FBI everyman with a touch of a sinister 1950s man in black. However Christopher Walken, as Frank's father, is superb and lifts the father son scenes from over sentimental Spielberg tosh, to highly charged and touching encounters. An award worthy performance that will have you blinking back the tears.The delightfully nostalgic opening credits set the tone for this charming film that is genuinely heart-warming and fun. The trailer is misleading as this is not fast paced chase film, but a dark, character driven, true story that will have you hooked from the first few scenes. Dicaprio oozes charm, whilst at the same time showing a vulnerable, lonely side that will have you routing for him every step of the way. It is possibly 20 minutes too long, and it feels as though the last few scenes were tacked on at the end. However the end scene pulls the whole story together and gives the film a completeness that will have you smiling as you leave the cinema. An engaging and touching tale about a boys wish to be part of a family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting chase movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his parents separated and he had to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. ran away from home. He warned his money from cashing fabricated cheques, posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor. As the numbers went up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty started tracking him in a cat and mouse game. Based on a true story, I think this is a good film. The plot starts from the end and jumps back to see why and how Frank Abagnale Jr. was captured by Carl Hanratty. It is the reason why the two hours goes by very quickly. The presentation is good. The opening credits impressed me and attracted me to continue watching this film. I also enjoyed watching the exciting game of cat and mouse. The cast is good as all of them acted very well. I think DiCaprio is good, he acted well and he made a lot of expressions. Hanks has also done a good work. His character is quite dull but I really thought that he did better than DiCaprio. Both of them gave a fine performance. On the whole this film is an interesting chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story. This film was excited and interesting to let me staying on the seat for two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Each individual director has his own unique style. Whether including a specific type of shot, or links to past films, there is always something unique to directors. The same is true of legendary director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg's films always tend to have an almost childlike feel to them. Often feel good films, Spielberg will create a film which, irrelevant of subject matter, always has a colourful style of imagery and background. In "Catch Me If You Can", Spielberg repeats this style with a clever little film telling the story of Frank Abagnale Junior.From the very beginning of the film, Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio) is shown to be a clever boy. Learning skills from his father (Christopher Walken), Abagnale slowly begins to learn how to copy cheques and over the next two years spends his time travelling from location to location, conning his way into different professions. All the time however, Frank is followed by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).When Steven Spielberg directs a good film, the man directs a VERY good film. Able to create an almost cartoon like world, Spielberg manages to grip us from start to finish. Whilst the opposite is true and Spielberg can sometimes create the most appalling work, with films like "Catch Me If You Can", we can perhaps forgive his mistakes.From the opening animation of the film, we know the basic premise. As Abagnale travels from place to place, there are moments of pure brilliance as this quick witted boy (since he's not even 17 when he begins the journey) outfoxes Hanratty time and time again.The connection between Abagnale and Hanratty in particular is what makes this film. With two well developed characters, both DiCaprio and Hanks give brilliant performances as we begin to bond with both characters. Superbly assisted by Christopher Walken and a few other actors, the two stars thrive in this fun little film.The beauty of "Catch Me If You Can" is the partnership of the main stars and the direction of Spielberg. Working brilliantly together, these three men and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, have examined Abagnale's story of his life and produced a great film which remains fun from start to finish. Great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When real life becomes fantasy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg returns to what he does best with this take on the true story of Frank Abegnale Jr, (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was convicted for dozens of cases of check fraud and assuming false identities before the age of 25. And a true story it may be, but all of Abegnale's daring deeds and frantic escapes are oversimplified in this telling - everything he does seems too easy and natural for him. Showing the difficulty the real Abegnale would have had to endure would add some realism and make the tale less of a fantasy escape, which is what it ultimately ends up as. But for a fantasy escape, there is some real drama infused into the story, especially with the strange yet fascinating relationship between Abegnale Jr. and Sr, and Frank Jr. realizing that he can't just settle down to marry his girlfriend Brenda (Amy Adams) who knows him under a different identity, since he is being constantly hunted by the authorities. And near the end, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gradually warms to his query Abegnale, despite all the trials and frustrations he has been put through - an unexpected and much appreciated reversal of character.DiCaprio does a good portrayal of Abegnale Jr. as he starts out confident and full of energy, while slowly descending into virtual paranoia, always looking over his shoulder and devising new ways to once again prevent capture. Tom Hanks also gives a strong performance as Carl Hanratty, the driven officer determined to catch Abegnale Jr. and bring him to justice. Yet they are both in danger of being overshadowed by notorious scene stealer Christopher Walken, in an Academy Award nominated performance, playing Abegnale Sr. the idol of his criminal son. Walken is truly affecting as he slowly comes to terms that he isn't as invincible as he thought, as his wife leaves him and everything he possesses is steadily taken by the government as he continually neglects to pay taxes. But his frequent self-confidence boosting sayings ("Two mice fell into a bucket of cream. One gave up and quickly drowned, but the second kept struggling and churned the cream into butter. Right now, I am that second mouse") give his son (and perhaps himself as well) the impression that he's on top of his situation.It's an excellent package, with John Williams' excellent 50's style score beautifully complementing Spielberg's work. It may be lighter and less realistic than it could have been, but Catch me if you Can is without a doubt, a lot of fun to watch, which is all it really needed to be.-9/10</fullReview>

Movie has Spielberg humor, Spielberg pace and Spielberg commitment. The scene in which Dicaprio takes off on an air plane and hanks watches the aero plane is a very difficult scene to direct but is shot so smoothly that it doesn't even attract the attention.

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is a very fine take on a true story. It brings together three of Hollywood's biggest names ? Di Caprio, Hanks and Spielberg ? in a collaboration that is certainly no pretender.Frank Abagnale Jr. and Stan Redding, "Catch Me If You Can" is the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage boy growing up in 1960s New York who ran away from home following his parent's divorce and made a living out of slyly and meticulously impersonating a doctor, a co-pilot for Pan Am airlines, and a lawyer. Hot on his trail but seemingly always one step behind is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows to admire and respect Frank's clear brilliance despite having only met him once. Told in elongated flashbacks as Frank is being escorted by Hanratty to an American prison, Frank had cashed more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks around the world and in all fifty states by the time he was caught at the age of 19.As if Spielberg hasn't shown himself to be the foremost American cinematic storyteller yet, Catch Me If You Can solidifies his position. This is the kind of film that reminds you of the absolute enjoyment of watching a great story in the hands of a great director and cast working with a love for the cinema that radiates from off the screen. But let's get one thing straight: Spielberg doesn't automatically make great movies because he's a great director; he's a great director because he has the ability to make great movies. Catch Me If You Can is one of them.Overall: 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fascinated by the very original introductory credits and some of the best graphics in years. It grabbed my immediate interest and augured well for what was to follow.The film itself is based on a series of serious criminal offences perpetrated by a young man called Frank Abagnale. The eventual outcome of his years of crime is nothing short of miraculous...almost unbelievable were it not for the fact that the events actually happened.The dramatic theme is handled with a very light touch...even with a sense of comedy at times. Leonardo Di Caprio excels as the anti-hero giving us quite an arresting performance. His role suggests that if you wish to impersonate someone the donning of a uniform ensures you are half way there.It is interesting that Tom Hanks was happy to play a supporting role. Despite his capable interpretation of the CIA agent, it is Leonardo's part as the lying,cheating, fraudulent impostor that will be remembered.To some extent some of the situations are repetitive and the film may be a trifle long, but I have to admit that there is a surge of interest in the end with an unpredictable aftermath of his life of crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge Spielberg fan but I think he has made some of his best work to date in the last couple of films he has made. Minority Report was surprisingly very good and Catch Me If You Can was just excellent. Touching upon a story like Frank Abergnale's is very daring as he had never done anything like this before. He knows about War, UFO's and Sharks but this is more of a story than special effects which Spielberg usually don's on.Frank Abergnale is a young man in a broken family. His Father Frank Abergnale Sr played wonderfully by Christopher Walken is somebody who has never been able to grab something and keep hold of it. He is bankrupt and can't do anything without the finance people picking up on it first and he feels he has disappointed his son in showing him how it is done. Frank Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio is fed up of family life as all his parents ever do is argue. Frank decides to leave home and live his life in a way that we all want to. He is clever, good looking, charming and very much a con man in every way by interoperating a Air Line Pilot, a Lawyer and a Doctor. After a while of partying and enjoying a life which is really a fake it doesn't take long for the FBI to be on his trail led by Carl Han ratty played hilariously by Tom Hanks. That is when the film really starts into a cat and mouse chase between the two leads. As well as being very dramatic and intense we also explore the emotional turmoil from frank's Jr sheltered life as on the way through all his scamming he really has no one around to love. This is what I admire in Spielberg's directing. He knows how to get a cracking performance out of somebody but he also has a lot of characterization which I think is rare in some of his films but you also see it in Schindler's List and ET but you see it more here. One of Spielberg's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, enjoyable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Steven Spielberg-directed Catch Me If You Can (CMIYC) is an enjoyable, funny movie with a great cast and plot. Based on the true story, the movie follows a few years in the life of Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio), who runs away from home and imitates many professions, from a school teacher, to a doctor, to a lawyer, making millions of dollars along the way. Always on his trail is Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent whose mission is to catch Frank. The movie features the cat-and-mouse chase between Frank and Carl, including the twists and turns.Spielberg has made a great film that was good to watch. The actors did well in their roles, particularly DiCaprio and Hanks. There were a few laughs and many bits of romance. CMIYC is a fun sort of film that many people can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank W. Abagnale, Jr.: The Great Pretender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" tells the amazing story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., a clever con man who posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and forged over $4 million in checks in the process. The story was directed by Steven Spielberg, and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. Tom Hanks plays Agent Carl Hanratty, the tenacious F.B.I. agent who stayed on Abagnale's trail, in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. DiCaprio manages to bring charm to his role, while Hanks gives a straight-laced performance. And the opening credits, done in retro-style animation, makes for excellent eye candy. It's not quite the sort of thing you'd expect from Spielberg, but it's definitely worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting Away With Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, first I'd like to comment how easy it is to lure spectator into this movie, due to the great names involved in this project. Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken are what made me wanna see it. To be honest, the film as a whole is good. Frank Jr. is a guy who is willing to do anything in his power to make easy money, even if it means stealing and cheating all around. There are plenty of moments in which the spectator gets to think "he won't get away with it", but, surprisingly, the well written plot always allows him escaping from the FBI. However, sometimes the way DiCaprio's character gets away feels over-the-top, considering that people wouldn't be THAT dumb in real life. I mean, how would Frank Jr. work as a physician in a hospital without EVER being asked about diseases or something related to it? Wouldn't Brenda's family make questions involving medicine? So, in my opinion, "Catch Me If You Can" is a well directed movie that entertains the spectator for the whole time, but sometimes admits to be just a movie and not a real thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Filmmaker's Dream-Come-True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fact-based story about con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. is a filmmaker's dream-come-true because it's absolutely incredible, outrageously funny and features an extraordinary protagonist. Based on his autobiography (which he wrote with Stan Redding), it charts Abagnale's exploits as a teenager who made millions of dollars through cheque fraud, travelled extensively at no cost to himself and assumed a number of fake identities with such success that he quickly achieved a glamorous lifestyle, great personal wealth and the attentions of numerous young women. Inevitably, his activities also attracted the attention of the FBI and led to him getting involved in a protracted cat-and-mouse game with one of their agents.Frank enjoys a perfectly happy upbringing in New Rochelle, New York until his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), starts to experience problems with the IRS over some unpaid tax and can't raise a loan to cover the shortfall. As a result, Frank Sr. loses his retail business, his car and his home and has to move his family into a small apartment. Soon after, Frank's French mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) has an affair with one of Frank Sr's fellow Rotarians and this leads to the collapse of their marriage and the painful divorce that follows. Frank is devastated by the loss of his happy family life and runs away from home.Frank looks older than his age and in his new circumstances, soon discovers that he has a natural ability to perpetrate cons by masquerading as an airline pilot and forging various documents and cheques. The wealth and respect that he gains through his activities give him a great deal of confidence and so, when FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) catches up with him at a hotel and confronts him at gunpoint, Frank simply claims to be a Secret Service Agent who'd also been pursuing the elusive Mr Abagnale Jr. and walks away from the premises before Hanratty realises that he's been duped.Frank goes on to pose as a doctor at a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia where he meets and falls in love with a sweet young nurse called Brenda (Amy Adams) who wears braces on her teeth and is worried about losing her job. When he meets Brenda's parents, he claims that he's also a qualified lawyer, like her father Roger (Martin Sheen) who's a district attorney and then gets taken on as Roger's assistant. Numerous surprising developments follow before Frank is eventually given an opportunity to rehabilitate himself in a most unexpected way.Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating character and Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely shines in this role as it fully exploits his ability to be charismatic and funny whilst also subtly hinting at the vulnerability and sadness that remain with Frank as a result of his parents' divorce. The surprising relationship that he develops with the rather dull and humourless Hanratty is also an enjoyable feature of the story and becomes quite credible because of the grudging admiration that the FBI man has for Frank and the common ground that they share (both having lost their highly valued family lives). In a movie full of top class performances, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams all make a tremendous impression.The 1960s-type opening credits do a great job of establishing the period within which the action takes place and also signal the playful, upbeat style of presentation that contributes so strongly to all the fun that follows. As a highly amusing "stranger the fiction" story, "Catch Me If You Can" not only has a huge appeal that crosses many demographics but also, with its family drama, comedy and moments of suspense, provides such rich entertainment that it's no surprise that it did so well at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING TRUE story with SPIRITUAL CHOICE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actors Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio have been playing protagonists so naturally as if they were that characters themselves! I like the very beginning. TV watchers supposed to find out a true Frank among three men. I especially enjoyed the question from the interviewer regarding a CHOICE. The question has been addressed to the first Frank, the fake one.Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg decided to address to a real Frank a NEW question and missed an opportunity to make the play stronger by giving a "chance" to answer: " I didn't have any choice."By answering that, the real Frank would have gained an extra dose of mystery, which is always good for a thriller, and he might have also gotten some additional sympathy from the audience. In short, it would have added a few cents to the character development.That answer would have been a powerful attention grabber for the watchers, who would be waiting for an explanation, and the interpretation would come through the story itself.Now, why didn't the real Frank have any choice?This is what we see in the movie:The boy was thrown into turmoil due to the divorce of his beloved parents. Thrashing between mom and dad, Frank, to avoid an emotional storm, runs away from both of them. After this point, he has been pushed to do what he could for survival, without being given any choice. The teenage boy started to face the cruelty of the materialistic reality - each independent step is costing MONEY. Already, before his parents' divorce, we observe that Frank had a high self- defense "mechanism" ? episode of his transformation into a school-teacher. Using the inheritance from his father ? the "mice pray" and the empty bank checks, Frank, thanks to his cleverness, is gaining success, ensuring his physical and emotional survival.As a matter of fact, he faces a real CHOICE and hesitation of a decision in the end of the movie. Frank is supposed to decide - whether to continue with the FBI or to shift to the illegal "free style" life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a typical spielberg movie, but enjoyable (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching this movie, despite it features one of my least favourite actors, Leoanrdo Di Caprio. Tom Hanks gives a good peformance, although, compared to his performance in 'Saving private Ryan', it sucked.The movie has an excellent twist, as we see how the main character 'Frank Abagnale' cons thousands of people, when he relentlessly continues to pay for expensive purchases, when the amount cannot be obtained from his account. Although I thought the film in general was fairly good, it didn't seem to be a movie made by Spielberg. To me, Spielberg seems to create superb master pieces again and again, for example; Schindler's list, and saving private ryan; and, this film seemed to be directed by a more novice director.Having said that, the characters, acting and dialogue are very good, and the movie concludes with a big thums up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth catching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie received a lot of hype when it came out, but I never got the chance to see it until this week (courtesy once again of the library, thank you very much). I'd heard good things about it, and I figured any film that involved Spielberg and hanks would be worth a look.The movie chronicles the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man who sees his father's (Christopher Walken) slow descent into poverty and decides to help him by applying his particular kind of genius into a bold but extremely clever fraud scheme. Frank is soon passing himself off as a pilot for TWA, and his schemes only get bolder from there. Assigned to catch him is determined Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who lacks Frank's brilliance but makes up for it with dogged persistence.The movie is very skillfully handled. Spielberg has a number of terrific shots sprinkled throughout (the moment where Carl realizes he's actually spoken with Frank and didn't know it is classic), and the feel of the 60s is deftly captured. DiCaprio really does look like he's fifteen or sixteen through most of it, and all of the small subtle period details are captured. We're also shown a great deal more than we are told; while Frank is a genius, we are never told that, but we see how his schemes unfold, part accident and part inspiration, and we come to sympathize with him even though he is a criminal. In fact it's a testament to the skill of the writing and directing that although the characters are at odds with one another and have conflicting goals, we can somehow root for them both.Hanks is his usual excellent self, and his Carl is a character we immediately like, even if he is a bit gruff around the edges. DiCaprio surprised me because he fits into the role seamlessly; I've never seen him be this natural or effective before, and it gave me new respect for him as an actor (he really needs to stay away from period stuff). His performance is the more important one, because naturally the bulk of the film centers on him. Christopher Walken is also very strong as Frank's father, a man whose life slowly crumbles beneath him yet who never gives up fighting for something better (it's never made clear if he did anything wrong in his past to elicit such attention from the IRS, which normally would be a drawback but in this case is oddly effective). The rest of the cast is excellent too, and Martin Sheen gives a nice turn in a smaller role.In the end we see that Frank really could have been someone amazing had he just buckled down and worked for it ? that he did so well with so little is also a testament to his pluck and intelligence. But Spielberg and his cast manage to present an interesting and entertaining story that never lags and keeps us wrapped up in its twists and turns from start to finish. In the last few years Spielberg has made his share of lackluster films (AI, Minority Report) but Catch Me If You Can is not one of them. A strong effort from some gifted people at the top of their games, Catch is certainly worth a rental. It's a little long at two and a half hours, but it's certainly worth the investment of your time.One minor note: John William's score is extremely effective and one of his better works in recent years. It marries perfectly to the visuals and is simply outstanding.June 6, 2004</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some lighthearted family entertainment...... its a Christmas movie! Frank only calls Carl (Hanks) every Christmas. Spielberg can do sleight of hand, some very interesting camera angles. This movie was shot in 40 days or so if I'm not mistaken. Plants and payoffs... e.g. the necklace, the "two mice", Hanratty's issue of "not having a family", and the biggest one; how Frank passed the bar in Louisiana.The ultimate payoff for me were the arcs of both the protag and the antag. And its an ending thats satisfying, and brings closure to this comedy caper INSPIRED by a true story (save for the stuff they made up).Watch out for the Forest Gumping in the beginning of the movie. You can never know its CG. John Williams's score is great too, reminds me of PINK PANTHER. And the Saul Bass inspired opening is reminiscent of the flicks of yesteryears.Entertaining cineplex that's artful.Grade A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked 'Catch Me If You Can'. Now, I am willing to forgive Leonardo DiCaprio for all the bombs he's been in lately. I'm also willing to forgive Christopher Walken for the same reason. DiCaprio, Walken, and Tom Hanks are all strong in their performances. This is a very enjoyable Spielberg film. Now, granted, I've liked everything I've seen of Spielberg's work and have yet to see a bad movie by him. Also, the bouncy John Williams score is a nice touch. Another good performance is by Jennifer Garner as a "model". The story was good, directly told, and this movie is just an enjoyable two hours you can watch again and again. Really. You'll want to watch it again and again. I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the book and the film but thought the film could have included more of the books exploits such as him starting on his dad by ripping him off at the petrol place. The petrol place gave him money for things such as tyres, kept the items to sell and put the bill on the dads card. Thus he got money to spend on the ladies and his dad got a hefty bill. I thought Leonardo was an excellent choice to play the young conman seeming to fit the part. He just worked as frank. I thought people could have been more suspicious of the stewardesses and what he was doing with so many new stews but i guess they jusy thought lucky him. Basically i liked both the film and book a lot and would recommend both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the kid who ran away from home and became a con-artist. Frank successfully impersonates a co-pilot, a doctor and we find that he has other surprises up his sleeve. In the process, Frank uses over two million dollars via forged checks.In 'Catch Me If You Can', director Steven Spielberg strays away from his sci-fi explorations (AI, Minority Report) and gets back to the basics. By that I mean, that he makes a simple movie (no superlative heroes or special effects) that everyone can enjoy. The entire cast excels here. DiCaprio, uses charm and wit in his performance as the scheming Frank. Hanks is funny in his turn as a nerdy and obsessive FBI agent. Walken gives his strongest performances in years in a small, but pivotal, role as Frank's father.Even though the pace of the film slows a bit during the last third, it is still a witty and immensely entertaining film. This one's a real catch.Rating: (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With `Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, pity about the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this Steven Spielberg movie. Leonardo gives a wonderful performance - witty, amusing, moving etc, etc. But what on earth has gone wrong with the DVD? There isn't a single extra feature to accompany the film. I mean that literally. There isn't even a trailer, let alone a documentary about the making of the film, interviews with the actors, production team etc, let alone a director's commentary. This is unacceptable. If you charge full price for a DVD the viewer has right to expect more than just the movie. There's a serious point here. A lot of movie criticism is wrong. The press are often hostile and intrusive. Extra features on the DVD enable movie makers to restore the balance - to record under controlled conditions what was going on. Features enhance a viewer's understanding and enjoyment of a movie. When these are recorded at the time the movie is made they have historical value. Walt Disney pioneered documentaries about his movies in the 1950s. They give a wonderful insight into how his films were made half a century ago. Is it too much to expect that Steven Spielberg, who directed this film, can come up to date? By explaining what you're doing - or trying to do - you reach out over the heads of the know-all critics and widen your circle of understanding. In Disney's day making a documentary was expensive. Nowadays any member of the production crew can wield a video camera. There's no excuse. I feel cheated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Outrun Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler HereinThe movie "Catch Me If You Can" was very entertaining. This is a film based on a true story about a young man named Frank Abignale played by Leonardo Dicaprio. Frank at a very young age began to trick and outrun the FBI for quite a while before being caught. This film shows some of the escapades that happen while running from FBI agent Carl Handready played by Tom Hanks.A theme I found present through out the film is that no matter how hard or fast you run reality always has a way of catching up with you. Frank began his life of crime to escape the reality of his family. Frank's last fond memory before he began his life of crime was of Christmas time and Frank is reminded of this memory at the end of the film, before everything comes crashing down (or so he thinks). Another theme through out the film is that Frank was against labels. You can see how he rejects them figuatively and personally in his own life. One of the funniest moments in the film is full of the labels off of bottles and jars.High contrast lighting is used in the film on both characters at different times to highlight them in a scene. This technique can be seen in a few scenes and was very effective. This film's lighting was like that of "Chicago", while most of the lighting was played down, at important moments such as a running scene or court scenes I found its use to be imperative to both films.The relationship between the two main characters is the one constant in the film no matter how much running goes on. Both characters are loveable through their chase in the film and I found myself pulling for both. The fact that everything catches up to you in the end is through out the film and ties in nicely at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What more could you want? SPOILER INCLUDED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie I really wasn't excited about seeing at first. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo Dicaprio, and feel that Tom Hanks has kind of been shoved down my throat with his perennial Oscar nominations, but this movie made none of that matter. The two played off each other beautifully in this true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Dicaprio (as Abagnale), and Hanks (as FBI agent Carl Hanratty) are almost perfect foils for each other as the teenage genius con man, and the stuffy by-the-books agent trying to track him down. Part of the appeal of this movie was that it didn't really revolve around the old Hollywood cliche "money can't buy happiness", but rather delved into the question of how loneliness cannot be cures by money or social standing. Frank has all of the money that he would ever need in his life by the age of 17, but he can't stop pulling off scams, and he can't seem to settle down. This is emphasized very strongly by a scene in which Frank and Carl are talking on the phone on Christmas Eve, and Carl realizes that Frank really doesn't have anyone else to talk to except him. The lighting in this movie is brilliant (no pun intended), and it helps change not only the mood of some scenes, but gives an idea of which character is getting the upper hand on the other at that particular moment. Frank and Carl seem to deserve each other, even from the first scene that they are in together, in which Frank dupes Carl into letting him escape. That scene is one of my favorite initial confrontation scenes since Pacino and Williams in "Insomnia". From then on, Frank spirals downward, as he realizes that not being a pilot, doctor, or lawyer has made him any happier, and that all of his connections with people other than Carl are rather superficial. Ironically, after Frank is captured, and his friendship with Carl blossoms, he regains all of the money and social standing that he earlier had. So sometimes success can't buy friendship, but friendship can lead to success. All in all, this is a movie definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks is back in comedy mode after his heavy performances in Road to Perdition, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away as the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail, whilst having to cope with incompetent staff and getting colours mixed with his whites at the launderette.This is Speilberg's most enjoyable film for years, and acts as a kind of redemption from the downbeat work he's presented us with over the last ten years.</fullReview>

He was a master of deception, and a brilliant forger whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame. At the age of 17, Frank became the most successful bank robber in the history of the United States... FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) made it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank was always one step ahead of him. I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written, well thought out, and in the end, really fun to watch... and that is saying allot considering I can't STAND Leo Decaprio. Tom Hanks delivered a stunning performance, and all in all, I'm fond of his movies, as he's a great actor. I recommend this one for a rental, or as part of your personal collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not believe that this movie was a true story. Frank W. Abignale (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a smart kid. This movie was pretty funny too, I mean some of the ways Abignale tries to hide himself. Tom Hanks plays a good role as Carl Hanratty as well. It is weird hearing him with an accent, especially that kind. I enjoyed it though, I give it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an adaptation of the book written by Frank Abagnale Jr., at one time one of the top con artists/forgers in history. The film is a sharp intelligent chase between the FBI and Frank. Surrounded by excellent locations, dialogue, and an excellent John Williams soundtrack, you are mesmerized by the sheer confidence and extent to which Frank was capable of eluding the law and forging checks. At times, Frank seems more like an escape artist/magician than a criminal.One thing the film doesn't truly address is whether or not the immense losses suffered by the banks, truly affected any individuals or business in a long term manner. What it does show is how one step in the wrong direction can create a snowball effect that doesn't allow one to escape even when they want out. Frank, while living the life of luxury, somewhere along the line realizes that to live that life while being chased isn't going to work.Luckily, for him, he was very young when he made his mistakes, and being very intelligent he acquired and retained skill set invaluable to law enforcement agencies and security companies today. Frank was able to turn his mistakes into a good thing in the end. I would guess, and one would hope, that if he had to do it over again, he probably wouldn't have made the same choices.A very well done worthy of watching. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this film, not as anything significant or groundbreaking or fraught with deeper meaning. Oh no, I enjoyed it for what it was: A few hours of light, fun entertainment. I typically don't care for DiCaprio, perhaps due to the vehicles in which he was delivered to the public. Such blockbuster efforts require its actors to look impressive, acting takes a back seat. Hanks seems to play the same core character in every movie, with brow furrowed or raised depending upon the needs of the script. Walken suffers the same affliction, but his offbeat delivery usually works in his favor.My preconceptions made CMIYK that much more enjoyable when the principals in this film actually broke their molds. Here was Tom Hanks, the hardboiled G-man from birth. Here was Christopher Walken, the not-so-confident conman who almost always reaches the goal, or would if someone didn't keep moving that goalpost. And finally, Leonardo DiCaprio, a blueprint of the father he idolizes (and DiCaprio almost out-Walkens Walken here), a scheming engineer that takes the original idea and makes it "better".Does it have a happy ending? Well, yes, just as it did for the real life person from which this film takes its story. I didn't see it as unrealistic because if there's one thing I've learned the hard way, it's that any good con man will always land on his feet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Credibility is an odd thing - either you have it or you don't. And one of its key elements is believing you have it yourself. If you act in a certain way, people will respond in a certain way. This theme which was so beautifully portrayed in "Being There" is central to Catch Me If You Can. Early in the film, Frank Abagnale sees a pilot and notices that everyone around him adores and admires him, and most importantly, does not question him when he cashes a cheque. Solution: Become a pilot. All you need is lingo (which he gets by fawning over an airport official) and a uniform (which he cons his way into). From here, we get the story of one of histories great con men, who before his 23rd birthday has successfully convinced people he was a pilot and doctor and a lawyer and had passed $4,000,000 of bad cheques. It it s wonderful light and entertaining ride.Catch Me If You Can is a major accomplishment for most directors, but for Speilberg, it is like a weekend off - a movie he made to take a break from making movies. Not to say that it is bad - it is a chase movie with more laughs than most comedies and extraordinary attention to detail. It recreates the innocent, pre-Vietnam 60's beautifully, a time when an airline pilot had instant credibility and charm.The movies three leads, DiCaprio Hanks and Walken are all at the top of their game. Having fun with there roles while at the same time creating memorable characters we care about. FBI agent Carl Hanratty is a dry-as-toast career fed with little more in life than the crooks he chases, but still, Hanks gives him depth and a personality. Christopher Walken is perfect is an odd role for him as Frank Sr., the beloved and hapless father of the anti-hero lead, who never quite gets the breaks in life he wants or deserves. But In Abagnale Jr Leo Di Caprio creates a criminal character we cheer for. As I watched this film, I was simultaneously cheering for both the bad guy and the cop. A tad over long, but Catch Me If You Can is a movie worth watching, and even owning. ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light hearted look at life on the run!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" directed by Steven Spielberg is a light hearted look at a man's life as he tries to accumulate as much wealth as he can in order to replace the happiness that he has lost. Throughout the whole movie witty con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. played by Leonardo DiCaprio accumulates a lot of money, but is continually searching for the love, security and acceptance he lost when he was a teenager. While he is searching for these things he has a constant pursuer in FBI Agent Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks.DiCaprio ploys his trade as a con-artist to get what he wants in several ways, everything from being a pilot, a lawyer and even a doctor. All the while he continues to run from Hanks. While still a teenager DiCaprio runs away from his home, and finds that he is suddenly without anyone and anything, thus he begins his wild ride of dishonest fortune. While practicing his many trades DiCaprio has the time of his life getting the money and not to mention the girls. One such time he goes to a college to recruit girls to be flight stewardess. After he chooses the 'qualified' ones we then see him with a girl on each arm and the rest surrounding him with a huge smile on his face. However, his loneliness and searching for happiness is also seen several times in the film. For example several scenes that show this in the movie is when DiCaprio calls Hanks and just wants to talk with him. He does this just because Hanks is the one constant in his life that is always there. He has no one else around him and he is lonely.`Catch Me If You Can' has great use of lighting and coloring. In the movie when DiCaprio is living it up both the lighting and colors are light and bright giving off even more of a sense of happiness. When DiCaprio is down and lonely the lighting plays a big part and is kept darker, especially when he is in prison.`Catch Me If You Can' in a way reminds me of `Oceans Eleven'. Both of these movies look at the light hearted side of the criminal lifestyle and they both depart from the directors, Steven Spielberg and Steven Soderbergh, usual style of directing, yet both are great movies.This film shows off Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks great acting talents as they bring to life the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the drive home from the movie I found myself thinking about my life and compared it to the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. This movie is based on a true story. Frank's story is very intriguing and exotic. It is about a man that in the late 1960's that makes a living through fraud. He writes bad checks, imitates professionals such as doctor, lawyer, and airline captain. He made millions of dollars living this way. At this rate it will take me two or three lifetimes to make the money he made. He lived like a god for about 4 years. It makes me want to just try to make one big score. This movie is an inspiration to me to do `wrong' for profit. If only I could have one chance to make big money. I would go for it. Yeah right, I don't have the courage to do it. That is why movies exist. It is escapism for the average man, ME! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't like Leonardo in films after that disgrace known as Titanic was released (even though it didn't really have anything to do with him), however I'm glad that did not sway me from watching this movie.Possible SPOILERS: maybe, not sure yet.I like to keep it simple. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a slick counterfeiter/conman with Tom Hanks from the FBI always hot on his heels. Based on a true story. Frank had a troubled family life and after a surprising separation of his parents after his Mom has problems keeping her legs together. Frank loses it and decides to run away, only to return to visit his father, Christopher Walken, from time to time. I especially enjoyed Walken in this film. His relationship with his son, Leo, in the movie was rather realistic and reminded me of mine with my father. Walken fans will enjoy seeing him in this film, even though he doesn't play his normal evil self. I also enjoyed Hanks and Leo's relationship in the movie as it resembled a father son relationship. Frank cares for Carl(Hanks), and Carl cares about Frank, even though it is his job to catch him and throw him in prison. And you can't help but to admire how Frank always outsmarts Carl throughout the film.Being a Spielberg film, one can expect the typical happy ending. And although I normally don't buy into such fluff, it worked for me in this film. It has a few quirky moments, but overall it was a good effort and I would enjoy watching it again. If you like any of the cast in any of their other films, I recommend this movie. Overall, I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on DVD last night--what a pleasant surprise! Well, I can't imagine any movie with Spielberg as director and Tom Hanks/Leo DiCaprio as lead actors to be anything less than good, but not having seen the trailer to the movie nor read reviews of it I wasn't sure what kind of a film to expect. Knowing that this movie is based on real life events of Frank Abagnale Jr. makes it all the more enjoyable to watch, while I cannot stop myself from wondering how on earth he was able to pull it all off--as pilot, doctor, and lawyer. I'm sure he must have run into some difficulties at times with his pretense, yet he must have been able to react quickly and avert near-disasters until the time he's finally caught. I really liked his character as DiCaprio portrayed him, despite the fact that the essence of what he did was wrong. Tom Hanks, as usual, did an excellent job--I ended up liking his character as well even though he started off being rather dislikeable. Christopher Walken also wins high points for his portrayal as the senior Abagnale, bringing a certain dignity and believability to his character that wins our empathy in spite of his shady dealings and troubles with the IRS. In short, I ended up liking just about everything in this movie. It was a very well-presented story and a well-acted drama, with humour sprinkled in just the right amounts and at the right places, in my opinion. The pace is just fast enough to keep me entertained and thinking at all times, without loosing me in any overly convoluted subplots. Kudos to Spielberg for such a fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying piece of film-making!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not convinced such a painfully linear story deserves to be made into a feature film I must admit I SOMEWHAT enjoyed "Catch Me If You Can". And come to think of it, how could I not with Steven Spielberg, that cinematic equivalent of a diligent travel agent, planning out my trip along the shortest possible route from point A to point B. Staying true to what has long ago, with few exceptions along the way, become one of the main traits of his directorial opus - this movie, too, is unbelievably ordinary and unremarkable. Everything in it is on autopilot. No pun intended. We follow a straight and narrow path until a desired destination is reached without any turbulence. In the end justice is served, characters learn from their mistakes and the audience goes home happy.Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life story could've been a piece on '60 Minutes' or a subject of an hour long 'Dateline NBC'. Making it into a two and a half hour movie was pretty unnecessary.PS: I really don't like Tom Hanks' acting. He is so damn bland! If he were a beverage he'd be Diet Coke.</fullReview>

It stayed in my mind for days after and led me to do a bit of research on the real-life character. Apparently the movie stayed very close to the autobiography except for the father's character.

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for this film I didn't think it looked like anything spectacular. Although, I am a fan of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, so I wasn't going to miss this collaboration. I must say that I was definitely pleasantly surprised, the film was much more than I imagined and really quite fun.The story is just incredible, and what really blows my mind is that it's based on a true story. There also a great deal more to the story than the obvious, it's not just about a kid that breaks the law and eventually gets caught, there are a number of subplots that make the story infinitely more interesting. Not only is the story and subplots great, the but the characters, the portrayal of the characters and the chemistry between them are just perfect.Of course the great Steven Spielberg always puts on a great show, but this was particularly good. I think the best way to put it is that Spielberg really nailed the feel of this film right on the nose, and was very consistent in his style. I know there's been a few of his films that had certain scenes or lines that I felt were out of place or oddly placed, but this film didn't have anything like that, everything worked perfectly. Then there's the always great, Tom Hanks! A truly gifted actor, he ALWAYS puts on a good show and doesn't let you down here. Leonardo DiCaprio was an excellent choice for the role of Frank Abagnale Jr., and really nailed the role. He has the ability to look older or younger than he really is when needed, not an ability every actor has. Other cast members that should be noted are Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Nathalie Baye, and Jennifer Garner, all pulling off great performances.This is definitely a Spielberg film not to be missed. Do yourself a favor and make sure that you see this film. Even if you are like me and don't think that it looks terribly appealing, give it a shot, you may be surprised. There is virtually nothing I didn't like about this film, which is a somewhat rare thing for me to say. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-LebowskiT1000</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED**I was skeptical about this film, because I know how sappy Spielberg could be, and I am in no way a fan of DiCaprio. Although, after seeing this film, I'd have to admit that I enjoyed it. The appeal with this film, above all else in my opinion, is the facination you're forced to have with Dicaprio's character....just HOW did he get away with all of that!?!?! It didn't seem to me that Spielberg involved himself too much in this film, and I must admit that DiCaprio shines in his lead role. It seems that he is finally starting to come into his own as a decent actor. Christopher Walken (a favorite of mine) was great as always. Tom Hanks, suprisingly, was tolerable as well...it was refreshing to see him in a role where you're not forced to see him as an immortal, or always feel sorry for him. He played his role straight-up and I enjoyed him. The story was told very well, although I thought the film was a bit too long. One thing I didn't quite get though...whatever happened to the gameshow sequence in the beginning of the film? That was never explained. Anyway, this film is not a classic by any means, but was suprisingly good and I would recommend it to true fans of 'cinema'. 3 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny comedy/drama about a young kid who goes on a binge around the country posing as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Expertly directed by Steven Spielberg, this is one of his finest, and shows a side of him I didn't think was there.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr. and Christopher Walkin plays his father, Frank, Sr. The two are an absolute gas together. Senior's life is going down the tubes - his business goes under, the IRS is harassing him, and his wife leaves for another man. The happy home young Frank knows is no longer there. The father gives a healthy disrespect for the law and authority to his son, so young Frank decides one day to pose as an airline pilot. He learns how to make fake identifications and phony airline checks, and off he goes. In short time, he's living the lifestyle of a swinging bachelor, even though he's still a teenager. He gets away with it because he's a great con artist and thinks quick on his feet, and he's so good at producing fake payroll checks that the FBI is soon on his tail.Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent after DiCaprio, and he does his usual superb acting job, playing the agent as a determined loner. Without giving up the details, Hanks eventually catches the young man, who after exhausting his airline pilot facade has gone on to pose as a doctor in charge of an emergency room and then a lawyer. The kid is so good at what he does, that the FBI hires him in lieu of a stiff sentence so that he can teach them how criminals manipulate the banking system.This film is absolutely charming. The acting is great and the viewer is enthralled at the amazing exploits of this young criminal. Walkin in particular deserved an Oscar (he was only nominated for best supporting actor). His manic character and determination are the inspiration by which his son embarks on his adventurous life of crime. And after his disastrous performance in "Gangs of New York," it's nice to see DiCaprio rebound with a winner.</fullReview>

But the similarities go beyond that: this is another film about a young man, abandoned in a sense by his parents, fascinated by the adult world butunprepared for adult life, who slides into a life of deception.What's different? First and foremost, the happy ending. It's the truth, I suppose, and it's what we want, in that Abagnale is a likeable, very competent youngman, who succeeds where Doinel failed. Unfortunately that happy ending also negates what we see about this boy whowants to be anybody but himself. While he didn't need to remake The Grifters, a little less sunniness at the end might have made a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember ever seeing this in theaters, which probably shows my lack of attention. I certainly didn't expect what it was.I'm not a big fan of either DiCaprio OR Hanks, but in this movie they worked. The way the era was captured was convincing, and the performances by all of the supporting cast were great.This is one of the few recent movies I've enjoyed enough to actually buy on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is rather rare nowadays, it had classic style and it was very fun to watch. It is like a caper from the past translated perfectly for todays audience, slightly reminiscent of Ocean's 11. DiCaprio and Hanks both give good performances, and Walken does well in the limited showtime he receives. The screenplay was excellent, as well as the script writing. This is one that will be appreciated later on, if not by people today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a film by Spielberg that I can watch!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Spielberg. I have not enjoyed/hated every one of his films. Well, which is it? Not enjoyed or hated? Both. Before he became the KING of Gollywood his stuff was sentimental and boring. Over and over again I'd go see his films in the hope that somehow he'd risen above the lowest common denominator , or I'd sunk into the miasma of critical and popular American taste. He'd been able to trivialize slavery, the Holocaust and war in his view of the Normandy invasion. I only rented this because I was desperate to fill the two for one offer at my local DVD dealer. Add to this how I despise the American Everyman, Mr. Tom Hanks, (I tried to overlook that he [the latter day James Stewart] was in the film ]). I found myself chuckling. I found myself laughing. I found myself really enjoying a film, ONE, directed by Spielberg, and TWO, one in which, Tom (Jimmy) Hanks (Stewart) is one of the stars. This is a funny and entertaining film, no matter what I've said about the principles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch me if you can is an enjoyable film that has a certain something that you cant put your finger on.Perhaps it is the DeCaprio charm or maybe it is the Tom Hanks factor that makes this very watchable but dont be fooled into thinking this is as good as everbody says because it does have one very poor floor.The problem with Catch Me If You Can is that it is one of those film that starts at the end then goes back to the begining and keeps switching to the end again and this really spoils the movie. We dont want to know what happens at the start we want to find out at the end!Only films like Momento can pull this off and this is no Momento. The acting is good and i would say the best display is from Christopher Walken and we should see more from this highly underrated actor. All in all not a bad film but it could have had 20 minutes shaved off of it. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

I'm the type of guy who likes to plan a bank robbery just for the fun of it or to imagine I was very important person and got away with it by bluffing, and to me this film was all that. This clever boy travels across the world, charming the ladies and spending money, always keeping one step ahead of the cops in the most cunning way. I liked this film for its main character which is actually played well by Leo. And if you can recognize any of the above in your daydreams, it's a movie for you. Strait 9 from me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a delightful surprise !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I passed this by when I saw it on the racks because I had never heard of it and because 'Titanic' ruined Leonardo deCaprio for me. However I caught a trailer for it at the beginning of the film I wound up renting that day, and was intrigued. It was my subsequent rental, and turned out to be a delightful surprise, and one of the best movies I have seen lately.Right at the start, Spielberg is making a nostalgic gesture towards older days with the elaborate, whimsical title sequence. The title sequence became a whole deal unto itself in movies of the 60's &amp; 70's (take, e.g., Saul Bass's great work in this area for Alfred Hitchcock), but has pretty much disappeared nowadays. It was nice to revisit this experience, with John Williams' playful score augmenting the visuals. An auspicious start.DeCaprio's work here makes me revise my low expectations of him. He does a fine job here as the driven Frank Abagnale. Likewise for Tom Hanks as agent Handratty, my only complaint with whom is his phony Boston accent. The chemistry between the two is great.The excellent script and Spielberg's direction keeps the movie going at a good clip and definitely keeps us on the edge of our seat as we see Frank artfully keep one step ahead of the dogged Handratty. The film is richly textured as well. It works as a suspense/intrigue movie, but also shows us Frank's complex motivations and confused family life. It also skillfully interweaves some delightful moments of ironic humor. Mention must be made of Christopher Walken - a fine and underrated actor - who here does a superb job as Frank's well-meaning, but doomed-to-failure father. Walken does a great job of making us feel sympathy for this man who never seems quite able to get his life together, but whose intentions are always good. On the whole, an excellent movie which takes us back to simpler days when moviemakers found fascinating stories about interesting people and told them as entertainingly as they could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a charmer of a film this was. Leonardo DeCaprio was breezy,delightfully fun as the lead. and Tom Hanks, was perfect as the FBI agent chasing after him. The Knock, Knock line is a classic.But most importantly, the screenplay was truly outstanding. I can imagine the screenwriter having a BALL writing the script, enjoying himself immensely after he wrote, page, after page of clever dialogue, fun moments, and narrow escapes. I felt like I was living the experience along with the character.What can I say, that hasn't already been said about the director, Steven Spieldberg, he is beyond criticism at this point, although, I have found in his last few films, that he just doesn't know how to end them. A.I. went on for much too long, and the ending of Minority Report, well, it had about 3 different endings... With this film, the ending seemed to always be around the corner. But then again, it wasn't, I was ready for the movie to end at the airport, where much of it had happened symbollically, but then there was an extra scene... but with such a clever, magical script, I really didn't mind if it had kept on going.Catch it, if you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These characters are very lonely (SPOILERS INSIDE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is much darker than it seems to be on the outside.(SPOILERS AHEAD)!!Christopher Walken I think steals the show in his very limited role , allthough Tom Hanks and Leo do their parts convincingly.We see Frank's parents at the beginning at their home dancing and looking very much in love and happy, but things turn very quickly when Frank's mother starts to get involved with another man who was supposed to be a friend of the family ( can't trust anybody).Anyway Frank's parents are forced to divorce and Leonardo Di Caprios character Frank is forced to decide whether he wants to stay with his mom or dad by a simple check of a box on paper.Totally devastated by what is going on at home Frank decides to take the blank checks Frank's father gave to him and leave home on a life changing escapade of false identity and a search for meaning in his life.At certain parts I thought were very sad especially ,where Frank and his Dad meet up at certain points throughout the film to talk about Frank's false success in life.Christopher walken and Leo shine during these parts more than any other parts of the film.Frank still thinks material items will get his Mom and dad back together and that's just not how life works.The main reason imo Frank goes on this venture is to try and find a way for his parents to get back together through his material success through his false identities, But once reality hits and Frank finds out his Mom is remarried his whole world crashes once again and he wants out of this adventure , which is shown at the bar scene where he calls carl in an attempt to end this fiasco, you really see that Dicaprio's character is still just a young 17 year old kid at this part, very good acting here.We also find out throughout the film that Carl (Hanks character)is also a very lonely person ,he is a divorced man who hasn't seen his daughter Grace too much since the split and is also looking for a meaning to his life.Carl and Frank sort of build a subliminal bond throughout the film which comes together at the end.We see Frank towards the very end looking to run away from his problems again but once he finds out nobody is chasing him any more the game is over and decides to live a normal life.It's at this point again that the movie is very subliminally sad , Frank and Carl though not verbally mentioning it to each other actually look at each other and know that they have built sort of a father son relationship through this crazy ordeal and decide to become friends.Again a much darker film than perceived at first about loss and wanting things back to normal no matter what.Some holes but not enough to render the film , definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had passed by "Catch Me If You Can" a number of times at the video rental place before finally grabbing it this weekend. From the ads I had seen for it when it first came out, I figured it would be kind of shallow, boring, "family" entertainment. I stand humbled and corrected.I have a new appreciation for DiCaprio as an actor now, although his performance isn't Oscar-worthy, it is pretty damn good. Tom Hanks is OK, although I still can't quite figure out (a) what that accent is he's using (Boston?) and (b) where is he stationed? That seemed the biggest continuity problem to me. At first he seems like he's in New York or Washington, then maybe Atlanta, who knows? Minor point, however.Spielberg does a great job telling this story and making you actually care about the characters; my only beef is that I think he could have explored Carl's family situation a little more. I can see why he didn't, however, and, frankly, it doesn't distract from the movie too much. I would give this a 10, but Spielberg must still pay penance for that horrendous "A.I."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN REVIEW:OVERALL RATING: **** stars.This was probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of them, believe me. For some reason though, this movie really had me glued to me seat. The trailers made it look good, but it no way compared to how good the movie actually was.The acting in this movie is terrific, and probably one of DiCaprio's better films. I really liked how well Walken portrayed DiCaprio's father so well, I was really impressed considering some of the other movies he has been in.Catch Me If You Can is about Frank Abagnale, a man who posed as a doctor, a lawyer, and a pilot all before he was 18. Carl Hanratty however has discovered that he forges checks for over a million dollars and is on Frank's trail and wont stop until he finds him.I simply could not believe how good this movie was. I liked how it mixed drama and comedy all into one, and I was impressed with how well everything worked out.</fullReview>

So, it was original, and therefore, a worthwhile 2 hours of my time.I thought DiCaprio and Hanks were both good. Hanks is ALWAYS good. The only downside was the lack of interaction between them. Of course, there likely was little, if any, interaction between them in real life, but all movies based on a good guy and a bad guy are enhanced by the "relationship" between them.Otherwise, no complaints, just simple entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Catch Me If You Can was absolutely wonderful! I recently watched it for the second time and it was as lovely as I remembered it being in theaters. I have renewed respect for Leonardo DiCaprio- I had underestimated his acting ability after seeing things like Man in the Iron Mask and Titanic. I thought he beautifully portrayed the charismatic but treacherous Abignale. (Abagnale?) Tom Hanks, who is always impressive is a wonderful Carl Hanratty- achieving a perfect balance of emotions, you love him but hate his job. Dialogue is clever, the plot is fast-paced and well-written, and the characters are captivating. I am now compelled to read the real Frank's novel. Being based on a true story gives the movie a strong foundation, but it can stand on its own as a brilliant film. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, Leonardo DiCaprio has acted well in the past. "This Boy's Life" and "Basketball Diaries" come to mind. He couldn't miss with this kind of material. It's one of those "how could you not like this?" kind of movies. Such a unique story is perfect fodder for a movie. People are gullible. How many firms really pore over college transcripts and check out all those references in depth? Charm gets you quite far in this life because as much as ability counts, an employer also wants to know, "Am I going to be able to stand this guy for eight hours a day?"Here's basically a slimy little kid named Frank Abagnale fooling everyone, essentially stealing millions of dollars, pretending to be some really high-level occupations (pilot, doctor, lawyer, teacher) and what happens? The viewer actually finds himself rooting for him. That's a combination of Steven Spielberg's directorial expertise and Leo's fine work with the script.At least the Oscar folks remembered Christopher Walken by nominating him for best-supporting actor, though Chris Cooper got the statue for "Adaptation." Too bad. As usual, Walken takes over the screen every time he's featured, and the performance as DiCaprio's dad was Oscar-worthy. Tom Hanks was good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, though it sounded as if he received New England accent lessons from Kevin Costner in "13 Days." In other words, "ugh!"Terrific film. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. It was the best I saw in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I must preface by saying I am not a fan of Leonardo DeCaprio. I had to suffer through him in TITANIC (a movie which I enjoyed), GANGS OF NEW YORK (which I hated) and now CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.I first saw CATCH ME IF YOU CAN in the theatre last Christmas and thought it was an okay movie. Nothing spectacular. I rented the DVD when it first came out and watched it three times within the week that I had the DVD for. This has since become one of my favorite films in recent memory. I have been turned off recently by some bad Speilberg films, in my opinion (AI, MINORITY REPORT.) But the combination of Speilberg, Tom Hanks and even Leonardo made this a very entertaining movie to watch.This movie actually reminded me of THE FUGITIVE, with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. It always seemed the crook was one step ahead of the authority figure. Tom Hanks is great as Carl Handratty, the FBI agent hot on the trail of Frank Abagnale (DeCaprio.) The always wonderful Christopher Walken plays Frank's dad and gives a brilliant performance well worthy of the Oscar nomination. This is really a great movie to see. One of my favorite parts was at the end where they are playing the classic Nat King Cole "The Christmas Song" during one of the climaxes. I would recommend CATCH ME IF YOU CAN to everyone, even those who are not Leonardo DeCaprio fans.Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can, the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. is compelling from the stylish opening credits to the very satisfying ending. I'll be honest, I have a love/hate relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio ? I want to hate the guy, but once in awhile he comes out with a performance like the one in this film and I have to admit that he really is a good actor. He convincingly portrays Abagnale, a teen who managed to outrun the FBI for years - all the while writing over 4 million dollars in bad checks, posing as an airline co-pilot, a physician and an attorney. Throughout the film, he is pursued by Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks with whom he develops an interesting relationship. While I admit to enjoying Spielberg's action and effects-driven films, I also enjoy the smaller pictures he produces as well. This film is a prime example. I completely forgot this was a Spielberg picture, something I consider to be a great compliment. When a director doesn't have a defining style, it shows an immense amount of talent, and more importantly, lacks the predictability that we see all too often in Hollywood today, especially in the case of someone with such a storied and lengthy repertoire as Spielberg. Granted, Spielberg had the good fortune to have an excellent script and three fantastic actors (DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken) to work with, but the direction is practically flawless in that there are no slow moments; everything happens for a reason and is integral to the progression of the plot. It goes without saying that a film that is close to two and a half hours in length can have lulls, or seem to be too long, but I found that I did not consider the length once while viewing it. Perhaps I've become so jaded after seeing so many movies, but I find that more often than not that I go into a film thinking that it isn't going to be as good as I had heard or expected. Once again, I've thankfully proven myself wrong with this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.--Shelly</fullReview>

The movie easily captures the frizzy fun of movies of a forgotten by gone era, and gives a hype vibe to all the scenes it has. The only problem with it however is the fact that it takes way too long to come to any real conclusion.

		<fullReview>Veteran actors Tom Hanks (who at about the same time was starring in ROAD TO PERDITION), pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio (who was also starring in GANGS OF NEW YORK at about the same time), and director Steven Spielberg, just barely recovering from MINORITY REPORT all managed to put out CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.I avoided seeing this in theaters because it didn't look like something I would like, but while watching the trailers for ROAD TO PERDITION, I saw a preview for this film. "That does look kind of interesting," I told myself. I rented it and I must say that I found it to be very entertaining.Leonardo DiCaprio must be coming out of his "little boy" stage of life or something because he is becoming more mature now and isn't redoing another overacted TITANIC performance. Tom Hanks seems to have a great time here, especially after ROAD TO PERDITION was praised by critics.What is most hard to believe is the message before the film begins and on the front cover. 'Based on a true story'. You wouldn't think a story so amazing and nearly unbelivable would be true. (It is true, by the way).Overall, I enjoyed this movie to a high degree. I didn't think I would, man was I wrong. Even though the film runs a little long and was slow in some parts, I think the fast-moving sequences were enough to make up for those few scenes. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Treat from Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is so preposterous it has to be true. A young man, a teenager actually, drops out of high school and, not satisfied with low-end jobs, variously impersonates an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer. All his impersonations work, and he uses his personas in various forgery schemes that net him millions of dollars that fuel his high-flying international life-style. The young man, Frank Abagnail, is played with breezy confidence by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is wonderfully believable and his portrayal of the young con man is one of his best roles.But it's not all entirely fun and games. The relationship between Frank and his parents, especially his dearly beloved but down-on-his luck father (Christopher Walken) is sad and multi-layered. The third important personal dimension is between Frank and the FBI agent (Tom Hanks) who pursues him.Set in the early 60s, Spielberg nails the period perfectly from the opening credits through the clothing styles, modes of entertainment and transportation, and even personal accoutrements. It's perfection. After a string of darker pictures it's heartening to see Spielberg take on this project. It's paid off very well for his fans and the movie going public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick Slight-of-Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg says that his initial impression of the massive con job pulled by Frank Abagnale, Jr. was that it was all one big "slight-of-hand" trick - no substance, no profound evil, just somebody wanting to see how fast and how loose they can play with the system.So Spielberg does about the only appropriate thing in bringing Abagnale's story to the screen: his movie itself is an artsy, slick slight-of-hand trick. It is as full of rich color, extensive detail, and beautiful decorum as anything Spielberg has ever done. I don't know if the movie is supposed to be "about" anything, even accounting for the obvious scenes where Spielberg tries to hash out his strange ideas of fatherhood. He has skipped his really relevant issues in favor of a shooting-the-breeze approach - encapsulated by the fact that shooting wrapped in only 52 days, manic speed for a Spielberg picture (this is the man almost run out of Hollywood for his monumental delays of "Jaws"). The film, in and of itself, exists just fine as this elegant piece of pop art which Spielberg has constructed, not dissimilar to the boys with toys attitude Steven Soderbergh brought to his "Ocean's Eleven" remake. Slinky, low-tech, with John Williams lyrical jazz ballet, it has vibrance, texture, and intelligence, with Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks stand- outs in their respective roles. DiCaprio is still a hard pill to swallow, but he comes off as at least a believably suave con man, if not a convincing one.I suppose my one real critique would be length - the film has such pride and joy about its own carefree attitude that it is a shame to see it ramble to the end of its 142 minutes, with an interesting but unnecessary epilogue about how Frank Abagnale emerged from his life of crime to help the FBI start catching forgers not as smart as he was. A more concise display of how Abagnale moved on once the chase was over might have been in order, but that is hardly a deal-breaker.3 1/2 stars (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch Me If You Can (M), now showing at The Regent Theatre in Te Awamutu, is destined to become one of the big movies of 2003 as the chemistry is perfect both on and off-screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has a big name director, in the shape of Steven Spielberg, as well as an all star cast, in the form of Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio and two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, and it has wonderful music from one of the movie industry's foremost composers, John Williams. Catch Me If You Can is the amazingly bizarre true story of a real life cat and mouse game between DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr and Hanks as FBI agent Carl Hanratty. Abagnale comes to US Government attention after posing as an airline pilot to cash a series of forged cheques. Running with the money, he boards a series of planes in uniform to get a free ride, cashing millions and travelling more than two million miles for free. All this before he can turn 18. DiCaprio, who is approaching 30, is stretched to his acting limits as he plays a young character impersonating older characters including a doctor and a lawyer . He also plays the character at various stages of his life. A memorable scene is when Abagnale, posing as a Mr Fleming, has a tailor copy a suit he had seen on Sean Connery in a James Bond movie. He drove away from the scene to the 007 theme. Ian Fleming, of course, wrote the James Bond books. Hanks, who is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, is superb as the disgruntled FBI agent who is always one step behind his quarry. Hanratty is irked by Abagnale's baiting, which is hilarious, and Hanks plays a complex character who often refuses to show his humanity ? until he catches up with Abagnale. There's also a weighty performance from Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Snr, DiCaprio's character's father, whose portrayal is complemented by that of Nathalie Baye, who plays his mother Paula. Almost everything about this film is right. From the opening credits, reminiscent of the classic TV shows of the 1960s, to the authentic wardrobe and John Williams' wonderful score. The only thing wrong with the film are the moral choices that Abagnale makes when pretending to be something that he is not. Catch Me If You Can is all about taking responsibility for your actions. When Abagnale is caught he must serve time. But it is not the end of his life but rather the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Honky Tonk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is the latest Steven Spielberg film starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. I quite enjoyed it. It was very entertaining, and I always am more satisfied with movies when they are based, at least in part, on something that really happened. In reviewing Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven, Roger Ebert wrote:Serious pianists sometimes pound out a little honky-tonk, just for fun. That's like what Steven Soderbergh is doing in "Ocean's Eleven."I kind of feel like that's a bit of what Spielberg is doing here. I've found this the least thematically significant film he's directed since Jurassic Park, but that said it is very entertaining and the acting is excellent. Even DiCaprio, whom I don't normally like, was great. Even more so, I thought Christopher Walken's performance as DiCaprio's father was superb, and very much worthy of a supporting actor Oscar nomination he garnered for the role.Bottom line: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightly dramedic period piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 1993, Steven Spielberg has burdened himself down in heavy material. After releasing "Jurassic Park" that year, he won a best picture Oscar for "Schindler's List," and with the exception of '97's "The Lost World," has had trouble making a happier movie since. He followed the '93 pattern that year, releasing the depressing true story of "Amistad," "Saving Private Ryan" in '98, and in the past two years, two bleak visions of the future, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" and "Minority Report." Is Spielberg saying something by making a lighthearted flick that takes place in the past? "Catch Me If You Can" finally pulls Spielberg out of the doldrums, quickens the pace, and leaves his audience with a pleasurable experience. At the same time, he gives Leonardo DiCaprio a chance to prove he's very capable of pulling off a great performance that is a driving force in a great film.Frank William Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) lives a happy young life with his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) and his French mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye,) whom Frank Sr. met during WWII in Mont Richard, France. They have a happy family, but Frank Sr. has had far too much trouble managing his finances and runs into endless trouble with the IRS. As a result, Paula leaves him for a family friend, and Frank Jr. runs away. Frank Jr. did, however, pick up a few con artist tricks from his father while he tried to dodge his financial troubles, and he never forgot them.Frank Jr. cons his way into a position as a co-pilot for Pan Am Airlines, printing fraudulent cheques to maintain a financial balance. From there, he successfully impersonates a lawyer and a doctor on the way to cashing over 5 million dollars in fraudulent cheques, which soon earns the ire of the FBI. Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is hot on his trail and is outwitted at every turn. He is embarrassed by Frank's actions and his coworkers and superiors begin to lose their confidence in him. But soon enough, as his fatehr becomes less of an asset to him, Frank turns to Carl for a parental figure for lack of his own parents. He turns to the only one left who is watching out for him... even if all he's trying to do is catch him."Catch Me If You Can" is a whimsical film. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Hanks hit just the right notes, creating a delicate relationship that fuels a lightly comedic drama about family. DiCaprio starred in two of my favorite films of 2002, this one and "Gangs of New York," though in the latter he did little more than fill the space of the lead role. He truly comes into his own in this film, playing a lost young boy looking for a father, and using a variety of criminal means to get that attention.There are three stars in this film: one is DiCaprio; another is Tom Hanks, who breaks his emotionally-repressed typecast and plays a role that allows him to be funny and touching at the same time; the third star is the amazing effort that went into staging a '60's period piece. Every visual detail is authentic, from the bathing suits, to John Williams' score bookended by appropriate hits from the period, as well as the costumes and production design. It's all spectacular - this film is a dead ringer for any popular '60's setting.What made me happiest about "Catch Me If You Can" is that Spielberg made a film that I could enjoy without feeling guilty about it. I couldn't easily say the same for "Schindler's List" or "Saving Private Ryan," but here the director has returned to his better form, the form that made me love his early films in the first place - let there be hope he continues in the same vein. 4 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

It is kind of hard to believe that one person could fool so many people, but I guess that shows that perception is 95% of the solution.

Then to top it off--have a dumptruck full of money from a movie/book deal!

		<shortDescription>Singular Spielberg effort makes for great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can", written by Jeff Nathanson from Frank W. Abagnale and Stan Redding's novel of the same name, is based on the real-life story of Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose life fell apart in 1963 when his parents Paula and Frank, Sr. (Nathalie Baye and Christopher Walken) lost their house and subsequently divorced. Not wanting to fall short of the American Dream like his father, Abagnale pulls a few forging tricks out of his hat and soon finds himself as an airline pilot, a doctor and a Louisiana lawyer, all before he turned 18! Expensive clothes, plush suites and gorgeous women are now accessible because of his newfound 'gift' of deception. He goes unnoticed until FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks, very effective in a supporting role) picks up on his exploits and is determined to nab him. This sets in motion a tireless game of wits between the two men. Colorful sets and nostalgic backdrops gives the film its 'look', but the real juice comes from the cat-and-mouse teaming of DiCaprio and Hanks, with fine support from Walken, Baye, Jennifer Garner (in a memorably amusing cameo as a seductive prostitute) and Amy Adams (as Abagnale's nymphet wife, Brenda). Very similar in nature to "The Thomas Crown Affair", this engrossing (if overlong) caper won Oscar nominations for Walken and composer John Williams. *** of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great acting aside, this movie felt extremely unrealistic. It never really went into great detail on how he became a pilot, doctor, and lawyer other than cutting and pasting really well, watching a lot of TV, and picking up chicks. They showed few "sticky" situations and made it seem far too easy. I'm sure it would be much more difficult to pull off any of those identities for a long period of time. Tom Hanks character was the weakest FBI agent I have ever seen portrayed. The overly soft scene in the French printers was terrible - give the man you've been chasing for 5 years his own cuffs with options?? WTF? I didn't hate this movie but it made people (especially the FBI) in the 1960's seem like complete morons - maybe it was like that. Wow, if it really went down like it did in this movie I give the real Frank Abagnale tremendous props. Feels just a tad to Hollywood however. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture was recently released to DVD and I must say that the transfer is excellent. The film loses nothing in the translation to the small screen because its main strengths are its superior direction and acting. Leo DiCaprio not only appears in nearly every scene, but he carries this film with amazing, amusing and seemingly effortless panache. He portrays Frank Abignale, a 17 year old youth who, in 1963, managed to flit across the country impersonating, variously, A Pan Am pilot, a Pediatrician, and a lawyer. He also succeeded in passing over 1 million dollars in forged checks, all the while eluding the F.B.I. man dedicating to catching him, a man named Carl Hanratty, played by the ever amazing Tom Hanks. It's a rare pleasure to watch these two top notch actors play off of each other, aided by a nuanced, witty, and intelligent script. Not to be forgotten (except by the Academy)is the fine supporting performances from Christopher Walken as Frank Abignale Sr.,Amy Adams, and the luscious, amazing cameo by Jennifer Garner as the high priced hooker who gets beaten at her own game in one of the funniest scenes that I've seen in a long time. Mixing this all together in one fine dessert is the direction of Steven Spielberg. The style of this picture marks a total departure for him, allowing him to pace this film like no other. It's an excursion that I'm glad he took. Kudos also to D.P Janus Kaminsky and a totally mesmerising jazz influenced score from John Williams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is a good change of pace for Steven Spielberg, who hasn't done a lighthearted movie like this in a long time - after "Minority Report," "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" and "Saving Private Ryan," a smaller-scale, factually-based tale would be just the thing. But while no one can possibly call this a bad movie, ultimately it's a bit too light for its own good.It does show how far good actors and a top director can take an uneven screenplay - and since Frank Abangale's book about his exploits as a real-life Great Pretender is adapted by the man who also did "Rush Hour 2" and "Speed 2: Cruise Control," it is pretty uneven. Luckily for us all, Leonardo DiCaprio and company take it almost to the finish; going from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, our hero Frank starts to fake it when his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have their house repossessed en route to getting divorced, going from pretending to being the substitute French teacher to posing as a Pan Am pilot, and taking it from there. You watch it wondering how far he can go before getting caught, and how he will get caught, and what'll happen then...The story is played for laughs for the most part, but it's handled with so that you never feel it shouldn't be or that he's doing it out of larceny; from the animated opening credits onwards the movie keeps skipping along, but it also takes itself a bit too easy - no sensation that the Fed pursuing him is actually chasing him, and not enough time to build up the people Frank meets along the way, apart from Frank's father. Thank heaven for Spielberg's ability to use actors who can make up for it, like Martin Sheen as the father of the sweet Southern girl (Amy Adams) who our hero comes close to marrying, and Jennifer Garner in a cameo as a model-turned-prostitute who winds up unknowingly paying our hero to have sex with her (some of us would do it for free)."Catch Me If You Can" also has lots of wonderful little moments like our hero getting crash courses in medicine and law from "Dr. Kildare" and "Perry Mason" respectively, and Handratty (Tom Hanks)'s knock-knock joke; as with many movies set in the 1960s it also fills the soundtrack with songs from that era, and though some are questionably chosen (Frank and Cheryl (Jennifer Garner) meet up with Dusty Springfield's "The Look Of Love" playing to set the mood, even though the year is 1964 and the song didn't come out until 1967) they're still good listening, but don't upstage John Williams's score - which, though it's been overpraised by all too many movie critics, probably because it's not loud, is still impressively light a la a lot of his 60s work.The trouble with the movie in the end, however, is... well... the end. It seems to run on for about 20 or so minutes after its natural end, and ultimately just seems to tail off. The movie's likeable and absorbing, but in the end it's no more than a pleasant diversion. But why pick on Spielberg et al for not producing heavyweight movies all the time? As far as cinematic journeys to the 1960s go, it's worth seeing, especially for fans of the cast and director. It's just a shame it doesn't linger long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a typical Hollywood entertaining movie! I couldn't help crying "genius" as I watched the movie. Yes, they produce the movie to fulfill dreams of people that can never be realized in real life. Of course the story can't be totally true: the plot that Frank escaped airplane by screwing off a few screws, truely interesting, but later with careful thinking, a normal human being can't just screw that off from top advanced instruments such as airplanes. Despite that, it's a wonderful Hollywood dream!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither true thriller nor credible comedy, but boasts an entertaining story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's latest film is the true story of the prodigious teenage con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo Di Caprio) who manages during the late 1960's to forge over two million dollars in checks throughout several different countries while posing as an airline pilot, a pediatrician, an attorney, and a college professor. All the while, he is being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), whose dedication to catching Abagnale borders on obsessive.While the main focus of the film is on Abagnale's genius for defrauding the government, deceiving just about anyone with whom he comes into contact, and the ensuing cat and mouse game with the FBI, it also allows us a glimpse into the underlying roots of his deception. His father Frank Abagnale Sr., portrayed with great depth and sincerity by Christopher Walken, has a penchant for deceit himself but when his business and marriage fall apart it ignites his son's strong yearning to restore the life and family they once had and ultimately his ambitious yet perilous journey into high stakes fraud.There are times when the plot seems repetitious and predictable, and therefore robs this film of becoming a first rate thrill ride. But strong performances, a fascinating storyline with both comical and sad undertones, and a fulfilling ending make Catch Me If You Can worth the trip to the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a huge fan of "based on real life" movies I saw this with some doubts in my mind. Many "based on..." movies come across with docu-drama feelings, plot holes due to time constraints, some shady comments that seem out of place unless you are already familiar with the real life events and various other unappealing material. Catch Me if You Can does *none* of this. The story of a young man with incredible talent who puts himself in unbelievable situations all searching for some kind of cosmic truth. This story could not have been written better if it was fiction, and the fact that it comes from a true story makes you really want to take a look at the people you pass on the street. It makes you think twice about the human race and leaves you feeling good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falsely categorized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that strikers me at IMDB is that the films there always carry so many genre titles. Catch me if you can is one of them. Virtually every category that was ever invented is listed, despite the fact that this is clearly what we (in Dutch) would call a ?speelfilm' or a ?spielfilm' in German. I do not know if there is a translation for it in ?genre' terms, but it roughly means ?motion picture'. You see this is just the story of a young fraud with not too much adventure, thrills or drama in it although featuring a lot of crime.I think that after this film, there will be a time of quiet surrounding Steven Spielberg, because it is the way he's done it previously. Hook (1991), Jurassic Park (1993) and Schindler's List (1993), then taking a 4 year break from making movies; Amistad (1997), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), then taking a 3 year break and now AI (2001), Minority Report (2002) and Catch me if you Can (2002) making a ??? year break I presume. Why do I make this list you wonder well, I do it to make a point. The point is, that I think that Spielberg will take a bit of a break now and that I think he needs one, because the last films he has made weren't really good. I mean you obviously cannot keep making Schindler's List's or Jurassic Park's but there is something missing lately in Spielberg's work. I miss that feeling that I'm watching the films of someone who never stopped being a small child and I miss the feeling. I mean let's face it, in AI Spielberg tried to insert that dreamy side of himself, but it failed because the Spielberg ending did not fit the Kubrick story, then there came Minority Report which proved that Spielberg is not the best in making thrilling crime movies and now there is Catch me if you Can a film that has a pretty nice story, but also a film that is neither good nor bad. It is entertainment, in it's most normal form and nothing one would assume to have been made by Spielberg. It's not as if I'm not happy with the choices that he makes, but I feel that he could bring more feeling into his film. One could have felt more involved, the film could have been more dramatic and more moving. What happened Mr.Williams' great scores (I know he got an Oscar nomination, but I cannot remember one bit of film, where the music stuck out). This film is just not Spielberg's territory and it shows, for it is not as outstanding and memorable as his other work. Spielberg's territories clearly are adventure (JP, Indiana), Drama (Color Purple, Amistad, Schindler's List) and Family films (Hook, E.T.) and maybe he could even pull off dark film like AI if he didn't try to convert it in a fairy tale at the end.7 out of 10post scriptum reminder to self: post more comments on unusual, emotionally gripping and / or meaningful films (Amélie, The Royal Tenenbaums, Donnie Darko, Finding Forrester) than on successful mainstream Hollywood entertainment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loved it. So funny, Leo is really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Catch me if you Can. After laughing my head off through the book I was reluctant to see the film. I was expecting the movie to be scant and painfully shallow, as many cinematic recreations are. This was a total surprise. Leonardo was so good as the conflicted con man but the best performance by far was from Christopher Walken. His crying scene in the restaurant was superb. You can see why he was Oscar nominated for this one, and you can see why he won one for The Deer Hunter. Tom Hanks was good. Always watchable and pretty likeable, but back to Leo. When I first heard he was cast I was disappointed. I thought Robert Downey would have been the better choice. Frank Abagnale was 16 who looked 26. Leo is 26 who looks 16, but somehow he pulls it off. I have never seen an actor change so comprehensively via a haircut. His change of looks are very convincing and carries the role perfectly. His charm and wit are excellent for the role and the cat and mouse themes from the book are perfectly represented in the film. See it. It's great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where DiCaprio failed in Gangs of New York, he succeeds magnificently in Catch Me If You Can.Touching and funny with an excellent cast, Catch Me If You Can is excellently directed and captivates. All the more remarkable for being based on a true story it skilfully combines Frank's scams with the relationship with his father.Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks and DiCaprio all entertain. The only real flaw with the movie is that some of the schemes seem a little implausible - but this is a feelgood movie, not an accurate guide on how to become a con artist.8/10 - recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining real life story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an impressionable young man growing up in poverty during the 1960s with two far from ideal parents, but that doesn't stop him from putting his father (a charming slickster played to perfection by Walken) on a pedestal. Using his quick wit and charm, the young man eventually gets what he wants by convincingly impersonating various professions and writing phony checks. Eventually his actions leave a trail, and over the years he gets drawn into a cat and mouse game with a shrewd, no-nonsense federal agent (Hanks). Overlong, but slick and interesting with a terrific cast. The two leads are definitely fun to watch, and despite some dramatic overtones there are plenty of laugh-out loud moments. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is truly an entertaining film. The 60's style of the adds to the integrity and intrigue of the picture. The film is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) a teenager still in high-school who pulls a number stunts and gets away with millions. With the F.B.I. hot on his tail, it is thrilling to watch over and again how Abagnale is able to escape their reach and play with them as long as he can. We as the viewers, tend to side with this desperate teenager and enjoy the taste of another sweet victory each time he gets away with a job. It is interesting to see DiCaprio take on the faces and prestige of doctors, lawyers, and teachers alike. All in the span of 2 and a half hours. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, agent of the F.B.I. and is a superb compliment to DiCaprio. Hanks always has an aura about him of high regard, and this film is another example of that expectation. The film was captivating from start to finish and has an ironic ending of which is a superb close to the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg pulls it off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg shows why he is the most important director in Hollywood. Not just anybody takes over a project with "Trash" written all over it, and makes a very good movie out of it."Catch me if you can" is a very enjoyable film that you can watch over and over again. I believe I'm one of the few that thinks Leonardo Dicaprio can be a good actor when he puts his mind to it. And although this is not the case, I must say that this is one of the few movies in which I don't find him annoying. Tom Hanks also proves his quality with an excellent performance in a supporting role, although it never felt right Hanks doing a goofy second to Dicaprio. Another great addition was Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr. He doesn't have as much screen time as Dicaprio or Hanks, but makes a strong background character that helps the audience understand Dicaprio's character. I think the film's biggest plus is being a real-life story. I don't know how much of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life has been changed for the script, but no matter how different it is, the story is believable, except for making Dicaprio a 17 year-old, c'mon!. I think somebody hit the jackpot when they looked at Abagnale's adventures and said "Hey, somebody should make a movie about him".Spielberg made a great last minute save with this film. I just can't imagine it being a good movie with Gandolfini as Carl Harranty and Verbinsky directing it. Spielberg + Hanks can never fail. I'm just glad Dicaprio didn't ruin it for us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Spielberg in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this isn't "Schindler's List" or "Close Encounters of the third Kind", fare from those legend movie, but it's the best movie Spielberg made since "Savin Private Ryan". Sad because is seems less Spielberg than other films, just like "Minority Report". Leonardo is very convincing and this is his best performance yet.His portrait is great and you could see him as that kind of charming fraud he plays. Hanks is less convincing than Leo, but it's still the great performance you'd expect from the best actor we have right now. As in "The Road to Perdition", it's a new character for Hanks, which in both movies probably led to the Oscar nomination of his co actors.But Christopher Walken is the best, by fare the best performance i've seen him in. He has some sort of devilish greatness about him it's just great. And the scenes with Hanks shows a great portrait of a father, Hanks must have some magic effect on he's co-actors, cuz if Hanks isn't the best all others are. The movie is great stylish, very 60s and very straight. There are funny moments in the movie, especially Agabnale's first prank/fraud.But somehow the movie is a little too long, but leads up the best Spielberg ending since "Schindler's List".I love spielberg movies and this is one of his five or six best, which is saying a lot. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earthly Spielberg's delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg, who has always fascinated us (not me,always) with his stories of the superhuman and the supernatural, capable of bringing a tear to our eye, triumphs this time with a well told story (apparently a true story, too) about a con-artist who managed to escape from the law for several years before he was caught and redeeming himself by helping the same law he once bended. Some of my friends who watched the movie before me have told me `it's nothing special'. After watching it myself, I understand why: they were expecting a comedy with unexpected send-ups and goofy turn of events. Thank God they were wrong. `Catch me if you can' doesn't try to teach us a moral lesson, or make us think a lot. It's just a story. And well told too. The cast is superb: Di Caprio has never been better (at least since `What's eating Gilbert Grape') and Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken have given an excellent support to the main character. You can sense Spielberg's hand in some parts, but overall it's a movie with a story you can enjoy without thinking what to expect next. My Rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great director doing what he does best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although his ventures into sci-fi in recent years turned up interesting results, Steven Spielberg has in this movie returned to more conventional story telling and the end product is a mouth watering feast of cinematic thrills. The film is based on the true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage con artist and fraudster who becomes the youngest ever person to wind up on the FBIs most wanted list. Having seen his parents seemingly perfect marriage crumble following his father's troubles with the IRS, DiCaprio enters a self destructive fantasy world when he turns his attention to forging cheques and impersonating airline pilots. Soon the Feds become aware of his illegal activities and Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) picks up the scent.In an effortless two hours and twenty minutes, Spielberg uses his considerable talents to weave an atmospheric and exciting tale of cat and mouse as DiCaprio always remains just one step ahead of the determined FBI agent pursuing him. Slowly the noose tightens around DiCaprio's neck, but not before he has a chance to defraud millions of dollars and successfully trick his way into a variety of jobs he was unqualified to do. As his increasingly sophisticated exploits land him in greater trouble, he finds himself further and further removed from reality and he is left with no one to trust and no where to go but to keep on running. With meaningful relationships destined to end in tears, he develops a deep rapport with the only person who has any understanding of him ? his pursuer Tom Hanks.?Catch Me if you Can' confirms yet again that Spielberg has no peer when it comes to making purposeful popcorn entertainment. He can thrill and audience without ever sacrificing the twin pillars of strong scripting and good acting. DiCaprio excels as the charming con man, while Hanks' measured performance as the dogged FBI agent is an effortless turn that once again reconfirms his status as one of Hollywood's most capable leading men. In the midst of the battle of the big names, special mention must go to the great Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father who steals every scene from the big boys. An exuberant jazz score from John Williams and a sumptuous production design that captures all the design flair of the period adds icing to this most enticing of cinematic cakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant acts in a somewhat jaded perspective of Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In these days of breath-taking special effects, dazzling sounds and tension-filled interpretation of violent thrill, it's quite hard for a director like Spielberg to check the interest to make uses of them in his movie while he has a number of award-winning films filled with all of them under his belt. But it evidently appeared, after watching the film, that he really wanted to do something new. Something that deliberately will not be considered as a typical Spielberg film.But he has not quite succeeded to fulfill those wishes. Though he has not used anything special of modern technology, apart from excellent camera work, another typical Spielberg perspective is now exposed which he could not remove from this film too. Well, upto this time that was playfully hidden by the tension his movie used to have. But now, the "cat and mouse" theory, in which the mouse is always the public winner (look at the examples, Jon Anderton, Ian Malcolm et al, the arachnophobics, the family in Poultergeist etc) is at its over-used bluntness while now, the 'cat' has come into the standard of FBI agents. But above all these, it must be said that Spielberg is quite lucky to have so much brilliant actors at their best in this film. Be it DiCaprio, who is all convincing as young and handsome Frank Abagnale Jr. or Tom Hanks as the FBI agent. Both, especially Hanks, got it all right in every places in the movie. And we must not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. His performance is also quite realistic and fluent. So it turns out to be the acting which prompts us to see the movie over and over again, this time not by Spielberg, though smelling something new in the future air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the triumph of lightness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Schindler's List, Stephen Spielberg has felt compelled to make Important Movies. Thus the portentous likes of AI and Minority Report have bored moviegoers worldwide. Spielberg' s latest is thankfully more playful than his recent work. And unlike some of his previous films, its less manipulative of the emotions than usual. Ironically Catch Me If You Can's lightness and lack of manipulativeness make its more emotional moments much more effective. Partly this is due to John Williams' soundtrack; usually Spielberg's in-house composer writes rather formulaic orchestra-driven music, but marimbas and glockenspiels and other percussion instruments lead the breezy theme here.Both AI and Minority Report went on far too long; both could have ended at a point where it was logical and satisfying but chose to carry on and on and on. Catch Me If You Can only possesses this fault of Spielberg's recent work to some extent; the film might have ended ten minutes earlier to no particular disadvantage. It tells the story of Frank Abagnale Junior (di Caprio), son of his namesake upright pillar of the community father (played by Christopher Walken, in one of his less psychotic roles), who runs away from home rather than confront his parents divorce. He learns that forging cheques and impersonating airline pilots and other professionals is much easier than it seems. All it takes is audacity. Inevitably, Abagnale draws the attention of plodding, methodical FBI man Hanratty (Hanks), the FBI's one passionate believer in the importance of cheque fraud.The opening credits resemble nothing so much as the cover of a 1960s paperback. In a way Catch Me If You Can is a film about the Sixties, but a Sixties slightly different from the image we have of it. Both Abagnale and Hanratty are touched by broken marriages, his parents in the case of Abagnale, his own for the older man. Aside from a few brief references, Vietnam and student radicalism and LSD might as well not exist.Some might see this as Spielberg closing his eyes to reality, but for me it more accurately reflects what the Sixties must have been like for the great mass of people who actually lived through them. It reminds us that for most people (at least most people who didn't go on to lucrative media careers in which they could endlessly revisit their preoccupations) the Sixties weren't about fashionable radicalism and rioting but a decade where they got on with their lives as most people generally do; working, living, getting married etc. Or in Frank Abagnale Junior's case, impersonating doctors and lawyers and airline pilots and passing fraudulent cheques.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest in Spielberg filmmaking, and clearly not what you expect. `Catch me if you can' gives something a lot more than your usual family movie time in which Mr. Spielberg is so clearly great at delivering. The film sees Leonardo Dicaprio play a young con artist who successfully became a millionaire by forging checks all before his 19th birthday. An interesting game of cat and mouse begins when a determined FBI agent finds it in himself to devote his work into catching the youngster before he gets himself into more trouble. Instead we see our director taking a different approach in his career by exploring the undoubtedly entertaining scenarios that sees our lovable character go over the edge into sadness and fear. Dicaprios outstanding performance as a confused minor certainly gains our sympathy as he lives his life with his money and games along with his struggling attempts to accept his parents divorce. We are all reminded throughout the film of his characters undying love for both his parents and most of all to his father, whose unforgettable performance belongs to Christopher Walken. Tom Hank's sophisticated performance of the man hot on his trail is definitely something we are all expecting from the well know actor. I always felt that Spielberg's movies were never to be taken seriously although at every climax the audience is unwillingly left with something special they can take home with them. Unlike most Spielberg films, this movie will leave you with a lot to think about with open arms to whatever this smiling piece has to offer you by the time the end credits hit the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Having read Frank Abagnale's book, I was surprised to see how much I enjoyed the film. It is clear that both Steven Spielberg and Jeff Nathanson have captured the spirit of the book, which was without a doubt "spiced" by the author (his cleverest swindle yet???) So don't worry about finding much sense in things like the escape from the plane through the toilet. Tom Hanks' character (Carl Hanratty) is an invention too, BTW. He was never mentioned on the book, but it's great to know that "Frank and Carl are still close friends". ;o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scam done in style and with a smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there were an award for the best credits presentation, the opening sequence of Catch Me if You Can designed in the style of the 1960's detective comic strips would be a winner. Overall, the movie's art-director deserves an award for the recreation of the 1960's style, complete with those bright monochrome shirts worth hundreds of dollars now.The biggest award for this captivating story, though, snatched the real Frank Abagnale Jr. He did it through those bank fees we pay now every time we're forced to write a real check (whose security features he, very likely, helped design) instead of easily pasting one up from fancy stationary, decals and John Doe's surrender to the force of blinding looks. All of the above he managed to use himself running one of the greatest laser-printer-free scams of the 20th century that leaves our eyes wide open and our jaws dropped.This movie is like a chess-game puzzle printed in a newspaper: we know who will win but we are intrigued by the strategy and the ultimate chase. It is never high-speed, but just like a chess-game, develops move by move. As viewers, we are more likely to side up with the con artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) than with his FBI hunter (Tom Hanks).Abagnale Jr. doesn't come across as an inveterate rogue--he is cold-blooded, but not a mean bastard (unlike Mr. Ripley, for instance.) Why are we on his side? Maybe because he does more harm to the system (that we probably wouldn't mind getting screwed sometimes) than to defenseless individuals, to whom he is actually quite considerate.One episode that isn't quite clear-the TV show the movie opens with.The movie is definitely worth seeing, because it leaves you inspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hanks and DiCaprio are right on form in what must be Steven Spielberg's most enjoyable and entertaining movie since Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade in 1989.After a slow first 30 minutes, the film kicks into high gear as we follow the cat and mouse game between DiCaprio and Hanks. Excellent 60s set pieces, costume design and an excellent, sometimes moody 60s soundtrack make what is already a brilliantly told story even better!This is the kind of film that perfects the reason why we go to the cinema - to escape from ordinary life.

Spielberg &amp; Hanks did their's job as we expected from them, while a pleasent surprise came from DiCaprio, who managed to get rid of the Titanic-look-a-like style and gain some acting abilities. But the best performance came from supporting actor Christoper Walken. An Oscar play. Catch me if you can is one of the best movies in 2002 and if it wouldn't be a little slow paced at the end, it would sure win the title - a classic movie.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

DiCaprio's character was well done, although at times I thought a bit young for the role he was portraying. Walken was genuine, truly deserving of the Academy nod. Hanks was believable as Hanratty, but not really a change up for him in terms of roles. The scene at Miami International signifies both the high water point and downfall of this, although I found some of the finale in the FBI interesting I'd like to know what happened when he escaped and was caught in Europe.

		<fullReview>Another fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. While I think this is not quite as good as Minority Report, it is more light hearted and simplistic entertainment, a film you can really watch anytime. As with all Spielberg films, his storytelling is wonderful as is his cast. In this film, amongst others, we have Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. This makes for great watching, and the story itself is amazing, because it sounds so implausible yet it happened in real life. Frank Abagnale Jr went around the whole of the USA and parts of Europe conning people and cashing in millions in fraudulant cheques. The material on paper looks like it would have difficulty sustaining a two and a half hour movie but truth be told there are no such troubles, with Spielberg behind camera and the grade A cast all on top form it's simply engrossing and movie making magic.Overall this rates as probably the best film so far of 2003. Its not quite a classic but still is a great piece of entertainment. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who don't know the story behind Frank William Abagnale Jr I promise I won't disclose any information that can ruin your experience watching the movie. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was the greatest con in the history of the US. He decieved 12 countries and all 50 american states while running from an FBI team led by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). And guess what? He did this all before he was 19.Frank was probably one of the most gifted persons in American history - even though he used his gift for breaking the law - and it was only fair that he was portraied by a gifted actor. Leo DiCaprio gets into Frank's skin perfectly with, probably, the best performance in his career. Tom Hanks is the same great actor as usual and they both make a very funny and interesting duo throughout the film. The story is always interesting and keeps the viewer attached to the end. Of course, the directing is flawless by Steven Spielberg. He returns to the subjects that started his career - the broken home - and achieves one of the best films I've ever seen. A quick special mention has to be given to the author of the opening generic - sorry for not remembering his name. He achieves a masterpiece with an animation short film. An overall superb film. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can we reward Spielberg with `Chicago's' Oscar for releasing two purely entertaining films in the same year?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remind me again why America has such lofty expectations of Steven Spielberg but will gladly sit through any of the now rotten George Lucas films? Our expectations are so high that Spielberg goes out and makes his most purely entertaining film in a long time (`Catch Me If You Can') and one of his absolute best intellectual films ever (`Minority Report') in the same year but finds the Academy rooting for the sophomoric `Chicago.' Truly perplexing.Possible SpoilersThat said, `Catch Me If You Can' is the most fun I've had at the cinema in years and like most Spielberg films appeals to everyone so as to maximize profit. `Everyone' refers to the dumbed-down American public who adore retread sequels, franchise films, and any film with the words Julia Roberts. And this is the brilliance of Spielberg who brings the masses of dumbed-down Americans together with the silent minority of intelligent film-goers who won't see a movie with less than 3 stars. `Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect film for everyone and so entertaining that I found myself more excited than I had been earlier that day at a screening of the self-indulgent `Adaptation.'Who knew that Leonardo DiCaprio could act? I sure didn't after the snorefest that was `Titanic' but Spielberg has a way of urging even the most awful actor toward brilliance. As Frank Abagnale Jr. Dicaprio is very good at making us like this con-man and indeed, hoping that he will get away with all of his crimes. Tom Hanks is fairly pedestrian here, perhaps he's out of revelations, but Christopher Walken is pure magic as always. In one scene he and Frank Jr. make eye contact and there is a secretive smile that they share as he congratulates his son on getting away with impersonating a French teacher. Scenes with Frank's future wife, a nurse, where she is more upset that he's not a Lutheran than anything else are pure magic. A chance meeting in Frank's hotel room with Detective Hanratty (Hanks) is smart and fun.Most intriguing is the fact that Spielberg spent very little time shooting `Catch Me If You Can' and in the course of one year managed to release two incredibly memorable films. Sure `Catch Me If You Can' doesn't add anything to the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. but a story as exciting as his doesn't need any additions, its a true story after all. Still, I can't imagine any other director bringing as much to the film as Spielberg does with his fun John Williams beginning to the scenes at Miami International Airport with the flight attendants and their cute powder blue uniforms. This is one of the few directors that you can currently look to for originality and excitement. `E.T.' was based on a dream after all and I can't forget those spiders crawling across the floor in `Minority Report'. Even his biggest failure `Artificial Intelligence' was unique and well-crafted. The other directors out there are on a course of making bad sequels for profit and making toilet humor some sort of revelation. You have to hand it to Spielberg for taking an extra step.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg ticking over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a pleasant ride this film was; based on a true story, it follows the life of the character portrayed brilliantly by Leo, through his latter years at home with parents with crumbling marriage intact (this is the norm these days), to his various misguided efforts to not only please his father and step into his shoes, but to actually put himself into a position where he thinks he can actually restore the family business and get Mommy n Daddy back together again (ahhh bless).Use of interesting camera angles, a good soundtrack, and subtle sprinklings of comic relief make this an interesting if slightly unremarkable film to watch, especially from the genius that is Steven Spielberg. So I'd have to vote this one a good 7 out of ten, although I must admit that I'm stumped on how they could have made it any better to watch, anymore entertaining, anymore accurate in terms of characterisation and period detail.In summary, a family film you'll watch at xmas, but I can't see myself going out and buying this one on DVD. Next time, stick to the Epics, Stevie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can I call it a sad documentary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I emerged from the cinema feeling rather sad. It was a good film and I had no regret whatsoever seeing it. I think how the film turned out has much to do with the fact that it is based on a real life story.I confess that I have not read the book, but I heard that the film, other than some understandable dramatisation, adheres quite closely to the facts (not necessarily the book, but the actual facts).Indeed the film has some funny moments but the tone throughout is not that of a comedy. It tells the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. as it happened, including both the comdey and the tragedy elements. Underpinning the entire story is Frank's absolute devotion to his father, throughout the latter's financial and marital disaster (not a spoiler here as it happened right at the beginning of the story). What makes the pathos so acute is Frank's cheerful, upbeat disposition in his quest to help his father. Everything he did was driven by a single motivation: to make his father happy again. My heart bled at every scene between father and son.DiCaprio turned in a good performance, particularly when he is a 30-year-old (rounded up to the nearest 10) actor playing a teenager impersonating a 30-year-old. For some reason, I kept thinking that I was watching Matt Damon. It must be the similarity between Catch Me and The Talented Mr. Ripley, in that the main character in both are cons (Ripley, however, is a very vicious con). I've also heard that Damon got the role in Ripley only because DiCaprio turned it down. However, by this association, I am paying a compliment to DiCaprio because Damon, in my view, is a couple of notches above DiCarpio, as an actor. I am delighted that Christopher Walken, who played the father, has been nominated for a best supporting Oscar. He may not win but certainly deserves the recognition of the nomination. I have not forgotten Hanks, the mentor/friend/father figure. Although in a normal cat-and-mouse situation, their roles carry equal weight, Hanks is playing a supporting role here. And this is why Hanks is so great. Whatever he plays, he deliveres what the role requires, in the best quality.Finally, I must mention how much I like the brilliant idea of starting the story with a scene from To Tell The Truth, which must be among the all-time favorite TV shows. I don't know if in real life, Frank Abagnale Jr. really did get on the show, and it doesn't really matter. It's seeing Kitty Carlisle again that bring back a lot of fond memories. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to comment much on the film which I liked. It is a very light drama/comedy that is fun for the moment. But nothing more than that. I think diCaprio gives a satisfying performance-the best his limited range allows. He's very charming and likeable. Hanks on the other hand, who even would get an Oscar nod for playing a dead body, is wasted. I have never been a fan of his acting (highly overrated) even though he had great movies (since he can choose from the best material, it's no wonder). The one who shines here is Christopher Walken, with the only touching performance in the entire movie. He provided the needed depth and delivered a character description nobody thought he would be able to do (after all his maniacs-roles). His Oscar-nomination in the supporting category is well deserved. I hope he will win after Ray Liotta ("Narc") and Dennis Quaid ("Far from heaven") got neglected by the academy. Anyway, go see the movie. It's a pleasant opportunity to kill 2 1/2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is about a con-man. I won't divulge more than the trailer does, at least I'll try not to. This con-man, Frank- played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is still a school kid, his talents for forgery, lying and acting all he has going for him really.He is essentially a lonely teenager, fraught by the woe of his parents' break up. In his teenage naivity he assumes this is because of his father's problems with the IRS and his company going under. It is actually the reason, but although it destroys his father it only releases his mother from a life she was already tiring of.Frank doesn't realise this and sets off on a quest to forge cheques (or checks depending on which side of the Atlantic you are) and make the money back to save his parents' marriage. Little does he realise there is nothing he can do as he digs a deeper and deeper hole for himself.Hanks plays the detective, who's career rests on him catching this boy. He plays it superbly as usual, another notch for his already fine repertoire. He delivers lines with dead-pan humour and heart-breaking sadness, on occasion at the same time.In fact every actor is spot on in this. DiCaprio's innocent appearance fits the part perfectly, Walken is as ever, and the rest of the support is well cast and as you'd hope, go unnoticed.The production of this film is fantastic also. From the opening credits sequence through to the period setting, the costumes, the pacing and editing. It is not 'the greatest story ever told', but it is a damn good one, told as well as it possibly could have been.The only issue I've heard raised on this film is how Frank is portrayed as the hero of the story when he is actually a criminal. Well, go and see it, you will see him portrayed with compassion but certainly not with any condoning of his actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I hadn't known that Steven Spielberg, the most financially successful bad director Hollywood has produced, had directed this movie, it wouldn't have taken me long to guess. There is a certain sticky sweetness, a sunniness of mood that is vintage Spielberg and which sits uneasily with the theme of crime and punishment. Not that Frank Abagnale Jr was a particularly vicious criminal, but here cheque fraud is portrayed as being nice clean crime, and we find ourselves wanting to see Frank get away with it, and make his FBI pursuer Carl Hanratty look even more of a bumblefoot than he is already. There is something rather manipulative about a movie that has us cheering the bad guy. Well, I guess not even Steve Spielberg, rich as he is, likes banks, and the nice thing about cheque fraud is that it usually the bank that loses, not the customer.That said, this a very watchable entertainment. The 1960s are beautifully evoked, not only through the décor, cars, manners and clothes, but in the accurate portrayal of air travel as the height of glamour and sophistication. Pam American and TWA were almost institutions; alas they did not survive deregulation and the proletarianisation of the air travel market.Leonardo Di Caprico, though in his late 20s, is a slightly pudgy, pretty sort of guy and gets away with portraying the precocious teenage Frank. Appropriately it is a charming performance though he does not have a big range. Tom Hanks as Carl glowers a lot and eats a lot of bad food, but I found it hard to evoke a lot of sympathy for him. With the resources the FBI had at its disposal Frank's capture should have taken weeks, not years. But then it would not have been such a good story, one which is made more intriguing by the relationship between Frank and his father, an unsuccessful business man (nicely played by Christopher Walken). Frank learned a lot about the con man's game from his Dad, though Dad lacked the audacity Frank displays. Frank's relationship with his mother (elusively played by Nathalie Baye) is also explored, but in a perfunctory way. It's a lengthy movie, 2 hours 20 minutes and it does drag a bit. The 'happy ending' is anti-climactic, though I can well believe it took some time to actually get Frank working for the FBI. And he's never left! Must be the pension plan.WARNING: SPOILER. At one point in the proceedings Carl asks Frank how he managed to cheat his way through the Louisiana bar exam, which Frank passed despite not having a law degree (he was only 18). Frank refuses to say. Later, we learn what happened ? Frank crammed for two weeks and passed the exam on his merits. This is perfectly explicable. Bar exams cover basic black letter law which merely has to be parroted back to satisfy the examiners. Some maintain that to have a law degree from a decent school is a positive disability to passing bar exams. Most law graduates sign up for a cramming course for the particular bar exam they wish to do. Maybe Frank did the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in workaholic mode, Steven Spielberg offers up his surprising latest confection a mere six months after the masterful "Minority Report" - and it's not only the precise opposite of that film's bleak sci-fi dystopia, it's probably his most enjoyable and commercial film in years, which is not to mean it's a disposable lightweight offering. Based on the true story of sixties conman Frank Abagnale Jr., who travelled America posing as a respectable doctor/lawyer/airline pilot and cashing forged cheques throughout but was in fact a New Jersey kid barely out of high school, it's essentially a breezy, swinging comedy where you follow Abagnale's trail of bouncing cheques alongside stoic FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who is always one step behind but begins to come too close for comfort. Underneath the dayglo, Technicoloured gaiety, though, Spielberg is essentially going back to one of his recurrent themes, family and the missing father, since the conman's actions always grow out of his need to earn enough money to make up for his father's debts to the IRS and get his divorced parents back again. However, this is Spielberg's less schmaltzy film in years, preferring instead to play up the free-and-easy smirk of the early to mid sixties (at one point there's a James Bond quote, and it's not an accident), greatly aided by the solid performances of the excellent cast, headed by the rueful Di Caprio as Abagnale and a hilariously deadpan Hanks as Hanratty, with special marks for Walken's poignant performance as the father. Masterfully handled, it's basically a minor entry in Spielberg's oeuvre but undoubtedly his most fun film in years, and it is great fun, even if you can't quite make out why should it run as long as it does - not that you notice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!CONTAINS ITZY BITZY MINOR SPOILERS!!!This movie is good, no doubt about it! I especially loved the sixties feel, very neatly captured by Spielberg. Leonardo is Leonardo as we know him, doing what he does best. Hanks is perfectly cast, and I was surprised that his face didn't bother me once, as it usually does.The story is intriguing and the tempo of the movie is high. Christopher Walken steals the picture with his exceptional performance.The father-son theme of the movie actually works very well which is a rarity for this kind of film.I would rate it 8/10, but (being a European) the depiction of the French police takes one point off the score. However the Music by Frank Williams, and the intro (which captures the spirit of both the film and the sixties) gives that point back.One could argue that the film idealizes Abigales criminal career, and that the morale of the film is, that as long as you do something good, everything will work out for you ? even if your special talent is crime. However, as this film is based on a true story, and since movies in my opinion are not supposed to lecture or mould the viewer, I stand by my 8/10 (even though the movie is not breathtaking, it's a tiny bit more than just professional work).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg seemed to falter with the overblown "A.I." - but since then, he's made two great films. Minority Report is a science-fiction classic, and now he's made a chase-caper film that's almost as good in its own way. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an excellent performance (definitely better than in Titanic) and Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken are also great - as usual. This is a fun and entertaining movie, but it's not forgettable or mindless, as many fun films are.</fullReview>

Hot on the trail of Gangs of New York, DiCaprio was very good... Can he now finally be forgiven for The Beach?! Perhaps these two should team up more often! I am definitely NOT the type to want the bad guy to escape, but found myself willing DiCaprio on! If only more "bad guys" could put their talents to better use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an absolute delight. It is lighthearted in tone (with a touch or two of darkness), breezily shot and acted, and painted in a kaleidoscope of '60s colors. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks get to retire their serious acting chops for a bit and seem to be truly enjoying their roles. The supporting cast is strong from top to bottom, especially Amy Adams as a clueless naif and a heartfelt turn by Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father. Concerning the story, the tale of Frank Abignale, jr. (DiCaprio) is as much a yarn about mankind's willingness to trust someone who says all the right things as it is a commentary on how confidence opens doors which, for you, should rightly remain shut. Spielberg, who has been producing heavy, ominous fare for the last decade or so (Schindler's List, Amistad, and Minority Report, just to name a few), puts a sense of magic and enjoyment into his movies that calls to mind earlier work like E.T.One final note: it's also amazing to note that what Frank Abignale did could never be duplicated--because of Frank Abignale himself. You'll have to see the movie or read the book to understand exactly what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Spielberg ever make a good movie again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had ended straight after the superb opening titles then perhaps I would think more highly of it. Well, initially, it's fairly average, with a fair dash of schmaltz, but nothing too terrible... but it goes on for so long. Chase movies shouldn't last 140 minutes. CMIYC continues Spielberg's inexplicable trend of dragging the ending on forever. Surprisingly, the one good thing about the movie is Tom Hanks, playing an up-tight obssessive FBI agent. But in the end, it ain't enough. I have now vowed never to see another Spielberg movie again after this waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the 1960's when Frank Abagnale Jr runs away from his crumbling family and begins the life of a fraudster, inpersonating a pilot, doctor and lawyer, and cashing millons in bad cheques all around the world. All before he had even turned eighteen.So begins a game of cat and mouse where the teenage Frank tries to stay one step ahead of the bumbling FBI Agent Carl Handratty who is trying to track him down. The escape scenes are a lot of fun, the father /son moments between Frank and his father are filled with heartwarming drama. But it is the relationship between Frank and Carl that is special. Right from the opening scene you know Frank is going to prison but you wonder how Carl will eventually catch him. And what a scene when it comes!Walken is great as Frank Snr.Hanks's Handratty is far from his best work, but that certainly does not mean he's bad. He's just not in Forest Gump mode.DiCaprio steals the show after being eclipsed by Day Lewis in GONY. He is outstanding in the role of the supremely confident fraudster Frank on one hand, as well as the vunerable kid who justs wants his family back together. It's a shame that he will probably miss out on an Oscar nomination , because he hasn't been this good since What's eating Gilbert Grape? Definately worth the ten year wait.9/10 - Great film - Based on the true story of the life of Frank Abagnale Jr, Catch me if you can is a treasure of a movie. The action moves at a pace, without seeming to move at all, and you are drawn in a moment from laughter to sadness and back again just as quickly. How refreshing to see a film that shows some originality! Thank you Mr Spielberg. Thank you Leonardo. You are both forgiven. (A.I, Minority Report, Titanic, The Beach....) More of the same PLEASE!!!</fullReview>

The fact that it is a real story makes it all the more better, and the performances are just unbelievable. Leonardo DiCaprio had the hardest task of making a movie that surpassed his performance in "Titanic", I feel that his portrayal of Frank Abnagale does this. Tom Hanks is always a joy to watch onscreen and can just about pull of any character that is given to him.I give this movie an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I had delayed seeing this movie for so long. I'm a Spielberg fan so I would usually not hesitate. Maybe I wasn't so sure how Leonardo Dicaprio would handle this role. Maybe it was because a ton of other "must-see" movies were out at the same time. Well, I finally saw and I'm glad. I can report that Dicaprio did a great job and that all the reviews criticizing Tom Hanks' Boston accent were wrong. I'm not saying his accent was perfect, far from it, but Hanks needed that little something to keep the viewer from thinking "Hey, that's Tom Hanks!" Hanks gives an understated performance that made me think that he is a better actor than I gave him credit for. (I know, I know he has two Best Actor Oscars) His mannerisms and the accent were different enough to allow me to accept his character and suspend my disbelief. Even if the acting had been horrible, the direction, the credit sequence, the music, the cinematography and the art direction would have me recommending this film. There were times when the story was poignant and bitter-sweet and moments where I found myself grinning in the theater. Any piece of art that can evoke emotion is a success on some level. I suggest seeing it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if you were a teenage kid, fast on your feet and possessing the gift of gab? What if you found that by wearing the right suit and faking some checks you could fly wherever you want, buy cool cars and get the sort of women here-to-fore only glimpsed in the pages of forbidden men's magazines? Would you say `Get thee behind me Satan'? Would you go back to church, sing in the choir and date plump little Suzie from down the street? Nah?neither would I, and neither did Frank Abagnale Jr., the `hero' of Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You CanIt's the early ?60s and Frank is a teenager in need of an escape. His beloved Dad's a crook, his French mom's a floozy and impending family bankruptcy has forced Frank out of his pricey private school and into the public school system. What's a boy to do but impersonate a teacher for a week to show the world what-for? The success of his prank coupled with a chance encounter with an airline pilot shows Frank a rather questionable solution to his problems. Soon Frank, resplendent in a filched Pan-Am uniform is caging rides on airliners, cashing forged paychecks and scoring with the Stews?just the type of therapy a mixed up kid needs. How this appealing young bunko artist is both brought to -and given a measure of - justice is the narrative thread of this absorbing fact based movie.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank as a bright, relatively normal kid who discovers natural talents well suited for a life of larceny. DiCaprio does an appealing job playing the character for simplicity and truth rather than the big effect. Tom Hanks plays Agent Carl Hanratty, the dogged FBI agent charged with catching Abagnale. Crusty to a fault but possessing a well-hidden streak of compassion, Hanratty battles both Frank and an FBI for who check-kiting is not high on the list of glamorous crimes.One of the strengths of the movie is the way DiCaprio lies. The problem with most movies involving conmen is that their cons are usually enacted with a wink and a smile. Because the grifters come across as transparently phony their marks seem imbecilic to fall for them. Not so in Catch Me If You Can. Frank Abagnale moved among intelligent professionals who knew much more about the subject he was lying about than he did. Frank would have had to prevaricate with complete conviction to pull off his con. DiCaprio captures this. Despite the fact we are in on his game, when Frank passes himself off as a pilot or cop we half believe him ourselves. The marks have no reason not to believe him. With Catch Me If You Can Spielberg is not straining for a blockbuster or trying to `hit one out of the park'. As a result the picture feels relaxed. Spielberg has an interesting story to tell and he delivers it like a master raconteur. It may not unseat Titanic at the box-office; it may not win a string of rewards. It does keep you constantly entertained, makes you care about Frank and Hanratty and gives you a sense of time well spent, an important feat in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which of us hasn't dreamed of succeeding in lots of fabulously high-profile careers? Doctor? Lawyer? Airline Pilot? For the past generation, the role model of escapist high achievement was given full power in the shape of James Bond, an ordinary looking upper class Englishman that achieved the impossible through fantastic gadgets and penetrating responses to life-threatening situations. But in the present day, the believability of a Bond-like secret agent is wearing thin. Similarly, the vicarious glamour of Hollywood stars is no longer a panacea to the wish-fulfilment dreams of working class drudgery. Enter stage left, appealing to everyone's slightly less than moral urges, Mr Frank Abagnale Jnr. And just to reinforce how it was possible to fake being a pilot, doctor and public prosecutor, we are reliably informed that it is all based on a true story.(Minor plot spoilers): A sudden victim of a broken home, the adolescent Frank Abagnale Jnr (Leonardo DiCaprio) hightails to New York, blagging a pilot's uniform to get a bit of respect, and brilliantly forging increasingly large cheques. He also fools the airlines. Tiring of parading and cocking his pilot hat to the infuriated airlines, he poses as a doctor, learning the lingo from the TV show Dr Kildare, before moving on to become an assistant public prosecutor. To evade escape, he recruits a bevy of eye-candy ?airline stewardesses', and leaves the country under the noses of dozens of FBI agents. Capture and prison sentences follow, but he gets off lightly and becomes a respected, megabucks-earning hero at the same time.Leonardo DiCaprio has tackled this real-life spoof with a professionalism that helps to make the film one that will possibly spawn look-alikes. His attention to detail included face to face research with the real life Abagnale and, even if the part does not demand the range of acting talent that instantly cries `Oscar', the skill with which he has executed his role marks him out as a very polished actor. Likewise Christopher Walken (as Abagnale Snr) turns in a first class performance and brings a range of emotion to his part (the beleaguered father) that is rare in Walken characters. Tom Hanks' performance, as the befuddled FBI agent trying to chase low-life Abagnale Jnr (who is patently of much higher intelligence than his pursuer), has restored my confidence in him as a Grade A actor ? especially after his rather wooden `Road to Perdition'. In the Director's chair, Spielberg has tackled something outside his usual stomping ground: Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted romp at heart, but delivered with such panache that it wins as an action thriller and psychological drama at the same time. For all its apparently lightweight pretensions, Catch Me If You Can is a fine achievement in popular filmmaking.</fullReview>

I saw this movie for three reasons: Hanks, Walken, Spielberg.DiCaprio surprised me. His acting was actually quite believable. Even though he's a 30-year-old playing a high school student, He seemed to fit the part. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken did not surprise me. I knew they could act before I saw this movie.The presentation lost this movie 2 points. It was presented as a comedy. Maybe I should have known that "Comedy" and "True Story" is a very unlikely combination. It had its funny moments, but Catch Me If You Can was actually pretty serious.Anyway, Spielberg gives us another movie worth seeing. Catch Me If You Can was a very well made movie. 8/10.</fullReview>

I could have taken my mother and not been embarrassed--and that's pretty rare these days.Although I might quibble a bit with some of the flashing forward and backward that makes the story a little confusing, this was an enjoyable film overall--nice cast, great score, good location filming, mostly accurate sixties period details.

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks stole the acting in this movie. Although Leonardo was impressive I feel he still lacks any real convincing character with any of his movies. He just seems to act the same whereas Tom Hanks will slide into his role and tune in perfectly. Thus said the film itself has it's moments. Has a few flaws (rare for most movies not to though) but casting that aside and releasing it's a movie (based on a true story) it's enjoyable. I am not one for spilling out the plot on movies but are we, the public, really think that Leonardo can pull off being a young 16 year old at the beginning of the movie?? Maybe when he was in "The Beach" movie he looked alot younger but he is past that age now so that was very unconvincing! It did tend to drag on a bit in places but then we are amused with the way Leonardo's character is always misleading/tricking Tom Hanks and escaping. Makes a bit of a mockery of the FBI so let's hope they don't have any more "Tom Hanks" guys working at the bureau anymore. I think it's a "one viewing movie" title but would perhaps watch it on TV but wouldn't go out of my way to record or buy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1960s a young man named Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Di Caprio) forged his way into a lifestyle that included designer clothing, girls and flying. His story is a fascinating study of how na?ve the world was then and how easy it was for an intelligent man to convince people that he was genuine. Have times really changed? Steven Spielberg is still channelling Stanley Kubrick and he delivers a dark comedy, which moves at a frenetic pace underscored by a jazzy soundtrack. On the surface, this film looks fluffy and brainless but take a look at the way the director uses things we take for granted. There are numerous references to Christmas in this film and forget the jolly holiday ? Christmas is presented as a dark and lonely time when bad things happen and loneliness digs its claws in. FBI Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) works on Christmas Eve and receives a call from a guilty Abagnale, a small Christmas tree one of the only sources of light in the room. Abagnale's discovery in France is at Christmas time while carollers sing pious songs. Abagnale is arrested outside his mother's new home; never getting to enjoy the Christmas treats inside. The world is presented according to Kubrick who believed that the world was a thoroughly unlikeable place and people cruel and self obsessed. This is one of the major themes in this film. Frank's father (an excellent Christopher Walken) is hounded by the IRS and abandoned by his French wife Paula (Nathalie Baye) and remains a broken shell of a man, still clinging to the sham that is the American Dream, never realising his full potential. His son runs away from all this pain, and running is an important motif in the film, and seeks solace through money. An ironic film reference to Forrest Gump (1994 ) involves a banknote floating in front of Tom Hanks reinforcing thematically that this race is for money, not fulfilment or spiritual comfort. Hanratty is just as obsessed as Abagnale and that the two should end up together is one of the film's strongest metaphors. Spielberg does not show us the whole story. He cuts and jumps and never gives us the full picture ? what is left out is just as intriguing as what is shown. There is resonance in the gaps and silences in the film and the symbols further enhance the ride. Lots of this film takes place in temporary accommodation such as hotels and rented apartments. Hotels being the symbol for transience and impermanence, the rooms are filled with trolleys of half eaten food, consumed alone, and the family home is broken up by debt early on in the film. Everyone in the film is eager for something greener ? the young girls duped into becoming stewardesses, the na?ve Brenda (Amy Adams) who is manipulated by parents and lovers alike and Hanratty himself, who is searching obsessively for his Holy Grail in the form of Abagnale. Hanratty never tries to understand Abagnale and even mispronounces his name. He is a loner who has no time for people only results.The score by John Williams (unlike his usual stuff) enhances the film and there are some very clever credits, which reinforce the feel of the era. There are sloppy errors in the production design, which are annoying, but the look of the film is one of its biggest assets. Spielberg uses period camera angles and editing and the photography is a delight. Janusz Kaminski knows his way around a camera and uses it to tell a story, to characterise and to make subtle points. An example is when Frank Jr meets a young woman in a hotel corridor. The camera focuses on the shoes of each character. Shoes in themselves being sexual symbols gives the scene much more resonance that if it were conventionally filmed.Spielberg has certainly grown up as a director. AI (2001) was a great film. That the general public didn't get its cynical take on humankind says a lot about how audiences see movies and how they are manipulated to accept the trite and the banal. Minority Report (2002) was a dark, brooding satisfying film and Catch Me If You Can while not as cerebral as the previous two, still does not fail to entertain and to please. This little black duck was very pleased thank you very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg did it again! What an entertaining film for all to enjoy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so many film releases all at once that it's easy to (dis)miss Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me If You Can." It is a breeze of a film - thoroughly enjoyable. Such entertaining drama with humor, suspense, family ties, FBI stories, based on true events from the life and times of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hollywood or not, it doesn't matter. C'est si bon. Spielberg made it seem so easily done - right after the June release of "Minority Report". Just the opening credit sequence sets the tone of the film. Its animation is so cool that you'd know it's going to be fun. The ever prolific Maestro John Williams, a regular in Spielberg films, once again provided the accompanying tempo to the plot lines. Watching Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) and Tom Hanks (as FBI agent Carl Hanratty) interact is such a treat. The vintage Christopher Walken (after such a wonderful low key performance in "The Opportunists" 2000, again) gave an endearingly subtle portrayal as Frank Abagnale Sr. - how can Frank Jr. not do everything he can to regain the financial status to his Dad, and win Mom back? There lies the loving ties of father and son, but is it reciprocal or blind-sighted? Besides being an 'innocent' con artist, Frank is quite skilful with graphic arts. Seeing him burnishing those PAN AM logos tack down reminds me of my graphic design days before Mac's and PCs - intently applying careful peeling, cut and paste techniques, burnishing those Pantone transfer types... The set production and art department really brought the 60's back to life. Cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and film editing by Michael Kahn - both are veterans in Spielberg films.Behind all the cheeriness, there are bleak reality moments. After all, this is still life on earth. Lucky for Frank Jr., through all the cat and mouse hiding and chasing, agent Hanratty became almost like a surrogate father to him. Glad to see Nathalie Baye was chosen to play Frank's mother. She is one of my favorite French character actresses, since her role in Bertrand Tavernier's "A Week's Vacation" 1980, to her 1999 "Venus Beaute Institut" and "An Affair of Love" - always she delivers with such simple ease.This film does remind me of "Chameleon Street" 1989 - Wendell B. Harris Jr. wrote the screenplay based on true events, directed and portrayed con man William Douglas Street (who took on a myriad number of roles than just 3). There's also Tony Curtis in "The Great Impostor" 1960, directed by Robert Mulligan.Thanks to the genius of Spielberg for letting us enjoy a psychological suspense drama in a lively and fun mode. Everyone involved in the production probably had a marvelous time collaborating. The audience certainly did. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORTH CATCHING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime doesn't pay... or does it? Either way, Leonardo DiCaprio looks like he's having quite a bit of fun in the new Steven Spielberg film CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. Based on the true events of con-artist extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr., CATCH tells the story of a boy from a broken home who dealt with his problems by pretending to be someone else, and cashing in by doing so. The movie opens with FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) transferring a sickly and slightly older version of Frank Jr. from a French prison to America. We then flashback to six years prior. Frank Jr. is living with with his seemingly happy parents, and all feels right with the world. Things quickly change. His father (Christopher Walken) is having serious IRS problems, resulting in a major downgrade in the family lifestyle. Frank Jr. goes to a new high school, where he finds enjoyment fooling his classmates into thinking he's a substitute teacher. Thus begins his obsession with trickery. Back at home, his mom appears to be cheating with Frank Sr.'s wealthy friend, played quietly by a somewhat pudgy James Brolin. Divorce soon follows, and Frank Jr. can't handle it. He runs away, immediately bouncing checks in an effort to live on his own. After seeing the unusual amount of high respect received by airline pilots, he concocts a plan to pose as one. His new look allows him to cash "payroll" checks easily, and he begins raking in the dough. Taking things one step further, Frank Jr. even uses his persona to fly all over the world for free. It isn't long before the FBI gets wind of what's going on, and agent Hanratty becomes determined to stop the thief behind it all. And so the chase begins. Frank Jr. manages to stay one step ahead of his pursuer, eventually posing as a doctor and even a lawyer, all the while never realizing what he really needs to be content. Women find him charming, and the newspapers practically glorify his actions. He finds time to communicate with his father, who surprisingly never disagrees with Frank Jr.'s methods, though it's obvious he feels his son is going to lose control. Meanwhile Hanratty is risking his own career by repeatedly letting the thief slip through his fingers.CATCH is an engaging film to say the least. One can only wonder how a person was cunning enough to pull all these acts off. Spielberg directs with fairly minimalist style. There's not many fancy shots here, but rather several moments of subtle humor. One James Bond-related gag helps make the movie shine, and generates some great laughs. DiCaprio and Hanks handle their roles well. Leo can still make us believe he's young, and it's hard to not like him in this role. Hanks is fun to watch, and his rather thick accent makes up for his otherwise nerdy character traits. We know he's the good guy, but almost view him as that strict librarian type who just doesn't know how to have fun. He's by the book, and Leo isn't, which creates a terrific character contrast. Walken turns in a fairly good performance as well, playing the tortured father figure who only wants the best for his son. Jennifer Garner fans can look for her to pop in and out as a former model turned prostitute. Unfortunately it's a "blink and you'll miss her" role. Other actors appearing here include Martin Sheen as the wealthy father of an innocent girl Frank Jr. proposes to, and Amy Adams as the girl in question. Also take time to appreciate the smooth score composed by the one and only John Williams.If there's any negative points here, one could easily say that the film runs rather long at 140 minutes. The opening of the picture also gives away the fact that Frank gets caught, which might have been better left until the end. There is a very unusual solution to all the problems he causes, making the film particularly unique. Spielberg has crafted an enjoyable flick that brings back the feeling of the late sixties, and appropriately tells the story of a truly interesting man... er... kid..On a scale of ONE to TEN, 10 being the best, I give CATCH ME IF YOU CAN a 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio since Titanic, he outshines Tom Hanks in this true life story. From the opening credits to the closing credits, this movie really makes you believe that you're back in the 60's, and keeps you going from beginning to end. DiCaprio captures the part of the con-artist Frank Abagnale perfectly, in a very believable performance. He's 200 percent on the mark. Tom Hanks is good as the detective, maybe not 100 percent on target but still good. Christopher Walken is excellent as Abagnale's father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS IN REVIEW***A breezy, very enjoyable film from the title credits onwards, Steven Spielberg's latest, 'Catch Me If You Can' is not a particularly important film from the blockbuster man, but it's good, guilt-free fun for a couple of hours. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man, son of a stationery store owner and a mother from provincial France, whose life is suddenly torn apart when his apparently in love parents announce their imminent divorce. Young Abagnale panics at the very notion of his parents being apart and hot foots it down the streets of NYC. After this spontaneous running away, Frank Jr. must somehow make a living?which leads to the idea of forging bank cheques. This forgery doesn't go unnoticed by the FBI, where Special Agent Carl Hanratty (a bespectacled Tom Hanks) is on the case, desperate to track down the chameleonic Abagnale. After some credible impersonations of pilots, doctors, CIA agents and lawyers (and a few others), Abagnale has racked up almost $4 million and the FBI is close to tracking him down?At 140 minutes, the film feels a little too long, although the time doesn't drag with the proceedings. DiCaprio is excellent as Abagnale, Christopher Walken is tragically funny as Frank, Sr. and Hanks is good as the always-on-the-job, Hanratty. As I said, it's not a particularly significant film in Spielberg's career, but it's a lot of fun. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a wonderful movie, although some of the more adult scenes could be limited and the end was rather predictable. I saw it with some friends, who also enjoyed it quite a bit. Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job, boosting his image after such titles as The Beach... Tom Hanks was great as well. I can't wait to see it again once it is released on VHS or DVD. Somewhat long, but it feels like 3 smaller movies all rolled into one large package. Younger people may not understand most of what is going on, but the story is good nonetheless. Bits of humor are added to make it even more crowd-appealing. Overall, it was a very good movie, a good reenactment of the true story (at least from what I've heard), and it deserves some recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a team!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has brought Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio together in what could have been a small film, but becomes great entertainment in the hands of these masters! One of my favorite things about this movie is something I didn't even notice until towards the end-- Spielberg adds his unique touches ('Spielbergian') without overwhelming the film. His restraint and professionalism truly shine here. Hanks is excellent as always, and DiCaprio continues to show his growth as a fine actor. It's only a matter of time before he wins his Oscar in the right vehicle (this isn't it). I saw 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me If You Can' within a week of each other. I would easily pay to see this film again, but not the other (even though 'Gangs' is quite good. And by the way, this film is much more re-watchable than Spielberg's other film this year, 'Minority Report'). This movie has a great 60's sheen to it. I hope it gets an Oscar nomination for Best Costume! The audience I was with enjoyed this bad-boy-on-the-run caper, rooting for him vociferously. And what makes it so special is that it's based on a true story. This film makes me want to read more about Abagnale. I recently saw an interview with him, and he stated that the movie correctly captured the essence of what his life was like then; that's as high a compliment as is needed. I had a feeling that the real Abagnale had a cameo somewhere, and I was right. In reading the credits he shows up as a French police officer! For the films that were released in 2002, there are only two that I can universally recommend to ANYONE. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', and this movie. 'Greek Wedding' would get a slightly more vigorous nod because of a bad swear word said by Hanks in this that might offend some; but it was the FUNNIEST line of the movie! This may win no Oscars, but it's GREAT entertainment! ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A game show, To Tell the Truth, opens the film Catch Me If You Can, a beguiling new comedy by Steven Spielberg. Three men, each wearing a pilot's uniform, appear on stage purporting to be the authentic Frank Abagnale Jr., a con man and impersonator who eluded the FBI from 1964 to 1966 until he was captured when he was only 19. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the real Abagnale, while the others are simply pretenders.Based on a book by Abagnale and Stan Redding, Catch Me If You Can is breezy entertainment served up with big bucks written all over it. Big name stars, popular director, sympathetic criminals, and John Williams' great jazz score, all that glitters in Tinseltown. It asks to be taken at face value and does not aspire to any great heights or depths -- there are no intimate revelations of a man's soul. Told in extended flashbacks, the film describes Abignale's exploits as he pretended to be a schoolteacher, airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer, and, in the process, cashed more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks. His feats were ostensibly in reaction to the impending divorce of his parents, but while the real Frank Abagnale has said that he did it mostly for money, power, and women, Spielberg's Frank is just an innocent child trying to put his family back together.After the game show, the scene flashes to Frank being escorted to an American prison by FBI agent Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, who has to force a self-conscious Boston accent throughout the film. Flashing back again to 1963 in New Rochelle, N.Y., where Frank's father, Frank Abagnale, Sr., played by Christopher Walken in one of his better performances, finds himself in trouble with the IRS (we never find out the substance of this trouble). In reaction to his father's woes, Frank Jr. shows his mettle early on, impersonating a substitute teacher at his new school with rare authority (I never had a substitute teacher that convincing). At first, dad shows a fatherly admiration and concern, but that changes later. When his parents go through a divorce, Junior runs away from home, taking with him only the checkbook his father gave him on an account containing $25. He learns pretty fast that a bounced personal check will not help much, but a fake company check from Pan Am Airlines will do wonders. Now all he needs is a new pilot's uniform and he's got money to spend and girls chasing him by the bucket full.Frank moves on from one impersonation to another. He eventually turns minor check fraud into an entire lifestyle of false identities and counterfeit checks and ends up on the FBI's ten most wanted list. It's a lot of fun watching the FBI dufuses giving chase. They look right, but never seem to know what they're doing, and Hanratty falls for Abagnale's cons on more than one occasion. The well-meaning but bumbling Hanratty is always hot on his trail, closing in but never making the kill. Catch Me if You Can has a somewhat surreal look, with a feeling of heightened reality and brightened colors. Underneath the veneer, however, is a view of the 60s as unreal as is Far From Heaven's view of the 50s. The movie wants us to know that "in those days" a scam artist could get away with everything because we were so na?ve and so trusting, and a smart scammer could take advantage of the way banks and businesses were willing to cash checks for anyone who looked respectable.Of course we are way more grown up now. Now fraud and deception is only carried out at the highest levels, beyond the light-hearted cameras of Mr. Spielberg. Abagnale is the perfect American entrepreneur, inventing a whole new species of criminality for the rest of us to admire. He is the movie version of everyman, a con artist in a society uncertain of its values. We admire people like him because he stands outside the system and, like the Mafiosos we pay homage to in our popular culture, has turned criminality into an art form and added a little charm. There is little difference between him and the FBI agents who use illegal methods to spy on civilians, corporation executives that make millions on questionable stock options, political leaders who try to convince us of the necessity of war, or ballplayers who use steroids to bolster their mediocre abilities. The only difference between them and Frank Abagnale is that their stories have no sex appeal and would be of limited interest to Steven Spielberg.Abagnale, confidently interpreted by DiCaprio, is, on the surface, the epitome of cool, yet underneath he is just as hollow as the society that elevates individuals without integrity into folk heroes. Just like our corporate executives, our advertising promoters, and some political leaders, Abagnale demonstrates the sharpness of a quick-change artist who snuggles his way into our confidence, exhibiting smooth-talking sincerity while camouflaging his lies and deceptions. Unwittingly, Catch Me If You Can has shown us the true culprit. Yes Pogo, we have met the enemy and he is us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One not to miss - that means you too, Oscar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I should probably declare my bias - I am definitely NOT a Speilberg fan. So when I heard the hoopla on this film - as yet another gem from the Speilberg stable I was sceptical. However, I did find two reasons to overcome my aversion to Steve and go anyway - the fact that it is based on a real-life person (hey, it might be educational) and secondly, that it signals the end of a two-year hiatus for DiCaprio. Okay, okay - I'm sure there are quite a few of you out there who base his entire career on Titanic - but for those of us who have seen a number of his smaller, 'indie' projects you'll know what I mean.And, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Gone are the long build-ups that Speilberg favours. Out, too, goes all of the schmaltz he has tended to dollop onto his movies of late. And, probably best of all, he gives us a movie in which Tom Hanks doesn't cry (oh come on, name another one!). Instead we get a tightly-scripted foray into the world of grand larceny through the eyes of a 17-year old boy.DiCaprio and Walken are both brilliant in their respective roles. Walken is both endearing and infuriating as the idealistic dreamer of a father who can't (or won't) understand why the IRS keep pursuing him for his taxes. DiCaprio, on the other hand, pulls off a double-whammy by being both enigmatic enough to be able to pull off the con-jobs while at the same time, never allowing you to forget that he is only a boy. DiCaprio's treatment of 'Frank' is neither condescending or trite - something many actors today could learn when playing teenagers.However, that is not to say the movie is without its flaws. The first is Hanks. Often held up to be one of the greatest actors today, here he flounders against not only DiCaprio and Walken but against much of the supporting cast as well. He just doesn't seem to be able to find a rhythm for his character and instead seems to be trying a different tack in each scene.The other flaw is that obsessive need of many American directors to bring psychological theory into their movies to increase the dramatic gravitas. We do not need to be told the reasons why 'Frank' embarked on his crime spree for two reasons: 1, DiCaprio has already done it for him through his sensitive, three-dimensional portrayal of 'Frank'; and 2, because the charm of this kind of movie ultimately resides in the fact that each of us find a certain appeal in 'Frank's' actions - both the audacity and the flair he shows in being able to pull off these heists. In saying all of that, this movie is one not to miss - and that means you too, Oscar. DiCaprio was robbed for What's Eating Gilbert Grape - don't let it happen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a lot of fun watching this movie! Leonardo DiCaprio was given the role of a lifetime -- he is perfect for the role of a teenager who can pass for an adult, and he makes the most of it. Teaming him with Christopher Walken as his father was a stroke of genius, as the two really resemble one another, something that never would have occurred to me. Both of them are great, and Tom Hanks has fun with his role, too. (I find it interesting that the Hanks role was offered first to James Gandolfini, but he had to turn it down due to his commitments to "The Sopranos". I can imagine what a great comic turn Gandolfini would have had with this role as the perplexed, straight-laced FBI agent.)And Steven Spielberg, who inherited this film from other directors, took it and made it into a truly enjoyable experience. It is probably the lightest, funniest Spielberg movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest film from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks is much more than a vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio, who is granted the most screen time by far, it is a massively entertaining film about the true life adventures (and I should think that the word ?adventures' should apply here in all possible meanings) of Frank Abagnale Jr., a brilliant young man who's con artist abilities are revealed in a thrilling early scene where he impersonates a substitute teacher, going so far as to turn away the real substitute when she shows up to teach class. We are not shown how he is caught after committing this relatively small-time offense, because the last thing we want in our minds about this character is how he gets caught at something. Instead, we see his parents sitting in the principal's office, where the principal reveals to them that their son has been teaching class for the last week, assigning homework, having parent/teacher conferences, and was even planning a field trip. His mother is furious, as most mothers would be, being, I think, the real rulers of the house, while his father was proud of his son's sneakiness as, I also think, many fathers would be (except for the uptight ones, of course). I know MY father would have loved it if I managed something like that in high school. (spoilers) It seems that Frank has a brilliant mind that he applies to not the mot legal avenues, and his home life is less than wonderful. He comes home one day to discover his mother having an affair with one of his father's friends, and when he eventually finds out, instead of writing a name on that little form to choose which parent he wanted to live with, he jumps out the window and runs away, beginning the adventure that we learn about during the rest of the movie. Granted, Catch Me If You Can is one of those films where the plot from beginning to end is revealed in the preview (kind of like Pleasantville), but it is still a thrilling ride, which is a testament to the talent involved with it.One of the most interesting elements of the movie is the way it is structured. It knows that it is a predictable film, not only because it starts at the end but because it is a true story and true stories that end tragically are not made into movies (at least not by Spielberg), so the chronology is mixed up at several points during the film. We start at the end, go back to the beginning for a while, go back to just before the end, a little past the end, back to the middle, etc. Not necessarily in that order, but the way the chronological order of events is skewed in the film makes it refreshing even if we already know what it going to happen.The only problem that I had with the movie was that, despite its ending, there were several things about the movie that were just too convenient. As only a single example, there is a scene late in the film when Frank is being transported back home from France to go to prison in America, and after finding out that his father fell down the stairs and died, he runs into the bathroom, escapes from the plane Commando-style in broad daylight, and runs on foot all the way back to his house. I realize that the movie takes place before cell-phones and even in the early days of two way radios, but you would think that it would not take the FBI the ENTIRE DAY to get to his house, the most obvious place that he was headed. In real life, there would have been squad cars waiting for him long before he jogged back, which makes me wonder how this particular detail played out in real life, if it did at all.Either way, it is clear that this scene is, as they say, dramatized for effect, which makes you wonder how much of the rest of the story is as well. There is also one other scene that sticks out for this reason like a bright red flag. About two thirds of the way through the film, virtually the entire staff of the FBI are at the Miami airport, because this is the only airport that Abagnale will use (the only reason given for this, by the way, is because this is the airport where Hanratty, the agent assigned to capture Abagnale, has set up his stake-out). They are looking everywhere for Abagnale to show up, and after his girlfriend sets him up, he goes to local universities signing up a whole crew of flight attendants for a two-month flight attendant training tour throughout Europe.We are never told how he managed to get PanAm to let these fraudulent attendants on the plane when they show up at the airport, or where their uniforms came from, or whether they were all on the same flight or PanAm was nice enough to spread them throughout their entire airline corporation, but the gimmick is that Abagnale is able to walk through the entire airport surrounded by gorgeous young women, and all the police officers and FBI agents their to capture him would be so distracted by all the hotties that they wouldn't even notice him. So here's problem #1: Abagnale is going for the art of invisibility, and there are few things less invisible than a lot of beautiful young women wearing matching pink uniforms. Very few things, in fact, would attract MORE attention to his little group of followers. Problem #2: If you see a whole group of beautiful young women wearing matching pink uniforms walking in a grinning little group with only a single male within the group, that male attracts at least as much attention as the women. Meaning, if you see that many women walking and giggling together and they are only with a single man, not many people wouldn't be scrambling to see who that man is. In both cases, Abagnale might as well hold up a blinking sign with his name on it.Of course, as with many other scenes within the movie that are just entirely too convenient, Hanratty is on the phone and facing away just as Abagnale walks by with his big pink group of buddies, but has the brilliant foresight to have a look-alike waiting outside with a big sign with Hanratty's name on it, another little detail more than likely added to the story for our amusement in the film version. Like I said, a lot of this stuff is not very likely to have happened, at least not exactly as we see it in the movie, in real life, but it's also not entirely without effect and not entirely unappreciated. Spielberg is America's most popular director, and in this movie he proves that he knows how to present a chase. A good chase film has to be structured with a series of close calls and more comfortable moments. You remember this in The Fugitive, for example, when Richard Kimble is cornered by Sam Gerard in the tunnel on the dam, only to escape by jumping off right in front of him. There is a wonderful scene in Catch Me If You Can where Hanratty finds Abagnale's hotel room and bursts in with a gun, at which point we are sure there's no escape, but Frank manages to impersonate a CIA officer right in front of Hanratty, an agent for the FBI, and narrowly escapes, to the audience's great delight. Again, not exactly the most believable stuff in the world, but it sure is fun.Leonardo DiCaprio has made a tremendous leap both in his choice of roles to play and in his acting skills as a whole. He has certainly come a long way from his chokingly awful performance in Titanic, to play a role in Catch Me If You Can that he seems born to play. The only problem with him in this role is that he is a 28-year-old actor who happens to be able to pass for a 16-year-old kid, when what the part needs is a 16-year-old actor who can, when necessary, pass for a 28-year-old man. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, is absolutely flawless in his role as the driven FBI agent determined to capture Abagnale, even if he asks him nicely to leave him alone. And I don't want to hear any complaints about Hanks' accent, because he captured it beautifully. If you really want to whine and moan about a well-known actor doing a fake accent, watch Thirteen Days. Overall, Catch Me If You Can has some flaws, it has a few scenes that go beyond the expected suspension of disbelief, but these scenes seem to have just been too ambitious in a movie that maybe was turning out even better than expected. In that sense, these scenes are little more than a slight excursion over the top, while the movie as a whole shines and entertains, even for the slightly lengthy running time. It was a sad and moving scene when Frank's father's death was revealed, and his mother strangely disappeared in the movie into the oblivion of her marriage to her father's friend (the one she had been having the affair with), but as a whole the movie is wonderful entertainment for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Note to self: Make a lot of fake checks, buy James Bond suit, work for FBI.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest film from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks is much more than a vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio, who is granted the most screen time by far, it is a massively entertaining film about the true life adventures (and I should think that the word ?adventures' should apply here in all possible meanings) of Frank Abagnale Jr., a brilliant young man who's con artist abilities are revealed in a thrilling early scene where he impersonates a substitute teacher, going so far as to turn away the real substitute when she shows up to teach class. We are not shown how he is caught after committing this relatively small-time offense, because the last thing we want in our minds about this character is how he gets caught at something. Instead, we see his parents sitting in the principal's office, where the principal reveals to them that their son has been teaching class for the last week, assigning homework, having parent/teacher conferences, and was even planning a field trip. His mother is furious, as most mothers would be, being, I think, the real rulers of the house, while his father was proud of his son's sneakiness as, I also think, many fathers would be (except for the uptight ones, of course). I know MY father would have loved it if I managed something like that in high school. (spoilers) It seems that Frank has a brilliant mind that he applies to not the mot legal avenues, and his home life is less than wonderful. He comes home one day to discover his mother having an affair with one of his father's friends, and when he eventually finds out, instead of writing a name on that little form to choose which parent he wanted to live with, he jumps out the window and runs away, beginning the adventure that we learn about during the rest of the movie. Granted, Catch Me If You Can is one of those films where the plot from beginning to end is revealed in the preview (kind of like Pleasantville), but it is still a thrilling ride, which is a testament to the talent involved with it.One of the most interesting elements of the movie is the way it is structured.

		<fullReview>My first and only criterion for enjoying a film is whether I'm absorbed. To the point where I don't think about time and think like the characters and consider them real. A fairly simple yet powerful measure.This film abosorbed me. A fascinating plot, very good acting, and even though we know the ending, suspense. It helps not to know before exactly what fields the fake entered, just to add a little more. A plain, good ole entertaining movie in the best spirit of Hollywood. I suppose uppity types won't be impressed, since it lacks the weirdness so many critics seem to crave in "critically acclaimed" movies.Bottom line: was the ticket worth it, was the time well spent? A resounding yes. Highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun little character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun little story with three great performances. When I heard about the plot, I instantly thought of an old Tony Curtis movie THE GREAT IMPOSTOR, which is one of my all-time favorites. While this one doesn't quite have the timing or panache of that old gem, it holds up on its own terms surprizingly well.&lt;Possible spoiler warning!&gt; The best thing about this film is the way two pro actors like Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are used in juxtaposition to each other. I thought the combination worked very well. It was also good fun to watch Leo go from a gawky high-school teen to a "wise beyond his years" slobbish 20-yo(!). Some of Leo's scenes are a bit too posturing (like the printing press scene), but I thought the story played smoothly most of the way through. And Christopher Walken gave a nice understated performance as the old Dad, which seems to be his stock-in-trade character nowadays.Certainly a great film to watch, which tries to catch some of the panache of the old comic classics; and almost succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this movie as compelling as it is must be that it's based on a true story. Otherwise, it would just be fiction about some fictional liar...man, was it intelligent. You can see irony, voice, wit and sarcasm splashed throughout this gem of a film. It kept everyone in the theatre entertained, young and old alike. I'm 17 and I thought it was brilliant. This is because the story, at its roots, is the realization of every brief, passing dream of wealth, notoriety and grandeur we have ever had. That is all we want, all that Frank wanted: the notoriety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Abagnale: The Real Life Pretender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They said truth is stranger then fiction, and this movie is direct proof of that. Leonardo DiCaprio really shines in his performance has Frank Abagnale, who forged checks and posed has a Co-pilot, Lawyer, and Doctor. And he was'nt even twenty one. He seems to pull it off nicely. Until one day one of his forged checks gets spotted by uptight FBI agent Carl Hanratty(played very well by Tom Hanks). Who soon sets out to find him. And it now becomes a game of cat and mouse. This movie was also good for it's 60's look. And beautifully directed by Steven Spielberg. I hope he gets nominated for best director. One of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this was a good movie, well acted, and thankfully not 'over the top'. the story moved along very well.sure, there wasn't really a HUGE climatic point in the movie, but it sure kept my interest from the opening animated credits (with the cat &amp; mouse type music) all the way to the end. i'm not really interested in altogether how abagnale pulled it all off, but rather that he just did is amazing given that it was only a little less than 40 years ago. whether or not hank's character or walken's characters in the movie were accurately portrayed, i enjoyed their characters very much. ...as said in my first sentence: not over the top, to me, which is WAY more realistic than any thing else. hanks was an fbi agent doing his job, nothing more. yes, i'm guessing here, but i'm sure there are numerous amounts of fbi agents with the same low key persona that hanks portrayed. oh, i especially enjoyed the relationship hanks and LdC developed in the movie--kudo's to spielberg on this movie and john williams for an enjoyable stray from his other movie music.~janet</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LdC wasn't too bad in this movie. Great having a face that can either be 16, or 29, depending upon the scene/era. I was at a bit of a loss though ... when Hanks went to France, it was in December 1967, however, he and Leonardo were on the plane home in December 1969. Did Hanks stay in France for two years, or was that a bad continuity call? Lastly, in 1961, Tony Curtis did a similar job to LdC in 'The Great Impoostor'. At least in that movie, he was good at what he did, no matter whether it was as a doctor, or a prison shrink! LdC's role seemed to more of a case of "I wanna be a doctor, even though I'm totally clueless!'6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonardo is excellent as Frank Jr and so are Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. The plot is great for a true story in the sense that you don't always know what is going to happen next, there are some surprises. It was one of the first time that a beautiful lady played by a famous actress wasn't in the action of the movie. In fact, there is none. Yes, there are many ladies, but they have little screen time and they aren't famous. So, it was a fresh aspect here for a Leonardo movie that I liked. The plot is entertaining because you're asking yourself when he'll get caught. (if you know that he gets caught) The way he fools everyone is also very funny to watch. The dates were a little bit confusing but it wasn't very important. Sometimes, some scenes are boring and you want to get to the action. At the end, you hope that it end because it's a long movie, but it's worth it.It is not the best movie that I've seen. Live some people pointed out, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, it wasn't dramatic enough to be a drama. It was something unusual that could have been god, but I think that Spielberg didn't spend too much time on this movie. So it gives us a good movie... close to even be very good...  8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few directors out there that can make a great film but it is even rarer for a director to make two great films in one year. Steven Spielberg will try to be one of those rare directors. Earlier this year, Spielberg directed the critically praised Minority Report, which gathered more praise for its box office battle with Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg attempts to breathe new box office life into the career of Leonardo DiCaprio by adding the mix of Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will this experiment work and showcase the reasons why Spielberg is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood or will this one of the very few flaws in his career?The story goes that Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents but things begin to change very quickly. His family moves to a small apartment after his father runs into trouble with the IRS. Frankie's parents soon divorce after his mother begins to cheat on her husband. This drives the confused boy to run away from home. Frank makes a good life for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot becoming the James Bond of the skies. But he runs from that job after an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty begins the chase to capture him. Hanratty will go to the ends of the earth just to catch him. The story, which was based on a true story, was well done but felt too weighted. Some of the elements seemed too unbelievable for the audience to really accept. And some areas of the story seemed to last too long that in the end they felt flat for the most part.The characters in the film were all based on real life people. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr. It really wasn't much of a stretch for him to play a ladies' man but it had been some time since he played a character that was like the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused character who continues the chase not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty to fill that void he is missing with his family. DiCaprio shows great acting ability especially in the end expressing this character. Agent Hanratty is not an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but it is a character which seems like he had a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is great as Frank Abagnale Sr. playing off Leonardo DiCaprio very well especially in facial expressions. It is a shame that his character is not given a good send off in the film rather then the plain ending his character gets.Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly not one of his greatest. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic films offered by Spielberg but Catch Me really seems slow and flat in certain areas of the film. Some of the characters were flat in some areas. Christopher Walken's character is great but sent off in a good way. At least there should have been something there for the audience for feel sorry for when his son is told his father is dead. Jennifer Garner's character, though nicely performed by the Alias star, seemed pointless in the overall effect of the film. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can. If not, don't worry too much about it.My Rating: **** out of 5</fullReview>

Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Walken are wonderful. The plot is intriguing and had me to the very end. The characters are very well developed and are presented in a very authentic and real fashion. The visuals are absolutely astounding and the editing and direction are outstanding. The film is never slow or pretentious and is stays true to what it is. The motifs of the film and its style and tone are displayed wonderfully throughout. John Williams has not written such a fine score in years and Spielberg is once again at the top! Five stars! A Real Winner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great escape from a January storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg, Martin Sheen, Leonardo DeCaprio and James Brolin -- what do they have in common besides a solid liberal base? They, along with always great Tom Hanks, entertained us for a few hours. All of us really liked this film, a rather serious story turned farce by the escapades of DeCaprio. With Hanks and DeCaprio obsessed with each other -- both dependent upon the other for existence, really -- Catch Me If You Can ended in a very satisfactory way. All the women were portrayed as silly, giggly, and super-credulous, making DeCaprio's jobs quite easy to arrange. The striped scarf and matching cap on a stewardess were wild. Watch the movement and the disappearance of the small gift (on the table at the "expensive restaurant") DeCaprio tries to give his father/mentor/role model, played superbly by Christopher Walken. DeCaprio's first deceit -- as the substitute French teacher-- set the tone for this film -- great, entertaining with a touch of sadness for the troubled son of troubled parents. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't believe I've ever seen a Stephen Spielberg, before this one, that was NOT branded with his particular mass-appeal style. At some point in his films, I usually feel poked in the ribs--okay, here's the punch-line from your All-American Boy, I-Love-The-Movies Director. His direction in Catch Me is coherent and strong without being intrusive, putting the story first.Not that I want to start on a negative note. Catch Me is a really good film--funny, human--and different, for Hollywood, which usually likes its young male heroes to be hip, horny and heartless. Frank has a disarming vulnerability and attachment to his family. That lost-boy thread saves his story from being about someone who uses people, and it makes the movie.Fine acting from Di Caprio and Walken. Even the opening credits are first-rate--clever and entertaining, but leading the viewer to the credits, rather than distracting from them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story about Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) who becomes a con artist after leaving home in his late teen ages. Good entertainment, but sometimes ends up moving quite slow. Personalities are just as Hollowood shallow as always, which is the main reason why this movie can't score.Compared to The Talented Mr Ripley or the French original Plein Soleil this movie is nothing, and it is a complete mystery to me why 2 out of 3 guys in the IMDb staff rated this movie as a 10. I thought one should be careful with that mark.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has many things in it that work - most of the performances, a great Saul Bass-like opening title sequence, John Williams' score and terrific art direction. But it really is just fluff - there isn't much substance to it at all. Hey, look at this young con man who ripped off a major corporation (for those of you who don't know - Pan Am eventually went bankrupt. Certainly not because of this hustler, but losing 2 million dollars in fraud certainly didn't help - and 2 million back then was equal to 10-20 million now). And once again, a huge star doesn't have anyone in their camp brave enough to tell them they are doing something badly - Tom Hanks' awful attempt at a Boston accent was a joke! Did he study with Kevin Costner from "13 Days"??? I mean, what was the point? Why have him speak with that accent? Hanratty isn't eventhe name of the real agent who was after the real con man, so why try an accent if you can't pull it off? DiCaprio gives a fine performance (to add to his brilliant work in Gilbert Grape and his sterling work opposite DeNiro in Boy's Life) and Walken is powerful and sad as his destroyed father. But movie just moves along from scam to scam and Hanks looks like a complete fool as he is tricked over and over. Like cotton candy, you don't mind it while you're eating it, heck - you might even enjoy it, but later you realize there's not much to it and your tooth aches. (5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first film with Leonardo DiCaprio since "Titanic." He gives a much better performance as a teen-age fraud on the lam than a lovesick, romantic artist on a sinking ship. Plus, the film is based on a true story so I give it two thumbs up. The film also portrays the consequences of bank fraud and such. In fact, I didn't know there was such thing as "bank fraud" back in the 60's. This is a great movie to see after all the winter blockbusters. I doubt this film will be taking home any Oscars but it's good enough to merit attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for Catch Me If You Can, I was hooked. I like movies about con-men, deception, and the line between fantasy and reality. To me, Catch Me If You Can was a positive family-friendly Talented Mr. Ripley. The movie doesn't sparkle and it really has no flash to it, for which, I'm quite grateful. It is a solid well-produced movie in the tradition of Quiz Show, that left me wondering how much of the story was true. Hanks and DiCaprio stepped aside from any normal scene-stealing and let the story capture the audience's fascination and like many others, I'd agree that Walken was on top of his game. I recommend this to anyone who wants to entertain his or her family or in-laws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg normally does a pretty good job with adapting books to movies, but this time he is way off! He has taken a fantastic story that could have been, in my opinion, shot directly from the book, and turned it into Fluff. While Leo DiCaprio does a fair job in a now bland part and Tom Hanks saves the film with his performance, people that have read the book will be sorely disappointed. The surprising thing is, Mr. Spielberg is usually so careful about getting things right, I have a hard time understanding how he got this one so wrong. The film takes way too long to get going, and when it does it's so slow it's hard to watch. Even if I wasn't a big fan of the book, this movie would be bad.Maybe he should call it Catch me in "1941"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sit Through Me If You Can!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can: Once again Steven Spielberg manages to take an interesting story and turn it into a deeply boring movie. Based on the autobiography of a confidence man who turned check kiting into a bona fide art form, this movie not only doesn't elevate the material, it leaves you longing for a return to the "To Tell The Truth" tv clip that opens the movie, because at least that format contains a smidgen of suspense.As for the cast, Christopher Walken, in a supporting role as the protagonist's father, succeeds, as usual, in engaging us briefly, but even his inspired hoofing can't bust through the 2 hour 20 minute wall of stunningly empty visuals and bland dialogue. Tom Hanks, playing the FBI agent that pursues our hero/antihero, spices up his usual cranky bureaucrat character with an interesting accent! Merci, Herr Hanks! Leonardo DiCaprio...well...was this guy ever good? Seriously, what was he good in? And don't say "Gilbert Grape", 'cause nine years is a long time to coast on a heartwarming portrayal of a hydrocephalic. Not that it hasn't be tried many, many times in Hollywood.Spielberg's direction is snappy and devoid of life. His characters get let off the hook all too easily. I couldn't tell if the protagonist's romance was shallow and unconvincing because he's a con man, or because, well, it's a Steven Spielberg movie. And the script is surprisingly bad, adorned as it is with every predictable device, and relying as it does on a series of emotional "gotchas" that bounce off with no discernable impact. Not at all what you would expect from a writer whose credits include Speed 2 AND Rush Hour 2. I hope Frank Abagnale got a lot of money in return for seeing his life turned into earnest, awful pablum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few good reasons to see this film: 1) the Saul Bass-inspired opening title sequence is sheer heaven and when it's complimented by John Williams's cat-and-mouse, Bernard Herrmann-like score (his best in years) the result is 3 minutes of a movie lover's dream!2) Christopher Walken's gaunt-eyed, haunting performance as Frank's father is his best in years and will hopefully be rewarded by some critics and the Academy!3) Amy Adams brings her energy and enthusiasm to the screen right when we need her to: the film begins to sag in the middle but picks itself up a notch when her braces flash themselves at the screen and her charmingly awkward candy striper begins to fall for Frank.4) the story itself -a young man's broken home gives way to his inner grifter who switches identities at lightning speed while being pursued by a sympathetic F.B.I. agent-is fascinating and strangely inspirational. However, it has been directed by Steven Spielberg when it needs someone like a young Scorsese or Robert Altman or Peter Bogdonovich or Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne, Paul Thomas Anderson, or even David Lynch! Any one of those filmmakers would give the story an extra layer and made it memorable instead of what it is: a moderate piece of entertainment. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Spielberg's timing and rhythyms are a just a snap off and the film drags instead of zips. It's stale Old School when it should be fresh-cool and jazzy. (Watch for the scene when Frank has a pool party and notice the background action -it's probably the stiffest staging of a house party since Reefer Madness.) Leo's a good actor who doesn't deserve the wishy-washy criticism being heaped on him: his performance as Frank is just fine and he remains one of our most compelling actors. Hanks, however, is Hollywood royalty even though he's never been anything more than funny, reliable, and sometimes solid; his performance -and Boston accent- are uneven and it makes you think that Dan Ackroyd must have been unavailable.</fullReview>

He is just such a great actor, and he can add this to his list of terrific performances. I also liked Christopher Walken as the Mr. Abignale Sr. I really think he is a great guy and a really funny performer and he gave this movie a lot of side character. I know this movie will be a big hit as it should be, and I am just amazed that this movie is based on true events. To think that a teenage boy could do so much harm in such a short time. Good job to one of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg. Without him, we would not have nearly as many great movies on my shelf at home, and when this on comes out on DVD, it will join them.

Based on a true story, this movie takes us on a non-stop journey of a teenage who is conning his way around the world posing as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. This goes on for years, as he is able to stay just ahead of FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is a great movie. The atmosphere, the acting, the sets, the costumes, the music, ... all contribute to a very stylish and interesting film. The only problem this movie has is that it's linked to one of the best books I have ever read. The book is so much more exciting and thrilling than the movie. I know, it's the same old story, "the book is better than the movie", but in this case I feel that the screenwritter left out the most exciting parts of the novel and added way too much stuff that was only brievely mentioned in the book. When the book starts, the mother is long gone and Frank's relationship with his father is maybe one page long. The movie also doesn't stress enough how after years of conning and living a luxurious life, Frank retires in France where he ends up arrested by interpol and ends in up in a French nightmare of a prison. I could go on and on how great the book was and how I would go "wooooooooow" each time I turned a page. A wow effect I was missing in the film. So Catch the book first if you can, if not, enjoy the film for what it is ... and read the book after you step out of the theater!</fullReview>

The first prize must go to Walken though, as his portrayal of a broken man is touching without being sappy.All in all, a great movie that isn't spoiled by the usual Spielberg trappings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun and Witty Holiday Flick......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Abagnale(Christopher Walken) is a struggling store owner who has a wife and a loving son Frank Abagnale Jr.(Leonardo Di Caprio). When Frank Abagnale Jr. has to go to public school instead of private because of financial problems. Frank Jr. pretends to be a substitue teacher for his French class to escape taunting by the other students. When Frank Jr.'s mom has an affair with another man, Frank Jr.'s parents decide to get a divorce. This causes Frank Jr. to run away from home never to return. Only a few weeks away from home young Frank Jr. learns how to con his way through the somewhat naive 60's. When Frank Abagnale Jr. was less than 18 years old he had earned his spot as the youngest man ever to be on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He had succesfuly impersonated a teacher, airline pilot, lawyer, and doctor before being caught by Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks). Frank was caught in Europe and sent to a European Prison, then transfered to an American Prison. After being in American prison for a couple of months, the FBI decided to hire Frank Abagnale Jr. in the check forging and bank fraud department under Carl's supervision. Today Frank Abagnale Jr. has a wife and kids, and still works with the FBI where he has made thousands of dollars helping the FBI catch crooks. This movie is one of my favorite Spielberg films. It's one of his only films that is light hearted and charming. This film is'nt bogged down, and keeps the audiances attention all the way through. I love the Christmas Eve phone calls(which by the way never happened), and the witty dialogue. "Catch Me If You Can" is a fast paced, fun, witty, and charming Holiday Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a wonderful experience. DiCaprio and Hanks were as good as ever, the pacing was quick and enjoyable, and the dialog was clever and quite funny. Christopher Walken does a particularly fine job as Frank Abagnale Sr. and Martin Sheen is expert in his (albeit somewhat of a bit) part.It is also important to note that contrary to what some poorly informed commenters have said, no one was hurt by Frank's scams. First, the money: the FDIC insures everyone against fraud and robbery. No families lost their income, no elderly people became unable to retire and had to "crawl off, unwanted, to some corner and die," or any other such melodramatic idiocy. The only agency who lost money was the federal government; which admittedly isn't a good thing, but didn't lead to any elderly or cute animal deaths.*** Minor spoiler ahead, but a spoiler still ***Last the people involved. The would-be stewardesses were not humiliated, they got a free trip to Europe (and back), and a great story to tell. His fiance was reunited with her family, a much more important thing than the inconvenience and embarrassment he caused them.I don't mean to suggest that everything he did was benign and that we would be better off with a Frank Abagnale on every corner. However, he was hardly more than an annoyance to the general public, and a wonderful story of redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catching Billy, If He Can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odd saga of our most successful filmmaker casting about for his artistic persona continues with "Catch Me If You Can". Steven Spielberg, who seems to have used up all his own artistic material years ago (possibly as long ago as "E.T."), has already imitated David Lean ("Schindler's List", "Saving Private Ryan") Stanley Kubrick ("A.I.", "Minority Report"), and even himself ("Jurassic Park") with consistently mixed results; apparently now that Billy Wilder is safely dead, he's next on the list.But alas, this latest homage is, like all the others, only a strangely muted copy of the original master's work. "Catch Me If You Can" would be the perfect Wilder vehicle - if only the story had been available in Wilder's heyday (it's true, the Wilder of "Avanti!" hacking through it might be a bit dispiriting). As it is, we get all the ingredients of an acidic Wilder farce - a charming cad, a bumbling, upright nemesis, a wittily framed pursuit, the unexpected intrusion of true love, the irony of everybody's moral position, the eventual comeuppance, the final reversal (not to mention the retro title sequence!) without any of the sweet-and-sour sting that made "Sabrina" and "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment" and even "One Two Three" so memorable.What we get instead is another bastard hybrid of Spielberg's sweet, synthetic sympathy and the darker insights of another, better director. Thus Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonard DiCaprio), the con man and scapegrace who swindled people out of millions while fraudulently pursuing the lifestyle of a pilot, a pediatrician, and a lawyer (yes, it's all pretty much true) is sweetened up from the sociopathic user we can feel, instinctively, that he really was, into a lonely youth from a broken home who just somehow hopes to get Mommy and Daddy (the excellent Christopher Walken) back together again. In Spielberg's weirdly paternal (and patronizing) embrace, Frank's strangely passive with women (who fall over him, believably enough, because of his fake credentials), confused and lonely in the grown-up world, and even to be pitied when he's impersonating a doctor in an emergency ward!All this makes what should have been razor-sharp a bit soft - even a little soggy. What's weirdest is that the material closest to Spielberg's own heart (he, too, was a brilliant, lonely transfer student in high school, as his parents' marriage fell apart) never catches fire either. Only a handful of scenes really shine (DiCaprio's clueless wooing of a high-price hooker, his first ride on a real jet, his deft escape from Hanks in a hotel room) - and these, as usual for Spielberg, hinge on an immature young man taking a scary, thrilling ride. We begin to wonder if this is the only thing Spielberg can really DO. Long ago, in movies like "Jaws" and especially "Sugarland Express", Spielberg was capable of a shaggy, vulgar vitality - remember the mayor of Amity, in his whale-print suit, or Goldie Hawn's entire performance in "Sugarland"? But somehow, after the mystical hooey of "Close Encounters", he lost anything like an adult common touch.Still, even if Spielberg's no farceur, the movie's not bad - it's even intermittently entertaining. DiCaprio's not good-looking or suave enough for the lead role (and he doesn't really project the kind of white-hot smarts the kid must have had), but he holds his own and scores a point or two every now and then, enough to keep the movie rolling along. Tom Hanks, as the upside-down Javert to DiCaprio's backward Jean Valjean, is convincingly earnest in his struggle to be more than just waddlingly competent. But it's Walken who walks off with the movie, because he's not afraid to give DiCaprio's father a cheap, top-o-the-world-ma kick beneath all the pathos Spielberg keeps pouring over him. When we're watching Walken, we can almost understand his son.Actually, to be brutally frank, "Catch Me" is probably Spielberg's best movie in years - simply because it's got the best script. For once Spielberg hasn't tampered much with his screenplay in mid-flight (he probably just didn't have time), and Jeff Nathanson has structured a solid (though not streamlined) arc that lands subtle points just where you want them. The film is blessedly unriddled with the kind of bravura "thrill rides" Spielberg inserted almost willy-nilly into "Minority Report", and this time the script's little ironies actually WORK - unlike "Ryan", "Report", and "A.I.", this movie, in its small way, makes thematic sense. It's true the film has one two many climaxes, and is maybe fifteen minutes too long, but for Spielberg, this counts as a big step up in self-discipline. Let's hope he keeps as tight a schedule on his next project (a Hitchcock picture? maybe a Howard Hawks?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dragnet meets The Fugitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Spielberg delivers a very entertaining romp through the life of Frank Abagnale,jr. I have not read the book yet, so am a little unsure what is fact and what is Hollywood, but it did seem strange that he was captured 3 times. Interesting performance by a New England accented Tom Hanks, who seems to be giving us his best Jack Webb impersonation. Leo is solid as the con on the run and was a nice selection with his natural charm. However, nowhere near as dynamic a performance as he gives in "Gangs of New York". Stealing every scene was Christopher Walken. Known mostly over the last 20 years for his goofing as frequent host of Saturday Night Live, Walken reminds of why he was thought to be a real up and comer in "The Deer Hunter". I got chills as Walken swells with pride in his son as he realizes Frank has the establishment on the run. Really thought many of the scenes with his fiance and her family were idealized and were there to show how Frank missed being part of a family unit. Again, I don't know the facts of the case, this is just a perception. Spielberg gets some nice supporting performances out of Mr. Barbra Streisand (James Brolin), Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner. Mostly this is an entertaining film that the masses will enjoy and there is nothing wrong with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is a very eclectic director and film-maker. I get the impression, he loves to dabble, as it were. In any case, he is definitely a risk-taker. This film is a jewel in several ways. Strong performances by DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. I'm glad to little Lennie getting out of his cutsy-tootsy, post-Titanic over-self-adorational stage. He might eventually become an actor. There are several moments in this film when he gives an excellent performance without resorting to his whinny, spoiled teenager persona he's shown us in previous films. Hanks and Walken, as usual, are top pros and right on line. Walken's role is a poignant one as the unconscious enabling father, Frank Sr. and old Chris comes through in fine style. Hanks (and, no, you reviewers willing to slam him for his "accent;" he's right on with the New England dialect)is superb as the low-keyed, workaholic, driven FBI agent, Hanratty. The circumstances of Abagnale's life and adventures are incredible and I remember reading about him back in the late 60s when he was apprehended. This story-- his story-- is more of a statement on our American culture and how our commitment to excessive materialism can make fools of us all. All in all, this film, while like most of Steve's brain children, is a bit too long but very engaging. It is a delightful biopic with both hilarious and sad moments. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie to be top notch entertainment. The acting was great, and the story was paced in a way that it didn't have any slow spots for me. There were enough laughs to make the movie seem quite light hearted. But, there was also a dramatic element of the movie where you realize that Frank (DiCaprio) is committing crimes, and he is being tracked down.Frank leaves home as a 16 year old and begins a "successful" career as a con man who uses the cover of a pilot, lawer, doctor, etc to help him to a life of riches as he uses his counterfit identifications to help him pass bad checks. The FBI is always a step behind. Frank seems to be able to get away with anything, and seems quite the clever con man. But, you begin to realize that he is really just a very young man, who despite the adventures, is really quite lonely.Yes, he is a criminal and you do have to kind of root for "bad guy" to get away to enjoy some of the drama in the movie. However, I don't think I'll be giving away too much to say that he does eventually have to pay for his crimes.I had just finished the book just prior to seeing the movie. And I do think the movie captures the spirit of the book. However, I found a couple of things curious about the transformation to the screen. Apparently the book is embelished. Probably several things in the book are presented more "grand" than they actually occured, or just made up entirely. But, there were a couple of events in the book that might have been interesting in the move. While the movie also adds some elements that weren't in the book at all. Oh well, I enjoyed the book also, and it was a pretty easy read, so if you enjoyed the movie, you may want to consider reading the book also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>has all the makings of a cult hit!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on the true story of Frank William Abagnale, who, at the age of 16, had a short but brilliant career as a major con artist, faking a career as an airline pilot, pediatrician and lawyer, all the while being pursued by the FBI.What got me most about the movie was how simple it is to say anything and have people believe you. Frank is very clever and quick-witted, telling lies very smoothly, even when caught off-guard. He is perceptive and knows how to get information off people in a disarming conversation, then use it to further his schemes. The funniest scenes are when he watches TV shows about doctors or lawyers and uses the dialogue in his "real life" -- when he addresses a non-existent jury at a preliminary hearing after watching "Perry Mason", the judge yells, "Son, WHAT is wrong with you????"The film also is well-directed and beautifully filmed, ranging from tony New York City shots to sunny Miami scenes, where all the women are very very blonde, it seems. The dialogue between DiCaprio and Hanks is very rapid-fire, and it's great to see two such talented box-office stars, known for playing diverse roles, acting together(as opposed to Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt in "The Mexican" -- they always play the same exact character!)This is just plain good stuff, a diamond in the rough that is today's movie listings. You will get a kick out of this film, and decide it's well worth your time and money to see it more than once. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As fun as it is intriguing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fact (and true) Frank Abagnale Jr. ran away from home in the mid 1960s at the age of 16. By age 19 he had impersonated a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while cashing millions of dollars in fraudulent cheques. If you're angry because I told you this up front, don't be. As I've said this is a true story and these facts are all told to you in the first 2 minutes of the film.Also, as you should know by now if you've seen the trailer, "Catch Me If You Can" tells this intriguing, fast paced, fugitive life style of 'Skywayman' Frank Abagnale... as told by the man himself in his book by the same name.I'll leave it at that... the facts are there, but how it's all told is purely another matter all together. And what actually happens to Frank, and his life should all be left to you to discover on your own (for me to spoil a movie in a review is quite uncommon anyway.)But the storytelling is key, and Spielberg's translation from the pages of Abagnale's own scribe is very strong. Even though we are a mere observer, the film seemingly tells the story from Abagnale's point of view... as well it should, since the man himself lived the life, and wrote the book that the film was based upon.But regardless how well you know or don't know the story of Frank W. Abagnale (who dropped the 'Junior' years ago), the film has a way of freshening it up, and bringing new life to it. We see his relationship with his parents, with the woman he eventually does fall in love with, and with his encounter with lawman Carl Hanratty, who seems to be the major target of his eluding. In this translation, we get to see the charm and charisma DiCaprio gives Abagnale's younger self as he makes his career in crime.The films delivery is also quite simple. There are no secrets, no hidden agendas... just tells it like it needs to be told. But that suits this story. I usually take pleasure in films that surprise me, or one that brings me to a revelation that makes the film's outcome. But in 'Catch Me If You Can', I take more pleasure in seeing what comes next, instead of trying to determine how things will end up. (Most likely because I already know -- but as I've already mentioned, that doesn't take away from the movie.) This makes the movie 'easy' to watch, and at the same time entertaining, and not at all dull.'Catch Me If You Can' is as fun as it is intriguing. Although it isn't the most moving picture out this year, it doesn't need to be. It simply is. It tells an interesting story, and does it well. A solid recommendation, and if it's the first film you see this year, it's a good start to 2003.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch me if you can definitely caught my attention! The movie unravels quite nicely and definitely has a lot to offer.

Frank Abagnale Jr.'s, world is torn apart because of issues with the IRS. Frank's family car and house are repossessed and he is sent to public school. On his first day he pulls a fast one on the class, pretending to be the teacher and actually gets away with it! However the families finances deteriorate to an unrecoverable state forcing his mother and father to divorce. Loving his mother yet dwelling on every word his father ever spoke Frank chooses to fake it until he makes it, on his own. Frank commences his crime career by attempting to cash fake checks; to no avail. He then resorts to a more fruitful method of changing the check number so it's directed to a branch in another state. By the time the bank realizes the check is counterfeit Abagnale has absconded with the cash. The fed.'s get hold of the fraud and Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks is hot on Frank's trail. Bored with fraud, Frank decides to pretend he's a pilot. He also takes on the alias of a Doctor, Lawyer, CIA agent and Teacher. I truly enjoyed all aspects of the movie. The acting, the humor, the conning and the costumes but was left wondering in retrospect, how fraud actually paid off in the end?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"? the most enjoyable and fun film this holiday season."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg has done it again. Somehow he's managed to bring us his second hit this year just in time for Christmas and what a cinematic present this is! Inspired by a true story, it's almost hard to believe that the events in the movie actually happened. With the combination of a truly amazing tale and Spielberg and Co.'s magic Hollywood touch, this semi-nostalgic piece reminds us just how different things have become since the 60s. It's definitely his most lighthearted film to date, and for sure the most enjoyable and fun film this holiday season.  Leonardo DiCaprio recovers within a week of his dreadful miscast performance in Gangs of New York with an inspired and seemingly youthful turn as the boy genius Frank Abagnale, Jr. His boyish charm and onscreen radiance are remarkable and really night-and-day compared to the aforementioned disaster. He brings back the elements of performance that made him so likeable and seem so promising in the first place. He's not alone, though. Tom Hanks gives a similar charming, if not deadpan performance as the uptight FBI agent after Abagnale. His New England accent is right on the nose and his now-plump figure give way to a new era for a more mature Hanks. This is a great turn after his well done but prickly character he played earlier this year in Road to Perdition. Also notable is the great Christopher Walken, who gives one of his best performances in years as Abagnale, Sr. All in all, Spielberg, DiCaprio, Hanks, and Walken really remind us in this film why we like them so much in the first place. Despite it's 2 hour and 20 minute running time, it breezes by as you find yourself lost in the colorful cinematography, the fantastic sets, impeccable costumes, and lovable characters. Even with all of the character flaws that each seems to display, though, each of them seem to have a warmth and vulnerability that's easy to identify with. The playful cat-and-mouse game that Hanks and DiCaprio are caught up in is obviously one that could not happen these days and really seems impossible in the first place, but that's part of the appeal. It's cinematic escapism, folks, and it couldn't have come at a better time. This is definitely one to catch in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the several excellent films late in 2002, Spielberg's fabulous "Catch Me if You Can" is most certainly among the topfive, for superb direction, innovative filming, and of course, great acting by principals Tom Hanks and Leonardo DeCaprio (whom I was never particularly fond of until now).The plot twists and turns keep the viewer perpetually interested. The surprises are unexpected, but logical - not outlandish.Years ago I might have felt that the depiction of the FBI agents was exaggerated, but after the current years' revelations of their activities, I find everything not only apparently accurate but almost understated at times. The two major characters are carefully and gradually revealed to us until we understand the personal difficulties Hank and Frank haveundergone in their lives, which to some extent lay the groundwork for their behavior.I highly recommend it for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio is one talented actor!*Minor spoilers*Summary: Frank jr. lives with his parents, but his father Frank Sr. is having problems with is store and the IRS are after him. Frank Jr. learns a lot from his father and in school one day he pretends to be a sub-teacher and gets caught after a week! At the same time, Frank's mother is having an affair and his parents then get a divorce and Frank runs away from home, but the cheques he has bounce all the time so he finds a way to make better cheques and changes his appearance from time to time to show what he does to cash the cheques. From a pilot to a doctor he uses the television to guide him in a way and soon an FBI agent catches on to Frank's trail, who now becomes a wanted fugitive.I really enjoyed this movie, it kind of reminded me of one of my favourite tv-series The Pretender (Michael T. Weiss, Andrea Parker) and how there are some people in the world that can pretend to be anyone they want to be. Leo was great as Frank Jr. and I think its his mother Paula that is to blame for him running away, she was having the affair that killed the family and how his stolen fortune soon messes his mind up so badly that he loses prospective of everything. Tom Hanks was very smooth as the workaholic FBI agent. Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. who loves his son dearly and Frank John Hughes who starred in a series called Players where he and 2 others were forced to work for the FBI, what a coincidence that he plays an FBI agent in this and especially because the ending is somewhat the same as that series.I rate this 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catch Me if You Can" is as light and carefree as the period it evokes. Right from the opening title sequence, accompanied by yet another great John Williams score, we are transported to the early sixties - a decade of bright colors, breezy tunes and gentile living - the Camelot of pre-assassination-of-Kennedy America.Steven Spielberg's flashier side is well hidden here, although his style comes through in his inventive use of close ups and cross cutting to give a sense of time and place, evoke the period through the use of small details rather than large settings.His work with the actors and the small character touches is evident. Leonardo DiCaprio fares best under Spielberg's guidance, Tom Hanks, not as well, but still strong.His use of a New England accent seemed to impede some of his line readings.The story is fun, with just enough depth to keep it from blowing away. Ultimately though, the material may be too light for Spielberg, often feeling *too* much like 5 or 6 episodes of a 60's TV sitcom, like "Please Don't Eat the Daisies" or "Gomer Pyle" Hank's use of a four-letter expletive not-withstanding.CMIYC is a fun time at the movies and will make you laugh and maybe get misty eyed, but it lacks the emotional pull of Spielburg's weightier films. Taken on it's own, it's an excellent film, but given the caliber of talent involved, I expected something more substantial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Affecting Good Time Movie Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who says Steven Spielberg can't make a movie without "scope". This is one fine movie going experience and a great yarn. Leo di Caprio gives an honest performance, but he can't hold a candle to Tom Hanks. Tom has a special appeal, which is why he's Tom Hanks. The most amazing thing about the film is that it is based on a true story. Thankfully, Christopher Walken supplies Leo with some interesting motivation for becoming "The Great Pretender". Earlier in his career, the knock on Spielberg was he was a director of spectacle; not an actor's director like Sydney Pollock. That just isn't the case. His abilities have matured, as has the man. This was an entertaining movie about an incredible character. Just the right fare for New Years Day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DiCaprio's best work since Gilbert Grape!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I have seen Gangs of New York and Titanic. Here DiCaprio plays what he plays best: a manboy. He still looks sixteen, but when he needs to he can have all the maturity and confidence of a thirty year old. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken do their typical great work, but they're not on the screen enough (or their characters weren't complex enough) for thespians of this caliber. I would like to have seen more of the father that refuses to believe his son is a criminal, and of the policeman who's the only one offering any kind of disciplinarian, paternal guidance -- which Abegnale seems to crave.Whether Abegnale is defrauding the Louisiana bar association or the U.S. taxpayer, we forgive him. We forgive him for the same reason we forgive the murderer in Dial M for Murder or the thieves in The Brinks Job: we admire how they did it. We are awed by the intelligence and the confidence (and sometimes sheer persistence) it takes to beat the system. These are all qualities we wish we had more of sometimes, though mostly with less ulterior motives.Sometimes we have more empathy for the criminal because we have less empathy for the victims. Had the would be stewardesses been more intelligent, had Amy Adams' character been more confident, had Martin Sheen's character been more persistent, Abegnale would easily had been unmasked.Spielberg can make even a warehouse look luscious, but he needs a screenwriter to challenge him. The Color Purple gave him the most multi-dimensional characters. The story by itself is of course compelling, but he needs to find a script with the depth to match his breadth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg does comedy, and succeeds!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently got a "A" in one of my college classes titled, "Spielberg/Lucas." In that class the instructor lecture on the style of visual, characters, and plot for a Spielberg film. We made "connections" with all of Spielberg's films, what did JAWS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and SCHINDLER'S LIST all have in common? With Spielberg's latest film, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is this the same Spielberg that is famous around the world?CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very different Spielberg film. It's a off beat comedy with a bit of suspense mixed into it. Critics and fans have been criticize Spielberg for the last twenty years for his attempt for doing a comedy film which was 1941. Now, Spielberg has managed to succeed in making a enjoyable comedy film. Where 1941 had tons of slapstick comedy and buildings falling apart in the name of laughs, CATCH ME is more from personality and wit. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). Frank is known to be the most successful con-artist and check forger in U.S. history. Abagnale posed as a Pan-Am air pilot, doctor, and proscutor, when he didn't even complete high school. Abagnale also went around the world making and cashing about $4 million dollars with bogus checks. Despite that the checks would bounce like a rubber ball, Frank had enough intelligence to fool the banks and even the the companines he claimed he worked for. It took federal agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) to identify Frank's mistakes, which led Carl on a cross country pursuit for Frank. While Carl is staying around the clock trying to figure out more about Frank and his whereabouts, Frank keeps changing his name, occupation, and girlfriend. The only two people that remain close to Frank's life is Carl Hanratty, and Frank's father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken). The film shows that one of the reasons why Frank remains to do his numerous crimes is to purchse expenisve things for his divorced father who is depressed from having his wife leave him on her request, and the closing of his family owned stationary store (where Frank learned about his numerous tricks of forgery). When I heard about CATCH ME being the new Spielberg film, I bought a copy of the book written in first person by the real Frank Abagnale. I highly enjoyed the book with the way Abagnale explains on what he did, how he did it, and the numerous funny parts that would be great to be put on film. After watching the movie, I was slightly disappointed in the film. There were some parts in Abagnale's book that I was looking so much forward to be seeing in the movie, including a part in the book where Abagnale gets involved with bailbonds man. Sadly to my disappointment, it wasn't featured in the film. I then read a interview on why Spielberg was so attached to direct CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and when you watch the movie, it's obviously shown on the screen. Spielberg loved the father/son relationship between Frank Sr. and Jr. In fact, the relationship was partially mention in the book, in the film, it's carried thoughout the film. While the movie does touches on the various career changes and check forgery. Also, since the book was written in first person, the character of Carl Hanratty was mention here in there, where Hanratty is the second most seen character in the film, right behind Frank. But other than that, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. I've always been devoted to Mr. Spielberg, and this is a very different film for him. It is historical, takes place in the past, but it's the first time where most of the film is being told from one character's narrative. Spielberg does a great job with telling the story, he even adds a nice touch of the mid 60's film style and mood with the opening credits being animated, very similar to the opening credits of dozens of 60's comedies. Then John Williams also adds the final touch with the jazzy score that is heavy on the clarinet and brass than the usual strings. Most people groan and moan when they hear the name Leonardo DiCaprio, "oh no! Not that guy!" I do agree DiCaprio does get overexposure, but he is a good actor. Look at WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and THIS BOYS LIFE, he did a excellent job in both films. I think most people just think of DiCaprio in TITANIC which wasn't his fault as much as it was James Cameron's. DiCaprio might win over some people with his performance in this film which shows that DiCaprio did understand the personality and that Frank had a fun time while doing all of the check swindeling. Christoper Walken breaks out of his stereotyped acting that many comedians and t.v. shows have made fun of in the past, and delivers a very good performance. Just watch the scene when he talks to Frank Jr. about his still love and devotion to the woman that left him for another man. But Tom Hanks is the pro, and he proves it again in this film. Hanks portrayal of Hanratty with the Boston accent and the combination of the clumsy actions yet intelligent mind makes the Hanratty character the most enjoyable federal agent since Tommy Lee Jones Sam Gerrad in THE FUGITIVE. Hanks did a brilliant job with Michael Sullivan in ROAD TO PERDITION, and he does it again with Carl Hanratty in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. I can not judge if CATCH ME IF YOU CAN should get any Oscar nominations (I haven't seen GANGS OF NEW YORK, ADAPTATION, and CHICAGO yet). But from what I've seen, CATCH ME is great, but it's not better than TWO TOWERS, MINORITY REPORT, SOLARIS, ROAD TO PERDITION, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, and PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. If there should be any nominations, then Hanks should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Hanratty.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable film, it's a big risk of a film for Spielberg to return to comedy. But this film proves that Spielberg can now do any genre, including comedy, and pull it off. Great job Mr. Spielberg! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, to watch a movie is in seek of entertainment. Not trying to pursuing some profound, wonderful meaning in life (unless I'm watching some movies like the Truman Show, that's one of the very few movie that actually makes me think).Catch Me is a movie that gives you a lot of entertainment. To me, this is enough. Movies are part of the entertainment industry, not a part of your lecture notes that you have to get tested on. Just watch this movie as an entertaining story, it's a pretty good film. Humorous, exciting, and a good plot line.And of course, Tom Hanks did a great on portraying the somewhat dumb, upright, and persistent FBI agent Carl. Leonardo Dicaprio has done so far the best job on portraying a character in all his movies, the smart, cunning and somewhat flirtatious young thief Frank.A very nice film afterall, not one of the best in history, but one of the best in the year.</fullReview>

The audience is asked to believe that with just good looks and a uniform, you can get away with anything. Especially the bizarre scene with Jennifer Garner.

		<shortDescription>Refreshing Opening Credits... Unrefreshing Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Catch Me if You Can' (2002) Dreamworks Pictures 2 Hrs. 20 Mins. Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.Perhaps this is just cynicism influencing my decision, but I came to expect much more form this collaborative trident. One of the greatest Directors assembles a cast wherein Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hanks share the screen in a genre-less film and out of all this talent; a mixed feeling arises when exiting the screening. How could it be all this talent concocted this mediocre film? Furthermore, what was the direction and drive for the film? Was it a comedy, a crime caper, or just an outlet to admirably lens Di Caprio's blue eyes from as many angles as possible?Director Steven Spielberg recreates the unreal yet true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. by casting Leonardo Di Caprio as a charming and surreal con man. Spielberg opens the movie with a refreshingly different credit sequence using John Williams' main theme as the tone setter for the film. Williams' superb saxophone/jazz tune carries weight in the film as it is replayed constantly displaying the cat and mouse game unraveling on screen.The film opens where it ends. Many filmmakers get caught in a pratfall when utilizing a jumping timeline in films, yet thankfully due to Spielberg's craftsmanship, the jumps are seamless until the final 20 minutes of the film. Despite our knowing how the film will end, it does not serve as a detriment to the movie going experience; instead, Spielberg slowly introduces us to the ensuing relationship that develops between the cat (Tom Hanks' FBI Agent Carl Hanratty) and the mouse (Leonardo Di Caprio's Frank Abagnale). Yet, in some instances, it could be completely the opposite as the roles are reversed. Spielberg shrewdly and meticulously demonstrates that despite Abagnale's reckless attempts in breaking the law, he is still a troubled young teenage boy searching for solace in all his wranglings.In the 1960's, Frank Abagnale was a young and extremely successful con man who passed himself as a Doctor, a Lawyer and even as an airline pilot for Pan Am. To add to all this, he was not even 18. Spielberg goes into great length to show the troubled relationship his parent's had and their divorce served as the catalyst for Abagnale's troubles. On the run, with no means of cash, he stumbled upon the art of forging checks. This is where his real claim to fame lie, he began passing fraudulent checks all over the country for large sums of money. Therefore, in a sense he was a successful and calculating bank robber, utilizing his smile instead of a gun to prey on innocent female tellers.Of course the film is a cat and mouse game and Hanks' character makes it a mission to hunt down and capture Abagnale's streak of scams. Hanks incarnates the loneliest of FBI Agents and packs on a few pounds and an annoying Southern accent to play the role of a gullible yet at times brilliant and compassionate man who comes to respect and even admire his catch.Without giving too much away, the imprisonment sequences at the end of the film are short and unclear in terms of timeline. Our Master Storyteller loses control in the editing room as we see Abagnale not serving out his full sentence due to a plea bargain; yet, the timeline is lackluster as we jump from one year to the other without grounding ourselves in the calendar.Perhaps this was intentional as Spielberg aims to recreate the lunacy of the situation and aims to propel the viewer into a whirlwind as Abagnale was. Furthermore, the cast profits from some memorable scenes thanks in part due to Jeff Nathanson's (Speed 2: Cruise Control) sporadically enjoyable script. Di Caprio uses his charm to engineer his character and Spielberg just adores bringing out his blue eyes in the film whereas Hanks adds another notch to his belt playing this weightful 'fella' who obsesses over the capture of Abagnale.While it does have its' memorable moments where Abagnale and Hanratty aim to outdo one another in terms of the 'oneup' (e.g. The airport sequence and the Limo Driver), I cannot make myself understand how such a sluggish film could be concocted by the filmmakers. The most radiant aspect of the film lies in seeing Christopher Walken be himself on screen. Playing Abagnale Senior, he relishes every scene he is in and adds class to a film that should have been a surefire hit.Instead, it seems as if the crew decided to take a Holiday and made a film simply for the sheer angst of it and release the project. When one is working on a project of this magnitude, perhaps it is easy to expect much more, consequently increasing the expectations of a film. But when a filmmaker who has brought us bold films such as 'Minority Report' and 'Saving Private Ryan' reduces himself to a charitable film such as this, it is quite easy to be disappointed.Giancarlo's Rating: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie a feel-good comedy with a message or a character-driven drama in lighthearted sheep's clothing? Well, it's both. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it appreciates and celebrates the fact that real life does not fall into genre categories, but spreads into all of them, binding them together with the common thread of the person who's living it - in cinematic terms, the main character. And boy, does Leonardo DiCaprio deliver in that department. Obviously intelligent and creative, his Frank Abagnale, Jr. is carefree, mischievous, and always aware of the fact that he will, eventually, be caught - he's just trying to enjoy the ride as much as possible before it ends. DiCaprio shows us the sparkling glee when Abagnale pulls off a con, the innocent ego that makes him absolutely believe that he won't be caught. then the grief that propels him onward, and a desperate loneliness that ultimately drives him to reach out to the FBI agent on his trail (played by Tom Hanks, who's been doing this for long enough that his character is automatically solid and enjoyable, even though he's technically the `bad guy'). Their tenuous and unusual relationship is one of the most interesting aspects of this fascinating movie - made all the more fascinating by the fact that it's all based on a true story. Real life is stranger than fiction, they say, and Frank Abagnale's life is one so impossible you just might believe it. He got away with an absurd amount of fraud and deception in a picturesque, na?ve era, and Catch Me If You Can follows his adventures with the delight of a director who truly enjoys the story he's telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Change of Pace for Mr. Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't have a lot to comment about. It certainly was an interesting film considering that it was based on a true story. Also it was good to get away from all the electronic devices used by Mr. Spielberg in his last two films.Actually my motivation for writing this comment is one of the scenes in the film. I am really wondering whether it hit anyone else as it did me.It took place during the dinner scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio is extolling his virtues to Martin Sheen, the father of his fiancee, who is quite skeptical and gives him a line if questioning. Immediately came to mind a similar scene, at the dinner table, from the 1972 film "The Heartbreak Kid". Charles Grodin is extolling his virtues and line of goods to Eddie Albert, father of Sybil Shephard. Mr. Albert tells our hero afterwards exactly what he thinks of him and from there, of course, the similarity ends. Would recommend this film, good story and great acting. Tom Hanks is always superior and Christopher Walken should probably be up for supporting actor. His facial expressions alone were heart rending</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch it if you can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well worth the price of admission. The opening credits were actually interesting to watch. Reminded me of some of the opening credits of some late 60's early 70's movies. If you just watch the movie and don't get hung up on thinking about what this guy's actions did to the lives of the people involved you are in for some good entertainment. Being based on a true story you have to wonder just how much of it is the truth. Some of the things were pretty unbelievable. Was the FBI really that unsophisticated back then? Maybe check fraud was just not a very high priority. The late 60's period also made the film very fun to watch. There were no explosions or graphic language(maybe a word or two here and there). Just an enjoyable movie that I would probably pay to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of Catch Me if you Can. I felt that there was too much going on for this film to be successful. I felt that there were too many time switches back and forth and that maybe Spielberg had ruined a perfectly good movie trying to make it a Spielberg movie. However, fifteen minutes into the movie I became totally amazed. Great acting by DiCaprio, this part is an actors dream, however he plays it very childlike, and very believably(Amazing considering Leonardo is 28 and his character at one point is 17). Tom Hanks is very good. I was thinking on the way home that maybe a "cooler" actor could have played Carl (Hanks character) such as George Clooney. However I realized that Carl makes too many mistakes to be "cool" so Hanks fits the part. Christopher Walken does a great job. My vote 9/10. A great movie to spend an afternoon at the theater. If you don't agree with me, "Knock Knock" (You will get that after you see the flick, and hopefully you will laugh)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Con Story in More Ways Than One (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To judge from the comments posted so far, few if any viewers have actually read the book on which this movie is based, which may explain the generally good reception. However, if you have read the book, as I have, you are in for a disconcerting experience, because roughly 75% of it has been altered, invented, and/or omitted in the transition to screenplay.Yes, the movie merely says it's "inspired" by Abagnale's book, and we all know that movies have to punch up autobiograpical material in places to appeal to movie audiences. And 2 hours inevitably requires compressing (and discarding) a lot of material.But the problem with "Catch Me" is that the alterations often don't make sense even from a movie point of view. For instance, early in the movie Abagnale uses a bogus check to "pay" a hooker. This scene comes out of nowhere, is played entirely for (minor) laughs, and is promptly forgotten. In the book, the event appears much later, and Abagnale makes clear that this broke his own personal code of only ripping off banks and similar institutions, not people, and was justified only because she came on to him under false pretenses. This interesting moral nuance is thus completely lost in the movie, rendering the scene pointless.Also, incomprehensibly, the movie fails to follow Abagnale on his European adventures, including his amazing "marketing" scam involving unsuspecting would-be "stews" (which is instead implausibly turned into a ruse to get past Hanratty at Miami Intl Airport). This story, which ends with his getting ratted out by a French former girlfriend and thrown in an appalling French prison, is far more dramatic, and cinematic, than the heavily abbreviated rendition of it in the movie.Even more unsatisfiying is the omission of Abagnale's hilariously brazen escape from the Atlanta prison where he is initially transferred after being returns to the States, not to mention his first close brush with Hanratty, or his near-fatal slip-up involving a forged check with his real name on it. Why call a movie "Catch Me If You Can" if you are going to leave the book's most memorable escapes on the cutting room floor?Spielberg's apparent decision to cut the book's heady mix of sex, cons and exotic locations in favor of a trite (and contrived) psychological subplot about Frank Jr.'s Oedipal problems, only succeeds in robbing the story of the precise reasons we go to see films about such a James Bond-like figure in the first place (the film's dashing title sequence hints at the movie that could have been). "Catch Me If You Can" was moreover an autobiography, not a work of fiction. What Spielberg gives us is an imitation of that autobiography. In short, the film is itself a con, and only a mildly good one at that. Looks like audiences are too fixated on the pin stripes (see the movie to get the reference) to care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good story. Not nearly as pretentious, overblown or intellectually devoid as, say, everything Spielberg has directed since 1994.It still has its flaws, and I'm wondering if ol' Spielberg chose to focus on the father-son relationship a little more than other important aspects of Abagnale's life... or if he's just showing his lack of ability to direct actors. I know, I know, that's blasphemy... but the parents in "A.I." and the modern-day old people scenes in "Saving Private Ryan" were just SO bad, I have to wonder if he picked Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen for "CMIYC" because a) They wanted to work with him badly, or b) They wouldn't require the direction of someone less experienced or less accomplished. Sound fishy? Explain the parents in "A.I." Switched loyalties like some people switch channels........As for "Catch Me," it's a cute, breezy film, with very few flaws. The most glaring:a) Jennifer Garner's one scene makes absolutely no sense, it's a non-sequitur. If she'd turned out to be an undercover agent, that would have been something. Instead, she just shows up, pulls money from her bra, and is gone again. I felt violated, like I just watched a plug for her television show in the middle of an otherwise fun movie. She obviously wasn't a prostitute because Frank says he recognizes her... I never did understand the fascination with this actress (assuming any actually exists).b) Brenda Strong, and her father, played by Martin Sheen. Once they exit the film, they are never mentioned again. They're set up to be fairly important in Frank's life, and I'm left wondering what became of them / Frank's relationship with them. This isn't a plot hole, so much as a huge gaping annoyance. Perhaps Spielberg is getting senile; no, it's not the screenwriter's fault, the director should be able to look at the script and go, "Hey, Jeff, what happens to characters X, Y and Z?"Beyond that: cute, breezy and worth seeing at least twice, so you can put it all together and admire some of the DP's camerawork (which alternates between the fancy and the mundane). Kudos to Nathanson/Spielberg for giving it a fourth and fifth act, and giving us that much more about Abagnale's life.Flawed, but only a few film geeks will notice. It gets an A from me, your opinion may vary. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a short piece about "Catch Me.." (no spoilers here). I think Leonardo C was correctly cast. They needed someone who could pass for age 18 but also who was pretending to be 8 or 10 years older, as the featured main-character/con artist. He does look awfully young, but I think it came off ok. The understated score was by Williams (no surprise) but was very different from other works he has done, and generally works well for the film. It is as unlike the score for Harry Potter as night and day, and does demonstrate Williams' versatility (although Schindler's List has long since put any concerns in that area to rest). I was not able to identify the composer prior to seeing his name, momentarily wondering if it might possibly be Dave Grusin or perhaps J. N. Howard or even Howard Shore. The director is an excellent storyteller, but I am left wondering how others might have handled certain treatments. There was good audience reaction and I would imagine it will continue to do well at the box office. I would like to find out what the budget was, but for dart-throwing fun I would guess it at $75mil. Tom Hanks as the hapless FBI agent-in-charge is entertaining as well, and Christopher Walken also has a good part in this. I would imagine that I will see this film again, sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it 1980 again? Steve Spielberg makes a movie without overdone moralizing??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a quality motion picture which suprises me because despite the questionable ending to Minority Report, thats 2 movies in a row that Stevie Hollywood hasn't over stuffed with sentimentality or kid-crap and therefore are good. Who knows if he can keep it up, but I imagine that he'll go out and make that Memoirs of a Geisha movie to offset the quality entertainment he's been making. Remember when the guy made Jaws, Close Encounters, Indiana Jones all in a row there? i dont cuz I wasn't born yet, but it musta been nice, because I grew up in him being all serious or having some underlying message to all his flicks. anyway...I really liked Catch Me if You Can and I have no complaints at all about it actually. For a 2 hr 20 minute movie it moved at a lightening brisk pace, had genuinely funny moments and had a very logical and well written script that never confused me for a second.Dicaprio plays Frank Abangale Jr., son of F.A. Sr. (Christopher "man's man" Walken) who before his 21st birthday managed to impersonate an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer and swindle his way, via forged checks , to more than 4 million dollars in loot. DiCaprio really was the only mainstream choice to play Frank Abangale in my opinion. Other than Tobey McGuire he's the only leading man with a marketable name that can play from 15 to 30 convincingly which is what the script requires him to do. And does he do it well, the kid is an actor, not that I've ever denied it, he was good in What's Eating Gilberts Grape and Basketball Diaries, but unfortunantly Titanic had to come along and make his sleepwalk performance in that what everyone remembers. (the same problem is with James Cameron, the guy made some AWESOME movies and Titanic is all he's gonna be remembered for)Chasing DiCaprio's Abangale is Tom Hanks Carl Hanratty, one of the few FBI agents back in the 60's to deal in check forgery and have a west virginia (i presume it is, they never actually say) accent as think as his horn rimmedglasses. Hanks does a damn good job here as well, as though there is really any chance he'd be bad, portraying Hanratty as a competant but timid agent early in the movie to an honorable and much more mature sleuth 3 or 4 years after he started following Abergale's paper trail.The movie runs deftly from the early years of Frank Jr.s life, showing how his father also had the smooth talking gene and took his son along as he attempted to finesse his way out of problems with the IRS. The whole conflict between the father and the government being passed to the son is very cool, I was pleased when I realized how it had shaped up, it wasn't spelled out in some long winded explanation by anybody like a stupid movie would. Spielberg, while not being my favorite director anymore, has the clout and the confidence to be able to tell a story without spelling it out just so the dumber members in the audience get it. Over the course of the movie we see the toll that the cat and mouse game takes while showing that both guys are good people and not villians in any sense of the word. Being based on a true story helped give it credibility and makes one wish that they were half as suave and clever as frank was at 15 years old.This movie is a different beast from most other Spielberg movies, its not a fantasy, or actioner, or sci fi, its just a story told very well without huge pretentions. It's just meant to entertain and show that in America a set of brains and a pair of balls will reward you in one way or another.***3/4* (I didnt give it a perfect 4 stars becase I really don't have an urge to watch it again, but maybe over time I will)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting cat-and-mouse game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Possible Spoilers***Two mice fell into a bucket of cream. The first mouse drowned. The second mouse kicked its legs until it churned the cream into butter, and it crawled out and lived. Director Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can tells the story of both types of mice in this cat-and-mouse detective drama based on the life of Frank William Abagnale, Jr. The script contains major holes, but audience members forgive unexplained details because of screenwriter Jeff Nathanson's intricate and well-written script. Every event and clue has a satisfying albeit predictable payoff, and the continuous scheming of Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) keeps the viewer constantly wondering what will happen next. Nathanson began with incredible material from Abagnale and Stan Redding's same titled novel, and he, Spielberg, and the cast turned this unbelievable history into an engaging film enhanced by a convincing and laudable performance by DiCaprio.Catch Me If You Can is told in retrospect to add to the outlandish nature of the situation. Abagnale first appears as a scruffy but very young man-one with peers who rightfully act like teenagers with juvenile preoccupations. But by this time people have already called Abagnale a teacher, a doctor, a pilot, and a lawyer even though he never received any legitimate training in any of the professions. He has traveled the world, intimately known numerous women, thrown fabulous parties, made wedding plans, hoarded large amounts of money, and figured out how to elude the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. Abagnale has lived a lifetime-or more accurately stated, many lifetimes-and done so all before his twentieth birthday.Spielberg and Nathanson presented DiCaprio with an actor's dream. Abagnale is a criminal, but he is a lovable criminal with good intentions and a desperate need to escape his loneliness. The character's choices drive the plot, but his personality makes the movie. DiCaprio delivers an awkward performance as the sixteen-year-old Frank, but one cannot criticize too quickly as the character must have struggled outside of his alter-ego existence. Abagnale slips into the shoes of a twenty-eight-year-old physician with ease, but his own youthful sneakers never seem to fit. Abagnale's multiple roles require him to learn and imitate a variety of professions, but his disposition remains constant. His charm woos the women, and his confidence and masterful use of language persuades even the greatest skeptic to believe his assertions. DiCaprio's performance defines smoothness, and his choices illuminate the humanness of a man who chose a life of crime in order to escape a reality he could not accept.Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent duped for years by Abagnale's trail of bad checks and Christmas Eve phone calls. His acting is only surprisingly adequate as the no-nonsense government agent, and is certainly not noteworthy. The part does not demand much versatility, and Hanks' obvious reactions and other mediocre acting choices elicit little sympathy or interest in Hanratty's persona. He is legitimately ultra-serious and focused on his career, but Hanks fails to create a sufficient amount of dimension in a character purposely written without a lot of apparent depth.The cat-and-mouse game and Abagnale's unusual situation provides over two hours of quality entertainment, but the many subplots and themes complete the film and make it memorable despite its minor flaws. Jennifer Garner joins the cast to add more star-quality to the picture in a superfluous role, and Martin Sheen also appears with a bit part as a rich and influential attorney. Christopher Walken completes the list of celebrities with an admirable performance as Frank William Abagnale, Sr., who teaches his son how to be the mouse that churns the butter and lives but who ultimately drowns in the cream. Nathanson wrote a story about a long game of hide-and-seek for the screen, but he also wrote a story about complicated family dynamics, love and loneliness, and the complex relationship between a criminal and his lawful pursuer.</fullReview>

It was one of the most entertaining, progressive and thought provoking movies of that time - especially in an era where most Indian films still dealt with formula musicals with romantic themes or stories dealing with identical twins separated at birth - (one grows up to be a police officer and the other a dacoit pursued by the unwitting twin, the police officer, the movies usually culminating in tne "revelation" by the widowed mother who identifies her long lost son by the melanotic mole on his back and brings about a family reunion of sorts...and so on and so forth). Mr. K. Balachander generally avoided such stereotypic tripe and made movies that stood out from the rest of the crop. Naan Avanillai was one of those. Enough said. The Tamil movie may be available on VHS. For those interested it would be worthwhile checking it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, director Steven Spielberg pulls another one of his patented surprises with CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, a juicy crime caper film set in the 1960s and based on the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who ran away from home and went on a three-year spree of check forgery amounting to over $4 million. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Abagnale, who managed to impersonate a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and pretty much every other legitimate line of work to make himself rich before FBI agent Carl Hanratty finally caught up with him.As played by the always-reliable Tom Hanks, Hanratty is a dedicated and cunning foil for DiCaprio's con-man Abagnale. The two men find themselves locked into a deliciously suspenseful game of cat and mouse that frequently resembles Hitchcock's great caper films of the 50s. The main titles sequence is priceless in its own right (if one didn't know better, one would swear this film had actually been made in the early 1960s), and John Williams concots a jazzy score redolent of Henry Mancini's classic 60s film scores. Featuring co-starring turns by Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is yet another triumph for Spielberg, one of the greatest directing geniuses in Hollywood history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catch Me if You Can" is an acceptable, feel-good movie involving characters we want to succeed, Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abragnale Jr, and Tom Hanks as FBI agent, Carl Handratty. Guns are drawn but never fired and a disillusioned son never gets to express his outrage at his opportunistic mother. Steven Spielberg injects the 1960s look of a Robert Wagner 'It Takes a Thief' TV series or a Peter Sellers 'Pink Panther', even bringing back Kitty Carlisle for the 'To Tell The Truth' show. But he doesn't give us the inventive nor provocative spirit of his trademark films. De Caprio excels in his very believable conversion, from a bystander witnessing his father dangling lockets or overly praising strange women to do his biding or his mother's philandering, to an active participant in fraud. Tom Hanks has to suffer the role of the fall guy, failing at least four times to catch his man. The interesting women in De Caprio's life, especially the hotel hooker (Jennifer Garner) who fails to appreciate a con and the sheepish young nurse (Amy Adams) whose genuineness is as clear as the braces on her teeth make for interesting distractions but their roles are too transitory. This is an OK film but, by Spielberg standards, below what was expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Catch Me if You Can was a pretty good flik. I enjoyed watching it, and I hope that other people will too. It was a very good movie, with a god plot. I was shocked to learn that this was also a true story. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job, and Tom Hanks gives a good performance. I would give this a 7/10 for it's good plot, and good laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a true story, "Catch Me If You Can" is an enjoyable film. The acting is good. Leo was OK, Hanks was great, but Christopher Walken stoled the show. I can't remember the last time he gave a subpar performance. Spielberg's direction was appropriate and reminded me of what a good story teller he is.Overall, I give it an 8/10, but Walken should get an Oscar nomination for his work as the father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film; it was never boring despite the 2+ hrs length. DiCaprio, Hanks, and Walken gave standout performances, and were thoroughly believable. Hanks had a great Boston accent. The movie was fast paced and there were a lot of laughs throughout. Watch for the schoolteacher impersonation and stewardess recruiting scenes! This plot would have been absurd if it wasn't a true story. Sure, they dramatized the story for the film. I saw in the closing credits that a Frank Abagnale was listed as 'French policeman'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch me if you can is a well made movie, but the main problem I have with it has nothing to do with the movie, but with its promotional ads and reviews. They keep promoting it as an original movie from an original idea never filmed before. So, all I have to say, am I the only one that seems to remember the Tony Curtis 1961 film `The Great Impostor' Which was also based on a true story about a man who goes around pretending to be everything from a Monk to a Prison Guard. He even pretended to be a surgeon and performed surgeries, and got away with them. So again, all I have to say, is am I the only one that remembers that film and if not, why do they keep saying `Catch me if you Can' is an original idea?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first great movie I've seen in a really long time. It had me hooked from the very opening, the little animated opening credits were really cool. The movie was a little long and you really notice it once (*spoiler*) they return from France, but it's really important to the story and I think Spielberg did an awesome job of entertaining us the entire way through. It was just a really cool movie with a lot of emotion, some great comic bits, and it made Frank W. Abagnale a hero to everyone in my theater. I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book several years ago and couldn't put it down. Fascinating story.Even though most movies don't compare to the book(not this one either), I still found the movie entertaining(especially Christopher Walken who has such presence. It is all in his eyes).Without trashing Leo(a great actor), I must say that I found the choice to use him as Frank quite ironic, having read the book.This is because one of the main themes in the book was the fact that Frank looked older than he was, and that fact as well as the way he carried himself allowed him to pass himself off the way he did.That having been said, someone with a baby face like Leo seems a strange choice for Frank.Nevertheless, the movie was still worth seeing and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has a knack for taking stories and making them look like nothing Hollywood has ever produced before. While stories of con men are plentiful, this film is absorbing, convincing, light and touching. It is a perfect holiday film as many of the scenes rotate on various Christmas Eves throughout the 1960's. I suspect that Spielberg drew on the divorce of his own parents when he was young and translated some of that experience in this film, based on a true story, which leads the protagonist (DiCaprio) into a life of clever but ultimately harmless crime and who turns out to ultimately have a successful life. Leonardo DiCaprio is back with a performance that tops his turn in 'Titanic' and he could land an Oscar nomination. In a low key supporting role, Tom Hanks, an 'A' list actor without an ego and one of the most down to earth guys in the world, let alone Hollywood, takes second billing and runs with his part and knows the limits of it and never tries to make the film his own. Christopher Walken will be under rated by most for his performance as DiCaprio's dad and I hope he finds his first Oscar nomination in twenty four years since 1978's 'The Deer Hunter'. It will be a long time coming for a guy that Hollywood never really appreciated throughout the 1980's and 90's but who can act with the best of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A festival of panache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's `Catch Me If You Can' is one of those movies that are almost pure fun. It's a series of bold capers in which a mere teenager fools masses of people out of tons of money -- sheer naughtiness in this lighthearted version of a true (well, mostly true) story. Along the way the boy develops a worthy opponent, falls in love and wins his girl, goes to jail and gets an early release to serve as an FBI expert on the very cons he has perpetrated.It's not a complete lark. The young Frank Abagnale Jr.'s bold and brilliant deceptions are like the pearls squeezed from an oyster out of a point of pain-his father's humiliation and his parents' sudden divorce. Con men are often desperately inadequate (but talented) individuals who hate who they really are and have to invent lies about themselves and paper their path with stolen money. But though imposters may be pathetic, they're capable of great daring and panache, and Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) has more than the usual allotment of these qualities. He wasn't just talented, but very bright. His FBI nemesis Hanratty (Tom Hanks) finally gets him to reveal how he passed the Louisiana bar exams: he studied for them ?- but only for two weeks! Abagnale passed as doctor and lawyer from what he learned from watching TV dramas. This is a true story (well, as we said, mostly) and the real Frank Abagnale was and is a brilliant specialist in checks and other falsified documents: today, in real life, his expertise is worth millions in annual fees for advising corporations on how to avoid fraud.`Catch Me' is set in the early to mid Sixties, a time when airline travel had glamour and no fear, and Frank's favorite scam was to pose as an airline pilot. Much of the delight of the movie is the precise but never cloying evocation of the period and the thrill of its glamour for a daring young man. Every scene is a visual delight, but there's a light touch -- unlike Todd Haynes' heavy-handed Fifties sets in `Far From Heaven.' The 2002 Christmas season has unveiled two comebacks for Di Caprio. `Gangs of New York,' though interesting, is not a successful film, and Di Caprio is miscast in it as the young tough son of a martyred Irish gang leader, Amsterdam Vallon. This is too sullen and repressed a role for the irrepressible, ebullient, risk-taking Leo. He doesn't look quite right, and he doesn't have the subtlety to show the conflict his character would feel after befriending Bill the Butcher, when planning to turn against him and get his revenge for his father's death at Bill's hands. But `Catch Me' is quite the opposite kind of movie: unlike the overcomplicated, conflicted, hashed up `Gangs,' it has an admirable directness and simplicity, focusing as it does on the fundamental family issues, the string of hilarious and spectacular capers, the dramatic and funny love story with Brenda (the charming Amy Adams III) and the friendly duel with the adversary, Hanratty. For Di Caprio the role of Frank is as near as possible to the ideal one for who he is today.Di Caprio's most successful performances are like bold exploits of fabulous pretense, most spectacularly perhaps his role as the obstreperous retarded boy in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape.' Another bold boast of a performance is as Rimbaud in Agnieszka Holland's `Total Eclipse.' But let's not overlook the braggadocio of Leo's work in `Titanic,' where he dazzles the prettiest, the most well born, most desirable girl on the greatest ship that ever sailed -- and sank -- and has the bravado to save her in a final love poem of an escape.All these Di Caprio roles also have their share of pain and anguish, and there again Frank seems ideal for him to play, because of the neediness and pain that motivates Frank's exploits, even if most of the time he is having enormous amounts of fun which we amorally tend to share. Leonardo looks supremely right for this role too, with his crisp, tidy, pretty features and his neatly cropped hair, his thin torso that fits perfectly into the tight pants and shirts of the early Sixties. Di Caprio is a bit of an eclectic clotheshorse, and rarely has an actor had a better opportunity to show off fashion as part and parcel of a role. Leo's clean-cut baby face helps him pose as under 19, when he's really 28.By the way: in a sense isn't any actor a con artist? Isn't he a man who fools us into thinking he's someone else? That makes Di Caprio's Frank Abagnale, Jr. the definitive actor's role. And Di Caprio has always seemed to strut and charm. Or drool and charm, if need be: Scorsese has said that when he saw `Gilbert Grape' he thought Leo was really a retarded boy. He was conned!The movie is far from being obsessed with Frank. Hanratty (Hanks) is his essential foil, as plodding as Frank is smooth. Tom Hanks, who's become the most self-effacing, not to say saintly, of actors, isn't the lumpish pawn he was in `Road to Perdition.' He's repressed, but there's a coyness in the way he hides his truths from his opponent when they communicate, and there's a winning warmness in his affection for Frank. Hanks on film has undergone transformations, humiliations, terminal AIDS, shipwrecks, isolation, tragic loss, and now this! --Bad, bulky suits, and the role of a bumbling, unimaginative FBI operative without particular style, or, so it appears at first, ability. For years it would seem he can't trap his target because he lacks Frank's sprezzatura. But what he does turn out to have is authentic determination, dogged loyalty to the chase -- whose serial nature is signaled by the two opponents' annual Christmas even phone conversations.Hank's modulation of types in his recent film performances is so subtle that it's hard to define precisely the way this one stands out, and some won't even get it. But there's not only the emerging warmth but also, under the cloddishness, a cool inwardness from the start that suggests that his steadfastness has ropes of steel and that he has the courage to maintain it no matter how foolish he may look. Hanratty is a parallel proletarian hero, balanced against Frank Jr.'s flashier one.Chris Walken gives a fascinating performance as Frank's dad, and Martin Sheen is excellent as Brenda's.There's one sequence among many that stands out. Frank escapes from the country by donning his pilot's blues once again to stage a recruiting session at some girls' school. Then he prances through an airport full of FBI agents, surrounded by the impenetrable camouflage of eight very pretty young women in fetching stewardesses' uniforms. This quintessential moment is so delicious it makes one want to cry. It's movie heaven. This is one of Speilberg's finest efforts, all the better for seeming effortless.</fullReview>

Unlike the Tom Cruise/Paul Newman hook-up in "The Color of Money," I think that this movie will be the vehicle that launches Leonardo DiCaprio into a wider range of roles.The delight of this show comes from its reality. The check fraud was a product of the times, when the world trusted most people to be honorable about bank checks. And the movie really captures your attention and allows you to empathize and imagine living the characters vicariously.I highly recommend this movie...You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first time posting as an IMDB member so I'll make it concise. This movie wasn't at all like I expected. I logged on earlier and it was rated 8.0/10.0 by IMDB users so I thought, hey, must be some outstanding movie of the year or something. Sadly, the only good part of the film were the opening credits. A lot of the movie dragged on, but with humor placed in awkward spots in an attempt to keep the user going. Easily one of Spielberg's worst. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Give me a break guys. At first walking out of the movie theatre, I didn't want to think it was THAT bad, after all, being directed by a star director. However, now that I think back upon it, it is an average movie. The thing that really got to me was how the heck Hanks was so nice??? He's a damn FBI agent that treats the guy he's chasing after like his own son! 6.5/10</fullReview>

Everything is tied together neatly. Tom Hanks is a good actor making everybody else look good, too. Leonardo DiCaprio is still growing as an actor and this film catches him in that growth between teenage fame and adult power. Tom Hanks helps him with wisdom and Spielberg blends the two of them into respect. It's clear all three men respect each other's work. I do to. I smiled throughout the film.

		<shortDescription>Believable but contains goofs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is such a meticulously crafted movie that seeing it makes me wish I had read Frank Abagnale's book first. Leonardo DiCaprio is not only believable as the "con man" (Frank), his character is downright impossible to dislike. Tom Hanks is excellent as the no-nonsense but somewhat inept FBI man trying to nab Frank. When friends are anxious to hear him tell a joke, he obliges...sort of. That scene can not be told here. Unfortunately, the careful attention to re-creating the look of the 1960s failed in two places: a scene set in 1967 shows a girl singing the 1969 song "Leaving On A Jet Plane", and in a 1969 scene Frank's dad is wearing a "U S Postal Service" jacket depicting a horse on the sleeve, even though the "Post Office Department" did not become "Postal Service" until 1970, at which time an eagle logo replaced the horse. Aside from those two goofs, the film is engrossing and enjoyable, although I'm certain that the real Frank Abagnale was not so skilled at all the fakery as the movie makes him out to be. All the con jobs are accomplished without anyone seeming the slightest bit suspicious. The old image of "shooting fish in a barrel" comes to mind. The movie's character should have had more obstacles to overcome instead of achieving his cons so facilely. At the end, a part of me was left wishing that Frank could have gotten away with all his stunts. For me, "Catch Me If You Can" catches three and a half stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can starts off with a boom with a very suave opening credits sequence, where sample people are chasing/being chased and using the credits to hide. Very clever, like the rest of the movie. Then we go to Marseille, France, where Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is talking to Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and he is released from prison. We are then taken six years earlier, to 1963.Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a grifter of sorts, but nothing major. He's being investigated for tax fraud. And when Frank's mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) is caught cheating, Frank leaves home and first tries out theft in his father's petty ways. Soon he gets way over his head and becomes infamous for writing checks, and soon he's stolen over $4 million. But Hanratty and the FBI is close onto Frank, but always one step behind.I have got to hand it to Steven Spielberg-taking a concept that people like I haven't heard of (gotta read the book!) and manipulating it into a multi-layered story of cat-and-mouse. Of course, it could have been better if there had been more sub-plots. It's mainly Frank having fun and Hanratty chasing him. Also, Hanratty's person needed more depth, but I'll talk about that later.Catch Me If You Can has a good deal of humor for a movie billed as a drama. Its opening credit sequence and Frank's schemes took most of the humor. During his first day at a new school, at a French class, there's no teacher, so why not act as one? That was his first step to stardom, so to speak. I love how he made the checks at PanAm (I'll keep it a surprise). The first half was better than the second half, because it was funnier and more involved. The first half had information about the family and his jobs as a PanAm pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Of course, he hasn't had any training, and it's always worth a laugh to see him struggle. The second half took itself too seriously, and had the now-famous Spielberg fake ending, but at least it wasn't as severe as AI or Minority Report.Depth of the characters, you ask? The movie focused most of the time on Frank, Jr., of course, but we do know some about Frank, Sr. His mother was very underdeveloped and could have been utilized better. Hanratty, we don't really know much about, so it's hard to get deep into his character (but you did get to like Frank). We do learn about his past at the end, but that's kind of unnecessary, isn't it?Leo, I'm not sure if he deserved a Golden Globe nomination, but he was very good. I enjoyed his `dapper dan' attitude, which is what the whole movie was like. It didn't find itself serious (until the end), so it allowed some sort of suave cockiness, which added to the fun and the authentic feel of the 60s (not that I would know, of course). Hanks, with his usual Southern accent, seemed fine (nothing like The Green Mile, though). All of the supporting characters knew their parts (and the one-liners didn't overact or anything!). Jennifer Garner, as a prostitute, is waster and not really needed, mainly just to get to the overlong 140 minute runtime.It's really fun and unpredictable (except the ending); you don't know how Frank is going to conjure up his next scheme. Sure, it tried to get sappy at the end, but it made you feel good, and that's what great movies are all about.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a waste of many things - good actors, a good director, and an excellent story/book. I have read the book by the same name at least three times and it is funny, dramatic, unnerving, entertaining, and a downright excellent work of art. The movie does not live up to the excellence of the book. It is too bad because they could have made it so good. I don't know what happened. Hanks is not hot enough and DiCaprio is not suave enough. They should have let the real Frank Abagnale, Jr. do the acting and directing. He is much more entertaining on his own than with these goofballs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top-notch job of acting by Leo, Tom and Chris. A different type of story for Steven Spielberg, but the story was very interesting (made all the more so because it all really happened). Leo was much more believable in this role than he was in Gangs of New York. This movie will sell lots of tickets and break the $100M mark during its run. Catch it while you can...a strong 9.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

This movie is FUN! This movie was worth 8 bucks. This was a great story that kept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to see it again. I was unsure of Leo before going in but the man pulled it off. Tom Hanks was a wonderful character and the movie got a health round of applause at the end which I rarely see.

		<fullReview>To be honest, there is nothing extraordinary about "Catch Me If You Can," Steven Spielberg's latest film. Everything is good, and very little is great. Even if the posters and trailers (and even the opening credits) hadn't told us this was based on a true story, we would know. This is a tale far too clever for any Hollywood screenwriter to conjure, but we know that, even without the "BASED ON A TRUE STORY" that pops up on the screen after the opening sequence. Here is a film that will be big at the box office for a month or so, then pass out of our consciousness for a few months, until it is released on DVD, where it will linger for a few months longer, and then once again pass out of consciousness. It's not a very memorable experience, but in spite of all of that, it's darn good fun.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr. a young con artist who in essence changes identities every few months, forges a load of bad checks, and makes the girls swoon at nearly every turn. We see him go from substitute teacher to pilot to doctor to lawyer, with such ease that it is pure delight to watch. Then we have the nemesis, Carl Hanratty, played by the always wonderful Tom Hanks, whose indistinct accent make the actual pronunciation of his name as mysterious as where Frank Jr. will be heading next. Hanks is delightful, and doesn't steal any scenes from the obvious star, DiCaprio. Hanratty is an FBI officer, middle management in charge of bank fraud, and once he gets wind of this Abagnale fellow, we know that they will become enemies, and probably friends in the way we know and love, and have seen a thousand times before. Christopher Walken plays Frank Abagnale, Sr., Dicaprio's father. Walken's character is down on his luck - in about ten minutes of screen time, he loses his car, his business, his wife (Nathalie Baye), and his son. It was a wise decision for Spielberg to not treat Frank Sr. as a main character, because he is not. This is the story of Frank Jr. and Hanratty, and is treated so.The one thing that was still in my mind as I left the theater, though, was John Williams' score. Being somewhat of a music enthusiast, I can always appreciate the oddball 7/8 saxophone trio, which is something you don't see much in movie music. Williams is probably the most famous of all film composers, and here I think we have his best work in years. Overall, this film seems like it could have been done by any other director, and I was still a little in the dark as to why Spielberg chose this film to follow up his miraculous "Minority Report," but I saw little glimpses of genius in several shots. Consider the FBI office shot near the end of the film, and notice how any other director would surely angle the camera more at eye level, than the low angle used by Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (also of "Minority Report"). It makes for a far more interesting shot, and there are a host of them throughout the film. One thing Spielberg has a gift for is showing us something that we may not totally understand, but will always want to look at.I find it best to not think of "Catch Me If You Can" as a follow-up to Spielberg's masterpiece, "Minority Report," because it's not. This film isn't an exercise in character or style or anything else. You can't analyze this film, because there's really not much to see. It's a solid 140 minutes of entertainment, is always fun, and will definitely leave a smile on your face. Now, I think it's time for Spielberg to get back to work.Three stars, out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just One More Cut...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is what this film needed. There were aspects that were vintage Spielberg, but there was a tightening that was needed. The film has no business being 2:20 long. But that said, there were some wonderful aspects about it.First, Christopher Walken gives a brilliant performance of a man who silently encourages his son to continue defying authority. The lines in his face outline the path his Willy Loman life has taken; and like every great actor's trick, there is something mysterious behind his eyes, someone he won't even confide into his own son about; it's like he has one last ace up his sleeve. It is the aspect of him that his son worships, that elevates his father into God-like status for him. He is suspended in animation they way young Frank, Jr. has suspended the family he left when he began his caper.Leonardo DiCaprio shines in total believability as the young Frank, Jr. He totally immerses himself into this role and produces such a fresh-faced kid who skirts just his side of rogue-ishness. Because DiCaprio can bring more of his own life and experiences into this role, it is his best yet. Notice the subtleties of maturation from the beginning to the flashbacks. This film is a calling card for DiCaprio and we sit in anticipation as to what his next roles will be. He just might be the new original star we have been craving - not a carve-out of the past. Maybe America has finally produced its own "Olivier," but an actor of the cinema (America's acting pedigree), not of the theatre. And DiCaprio's magic will finally legitimize cinema's form of acting as an art.While some have call this Spielberg's imitation of Soderbergh, I think it's the director still trying to find his Howard Hawks voice. Now that he has become an icon, he will try to be a dilletante in many genres. His second act bump recalls the suspense he built in "Jaws," envoking applause at the ingenuity of the script/direction. He needs to try another "Sugarland Express," see if he can get past substance and tell a small simple story without epic treatment. A bold experiment for Spielberg would to now MAKE a made-for-tv movie, maybe try a Soderbergh pretention and create a road-show film. While "Full Frontal" was an exercise in "cinemart", for Spielberg it might have actually created some interesting results. What if this very film would have been made for less than $5 million with the same exact people. I bet the results would have been more exciting than the finished product.And so I come to this conclusion: it was entertaining and enjoyable, just overproduced. Mr. Spielberg, please try something like this again, only put some restrictions on yourself. Don't build everything, shoot something on the fly - challenge yourself by restricting yourself. I'd love to see the results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the most dynamic movie of the season *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch me if You Can" though not the most dynamic movie of the year, is definately one of the better movies I have seen for some time. It lacks the grandeur and stunning sights of 'Towers' and Gangs' and therefore relies on the basics of moviemaking...good direction, acting, and a good story. And Speilberg doesn't fail in delivering a movie to keep you entertained for two and a half hours. However, when looking at the movie in parts, the audience is left wanting something a bit more. DeCaprio fails to convince that he is a young boy who is running away, not from the feds, but from the failed relationship of his parents.And when he reached the point where he can no longer live in denial, you don't really feel for him. Nor does Hanks quite earn your sympathy when he continually just misses catching DeCaprio. On the other hand, Walken manages to stir your emotions with his wonderful delivery as DeCaprio's father. Towards the end, Spielberg fails to wrap everything up as neatly as you would want. Nevertheless, it is a movie worth seeing at least once. It was good fun that will possibly be lost in the deeper movies and more cinematic movies of the season. But if you aren't in the mood to see an epic film or left wondering just what the movie was about, I recommend catching the flick when you have nothing better to do on a cold afternoon.</fullReview>

Tom Hank was perfect for the role of Carl Hanratty a FBI agent whose only want is to catch Frank.Through this action packed comedy comes a story that is picture perfect and a cast that is unforgettable.This is a job well done by Spielberg and patenitally an award nominee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not big on Leo, but he has been a bit busy the past year or so. I heard of Catch Me if You Can a while back and did a quick look up of the main character and was pretty interested. I like guys like Ricky Jay (and was very interested in seeing his Broadway Show on being a con-artist) and what not so this was something I was really looking forward to. And I was not disappointed at all.Leo was great as Frank Jr, and I always welcome any Christopher Walken character. Tom Hanks did fine as Carl Hanratty, but the real character was Frank. It had a biiiit of a slow start, but from the first moment we saw him taking control in school and con-ing his fellow students, it was pretty cool and not so unbelievable. His character really took advantage of those situations where you say to yourself, how does anyone know that I am really supposed to be here. I really have to comment about the opening credits because they were just sooo neat. The wacky situations that Frank seemed to sneak out of and into were just too ballsy (even makes you a bit jealous). If there were any real problems that I had with this film it was the almost silly and sped along France scene, but other then that I was pretty impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's entertaining chase comedy/drama features a couple of very fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as a forger who travels the world and the FBI agent determined to haul him in. Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., it fits nicely into the Spielberg canon of films about splintered families; Abagnale's underlying motivations concern his determination to recover what the I.R.S. has taken from his tax-evading father and, in the process, repair his broken home. Though it's an interesting story, it's not an extremely fascinating one: once Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson have set up the basic scams Abagnale operates, there's a lot of repetition over the first three-quarters of the film's 140 minutes (the action could have been pared a bit in the editing room) and it refreshes only in the final section, where Hanks overtly assumes the role of surrogate father to DiCaprio's needy child. After a couple of moody, personal science fiction films in "Artificial Intelligence: AI" and "Minority Report", Spielberg seems intent on losing himself in a wistfully retro action story--the film takes place in the Sixties but a Kennedy-era-innocent Sixties that seems cloistered from the events we've chosen to make iconic--but he's unable to let go of his dark side (he's probably incapable of ever making an `E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' again) and the film wallows in its unhappiness. But he's energized by the engrossing lead performances that dominate everything around them: as people consumed by the actions of escaping and capturing, DiCaprio and Hanks lock into each other and the relationship they form subtlety invites the viewer into their game; Spielberg wisely allows the actors to interpret the material directly and keeps the pressure off the audience by making everything clear and digestible. With Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken, amusing and intelligent as Abagnale's father. The harsh sunlit cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the cleverly mod production design is by Jeannine Claudia Oppewall. John Williams' unassuming, jazzy score is surprisingly good, considering the source.</fullReview>

If you take fine actors and put them into one film and have a genius direct it what do you get? An Oscar. This film by far is a great achievement on Mr. Speilberg's part. Mr. Di Caprio and Mr. Hanks as well as Mr. Walken all were incredible as they embodied these true life characters. I will aprecciate Mr. Speilbergs work and refer to this film whenever i talk about his films. Log this one away in your memory bank folks. But be careful, dont lose it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was definitely a fun one. I saw this one Christmas day with the family and was very much impressed. It's fun to see Hanks as a flawed character, and his performance (along with Leo's) was just awesome.There were some laughs to go along with the drama, but most of all, Frank's (Leo) actions served to capture the imagination. His many "Zach Morris moments" make this film a real treat to watch. I don't say this often, but this film is probably worth your $6-10---depending on how much your local theater gouges you.

		<fullReview>This was an interesting film. Very Cerebral in it's approach. Look for classic Tom Hanks as stuffy but diligent FBI Agent Carl Hanratty. This film looks at the true life experiences of Frank Abagnale, Jr.. While the movie would make the case that young Mr. Abagnale is a miss guided youth, the fact of the matter is, Mr. Abagnale was brilliant in his approach to crime. The break out performance is Amy Adams as Brenda. This lady has a future in film and I look forward to seeing her again and soon! The cast is well suited towards this film and all perform to expectations. This is certainly a movie that deserved a better release date. Lets face it, going against LOTR II is a tall order and I often wonder what the distributers are thinking. If this film were delayed three more weeks in it's opening weekend and this film could have been number 1 at the box office. As it is, This film should open at #3 or #4. It is well worth the price of admission!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing joy ride of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is easily Spielberg's best film since "Saving Private Ryan", and his best comedy ever. The film is a funny, exciting, adventurous journey into the world of conman extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr. If you don't know who he is now, you will after seeing this movie.Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much going into this. Spielberg's films have become so premeditated recently, with just the right angle, just the right piece of music and just the right look of awe on the actors' faces, that his films haven't been truly enjoyable for some time. He's like a novelist who, despite great diction and flawless punctuation, has lost his touch when it comes to story and character. With "Catch Me If You Can", Spielberg has finally loosened up and let the story take center stage. It's an understated but mesmerizing success. I even forgot that I was watching a Steven Spielberg film, which is a sign of how good it is.Christopher Walken, who did a Q&amp;A after the screening, said that this movie was filmed very quickly. Maybe that's why Spielberg didn't burden the movie with too much style -- he didn't have time to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, perceptive, touching, and funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wintermester of award winning films has finally arrived and I'm thankful for that. Having a chance to watch Catch Me If You Can ten days before its worldwide release was both rewarding and worthwhile. Steven Spielberg has perceptively created a true story, a period piece full of life, a colorfully captured era, a touching story of broken bonds between parent and child (especially that special relationship between father and son), an amusing chase of cat and mouse, and alas a trip that was so unpredictable and intriguing it makes you stare in awe and wonder. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale Jr., a young teenager who lives with his parents (Christopher Walken) circa 1960s and is adjusting to his families financial downfall after his father loses his former job and consequently his parent's divorce. After his father opens a bank account for him, Frank runs away from home to pursue a fake life of fraud checks and fraud identities. He pretends to be a co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, steals millions of dollars in the process, and falls in and out of romantic escapades. Meanwhile, FBI detective Carl (Tom Hanks) is hard on track behind Frank's many adventurous schemes trying to catch him. While the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat with its humor and fast paced entertainment, it also manages to be touching with one of its most important themes being the father son relationship. Frank Sr. (Walken) teaches his son Frank Jr. (DiCaprio) that "there are two mice who fall into a bowl of cream, one mice quickly gives up trying to get out, the second mice keeps struggling, continues and never gives up until he manages to get out by turning the cream into butter." This is Frank Sr. biggest lesson to his son. But Frank Sr. is convinced that his son is not a criminal and he won't turn him in to the police simply because he is his son. Frank loves his son too much and the only way that his son knows to repay his love is by buying his father a new Cadillac and offering him some money. It's interesting how Frank Jr. thinks that his parent's divorce and the destruction of his family is caused by the lack of money, which is exactly what causes him to pursue exactly that: money. He wanted to save his family or at least make sure that his never suffered because of lack of money. The music by John Williams is giddy, fast, and bouncy which reflects the sneaky endeavors of Leo's often weasel of a character. DiCaprio, Walken, Sheen, and Hanks all bring a knockout showcase, even though Hanks' southern accent is often annoying. Many of the scenes take place around or on Christmas day which make the movie sort of a holiday treat. I will not reveal the ending which ends kind of abruptly. I must admit that it did left me wanting to see more of the relationship that flourishes between Hanks and DiCaprio. But I was thoroughly entertained. This is a sure thought-provoker and a must-see for the holidays, especially anyone who admires its cast and crew. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie in its first public screening at the LA Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. Going in I did not know what to expect, mostly because of the fact that Spielberg directed and because of the presence of a former distaste in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say I was very surprised at the finished product which was very cool, very well done, witty, and just an all around good movie. I have not seen a biography film done so well since, well I guess since I first saw The Passion of Joan of Arc. DiCaprio appears to be back on the top of his game. Hanks... is Hanks. I love Hanks so I can't say anything bad about him. And of course, Christopher Walken in the role of the Frank Abagnale, Sr. There is a glimmer of Captain Koons, his cameo in Pulp Fiction, in his character in this movie, although he is very much more fun, and crime, loving. There is little suspense thriller or action in this movie, but it is more than made up for with the depth that Spielberg achieved in his characters as well as in the drama. A very representative scene of these characters is when Frank, Jr. has been caught posing as a substitute and teaching his English class at his new high school for a week before he is figured out. His parents are both brought in to the principals office and informed of his behavior as he is forced to sit outside the office and watch the proceedings. When his parent finally emerge they have grave looks on their faces as they escort him out. The mother exits frame as Frank, Sr. walks beside his son looking down condescendingly. It appears that Frank, Jr. is busted. Then out of nowhere Frank, Sr. pulls this jovial smile and the tension is released. Frank, Sr. is proud of his son's accomplishment. A very interesting relationship operates between the two for the entire movie along these lines. In addition to the screening, Christopher Walken was there for a little Q&amp;A afterwards. Weird dude. Funny, but weird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe he actually got away with all of that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie based upon a true story of a young con man who, in the space of a few short years, made millions of dollars cashing dodgy checks and passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and many other things as well. The movie is pits a determined FBI agent against this slippery criminal in an exposition of how hard it actually is to catch fraudsters. It is a very amusing movie, especially the scene where he walks into the French class of his new school and passes himself off as the teacher for an entire week (and he is able to do this because his mother, being French, has already taught him the language).I'm not a big fan of Spielburg Movies, meaning that whenever he releases one I generally feign acknowledgement and then go off an do something much more interesting. Indeed I find most of his movies are either boring feel good movies (ET, Close Encounters) or simply movies demonstrating how wonderful he thinks he is. However, this movie was actually quite a surprise. It was funny, absorbing, and the characters were quite intriguing.I remember when Tom Hanks was a comedy actor, though I would never put him in the same class of actors such as Eddie Murphy or the like. Once again, a lot of his old movies tended to be very light hearted feel good movies. However, he changed his direction with Philidelphia to more challenging roles. I can't say that this movie is one of those roles, since his character is very much like a cardboard cut out. However, this could simply be because the character that it is based upon is like that. He is an FBI agent that is determined to get his man and since he actually has nothing else for him (his wife left him) this is all that he has to define who he is.De Caprio has actually come quite a long way. He definitely is no Brad Pitt, but a number of movies that he has been in (Inception for a start) are starting to catch my attention. However I am still ingrained with the concept of the teenie bopper heart throb that I suspect he never intended to become (particularly since The Basketball Diaries was one of his first movies). In this movie he also plays a character who is alone, however his loneliness does not arise from his dogged determination to succeed, but rather because he is always on the run. He cannot stop, and Hanks will not stop chasing him. This is not surprising because he is a crook, and the FBI will not let crooks (or at least the poor ones) escape. He is caught in the end, but the end actually provides a further twist. Still, I thought the whole enemies talking to each other on Christmas day, when both were alone, did emphasise the loneliness of both characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cat-and-mouse chase that doesn't know which direction to take ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is a fitting title because I really tried to catch the appeal of the film and I almost managed until a final act that confirmed me one thing: a good story doesn't necessarily make a good film, a pity because the movie had great potential but ? only as a comedy. This is the film's problem; it's so ashamed of its comedic tones that it uses the moodiest drama as a counterpart. You have two levels in the film, when it's funny, it raises the humor to the level of greatest comedies reminding of good old Billy Wilder or Frank Capra's classics, and I mean that for the two acts, but when it's dramatic, boys it's so depressing I wonder if it's still the same film I'm watching and if it didn't actually convince Scorsese to hire Di Caprio as his new protégé. If only for one thing, I blame the film for having introduced Leo's new serious side.I'm aware that Frank Abagnale Jr.'s back-story carries many serious undertones, but come on; the guy is a con artist, and the premise is so entertaining, why should we care for the whole torment inhabiting his heart? Although I admit I love the whole father-and-son relationship and I thought Christopher Walken delivered a great performance, the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. was begging for more and more comedy. The material was shamefully wasted in Spielberg's attempt to make a serious character study out of this. And if it remained true to the first comedic premise, who else could have done a better job as a 'straight man' than Tom Hanks as Hanratty? He was a constant enjoyment as long as he was fooled by Leo -their first encounter is one of the funniest movie moments of the 2000's- but when the cat-and-mouse situation turned to his advantage, and Frank ultimately decided to help the FBI and become a new Hanratty, I couldn't help but be disappointed. I was waiting for the punch line, but I know, I know ? this is a true story.Well, let's admit this is not any con artist, this one was real, but that would have provided twice the excitement, even as a drama. Franks impersonated an airline pilot, doctor, assistant attorney general and history professor, and some of these exploits were made before he was 21. Well, I'm sure if a poll survey was made after the film's viewing, the majority would agree that the 'pilot' part was the most covered, with the most details about his growing craftsmanship as a fraudulent checks' maker. But how did he live as a doctor? How did his life consist on when he was a secret agent? The different chapters of his lives were so unequally covered that all we had to do, is to trust Leo's talent and sex appeal: if he did it once, he can do it anytime. I'm sorry but when you spend so much time on very depressing parts, why do you apply shortcuts on the most exciting ones?And are we supposed to believe that Frank's talent relies more on his sex appeal than a developing expertise? I'm certainly not a feminist, but the way women were depicted in the film was offensive and killed off all the charm of seduction. There is a part where the flight attendant welcomes the pilots with a sort of sexy wink in her eyes: if at that moment, you can't guess that Leo will bang her in the next scene, you haven't seen enough movies in your life. There are absolutely no redeeming female characters in this film, their whole purpose is to serve as a foil for Leo's charm, falling in the most obvious and degrading traps like compliments about their eyes, or a necklace. What was a cute running-gag became a blatant exploitation of women regardless of their differences: from the sensitive nurse to the over- glamorized hooker, not to mention the poor flight attendants applicants, all smiling around unknowing that it's only their sexy butts that are used as a cover.The whole film works as a fantasy anyway and not just for the chicks. It's so stylized that it was impossible to get any hint of realism even in the scenes that rang true, script-wise. The movie had one of the most memorable and stylized opening credits, the whole setting was trying so much to look 60's to the tiniest details, the cars, the clothes, the girls fashions, everything was aesthetically great looking, but at the end it was just like too 'sanitized'. I had the feeling I was watching an idealization of the 60's rather than a true biopic, maybe Spielberg is more at ease with World War II when it comes to the realism of a setting, but "Catch Me If You Can" was a fantasy on that level. This is why it should have kept the comedic tone, and spends more time on the other chapters of his life, yes, it wouldn't have fitted the title, which was about a cat-and-mouse chase, but let's face it, at the end, after two long hours, it was becoming too redundant. Once he's caught, another time, he escapes etc. etc. and any attempt to focus on the deep relationship between Hanratty and Leo was just bullshit, one was doing her job and the other wouldn't have cared less of becoming his friend, or working with the law. He was in a dead- end and had no choice. So at least the film, could have been an entertaining story of how you can fool the system with a nice creativity, but it chooses to be a biopic with cringe-worthy voyeuristic value. A nice try, an excellent premise, but a movie that doesn't know which direction to take, and this is saying a lot, coming from a Spielberg film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is a very entertaining film. Even though there is not much action, the whole dilemma of the con artists is good enough. The plot is about a con artist named Frank Abagnale Jr and the way he tried to avoid authorities including Carl played by Tom Hanks. The acting in this film is very good. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks had very good chemistry together. I liked the way how DiCaprio was able to perform Abagnale. The whole concept of this film is highly interesting. it's nice to learn how con artists operated back in the 60's. The music by John Williams is another classic but it is different than his usual music. You can tell that it's by Williams, but the music has more of a jazz sound. Overall, this is a very good drama by Steven Spielberg. I rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie and it was a very entertaining experience.The best thing about this movie (which is easy to overlook) is that although Frank is a cheat and a criminal in every sense of the word, we sympathise with him and want him to be more deceitful. We want to consciously overlook the moral bankruptcy. That is honestly how good the script and direction are.The presentaion of the 60's is realistic and engaging. There are a few occasions where you think that Frank's "heroics" are somewhat exaggerated but perhaps it is understandable because he was a master con man. Di Caprio does not look 16 when he is portrayed as 16, but I guess you can't make someone aged 30+ appear that young no matter how hard you try! I did not like Di Caprio before I saw this movie but my perception of his talent has completely changed. He gives a spell bounding performance. In fact I don't think any other actor would have bettered his performance. He completely looks the character and portrays many different expressions with flawless expertise. Hanks is subdued but is reliable nonethless. The rest of the cast are also very able, be that Frank Sr or Frank Jr's would-be father in law.In summary the direction, acting, scipt, photography, everything is top-notch. The only reason I don't give it a 9/10 is because it is a bit too long and I feel it could have been trimmed about 10-15 minutes. Well done Spielberg. Well done Di Caprio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not at all what I expected. What I expected was a comedy and or sappy romance that was somewhat cheesy. It wasn't. In the past I had not been a big fan of Mr. Leonardos movies and I believed that he was too cocky to really portray a good and true character. In this movie I found that he could do almost anything. He can play the businessman, the caring son, the loving fiancé, the player, and the pitiful homeless kid that just wants a family. I have seen this movie 3 times and each time I cried. I guess that my favorite thing about this movie is that you never really know what is going to happen next. You think you understand what is going to happen but you don't. I absolutely love this movie its got a little bit of everything in it. It has all of the things that you could ever ask for in a good movie, famous actors, romance, a little comedy, the cocky young hot guy that you end up feeling sorry for, and a great plot. Above all the most intriguing thing about this movie was that it was true. The story wasn't something that Hollywood dreamed up with their vivid imaginations. No it is the real live story of a living breathing persons life growing up. I was so into the movie that I actually decided to do some research on Frank Abagnale Jr. and learn more about his real life as one of the greatest bank fraud men alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few directors can lay claim to as much diversity as Steven Spielberg ? he's shown us every now and then with his ability to produce two films of starkly contrasting tone in the same calendar year. Most recently, 2005 saw Spielberg deliver the spectacular alien-invasion blockbuster War of the Worlds followed closely by the somber Best Picture nominee Munich. In 1993, it was the one-two punch of crowd-pleaser Jurassic Park and the uplifting Best Picture Schindler's List. 2002 was another year of achievement for Spielberg ? after wowing audiences with the thought-provoking sci-fi thriller Minority Report, they were treated with the light-hearted, thoughtful, and endlessly fun Catch Me If You Can.Set in the 1960's - in New York initially but spanning all the way out to France - Catch Me If You Can tells the tale (the film opens with "inspired by a true story") of Frank William Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fraudulent con artist who had successfully posed as a teacher, a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, stolen millions, and gotten away with it, all before his 19th birthday. Throughout the entire three-year episode, detective Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who gives determined chase, setting up a cat-and-mouse affair where Frank always seems to be a step ahead, but who more than once offers to give himself up to the agent he forms an interesting dependence on over time.What seems a simple premise is taken beyond that by a clever script and assured direction. The two leads are cast wonderfully, DiCaprio as the youthful con artist who seems to revel in the thrill of just getting away with things but who can in a moment snap into loneliness and yearning, and Hanks as the all-too-serious agent who loves to mess with Frank's mind. The supporting cast, too, give excellent turns but it's Christopher Walken who stands out as Frank Sr.- his sad, unfulfilled eyes speak tomes of the emotional struggle he's been through and the shaft that the law has treated him with. If there's a failing with the picture, it's the pacing during the opening sequences which establish the context of Frank Jr.'s situation - they seem to slow and weigh the movie down a little before it even kicks off proper with Frank Jr.'s first con. The closing sequences, too, serve as an epilogue that's a little bit unnecessary - Spielberg could have easily finished the film ten minutes earlier and audiences would not have been any less satisfied.It would be a shame to finish the review without touching on the technical aspects, and it's here that Janusz Kaminski's brilliant photography seems to glitter in gold, combining with excellent costuming and John Williams' score (inspired by 60's Sinatra hits and James Bond-style cues) to give a believable, immersive sense of period. Indeed, perhaps what makes Catch Me If You Can so effective is the supreme sense of amusement and fun it seems to have been made with, and that is something that's directly channeled on to the audience. There's no heavy, resonant story here that delivers an important message, but where Spielberg succeeds is in not trying to: it's a cop-and-crook flick that simply excels as entertainment, even if it's a tad on the long side for the scope of the story it covers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch it if you can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me if You Can is a fun ride based on the true life adventures of Frank Abagnale Jr. who, starting at the ripe old age of 16, posed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer (actually passing the bar) and wrote over 4 million in phony checks by the time he was 19 years old. I have read Mr. Abagnale's book and it is truly an amazing story. The screenwriter did a very good job of turning what could have been just one escapade after another into a thoughtful story of a young, smart, highly sensitive boy who was traumatized by his parent's divorce. He ran away when forced to choose between his two parents, and got caught up in a web of deception which took on a life of its own. Spielberg had to leave a lot of the details of the story out of the movie in order to more fully explore the motivations of the characters. I think this made the movie more interesting and added a serious dimension to what otherwise might have been fluff. After Schlinder's List, I believe this is Spielberg's best film. Great acting by all, especially Christopher Walken. Wonderful cinematography. The set design &amp; costumes envelop you in the '60's. Perhaps the real star of this film, however, is the original score by John Williams.....very sophisticated! In every way a real treat of a movie!</fullReview>

Just before renting "Catch Me If You Can", I've never heard anything about Frank Abagnale Jr. Now, I know a lot of things...Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man (in fact, not 20 years old yet) who discovered that he had a real talent of forging other people and to make money from it. And the story itself is not a forge, because it really happened. All of the elements presented in the movie are not necessarily true, but the majority is. The trueness of the story is simply incredible and hard to believe.Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers a fairly splendid performance here. While he was in his late 20's during the filming, DiCaprio perfectly appears as a late teenage boy.The other main character is FBI agent and fake checks specialist Carl Henratty, played by the incredible Tom Hanks. Henratty is the cat of the cat-and-mouse game and he personally runs after Abagnale on this wild ride in order to bring the kid to the justice. But the job isn't easy.The main example is the famous hotel showdown. At this moment, Henratty only heard the Abagnale name and he doesn't have any sight of Abagnale's face. So, he meets Abagnale, but the young man acts like if he was an agent as well and Henratty falls into the trap. This situation is the funniest one in the entire movie.Also highlighted must be Christopher Walken's performance as Abagnale's father.There is no single mood into this movie. Sometimes, it is very dramatic and there are very special scenes. But it's also very comic and it surely is one of the lightest movies of Steven Spielberg's career as a director.So, "Catch Me If You Can" is another jewel in Spielberg's filmography and so it is for DiCaprio and Hanks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of my favorite Spielberg films, I found it to be absolutely intriguing to watch and have seen it three times. My other favorite Spielberg films include THE COLOR PURPLE, 1941, JAWS and MUNICH, which was recently overlooked at he Oscars. I have written to Steven Spielberg and I am trying to find out how I can work in one of his films as a supporting actor or possibly meet him in Los Angeles. I think about Steven often and he is one of my Hollywood idols. He doesn't usually answer my letters to him at Universal. If anyone out there knows how I can reach him email me at TOMCONDELLES@YAHOO.COM, it has been a lifelong obsession of mine to work in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We enjoyed so much this film but not the end too.. We would like that Frank will continue to cheat everyone and he will continue to work as a lot of other work.. We 'd like to know what's happened to Brenda because after Frank left her at the Miami Airport we didn't have any information about her..Is she alive?? We think Carl had a special feeling for Frank and he would like to catch him only for his personal aim. But anyway was a great movie about the 60's and very realistic too. We think the worst character in the film is Frank's mother.. because she wanna only "catch" the richest men of the Rotary Club to have a lot of money to enjoy herself!! This is our comment!

		<fullReview>The life of Frank Abignale is explored here rather excellently by Steven Spielberg and company. This is all about a expert cheque forger who scammed his way into jobs with Pan-Am, was a high ranking lawyer and doctor, and romanced countless women. After getting caught by ruthless F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty, Abignale wrote an outstanding memoir, which has been quite faithfully brought to the screen. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite great here as Abignale and Hanks is good as Hanratty. After watching it, reading the book and then watching it again, I feel the book is slightly better, as the movie leaves holes in subplots the movie alludes to, but doesn't explore further (like his time in jail, and his relations with the Pan-Am recruits, which, bizarrely in the movie, is just dropped, making me wonder what on earth it was there for). But these are just minor "I've-read-the-book-neener-neener" points, the movie absolutely stands on it's own as a totally enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg is a real movieteller and his movies are always little jewels. Yes, he isn't alone and have excellent collaborators (actors, music, cinematography, editing,...) but others with the same starpower (no names for my safety...) do raspberries movies. As in warfare, a good general is first of all, a good leader of men.Beginning "Catch me" with original credits very stylized &amp; 60's, it is winning decision because you are always in the mood. Being a reader of the American Ads art-book, I feel all the flavors of this era, in the firework of colors, and the carefree spirit of the people.And this is what I remember of this movie: the strength of freedom.With courage, you can do everything, like Frank Jr. And if you are caught but the intention is pure, the fate would recognize it. And this justice is the same value for Spielberg from his first movie to its last: the family, the kids. On the fun side, everyone knows the love of Spielberg for planes, thus the choice for this particular story must have been evident for him.That's why Spielberg is great: The fundamental philosophic message is always delivered with impeccable techniques and a sincere humanity. The circle is closed...</fullReview>

The most extraordinary thing is that it's based on true story. I'm not a fan of Leo usually, but he was very believable and the Hankster was great. Although, I was not overly impressed by the way he was initially portrayed as something of a buffoon, only to turn into this sensitive, caring kind of guy. What put me off watching the film originally was the trailer showing Leo surrounded by all the beautiful air stewardesses - this didn't give any clue as to the actual style of the film - how he arranged that was masterful.

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Catch Me If You Can' is a rare breed of film combining skill, history, adventure, and interesting characters. (And I don't give out 10-star ratings unless I personally love the film and think it could not have been done any better.) 'Catch Me if You Can' was similar to the 1950s and 1960s North By Northwest or Bond-style films. The acting is done very well, which is highly crucial to the film because it is a film about characters. Leonardo does an excellent job in a not-so-Leonardo-typical-role. A good job on this film in this type of role probably earned him the part of Huges in 'The Aviator.' It is easy to get caught up in this film because of the good characterization and the wittiness of the events which lead him to jump around from place to place, creating this fantasy world and getting caught up in all of the lies. It is easy to feel sorry for him as much as to wish that he were caught and cured of his criminal past.I would highly recommend this film because I think that there is something in it that will appeal to everyone. You may not appreciate it or enjoy it as much as I did, but I still think it is one of those films you will remember for years to come. Excellent. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can is an absolutely fun film from the theme song to the adventures of Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abignale. The actors and characters are outstanding! Based on a true story of a con artist who couldn't handle the divorce of his parents, Leonardo DiCaprio breathes life again to the young Frank. Tom Hanks provide hilarity and a sternness to the plot as he and Leonardo provide perfect chemistry on the screen. Everything is perfectly set in it's time of the 1960s. From the airports to the clothes, the 60s are brought to life again. Steven Speilburg did a wonderful job, as well as the people who did props, clothes, and other items, bringing this picture to life. Comedy, romance, suspense, family, and the true art of bank fraud are brought forward in this remarkable film. With a shocking ending and sweet story line, this film definitely deserved more credit than it got. Watch it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Catch Me If You Can' is a beautifully crafted caper from Spielberg. Featuring terrific performances from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken the film exudes quality from start to finish. The depicted time period is captured and expressed to perfection: the sets, cars and clothes are a joy to behold at times and you find yourself genuinely lost in Frank Abagnale JR.'s world of deception. The lighting is wonderful, all sunlight streaming through windows and half closed curtains, giving the film a timeless, fairytale look, perhaps serving as a metaphor for the make believe world of young Frank as he impersonates both a doctor and an airline pilot whilst conning America's banks out of millions of dollars through bogus cheques, all before his 18th birthday. The characters are fleshed out extremely well and the reasons behind Frank's descent into a life of crime are carefully illustrated and conscientiously referred to throughout the movie. I highly recommend 'Catch Me If You Can' as it is refreshing, well made and absorbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch Me If You can is based on the extraordinary true story of 15 year old Frank Abagnale, Jnr (Leoardo Dicaprio), a young lad who lived during the 50s. At the point where we pick up Frank's life, he is not having the best of times at home. His parents are having financial problems which eventually lead to them splitting up and his mother (Nathalie Baye) leaving the family. The split strengthens Frank's relationship with his father (Christopher Walken), and inspires the youngster to leave home with the sole aim of making enough money to help his dad. With just $50 in his account Frank has no idea how he will succeed, but he soon learns! It is during his stay in New York that Frank stumbles across a master plan, which he thinks will offer him a bachelor lifestyle, while at the same time earning him a wedge of cash. His idea is based upon becoming an airline pilot, a profession which is treated with respect. Frank sets about impersonating a pilot, and the financial reward, built in with the trust that comes with the job soon sees him taking advantage of his position. The success proves too much of a temptation for Frank and he abuses the trust placed in him in order to cash fraudulent checks. His dodgy dealings continue over many months, but it soon becomes apparent to him that he must change his identity frequently to avoid being apprehended, so Frank cons his way into several new professions, including a medical doctor and a lawyer.Catch Me If You Can was a major hit when released earlier this year and it is easy to see why. Steven Spielberg has taken an interesting story and added his own personal touch to create a movie which is engrossing, yet incredibly easy viewing. The movie also has a cast to die for, which is another reason why it succeeds in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, if not very deep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a lighter film from Spielberg, which makes for a nice change. Unfortunately, it's also a bit disconnected. It's lacking an emotional center and comes off a bit cold, although it does have a certain charm. It also has a tendency to downplay the seriousness of the crimes committed, while it glorifies the ingenuity of the criminal.The actors are fine, if a bit cold. DiCaprio (not a favorite of mine) is good as the smooth talking con man, although he isn't quite as convincing when he tries to slip into the cover roles that the character assumes. He's doesn't look like he could pass for an older figure, as the real Frank Abignale did.Tom Hanks is his usual self, some good scenes, some mediocre. He can be a good actor, but he seems to take himself too seriously in his dramatic roles. I thought his performances were much better in his comedies.Christopher Walken is great, as usual, as the influence and motivating factor in Frank Abignale's life. He lives his life as a lie and provides the blueprint for is son to do the same.The period detail and music are good, without hitting you over the head, as in Down With Love. Some attitudes don't ring true, but that is a minor quibble. The pace is leisurely, if a bit too much so when the "chase is on." Thankfully, Spielberg is not of the "epileptic editing" generation of filmmakers.Ultimately, this is an entertaining, if lightweight film. It's a nice caper story that tries for sympathy, but never quite gets it. Like most capers, it treats serious crime with a laissez faires attitude, but is lacking the subtle charm of a classic caper film. It never decides if it is a comedy or a drama and doesn't seamlessly blend the two. Still, it provides enough entertainment to sustain interest. Worth a rental or a matinée viewing, but not destined for any top 10 lists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hallelujah! Spielberg's back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the crafty hands of Spielberg, a novel long having been considered as unintriguing, becomes an excellent piece of work. The autobiographical novel, written by Frank Abergnale, tells of a counterfeit-savvy teenager's three-year stint at eluding the FBI by posing as a pilot, doctor, and teacher in the 60s.  Abagnale's story, first published in 1980 was shopped around for weeks to studios before being picked up. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you'll have trouble thinking of it as unexciting. However, looking at it from a different angle, is a form of crime such as passing bad checks is nothing visually compelling and it doesn't lend itself well to base a whole movie about?  To this I credit Spielberg, who once again creates an exciting and fun movie, that families can get excited about seeing come holiday season. Spielberg, essentially, takes the stories and infuses it with a couple of familiar elements: a lost youth struggling with the abandonment of a father figure (or in this case, his actual father), as well as a cat-and-mouse chase. The former is something which we can relate to more than we consciously realize and the latter is something which adds suspense and fun to the story. The alienated youth theme has popped everywhere in Spielberg's movies, from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to AI and everywhere in between. At the same time, I wouldn't call Spielberg's work, unoriginal or recycled, since he mixes these motifs in different combinations with other dramatic elements and the story itself is quite fresh. Quality seeps out of every element in the film, from its score and sets to its dialogue and acting. I never thought I'd ever hear myself say this years ago, but Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a great performance, shedding aside his `Who needs acting when I'm a sex-symbol' attitude of old, and immersing himself in the role with all the vulnerability, despair, and aptitude it entails. Tom Hanks, of course, matches up to DeCaprio, line by line, as Hanratty, the FBI investigator who chases him for three years. The relationship of mutual respect between the two, and eventual lifelong friendship, is truly heartwarming. In Hanks' interpretation of the part, there is not just mutual respect but frustration bordering on obsession, as he borrows a page from the inspector in Les Miserables. Christopher Walken also has a big role as the father, with whom DiCaprio's character is very close. The film is not only a joy in itself but a positive sign in this new century that the work of a skilled storyteller such as Steven Speilberg can still hold up after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fun; DiCaprio's Best Since "Titanic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie earns a good rating if only for bringing to light the unbelievable and yet true story of Frank Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a young scam artist who bilked banks out of millions and who, having been captured and come clean, eventually put his talents to work in the other direction. If you can get through what I thought was an agonizingly boring animated sequence that runs during the opening credits (which seemed to go on forever) you'll enjoy this.The movie is about Abagnale's criminal days, and takes the viewer on a roller coaster of situations which Abagnale manages to lie, swindle and cheat his way through, all the time being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks); thus the title of the movie. It's a fun story (particularly, I thought, his very first "scam" - as a student at a new school, he manages to convince people that he's a substitute French teacher and actually "works" in that capacity for 10 days until he's discovered!)In my opinion, this is DiCaprio's best performance since "Titanic." I haven't been impressed with his work since, but here he really managed to become the character of Abagnale (much as he did with Dawson in "Titanic") rather than simply looking as though he were acting a part. He was clearly the star of the movie. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, quite surprisingly disappointed me a bit, and I would rarely say that about such a talented actor. Perhaps it was the part of Hanratty, but Hanks just didn't stand out to me. It seemed as though a hundred actors could have played the role without anything (except the name Tom Hanks) being lost. So, my normal expectations of the two stars were reversed here, which made the movie all the more interesting.It's an enjoyable way to spend an evening.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about the consequences of divorce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two reasons which made me unable to enjoy this original and amusing story from A to Z. One is Leonardo DiCaprio, who, unfortunately, has the leading part in this film. He plays an 17-year-old boy who looks ten years older than he is, all right but he absolutely failed to convince me that he is really only 17. Sometimes he tries to play particularly `childish' in order to emphasize his real age but everything else ? marrying, cheating, etc. ? he does like Leonardo would do it, not like a minor whose parents got divorced (no matter how super-intelligent this minor may be).The other problem is that this is a Steven Spielberg film. I was looking forward to see it because I thought maybe Spielberg has, for a change, chosen to tell a good-humoured story about a good-humoured sly fox in a good-humoured way. And I guess, any other director would have done so. But Spielberg would never get away from his crucial but corny theme: family. And he would make a family film out of every subject put in his hands. And this, in my opinion, harms the film very much. A movie based upon a true story can never be really true. So Spielberg had the chance to decide to skip famiy sentimentalities. But he didn't.If you want to see a good film on family, watch The Royal Tenenbaums or the Danish documentary Family. If you want to see Catch Me If You Can, do so. It is really entertaining, brilliantly filmed and well acted by the whole cast with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. But do not be so na?ve to give Steven Spielberg a second chance.</fullReview>

Today he'd be on talk shows bragging about his conquests and would seem right in time. Back then people were more decent and trusting and he was able to exploit that. Steven gives the movie a lot of style. It all looks and feels correct to the period but you are not assaulted w/this. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner are terrific too.

		<shortDescription>Crime doesn't pay! Unless of course you're really good at it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People have always delighted in the exploits of those individuals that flout convention (and the occasional law) often living vicariously through them. How else can one explain the fascination with gentleman skyjacker DB Cooper, who, in 1971, jumped out of an airplane with a $200 000 ransom and vanished. No one ? with the exception of law enforcement ? wanted him to get caught. But next to Frank Abagnale Jr. Cooper looks like a piker - half a decade earlier, Abaganalemade off with a far greater sum with nothing more than chutzpah, fast-talking and a great smile. So what if he got caught?Frank Abagnale Jr. learned early on that looks could be deceiving: his parents' fairy tale romance didn't include a `happily ever after' ending and although Frank Sr claimed to know the secret to success, it continued to elude him. Rather than be discouraged, Frank Jr. embraced these lessons and adopted deceit as his career, assuming the guise of doctor, lawyer, and pilot (among others). Not content to look like a jet setter, Frank embarked on global cheque bouncing spree to the tune of $2.5 million that earned him a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted List - quite a feat for a 17-year-old high school drop out.Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr's dalliances with the law as a teen con man, `Catch Me If You Can' is both adventure and comedy with a touch of cynicism (the whole collapse-of-the-nuclear-family angle). The film has a bouncy, spirited soundtrack that supports and enhances the lightweight subject matter. This, along with wonderful set and costume design help to faithfully establish that sixties feel. Subtle scoring, fluid editing and tight camerawork ensure that the pacing is consistent and flows smoothly. This attention to detail is carried on by the cast.This is the other Leonardo DiCaprio Christmas movie ? the one with a modest budget, that wasn't years overdue, and didn't have everyone's tongue wagging about late night parties and blow-ups on the set. After solid work in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' and `The Basketball Diaries', DiCaprio became the flavor of the moment with `Titanic' (one of the most overrated movies of all time) and his credibility went into decline with roles in `The Beach' and the abysmal `Man in the Iron Mask'). I braced myself for the worst and was therefore pleasantly surprised with his performance in this film: DiCaprio carries the role of Frank Jr. with aplomb, infusing Frank with the perfect balance of charisma, ballsy impertinence, humor and when necessary, gravity (without resorting to the broody scowling we've seen before). His colleagues are no slouches either.His role as the spectacled ubergeek in `Blast From the Past' notwithstanding, Christopher Walken's characters are best known for their villainous tendencies. As Frank Sr., Walken is decidedly under whelming, a pitiable dim shadow of a man who labours under delusions that salvation is just around the corner. Walken ensures that his character doesn't cross the line into useless pathetic, rather he exists as a cautionary tale to blind optimism. Equally understated, and yet simultaneously outstanding, is Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, Frank Jr's dogged FBI foil. Carl ? a composite of several of the individuals who tracked Abagnale ? is a quiet, determined loner who carries a few too many pounds and revels in the chase. Hanks brings the same quintessential every-man quality to the role that he is famous for, without looking like his character is a rehash from some other film. This is one of those rare films that has virtually no swearing, violence or nudity (there are a few suggestive scenes) and yet doesn't moralize or try to drown the viewer in saccharine. In addition, it is fun, engaging, and well acted. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun in sadness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from Schindler's List, Catch Me If You Can is my favourite Steven Spielberg film, in which I believe something common between us teenagers is reflected home-- fear to see our parents' divorce. Frank's life as an economic criminal began right after his parents' announcing divorce. He first did this just for living, and then the thought of reunion his family took over. Like many teenagers, Frank loves his parents so much, as can be told through the minutia that Frank wants his mother to quit smoking, but they, just like many parents, just seem to ignore this, as an only child, I can't help but feeling extremely sad about it. Each pair of parents should pay attention to this brilliant piece of work, 'cause sometimes you just have no idea about how your children love you! Frank made every effort trying to reunion his parents, but each time his father turned him down. Every crazy step Frank took was related to this purest wish, nothing seems matters when compared with it, even going to jail. His father's death made up his mind to visit his beloved mother, who was happy with her new family, Frank alone outside in Christmas, urging Carl to put him in the car not to be seen by mom, not to worry her. I just can't help laughing and crying each time I saw this movie. Steven Spielberg is amazing! He handle the delicate feeling of the many Franks and the carelessness of parents so very well and accurately. A tragic rather than a comedy. A triumph deserves recommended.</fullReview>

And at the end i was amazed at how well these events were conveyed because this really did happen. I thought that was amazing. BUY IT!!! Give it to your friends for Christmas, thanksgiving and Easter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie twice in the theater, which is saying a lot, because I hardly ever even go to the theater to begin with. To say that Stephen Spielberg is a genius is an understatement, when it comes to films like this. Every single moment in the movie is captured with sheer brilliance and fantastic execution. He knows exactly how to make the audience feel with each and every different aspect that is delivered to us in each and every scene.Leonardo DiCaprio is of course famous for Titanic, and other films since then, but I would have to say that this is his best role to date, since "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?". Although he is a character actor, and a good one at that, this role for him was perfect, because he not only was given the chance to be a "character" but also the lead in the film. He is able to carry a whole movie on his shoulders with such ease it is so enjoyable to watch. Tom Hanks was certainly not one to forget in this film, either, though. His character, Handratty, was unforgettable as well. Hanks is able to make you hate him, feel sorry for him, and laugh at him all at once in 'Catch Me'. His accent is very well rehearsed, and there are times you forget that it is Tom Hanks, and not the real character he is playing.This movie will leave you cheering for the wrong team, and holding your breath at times. It is hard not to like this film, and I give it a full 10 for it's magic, beauty and true-to life story that it so gracefully delivers to us. A good watch and great film in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but did Steven Spielberg's latest Blockbuster-fodder, Catch Me If You Can, have to be released now? The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks have already turned in their best for the year (Gangs of New York and Road to Perdition, respectively), even if those performances weren't great, and Spielberg's other chase film released during the summer, Minority Report, was one of his best films. While the release date shouldn't directly effect the film itself, it might've given Scorsese's Gangs a little chance to breath without having this and that as two Leo films at once during the Christmas-break film rush. Catch..is inspired by the story of Frank W. Abignale Jr., who as a teen became a con-man, impersonating an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc, and was finally caught in France. DiCaprio plays Frank, and tries to play him as a suave, if occasionally panicked, teen, and while there have been worse performances this year, it is very clear that the better work for him is in Gangs, not here- he's often too straightforward with his emotions and only hints to that he's someone outside of a conniver. Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job, with a keen accent and demeanor, and Christopher Walken, who plays Abignale Sr., turns in the best performance of the film, and shows more depth than his son in the few scenes he has. Overall, there are some moments of fun that shine through, like when Frank Jr. does his first con as a school teacher at 16, or when he fools Hanks at the Miami airport, yet it can be seen in many scenes that more challenging material was manipulated by Spielberg and company. Still, it should appeal to the mass market of movie-goers.....this is a re-edit some four years later. On repeat viewings, the film works better. DiCaprio actually works as more effective with his character, and even Hanks becomes more interesting than just 'decent'. B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know by now that CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on a real person, and his exploits as a doctor, lawyer, airpline copilot, and a few other things. For the most part the film is factual, as described in the DVD extras, including the real Frank Abagnale describing his experiences himself. DiCaprio and Hanks are both excellent in their respective roles. Hanks, especially, who usually seems to simply be playing various versions on himself, becomes a great character as the FBI agent chasing Frank Jr.some SPOILERS follow - two main deviations in his story were used in the film. First, Frank Jr and his dad had several encounters during the film, but in real life Frank Jr never saw his father again after he ran away, and Frank Sr. died while Frank Jr. was in prison. That deviation worked well. The other deviation did not. In reality he was captured in France when locals reported seeing him in their community. In the film, there is a very implausible scene where the agents are looking at some of the counterfeit checks, quickly decide they had to come from Europe, and also quickly decide that he must be printing them in his mother's home town. They go there, they find him, he ends up in French jail. When I saw that scene, it bothered me, I didn't think it seemed plausible with regard to the rest of the film. And, when the DVD extras made it clear that this scene was fictional, it further reinforced my opinion that this was not a good deviation.Still, it is a good, entertaining film, and the DVD is top quality, with a very interesting set of extras. After his release from prison time, Frank Jr. has gone straight, has contributed to techniques world-wide to reduce check and currancy fraud, and has made his real fortune as a consultant. He is in his late 50s today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" tells the story of Frank Abagnale, con man. With Spielberg in the director's chair and A-listers leading the way, you'd expect something a little better than this story about a kid who conned his way into jobs as a Pan Am pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, and into some serious money. Reasonably entertaining and well crafted, this film runs a tad long and is smeared with comedic overtones making it difficult to take seriously. It might have worked better as a serious rather than playful drama. Nonetheless, worth a look by anyone interested in stories about scamming.

		<shortDescription>entertaining, if minor, Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From childhood on, we are taught that honesty is a virtue and dishonesty a vice. We have that message pounded into our heads and branded into our psyches by parents and teachers, by law enforcers and lawmakers, by clergymen and civic leaders. Yet, at the same time, society as a whole, especially in our entertainment, has always had a certain soft spot for the scoundrel and the rogue, a kind of running love affair with the con man, the shyster, the rascal who can pull the wool over everyone's eyes and get away with it. It is this paradox of human nature that Steven Spielberg celebrates in `Catch Me if You Can,' the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., the huckster supreme who, at the incredible age of 17, left home and family, and managed to pass himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and to swindle the banks out of millions of dollars in bad checks into the bargain.If the film didn't say that it was based on a true story, no one would ever believe it, so absurd and unlikely is its premise. The story certainly proves that old adage that fact is indeed stranger than fiction. In many ways, `Catch Me if You Can' is essentially a lighthearted, comic version of `Les Miserables' (or `The Fugitive' if you prefer), with Tom Hanks as the Javert-like Carl Hanratty, a by-the-book FBI agent who becomes personally obsessed with bagging this one particular lawbreaker, who somehow manages to deftly evade his every attempt at capture. For Hanratty, apprehending Frank becomes the quest that gives his life meaning and purpose, the focal point of his existence. Hanks does a splendid job capturing the deadpan seriousness of this single-minded but constantly put-upon individual, never allowing him to become a mere buffoon or caricature as he might have become in less capable hands. Leonardo Di Caprio does a first rate job turning Frank into a world-class charmer. We understand how so many people could allow themselves to be duped by his charismatic personality. And it is nice to see Christopher Walken NOT playing a creepy villain for a change, but rather a father who loves his son but who simply can't find it within himself to be either a successful person in his own right or a moral role model for his boy to follow.Spielberg does a fine job pointing up the parallels between Frank and Carl, the lawbreaker and the law enforcer. Despite the fact that they are antipodes apart on the legal spectrum, both are living lives of loneliness and emptiness, and they develop a strange sort of camaraderie on that basis. For one thing Frank learns is that, although he may be able to dupe people into believing all sorts of untruths about him and live high in the process, there is no substitution for the real things in life like love, marriage and family that money cannot buy.`Catch Me if You Can,' though it is a very entertaining film, ultimately feels a trifle incomplete, as if it were lacking just that touch of depth that would make it truly outstanding. It's fun on the surface, but it never seems to dig much beneath that surface. Perhaps, it is in the nature of the story itself that the trouble lies. Once we catch on to the novelty of the plot, the story doesn't really seem to have anywhere to go except to keep showing us the same thing over and over again. For all the bravura performances, the characters never quite show us what makes them tick. This is particularly true of Frank, whose motives remain obscure throughout most of the film. Oh well. `Catch Me if You Can' is intended primarily as a lark, I imagine, and on that level it is generally successful.This latest film certainly does not rank up there in the Spielberg pantheon. It is, in fact, a minor work by a major filmmaker, who is merely marking time, perhaps, till his next true masterwork. It's Spielberg in a relaxed, kick back, sunny mood, not as great as when he is really pumping away hard, but good enough for the time being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have caught him sooner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These sorts of psychopaths are always interesting figures, one of the reasons stories and films about them keep appearing on a regular basis. (Tony Curtis did a nice number in "The Imposter".) The guys can charm the pants off you. They tend to be bright and handsome, or at least well groomed. And they run into situations that are bound to be comic. All the ingredients are there for an engaging flick.Maybe one of the reasons we are fascinated by them is that we envy them. Here are people who are reasonably smart, who keep themselves clean, have decent manners, and in many ways resemble the rest of us except for one thing -- they lack anxiety. Well, anxiety of a particular sort, the kind that is sometimes called "responsibility," "conscience" or, if you want to stretch it, "superego." Any of us could learn how to pass for a lawyer by watching Perry Mason reruns for a couple of weeks. We could perhaps even pass the bar exam with a few weeks of dedicated study. We could all be doctors too, if being a doctor meant nothing more than strolling around in a lab coat with a stethoscope hanging around our necks and never having to perform a laparotomy. But we can't do it because we've been conditioned in such a way that we would be betrayed by our own anxiety.DeCaprio is able to do it here, in this nicely directed Spielberg movie, with the help of his victims. The help comes in the form that sociologists call "normalization." We live our lives according to generally recognized scripts. If we do something it calls for a certain kind of response from the people around us. (Eg., what does the script call for next when we say to someone, "How are you"?) The mistakes we inevitably make are reinterpreted by others so that they seem to follow the script. DeCaprio as a doctor is called in unexpectedly to treat a patient in the ER. "Bicycle accident," says one of the other physicians. "Do you concur?" he asks the others one by one. They concur. "Carry on then," he tells them and leaves and they make up a good reason for his behavior. Most of the movie is played for laughs, as Williams' light-hearted semi-fantasy theme tells us. And it has its amusing moments. DeCaprio has seduced a girl and is on the brink of marrying her when he blurts out the truth -- "I'm not a doctor, I'm not a Lutheran, I never went to Harvard, and I'm not a lawyer." Her jaw drops and she says, "You're not a LUTHERAN?" A scam in which DeCaprio chooses eight pretty young girls to play stewardesses and distract attention from him is staged like a Miss America contest. There are some dramatic moments too in which the film and the score, as manipulative as the DeCaprio character, practically begs you to feel sympathy for the guy. It stops just short of ripping open your thorax, reaching inside, and playing "Hearts and Flowers" on your heartstrings.But it all leaves a kind of sour aftertaste if you give it any thought at all. Here is DeCaprio. Strutting around in his faux Pan Am pilot's uniform, or his doctor's clothes, a multimillionaire after hanging all this bad paper, all the women adoring him for being something he isn't, sprung from jail after a few years for a cushy job with the FBI, writing a book about his crimes, selling the rights to Hollywood. Fine for him, but he has cost the rest of us a good deal. These financial shenanigans alone must have boosted the banks' insurance rates, which means their operating expenses went up, which means the rates they charge us for their services went up, which means we all contributed our little bit to the 4.1 million dollar pot that DeCaprio's character has accumulated. And that's not counting the heartbreak he leaves behind. (Eg., once he dumps his girlfriend she disappears from the movie. She's portrayed as stupid, homely, and shallow. But she's as human as DeCaprio. How, exactly, did she feel about the whole affair?)It seems unfair somehow that people like this should be celebrated at our expense, just because we have consciences and they don't. When a guy cuts in front of you in line it's a selfish act, and it doesn't matter whether he's charming or not. He's putting everybody else one place back and hasn't earned his position. It's sorry enough in real life. That the movie should celebrate the facts of DeCaprio's contempt and our own foolishness is really inexcusable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment but should have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to like in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN--the handsome production values, the unobtrusive John Williams score, the performances by a first-rate cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Walken) and the fact that it's based on the amazing story of a young man who fooled authorities with forgeries and impersonations over a long period of time.Makes me recall the Tony Curtis film, THE GREAT IMPOSTER ('61), which told the same sort of amazing story with a lot more exuberance. Somehow events never seem quite so extraordinary in the way that they unfold in this reenactment of a true story. Only a few times does the urgency of DiCaprio's escape from the man chasing him really involve the audience. Don't ask me why--but there's not enough punch to the proceedings and perhaps this is where John Williams with his "nice" score fails to take the drama seriously. Instead of accompanying the more gripping moments with dramatic bursts of music, he instead goes for a quieter, sophisticated sound closer to the bland '60s sound of cocktail music. Somehow this deadens the impact or seriousness of the crimes being depicted and gives the whole movie a bland quality that is out of place. I never thought I'd be criticizing a John Williams score for being bland but so be it.The performances can't be faulted--Tom Hanks is especially good as the F.B.I. man and DiCaprio does a highly competent job as the misguided youth. Christopher Walken makes the father an interesting character.Nevertheless, it IS an amazing story--this man had to be brilliant to pull off what he did--in an age where counterfeit checks and IDs are scrutinized as carefully as they are most of the time, it seems highly unlikely that such a ruse could happen in the light of today's high security--or is it??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances are good. Christopher Walken is himself, and even when he's sympathetic, he's odd. The movie looks clean. But for a caper/con movie, it's very slow.(Spoiler) Also, the movie suffers from the typical neat Spielberg coda where "Poof! Now he's happily married and a millionaire!" Kind of like Mike Milken, Ivan Boesky and (soon to be) Enron, Adelphia and WorldCom figures who bilk little people for millions, serve almost no time, and come out ready to restart with all their cronies. I'm all for redemption, but without the context of the interceding years, this amounts to glamorizing grand theft and fraud. I'm sure the facts are true, but they didn't belong in the movie. Unless the director is making an expensive lesson advising his (and my) children that crime can pay if you're just clever enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perversely, this movie would actually have to be better for me to dislike it. As it is, it's just too boring to care about. Good cast and crew, likeable production values, no complaints there - but there's also no story, no believability, no suspense, no interest, no ANYTHING.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a one note performance in which he looks cute (whoa - THERE'S an Oscar caliber stretch, huh?) but tells us nothing about the character. Tom Hanks apparently decided to give nothing to this performance except some extra time at an all-you-can eat buffet. He's a slightly chubby cop obsessed with catching Leo for no particular reason; he doesn't even dislike Leo, nor is anyone else in the FBI apparently even interested in catching this "master criminal."But worst of all, Leo's character impersonates a doctor, a pilot, and a criminal attorney...and yet we don't see him get caught in a tight scrape even once. As this is a real life story, surely the real Frank Abagnale had many hilarious or suspensful "near misses" - so why have they all been cut from this film? Leonardo postures in costumes; Hanks follows at a walking pace (with virtually no police procedural techniques shown); no one particularly cares if Leo's character is ever caught or not. (Worse still, in the opening five minutes of the film, you ALREADY KNOW whether or not he got caught, and who (if anyone) caught him). Peg this one at "zero" on the old suspense meter.This seemed like a not particularly well-done TV movie, done for not a particularly prestigious network. A definite disappointment for all involved (even John Williams' score is lame). I'd say to wait for this one to hit the 99? rental rack...and then "Catch It If You Must."</fullReview>

However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending. The only thing I didn't enjoy watching was DiCaprio (as "Frank Abagnale") taking advantage of genuinely-nice girls. This guy was no hero, believe me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Frank Abagnale's autobiography so I was worried what Steven Spielberg would do with the film, given he's known for giving his subjects the big Hollywood treatment. I was pleasantly surprised - I guess Abagnale's incredible true story suited the big treatment. Leonardo Di Caprio accurately captures Abagnale's immaturity and impulsiveness, disastrously combined with his fierce intelligence. He becomes a master con man living out every fantasy, as a pilot, a lawyer, a teacher, and even a doctor, and manages to swiftly dodge the consequences for years. It's comical, in a way, seeing the sheer audacity and inventiveness of the man. I love the scene where he strides across the airport with the air hostesses in their chic suits. It's funny to see how trusting and gullible companies such as banks and airlines and hotels were in the 1960s, and Frank just exploits it to the hilt. But also, as in the book, we see how terribly sad Abagnale is. In the end he has only his wits to live on, and it can't last if he's going to live a normal life. Things I don't like include how overblown the music score is. I hate it when the music tells you how you're supposed to feel in a scene. I don't like Tom Hanks as the detective -- he's too much of a clown. I love Christopher Walken as Frank's dad, also a bit of a sad character. Also the film does go on a bit long, but then there is a lot of Abagnale's life to squeeze on to the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story in this film entitled,Catch Me If You Can.It is a biographical comedy-drama film based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so skillful that the FBI eventually turned to him for help in catching other check forgers.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale and Tom Hanks along with Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye.Frank W. Abagnale Jr. is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula, leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr., after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty , an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong, a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA.The scene then flashes forward to a plane returning Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Consumed with grief, Frank escapes from the plane and goes back to his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl that Frank realizes is his half- sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, to which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him.On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet appeared at work. However, Frank finally shows up and they discuss their next case.The ending credits reveal that Frank has been happily married for 26 years, has three sons, lives in the Midwest, is still good friends with Carl, has caught some of the world's most elusive money forgers, and earns millions of dollars each year because of his work creating unforgeable checks.Steven Spielberg turns in another hit, with help from a strong performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, in this stylish, breezily entertaining, and surprisingly sweet story of real-life wunderkind con artist Frank Abagnale.It was a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices.Also,it was an excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted.In summary,the movie works at all levels.</fullReview>

And The Performances, are WOW!'Catch Me If You Can' is based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. Bringing the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr. on celluloid is not an easy job. Abagnale, Jr. in his prime was a man who had a vision many didn't. He had the talent &amp; skill many aren't blessed with. His notorious yet adventurous journey, luckily, unfolds, brilliantly in here. Even cinematically, Abagnale, Jr.'s Life turns out to be one hell of a roller-coaster ride!Steven Spielberg's Direction, is Marvelous. He handles this journey with amazing ease &amp; excitement. He creates a puzzle, which he solves eventually, and he solves it strikingly. Jeff Nathanson's Adapted Screenplay is amazingly entertaining. Cinematography by Janusz Kami&#x144;ski, is stupendous. Editing is sharp. Music by John Williams, is excellent. Art &amp; Costume Design, are worth a mention.Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio gives a mesmerizing performance as Abagnale, Jr. The Actor embodies the Genius &amp; Carries the film on his shoulders.

		<fullReview>The perfect period drama! Steven Spielberg couldn't have done a better job of showing what life was like in the 1960's with his movie Catch Me If You Can. From people being in awe when seeing a pilot to the music and clothing, the 1960s were shown very well. There was nothing about this movie that didn't feel like it belonged in the decade. The fact that this is movie based on real life, makes the story that much more amazing. The main character, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), was a con artist at such a young age, 17 years old. Throughout the movie he impersonated a pilot, doctor, teacher, and lawyer, stealing money from the government along the way with fraudulent checks. Even though he was considered "the bad guy" in this movie, you're still rooting for him to escape the police. The FBI was constantly on his trail, under the command of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), creating suspense throughout the entire movie. Even with this serious criminal activity, Spielberg still manages to bring humor into the movie. This humor is emphasized by the two lead actors because they work so well together. Had those two been cast differently, I don't think the movie would have been as good as it was. My favorite part of the movie had to be the opening credits. They draw you into the movie right from the start. Instead of just putting the cast and crew's names over the start of the movie, they made the opening credits their own movie. They literally told the story of the movie using retro animation. It went through the jobs that Frank impersonated during the movie in such a great way. The best way to lead you into the movie!This movie, in a way, resembles many aspects of the James Bond movies, minus the killing of course. Frank could be described as a "Lady's man" in this movie, despite his age, and also his numerous disguises/impersonations help him remind me of James Bond.This movie would be my first recommendation for movies based on real life because it's so suspenseful, entertaining, comedic, and fun to watch. I was constantly trying to guess what Frank would do next and how he would escape the FBI, and I love how the pace of the movie never slowed. It's just the sort of movie that you want more of even when the movie's done. So, I guess you'll just have to watch it again, because it's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishingly exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie managed to catch my attention in the first 10 minutes. Ever since I had laid my eyes on Leo, I knew this was gonna be marvelous. It's one of those films that just can't bore you no matter how mundane things get! All of the actors did their best in my opinion, and everyone scintillated in their own specific way, especially the main protagonist, whose charm and intelligence impressed me.I honestly think that this movie has it all. It's unique, exciting(especially its myriad amount of unique humorous scenes), original, and it's based on a true story. It will satisfy even the snobbiest filmophile. I wholeheartedly recommend you this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING THIS REVIEW INCLUDES A SPOILER Catch Me If You Can is inspired by the young teenage con artist and master of deception Frank Abagnale Jr. played by actor Leonard DiCaprio. This movie is about the relentless pursuit of Frank Jr. by FBI agent Carl Hanratty played by actor Tom Hanks. The movie starts out by showing sixteen year old Frank Jr. living a good life with his father Frank Sr. played by actor Christopher Walken and his mother Paula played by actress Nathalie Baye. The family runs into some financial issues because Frank Sr. owed the IRS money. Due to the financial issues the family had to move out of their house to an apartment. Paula cannot deal with all of the changes and begins having an affair with one of Frank's close friends played by James Brolin. Frank Sr. and Paula end up getting a divorce and Frank Jr. had to move a choice of which parent he wanted to live with but instead of choosing Frank Jr. ran away.After Frank Jr. ran out of money he begins to try and cash bad checks at all of the banks. Frank Jr. quickly moves up the criminal chain when he starts impersonating an airline pilot. He also starts making fake Pan Am payroll checks. This is when Carl begins to start chasing Frank Jr. It was a long chase for Carl but he never gave up. Frank went from being a pilot to a doctor, a doctor to a lawyer, and even managed to fall in love with a girl named Brenda played by Amy Adams. The chase eventually came to an end when Carl found Frank Jr. and he decided to give up. Frank Jr. was so good at check forgery that the FBI decided to eliminate his jail sentence as long as he would work for the FBI in their fraudulent check department.In my opinion the theme is no matter how long you run the things you do in your past will catch up with you and you will have to deal with the consequences. The obvious example is the main character Frank Jr. getting caught and sentenced for all the crimes he committed. Another example is Frank Sr. was committing fraud on his taxes. This caught up with him and caused him to lose all of his worldly things and his family. Finally Paula was having an affair and tried to keep it a secret but it caught up with her because the affair broke up her home which in turn caused Frank Jr. to run away. I feel like this theme could be applied to many other movies. For example The Cider House Rules, Roses father was having sex with her and he also attempted to keep it a secret. He even denied having sex with her when questioned about it. This eventually caught up to him to because he got Rose pregnant.The movie is mainly shot from an objective point of view and the lighting is mainly high-key lighting, except when Frank Jr. was in prison (the lighting was darker). The lighting really ties in with the theme of the movie. When Frank Jr. was free and living life the lighting was bright but when he finally got caught the lighting was darker.I must say I truly enjoyed this movie. Not only does the theme teach a lesson but the acting was great and the movie kept my attention the whole time. I give it two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Story of Real-Life Con-Artist and Impersonator Frank Abagnale Jr. Lived by "If You Can't Beat 'Em Join 'Em": DeCaprio's Finest Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most criminals, we all tend to like con artists or "confidence men". Con artists have to be likable, and they have to be so convincing that "being taken" never enters your mind. The perfect con is one where the mark never realizes he or she has been had. Frank Abagnale Jr. was one smart and likable kid who realized early on that a lot of decisions are often based on artificial perceptions which may have nothing to do with reality. If you lay in front of people certain visual clues which play into people's preconceived notions, including their prejudices (which can be sometimes positive), you can steer people into a particular understanding which may have nothing to do with reality. Abagnale decided to test this idea by dressing as an airline pilot. And it worked; he found that simply wearing the uniform convinced people he was an airline pilot, and therefore trustworthy.After his parents divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home and has to figure out how he can make a living. He learns how to forge cheques, but he can't get anyone to take his cheque since they don't "know him". He has no luck until he sees some airline pilots with their entourage of beautiful stewardesses, all in Pan Am regalia. In their uniforms, airline pilots appear to be the equivalent of nobility, with people staring in wonder as they pass by. In the 1960's, people had an idealized perception of airline pilots as honest and even heroic, a kind of positive prejudice. If Abagnale could project the illusion of being an airline pilot, he might be given carte blanche to cash his forged cheques. Why not join the party? It's even better than donning a Superman outfit.Through some ingenious maneuvering, Abagnale acquires a uniform and an ID card to pass himself off as a co-pilot for Pan Am. What he finds is much more than he bargained for. By simply wearing his uniform and carrying a forged ID card, Abagnale opens bank accounts, flies on airlines for free, even gets free room and board at the expense of the airline. And he's cashing millions of dollars worth of Pan Am cheques. Everything seems to be going his way until the feds pick up the scent of a prolific cheque counterfeiter and con-artist. Pan Am knows about the fraud and they aren't going to look away. Pan Am and the Feds know he is posing as someone in the airline industry, but they don't know who he is. They misidentify him as a young man in his early 30's. Abagnale is not even 18. The Feds realize their mistake, and Abagnale, to lose their scent, becomes someone else, first a medical doctor, then an attorney. And the cat-and-mouse game is on.Certainly, in retrospect, everything does seem a little too easy, but when watching it, I bought into it, hook, line and sinker, just like I was being taken by a good con artist. A couple of scenes point out he's getting in over his head, particularly a judicial hearing in which DiCaprio, based on some footage he sees on the TV show "Perry Mason", starts presenting evidence like a prosecutor at trial. But Abagnale, having not been to law school, doesn't know the difference between a hearing and a trial. This seemed pretty realistic. A similar scene also occurs when he's practicing medicine.This is just a great joy ride of a film, an incredibly compelling story, and possibly my favorite performance by DiCaprio. The combination of DiCaprio's performance, Spielberg's direction, and the fantastic script keep everything moving, making you believe you've been through this roller coaster along with Abagnale. In modern life, we often want to fantasize being something else, the grass is always greener in the other yard, etc. Frank Abagnale took that idea to the extreme and led a life where he realized his true fantasies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining chase movie with all-star cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest "cops and robbers" chase movies ever, directed by Spielberg, and featuring an all-star cast.I'm not a big fan of movies where the main character is a criminal, but this is the exception. DiCaprio is great as always and his character is so clever and likable, that you just want to see how he cons "the system" next. The cop chasing him is Tom Hanks. He has a goofy accent, but he is still also likable, even though he gets really obsessed with catching DiCaprio. Christopher Walken is also there for a few scenes as Leo's dad, and he is great as always.What makes this movie even more amazing, is that it's based on a true story.It may seem a bit shallow, since it is basically just one man conning the system in creative ways, but it is very entertaining.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romp with an Impostor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's account of the truly fascinating story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an impostor and con artist who waltzed from one side of the country to the other in the 1960s, ripping off just about everyone along the way.The film's period look is a lot of fun, and though the film gets a little sluggish at times -- not a complaint I can usually level at a Spielberg film -- it remains pretty entertaining. My biggest complaint might seem like a nit-picky one, but regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski handles the film's cinematography all wrong. Kaminski takes the same approach to lighting his films no matter what the subject: washed out color, backlit interiors. This works for gritty stuff like "Saving Private Ryan" or "Schindler's List," but doesn't for something like this film. But whatever....Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail and Christopher Walken gives a heartbreaking, Academy-Award nominated performance as Abagnale's washed up dad.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch this one if you can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" tells the true story of Frank William Abagnale, Jr. After running away from home at age 16 he became an expert impostor pursued by the FBI for millions of dollars worth of check fraud.The story is a highly entertaining one. Sure, liberties were taken with the facts but the true story is extraordinary enough that the fabrications don't seem out of place at all. While the story is mainly light-hearted it also shows some depth in dealing with the characters.The cast is a fine one with Tom Hanks &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio excellent together as pursuer &amp; pursued. Just having one of them would have been great but having both of them together is a rare treat. The supporting cast is also top-notch with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen &amp; Amy Adams all giving memorable performances.The direction by Spielberg is flawless as usual and the cinematography is a key contributor to the film's vibrancy. The period look is very appealing with close attention to detail and a retro opening credits sequence to boot. Also adding to the film's flavour are the jazzy score by John Williams and a number of well-chosen pop songs from the period.The fact that Spielberg has directed so many excellent films unfortunately means that some of them get unjustly overlooked. In my opinion, "Catch Me If You Can" is one such film. That's a shame because it's a fine, fun romp with impeccable production values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sincere Con Man Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed this movie. The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. The bond between them is not immediately apparent and it is highly unorthodox, but, by the end, you completely believe the friendship that has arisen before our eyes. The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected. The film definitely delivers, and, other than "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in. I found his work to be the weak link in "Gangs of New York." Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again. Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background. This one is certainly unique as it has a retro, yet not dated, feel to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite just pop-in movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies I just put in when I want to be entertained but not have to think too much. I love this movie for that purpose! Not to say that it doesn't cause some cerebral response, but it's just fun to watch! Frank just keeps slipping through all the nooses, and Tom Hanks' portrayal of Carl Hanratty is probably one of the most overlooked performances of his career while being one of his best (and he has some pretty good ones out there).One of my favorite things about this movie is the opening credits. It's unbelievable that anyone would like the opening credits, but it brings back memories of my early adolescence when I learned to love movies watching the late night showings of Martin and Lewis on Fridays and Saturdays on my local network affiliates. The 60's styling during the opening credits just creates a wave of nostalgia that causes me to really enjoy. And I love the score. It's perfect for this type of intrigue.The only negative thing that I saw in the movie is the stretch of age that DiCaprio has to pull off. I think he does so on an emotional level, but, physically, it's hard to believe him as a 14 year old at the beginning of the film.If you haven't seen this one, it's worth the purchase price of the special edition DVD. Grab it before it gets away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, fascinating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true story of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played here by Leonardo DiCaprio) and the detective (Tom Hanks) in pursuit of him, "Catch Me If You Can" proved to be a fun-filled, fascinating movie. Rather than telling this story as accurately as possible, Spielberg manages to spice it up with tons of little bits of humor and fascinating facts rather than just tell it as a straight story. There is enough humor here for this to be a comedy, from Abagnale pretending to be a substitute teacher to get back at some students who made fun of him to him pretending to be a former graduate from Harvard to impress his girlfriend (Amy Adams) and her father (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, there is a moving story here, dealing with the struggles in this man's life and his family. It is truly a fascinating story on its own, especially the areas regarding Abadnale's high level of intelligence, and it is a story told very well here. The film could afford to be shortened a bit, as it tends to be a little long overall, particularly with the long scenes with Abagnale and his father (Christopher Walken) and other scenes having to do with his family. The recurring Christmas theme is also somewhat unnecessary and not necessarily beneficial. Nevertheless, this is an impressive movie, one of Spielberg's best, in my opinion. Not entirely perfect, but not too far off. Worthwhile for just about anyone, especially if you like excitement as well as great character studies.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

He gets up to all sorts posing in a variety of different professions to get by and escape the authorities who are after him as he keeps forging cheques (checks). The antics he gets up to are astonishing as i think many people wouldn't have the nerve to do them - This has taught me a lot about cheque fraud and counterfeiting.

		<fullReview>Frank Abernagle Jr. becomes one of the most successful con artists of the last century. He likes to fool people into believing. If he had studied acting, he would have probably gone very far. Frank is played by Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio and Frank Sr., is play by Oscar winner Christopher Walken. The cast is first rate which includes French actress, Nathalie Baye, as his French mother, Ellen Pompeo before Grey's Anatomy, Kitty Carlisle as herself, and the Oscar winner Tom Hanks. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg. The film is quite detailed about Frank's life conning everybody from his parents to everybody else. The film earned several Academy Award nominations. It's a smart film but it's too long. It does bring back the Pan Am airline legacy even for a little while. Before 1991, Pan Am Airlines was the king of the airlines before it closed down due to poor mishandled financial matters and weak security which helped cause the 1988 disaster. The story ends before Pan Am's image is tarnished.</fullReview>

This is a slick movie about a real life conman, who pretends to be many things and endangers peoples lives doing it! Tom Hanks is the cop hunting him down. It's funny how their relationship is portrayed as well. It's quirky and i think Steven used it well. Chris Walken is Leon's dad and as usual puts out a good supporting role.

		<shortDescription>Spielberg having fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg seems to have had some fun doing this movie, and he is trying to make the viewers feel the fun too. I am no big fan of the true crime stories, but this is the second I saw recently (the other was the more recent 'Zodiac') that I really liked.The charm of the movie lies mostly in the recreation of the 60s with techniques of the 60s movies and some quotes from the James Bond movies for example, all combined with the fine story telling skills of Spielberg. Added here is the excellent performance of Leonardo DiCaprio which I have quite mixed feelings about generally but who fits here perfectly playing at 28 the role of a teenager who incarnates 28 years old characters. Together with Leo we can see Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, whose relationships with him as the detective following him to obsession and as his father are key in the logic of the character and of the film.Spielberg is now famous and proved everything he had to prove. In the last ten years he tried different genres, and seems to do a good job in most of them. The one thing that we may lose is who is the real Spielberg, what is this strong voice trying to say. For this we need to go back to the 70s and the 80s, or maybe see again 'Schindler's List'. Between those we may also have some fun seeing a fun movie like this one.</fullReview>

Oh well I'm not in charge of the Academy Awards (and I don't think many people would want me to be). I thought that the movie was very well done. The story line was great and the acting surpurp. Tom Hanks being my favorite of all time is a huge reason (if not the only reason) I went to see the movie. But after seeing it I fell in love with the whole thing. I will say though after re-watching it the other day, that most flight attendants are that excited about going to work or their jobs (trust me, I am a flight attendant, though I like my job, you would never see me that happy about going to work). Other than that, which I have to say makes me laugh, so I guess I should even with that I thought it was a well done and great movie to see.

It explores every facet of Abagnale's life while remaining wickedly entertaining and perfectly stylish (the costume design and set decoration are incredible). DiCaprio gives another knockout performance Hanks delivers what might be my favorite performance of his. Walken and Amy Adams are also quite excellent (as is Jennifer Garner in her cameo). A really fun, enjoyable ride with a lot more under the surface than it seems to have. It's easily my favorite Spielberg and definitely one of the best of 2002.

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape Artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it was easy for me to believe that Steven Spielberg could direct such pictures such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan or Minority Report where each of those films tackle subjects or showed realism of certain events, Catch Me If You Can surprised me as one of those films where for once he could show the other side of him without losing his touch.In "Catch Me If You Can," Leonardo DiCaprio is the central character for which he plays William Abagnale Jr., a young man who looks up to his father William Sr. (Christopher Walken) in which all the son observes is how to lie and B.S. people to getting what he wants. In one particular scene, William is at a public school dressed in his old private uniform outfit and fools a classroom in believing that he is a teacher and not just some puny student. The rise and fall from grace starts after William sees his father and mother getting a divorce which leads him to be like normal teenagers in running away from their parents and trying to use his father's wisdom in succeeding by fooling people, especially pretending to be a pilot for Pan Am Airports.After stealing nearly a million dollars in cash from pretending to be the pilot, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is on the hunt to look for William in which on one occasion, he meets the young man face to face at a hotel in Florida and thinks he has him until he is coaxed by William pretending to be a secret agent.By using alias names from comic books, William is having different professions from a smoothing playboy, a doctor and a lawyer to get by making ends meet and at the same time falling in love with a girl by the name of Brenda (Amy Adams) who got kicked out by her parents after she got an abortion. Only time will come when young William will be caught and the truth will be revealed.Catch Me If You Can surprised me as a film about con artists and also a film about identity for which a person can surprise others in the way they present themselves and pretend to be something they are not. In a film with an all star cast from Leonardo DiCaprio proved that he is growing up and leaving all the teeny bop roles behind; Tom Hanks is a mixture of comic relief and drama for which he just wants to make sure that William Jr. is safely caught before getting killed just as Christopher Walken proves that despite playing eccentric characters or people on the brink of insanity, he can play anything smooth.</fullReview>

This has got to be one of Speliberg's best movies but what also makes this film special is that it has his style but all in all without any big CGI or SFX , its just pure magical entertainment which strings you along. The story follows the life of a young man known as Frank Abignal Jr who would go into history as the most audios and yet daring and youngest con men in history conning banks out millions as well posing as several other professionals. Leo DiCaprio shows once again that he is not just a pretty face and he can square of with the likes of Johnny Depp. One thing that is great about his performance is the level of innocence portrayed by him and it is very hard if not impossible to be mad at him . The film moves at a slow pace which I really didn't mind because it introduced you into his world which also mad one build bonds with the other characters which made the movie an emotional one to watch and sometimes painful for me personally through watching my parents having to struggle with their finical situation and how teen against can some times go right out of control. Tom Hanks was good as the federal agent , not his best performances but still very good but Christopher Walken was nothing short of brilliant which begs the question why has not been given an Oscar yet ? My only complaints were that it was a little too long but I was willing to let that go because DiCaprio kept my hooked and a few Hollywood moments added in which I guess kind of distract a slight bit from its inspired by true events angel. To conclude Catch me If You Can is one of Speilbergs best works as well as proving that DiCaprio is not just a pretty face but one of the talent and very respectable actors coming up , highly recommended there is something for everyone in here.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: 8.6 OUT 10THE TRUE STORY OF A REAL FAKE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can (2002)Top 5 - 2002Spielberg's versatility is yet again proved with 'Catch Me If You Can' as supremely entertaining film with a mix of solid humour and drama.Leonardo Di Caprio is on the run from the cops, for fraud; Tom Hanks is the man determined to catch the charismatic criminal as he cruises around America, under different names, occupations and personal information.Christopher Walken plays Di Caprio's father, in what is one of his best performances in recent years.Spielberg's film combines an enjoyable ride, with wonderful performances and again a vibrant soundtrack from John Williams add to the whole rhythm of this superb film.This is not a masterpiece, but it has qualities and it entertains constantly. This is one of the best films of 2002 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My all time favourite movie. Absolutely brilliant! Definitely Spielberg's best. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my ten favourite actors. Everything I've seen him in, both he and the movie it self have been absolutely brilliant.Leonardo is Frank Abagnale Jr. Someone who became a doctor, lawyer, an airline pilot and managed to con millions of dollars from the government.Tom Hanks plays the F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty who is devoting all his spare time to track down capture Leonardo as soon as he can.Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale, the father of Frank Abagnale Jr. His son learned most of his skills from his father. His father loves his son, and won't say anything to even hint to his son's location and Nathalie Baye is Paula Abagnale, Franks Jr's mother. She's started a new life and doesn't much care for her former husband, and just wants her son to be safe and not on the run from the government.This movie is perfect. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring:Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale, Jr. Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty Christopher Walken as Frank William Abagnale, Sr. Martin Sheen as Roger StrongPlot: A true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor.Where to begin? I had heard nothing of this movie before I saw the trailer in theaters, and then just had to see it. How does, I wondered, a man become a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer all before his 19th birthday? And when it revealed it was based on true events I became even more interested. What was this story and why hadn't I heard about it? I checked it out and I was blown away.The best thing I think about this movie is the cast assembled. When you have a cast this good you are bound to deliver in terms of quality. DiCaprio, Hanks, Sheen and Walken all come through in their roles and DiCaprio especially blew me away. Before this I had known him as that guy in that chick flick that's set on a boat(which wasn't very good). When it came to playing a smart kid who knew how to con everyone, Leo brought the chops and put on a very engaging performance. Christopher Walken may whore himself out to a lot of movies just for a paycheck, but he does have what it takes and earned his Best Supporting nomination. Martin Sheen does well for the small amount of time we see him. Tom Hanks puts forth his best Boston accent but I don't think he brought it as he normally does.The story itself was a little different from the book(which I read later) but it was still pretty damn good. It hooks the audience right from the beginning with it's premise, and the fact that everything that transpires is (mostly) true keeps them hooked. Between the story and performances, and Spielberg working his usual magic, it all comes together for a strong movie. And again, Williams score always comes through. The title theme gets stuck in my head and I find myself humming it whenever I watch this.What did I not like? Well there were some, awkward moments. I myself felt like the entire Hanratty/Abagnale relationship didn't ring true and didn't really work at times. Whether it was because I didn't see any chemistry between Hanks and DiCaprio or the fact Hanratty is a mostly made-up character, it just didn't work for me. I also felt like Walken's character was just dumped after a strong show. I suppose that's how it actually happened but they wrote him out with one line and not much mourning on the part of Abagnale (who for some reason decides to escape as soon as he hears the news).But even though it's a flawed movie, it's still one of my favorites. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do so. I don't really hear this movie mentioned in the same breath as Spielberg's other films and that's a shame because while this isn't one of his big budget blockbusters, it's a nice change of pace from all that. It shows that hey, he really can do something different(Schiendler's List aside). Go watch it.Rating: **** of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio is the nemesis of an FBI agent, and vice versa, in "Catch Me If You Can," a 2002 film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on a true story, DiCaprio is the young Frank Abagnale, a great impostor who teaches school, becomes a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer as he floats bad checks all over the country and seems to be impossible to capture.The film is beautifully paced by Spielberg and absolutely fascinating as you wait and see what Abagnale is going to do next. When his father gets in trouble with the IRS, the family lifestyle changes, and Frank has to go to a public high school. He insists on wearing his private school jacket on his first day. He promptly takes over a French class as the substitute teacher and dismisses the real one, saying there must be a mistake. When he's discovered, his parents are called in. "Frank has been teaching French for the past week," the principal tells them. "Today he scheduled a field trip to a French bread-making factory. You see my problem." His father (Christopher Walken) admires his son's chicanery but refuses to take advantage of it, even as his financial state worsens.Tom Hanks is Hanratty, the FBI agent who chases Abagnale all over the world. He is fabulous as a lonely, hard-working, insightful man who gets a call in his office from Frank every Christmas. "I know why you called me," he says to Frank. "You don't have anyone else to call." The two develop a strange bond. The baby-faced DiCaprio does a magnificent job as Frank. He's totally magnetic, charming, and also sad, exhibiting Frank's pain over his parents' divorce and his father's downfall. His goal is to get "everything back again" but then it becomes a game he can't quit. As his father, Walken is excellent as a proud man faced with the loss of his property, income, and family.A well-cast, expertly directed film all the more intriguing since it's based on a true story. The opening scene is Frank Abagnale's appearance on "To Tell the Truth." We don't get to see if he fooled the audience, but he probably did - telling the truth is something Frank, while on the run, never did particularly well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining indeed. Easily digestible: a feel good movie seasoned with a dash of suspense, small-scale drama and the obligatory happy ending. Nothing wrong with the previous assessment apart from the fact that "Catch me..." did not entirely succeed in keeping my undivided attention and that I was not really impressed due to an absence of tangible substance in the portrayal of the various characters.All the protagonists seemed to lack a form of real content and appeared to me as being very shallow human beings. Even the chemistry between Di Caprio and his father which was obviously intended by the director, was hardly convincing. In the first half of the movie Tom Hanks was portrayed too often as a bungling FBI agent which bordered on ludicrousness but luckily he was more convincing in the second half. Some scenes, such as the references to James Bond and Di Caprio's amorous encounter in a hotel room, were really superfluous not to mention the viewer's disbelief at the ingenious escapology of the Houdini-like forgerer. As stated in another review: a popcorn movie more or less, with regrettably, in my view, slightly less than more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a title like "Catch Me If You Can" I was expecting a story with pace and excitement. What I witnessed was a half-hearted and stunted film that seemed to be more concerned with style over content. Surprisingly the film is boring. Considering the strong premise and the talent of the Director I was expecting a light-hearted, fast paced, comedic romp. I was disappointed almost on every level.The opening title sequence was an absolute bore and seemed to go on for an age. The Music by John Williams was insipid and uninspired.The Direction was laborious and stilted, almost devoid of emotion. What was he up to?I got the feeling Spielberg rushed too much during the shooting schedule and then refused to cut mercilessly in the edit. Twenty minutes could have easily been slashed to the cutting room floor, especially scenes involving the Tom Hanks character. Could Tom Hanks' ego allowed him to have taken a supporting role in this Picture? I think not. In fact I am sure his part was padded out ? to the detriment of the whole.Spielberg is a great Director, but has he got a Classic Motion Picture left in him or is he just painting by numbers as this Film seems to suggest?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre film, with a couple of interesting twists starring Leonardo DiCaprio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film sitting gathering dust on the shelf of my local store and decided it might be worth giving it a try. It defiantly did not disappoint me as I was sucked into the world of Frank Abanale Jr and experienced his unfortunate and stressful life.Based on a true story, this film is about a young boy aged 17 who in his lifetime had managed to con his way into millions of dollars. Flipping easily between different jobs from airline pilots to Doctors, to lawyers. Along his way he even managed to run into a bit a romance.However, I believe that Leonardo did not play his character in a pensive way, as I think he should have. Although he is revelling in his wealth, he should perhaps be a little bit more upset due to the circumstances.It is an interesting plot line with lots of snaking twists and turns, it is unequivocal to see that a lot of thought has gone into planning this film out, but I must admit that I have seen better films.During some of the unnecessary scenes in the film I was so bored I realised I had taken better interest in the way the curtain was blowing in the wind, in contrast to the more interesting scenes where I would be literally on the edge my seat in frenetic anticipation.Overall, the film is generally interesting, and is a definite must see. If you don't like the film I'm sure heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio will catch your attention. (And I'm not jut talking to you ladies!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, in my opinion, is an excellent biopic about a very sly con artist. If you ask me, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a very sly criminal and con artist. I just can't believe he did it for a stupid reason, though. If you want to know the reason, you'll have to see the movie. However, I could relate to how he was feeling, albeit I didn't do what he did. I would never commit any kind of a crime. Even if I had been set up for a crime, I know someone would get me off the hook. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks make a great team. You're in for a really good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This works for much the same reason Shakespeare works with women characters dressing as boys in the play where the original actor is a boy playing a woman. Di Caprio plays a con man who is a consummate actor. Since his skill at conning is identical to di Caprio's acting skill in the movie, his schemes blend seamlessly. His ability to fool people seems completely natural.The plot whips along at a galloping pace.Actors like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro seem wasted in this movie. Hanks plays a very bland uninteresting cop. The role could have been played by any balding TV cop.This is based on a true character.

The title sequence to "Catch Me If You Can" is as repetitive and as annoying as any I've ever encountered. It got the film off on the wrong foot as far as my wife and I were concerned. Nevertheless, it is an amusing film with Leonard DiCaprio as the teen-age youth who successfully passes himself off as a co-pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc., while passing phony checks that lead the FBI on a global chase. Hanks is the perfect nerdish FBI agent who eventually catches up with DiCaprio in a tiny French village where his father and mother met during World War II.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a marvelous job in the beginning but as the movie progresses his acting falters. the movie is though enjoyable and captivating in the beginning, it loses its charm eventually and ends up as a bore.

My second question is wouldn't Frank havegotten soaked from the toilet water. Yes his shirt definitely looked dirty, but it really did not look wet. Plus his hair looked dry too Another question is wouldn't the bathroom floor be soaked as well. Finally why would Frank leave the screws as evidence.

I adore his photography and brilliant directing in all his movies. In Catch me if you Can he gets a brilliant ensemble cast to for fill this movie eg: TOM HANKS (AGAIN), LEONARDO DICAPRIO and many more... I believe anything script he reads, he reads 100 times before signing on for the project, he checks it for errors and mistakes and also writes his own little comments on the scripts. That is why every film he does is 100% perfect.. As you will notice he uses Tom Hanks in most of his movies, and that my friends is a very good move, because Tom is one of the best actors around and brings passion to all of his films. The basic plot in this movie is about a traumatized teenager (LEONARDO) going through his parents break up. So he goes on the run as a 'CON' and lives the high life for a while, until Tom Hanks Comes Along.. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN IS A SOPHISTICATED TRUE STORY BY THE FILM GENIUS "STEVEN SPIELBERG".....10/10 PAUL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catch Me If You Can" is such a whimsical, hearty tale of how sometimes crime, while ultimately consequential, can be fun to watch, especially in this clever execution from legendary Steven Spielberg, who usually tackles heavier and more critical subjects. This is not to say that this endeavor is not compelling, emotional, or unworthy of serious consideration, as this is a film of crafty suavity and cunning character exploration, succeeding marvelously as both an amicable tale of youth and innocuous adventure, as well as detailing the consequences of his illicit actions. Aside from that, this is simply a fun ride where we find ourselves rooting for Frank Abagnale in his impervious pursuit of riches through one brilliant financial (and personal) scheme after another. What's amazing about Abagnale's exploits is that aside from his reckless charades working masterfully in the film, is that Abagnale actually managed to stump the government some thirty-five years ago, as this is a true story! The scenery and music is grandiose, enchanting, exhilarating, and definitely defines the various tones of the film. The performances are compelling and whimsical- I especially enjoyed Christopher Walken's patronizing, hearty role, and DiCaprio is very convincing as the almost innocent, yet brilliant and charming Abagnale. However, one major complaint: the various romances throughout the film seem to deviate from the "fun, simple, zippy" premise we come to appreciate, and sometimes these scenes take themselves way too seriously and are sometimes quite redundant to the theme and enjoyment of the film. Overall, this is a fun, whimsical, and hearty tale laden with simplicity, yet some emotional complexity, and a jocular look and feel that appeals to audiences of all kinds. "Catch Me If You Can" is a definite recommendation, and for the most part, a definite good time.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

I think that Steven Spielberg succeeded finally creating an entertaining cat and mouse romantic thriller after his flops AI and MR. The best thing is that all is based on a true story. The setting of the sixties accompanied by some songs of Frank Sinatra gave me the impression to be in that time. I can recommend it to everyone that likes heist films. It is by far better than "Heist", "The Score" or "Oceans 11". My vote is anyway lightly above average because there is not enough suspense atmosphere. 6.5/10.</fullReview>

The story also proved to be unique enough to grab someone's attention. Steven Spielberg also made a welcome change of pace, getting away from the sci-fi genre for a nice little foray into a light drama.

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film it scared me. This movie although funny and engrossing tends to remind me of just how much we assume things in our daily lives.I found myself going to the doctor a few days later and thinking to myself "what if one of those nurses came out without that white coat on. I mean is the fact they have the coat on that makes you think they're a nurse or the fact they came from behind that door. What I loved about this film and in fact the whole thing was this kid actually did all these things for so long just because people took for granted he was who he says he was.I have talked to some people who work at hospitals who tell me they wear the white coat not because they are required to but because people give them less problems when they do. I talked to several nurses who told me when they don't have their whites on patients have actually screamed and harassed them out of their rooms cause they though they weren't real nurses and were there to kill them. Cops too, I spoke to several cops who said that when they are off duty people don't stop for them even when they flash their badges. One told me he has actually had several people get off cause they told the jury the badge looked fake, and he didn't look like a real cop. Also several people who have worked at banks tell me they have seen the real guy before as he did several educational films for various banks about how to spot bad checks. Apparently he really was that original when he was young, and after he was caught banks changed security procedures for good. Not many criminal can say their actions changed a industry, much less now work for the industry as experts. These days people a allot more jaded then when these events took place and people have a more inquisitive nature. But as 9/11 showed us things are still not perfect if really better at all. My favorite scene in this film is when he becomes the head of the department at the hospital. The two doctors look scared and all he does it what he saw on TV. I think he was watching General Hospital or something, but I am not sure. I like the acting in this film especially Walken, Hanks character was really drool but from what I heard in interviews, that was the way the guy really is. Leo does well in this as usual. The film is well paced and believable. People can argue about all the things in this movie that are wrong. To me though this movie is about a kid who wants to help his father so he can get back with his mother and they can be a family again. Once he realizes he has gone to far, he keeps going and does what he can to go on with his life. He had one h*ll of a ride though and he knew it. It is a good story that is well told and well acted. When I go to see a film that's what I'm looking for. </fullReview>

The plot had Abagnale doing some really dumb things, he would have never been caught otherwise. I suppose these things were supposed to be poignant, but were just really dumb. One example: setting up his print shop in the French town his mother was from. He had five million dollars. He could have gone anywhere. And why did Christopher Walken get an Oscar nomination for this? He is a fine actor, but I didn't think that this role was really worthy. Overall. this is mildly entertaining, but all involved can do better. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the advertising for this title, I thought I was in for a joyous romp as Tom Hanks chased Leo all over the board. Instead, this was a fairly serious movie. It was way more dramatic than advertised, but still a nice movie. Not a laugh-fess by any stretch, but a pretty nice movie.P.S. - Walken rules... yet again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but not a memorable classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Catch Me if You Can' is inspired by the real life story of conman Frank Abagnale Junior who ran away from home at the age of sixteen following his parents' divorce. His deceit includes pretending to be an airline pilot, doctor and barrister ?all while he is still a teenager. As he travels around the globe cashing fraudulent cheques, Frank is pursued by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) ?hence, the taunt in the film's title.What makes this film an interesting and fun one is that the main character actually exists in real life and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is a charismatic one. Although I found some parts of ?Catch Me if you Can' enjoyable, I did find it a bit slow and the story-telling flawed. Although one can conclude that Frank was a genius to have deceived as many people as he did, the film is lacking in explanation of how Frank managed to succeed in the range of positions he came to work in, eg how did he become a doctor and barrister without going to either medical or law school?As a fan of Steven Spielberg's work, I was looking forward to this release and compared to his last two films ?A.I' and ?Minority Report', this film is much lighter in tone. Although entertaining while it lasts, ?Catch Me if You Can' is not the memorable classic that I was hoping for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite an entertaining and interesting movie and also not the typical movie you would expect from Steven Spielberg. It is also much better than Spielberg´s couple of last movies. It has very nice and relaxing pace and gives you kind of a chill out feeling as you watch it. Sixties are portrayed very stylishly and the soundtrack is really good. Christopher Walken is great as usual. He defenitly gives the most memorable performance of this movie. Hanks is okay, nothing special. Di Caprio? Well, I think there are other actors who could have been better but he gets the job done. At least he is not annoying. Not a movie you would remember too much about after 6 months but it has some great jokes and an interesting story. Hollywood entertainment - nothing more, nothing less. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing execution and little concern for characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the good news. Christopher Walken fans will appreciate the one gem of his movie -- his supporting performance. After that, there isn't much to hold this movie together.Leonardo DiCaprio is mis-cast as someone who thrived on their anonymity -- while he happens to be one of the most over-exposed actors in Hollywood. Tom Hanks, along with his role in Road to Perdition, adds little dynamic to a key character -- seemingly taking a parallel to Dan Aykroyd's film career: a once-notable star playing forgettable roles, getting chubby from too much food and sitting on the laurels of former glory.There are a few moments of interesting character situations, but none of the characters made me care about them (besides Walken). Characters are discarded so frequently in the chase for DiCaprio that the movie seems as shiftless as his character's life. While this conveys the nature of his on-the-run existence, it leads to a film with more of a laundry list of brief encounters rather than any richer storytelling.There's an attempt to create a surrogate father-son relationship between DiCaprio and Hanks, but it is handled superficially and merely suggested. There's probably more they could have done to bring out an interesting dynamic between these two key characters. More also could have been done to bring out the dynamic of the real father's influence on the son.The movie employs the classic switch between past and future scenes, but there's no mystery in them other than the mundane details of how they will inevitably connect -- as the audience presumes from the start. A few clever escapes here and there, but they are hardly captivating, let alone memorable.To its credit, making a story about a fugitive guilty of fraudulent checks is hardly Hollywood sexy these days. But the entire experience left me expecting more from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A kid with special talent for cheating and swindling takes it as a way of life after the shock he feels with his parents' divorce. After that there is a succession of forgeries and impersonations some of them a bit unbelievable that take place in a not too exciting development. The kid is not a bad guy after all and has a lot of chances to show his good sentiments. He almost always behaves nicely. The affection developed between chaser and chased (maybe the most important feature of the movie) is not deeply explored. Well the story is a bit lukewarm and makes you sometimes think how is it possible that the kid has not been caught on several occasions. We only believe it due to to the great individual freedom and personal mobility that exist (and existed already in the sixties when the story takes place) in USA with the possibility of people changing their names all the time if they want to, etc.. I think in most European countries that kid would be caught very soon with our much more tight personal controls, mandatory identity cards, etc.. Concerning the acting, Di Caprio is equal to himself as we know him and in my opinion Tom Hanks' real talent is waisted in this movie. By the way a curious note: FBI agents are not shown here as the usual supermen and heroes but many of them as somewhat poor guys and not very bright. Well just a tolerable movie no more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hi, My names Pip Hodgkinson and before I go any further I'd justlike to say Speilberg is one of the most fantastic directors in thisday and age, but this film is the last straw.Why oh why can't he end a movie? With AI I was a little upset, buton a second viewing I was satisfied with the glossy ending. WithMinority Report I was in a world of my own until he went off on hisBrian De Palmer tour of filmmaking! And on a second viewing Iwas just as upset that he managed what could have been thefinest film last year look very ordinary with the last 20minutes. SoCatch Me If You Can was his chance of redemption, prove that hehas a little more variety in his abilities as a filmmaker thanconstantly not being to end a film (god knows what would havehappened if he'd directed the Ice Storm!) so image my distresswhen I'm loving the movie, pleased with the plot,pace andperformances then bang. Theres an ending, but no Steven doesn'twant to leave us with any distaste in our mouths so he takes us offon a 15minute buddy movie style ending, oh at first they wereagainst each other then now! the work with each other! Wow didntsee that one coming. If Minority Reports ending reminded me ofMission Impossible then Catch Me if you can was Dragnet. Thenhe manages to do the most lazy straight to tv trick in the history ofcinema. Oh yeah you got it, he uses the rolling text to make surewe understand that it IS an happy ending.So while I celebrated both Minority Report and AI as good films thatcould have been great. Catch Me If You Can is not its a disgrace, ithad all the makings of being ten times better than both the beforementioned films and one of the best films of the year but hemanages to make the film ordinary with its ending. So why shouldwe praise this movie?Speilberg is the greatist movie maker for the openings to his films,take Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones (all three) and nowCatch Me If You Can and you can see a genius at work. But I find itvery hard to find an exceptional Speilberg ending since Jaws?Surely thats as or more important than the start?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Rough-Cut of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the german premiere in berlin. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio appeared and the little girls outside went nuts. All Spielberg had to say about the movie before the screening was "Nobody dies in this movie." Hmmm. Anyway, the movie was quite boring. If you have seen the trailer (which was good), you have seen enough. It is always very suspicious when the most interesting part of a story is, that it is based on a true story. The movie gives everything away in the first five minutes and has nothing to add in the following two hours. Camerawork, production value, design, acting - all very high standard, but the movie lacks a heart. Maybe that's because Spielberg was originally producer of this flick and had to jump in to direct it at the last second. It had some nice parts, I smiled sometimes and the characters are sympathetic. But it has big dragging holes in between and it's repetetive. All in all it looks like a rough cut and maybe it would have been better, if they took out another twenty five minutes. Well... maybe not. I gave it a six (out of ten).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the book, and find the movie delightfully entertaining. I love the fact this was based on a true story, and that Frank Abagnale Jr. was able to successfully beat our corrupt system at its' own game.However, the movie omitted a lot of events the book detailed. Such as Abagnale being asked to fly the airliner briefly, while the pilot went to the lavatory. Good thing Frank knew better to switch on the autopilot, while he was away. And being asked to deliver a newborn baby, while posing as a doctor. He was very fortunate an experienced nurse was nearby, that day. Despite Spielberg's aversion to sexual matters- the book clearly places Abagnale's exploits with women nearing 50 encounters. I admire anybody who can live this way, and not catch anything.Frank W. Abagnale, as a real-life pretender of sorts- illustrates what every young man's secret fantasy world craves; the ready ability to change and adapt to your surroundings. I applaud Abagnale's clever ability to "socially engineer" himself so convincingly, at such a young age. Frank's message to me was clear; dress like how you wanted to be treated. I envy the fact he got away with this kind of crime in a day where it was easily perpetrated, and hard to detect. Those days are long gone. What is still true to this day, is that if you look and skillfully act the part- you can still BS anybody, into doing virtually anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker.He made false moves on his career and great movies.He made a lot of sci-fi films,historical dramas and he made some comedies.But his comedies(The Sugarland express,Hook,Always and 1941)were failures of critic and of popular opinion.They are the less known movies of his career and a lot of people forgot them.Maybe,they were too shallow or,simply,they were not funny.Catch me if you can is a comedy but it's way better than his other comedies and it had good popular opinion and critics and a lot of people know it and remember it.I have to say Catch me if you can is the best comedy of Spielberg's career.The best thing about this movie is that it is dynamic,interesting and very fun and funny.The script is very well written and the 141 minutes this movie has pass flying.Another great thing about this movie is that the film does not have a hero and a villain and I did not want to see one of the main characters as the loser.The ending is great.Leonardo Di Caprio is,no doubt,a great actor and here,he has a great performance.Tom Hanks makes an awesome performance,too.These two actors were ignored by the pathetic awards because they did not have serious roles but they deserved a nomination.The supporting cast is great,too but the best supporting performances are from Christopher Walken and Amy Adams.Walken is really perfect on his role and he had very well deserved Academy Award nomination and Adams has a role of teenager in love but she makes the character complex and memorable.Catch me if you can is a great movie.Rating:8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch Me If You Can should be seen back to back with Tony Curtis's performance in The Great Imposter. They are both excellent films and both deal with a protagonist who's a brilliant and charming fellow and a quick study who masquerades in many disguises.In The Great Imposter the whole story is told from Tony Curtis's point of view. And it's more lighthearted in its treatment of Ferdinand Waldo Demara than this is of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Curtis's father Gary Merrill only has a few minutes in the beginning of The Great Imposter, but enough to establish the relationship there. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as son and father have a great deal more screen time together.And of course in Catch Me If You Can we also have the point of view of the man trying to catch young Abegnale, FBI agent Tom Hanks. Remember this was the Sixties and J. Edgar Hoover was running the agency. Hanks is great as the uptight, buttondown agent in the Hoover mold. One of the best scenes in the film is DiCaprio conning Hanks out of an arrest by pretending to be a Secret Service Man and humiliating him in the process. He also turns Hanks into a man with a mission. DiCaprio is a middle class kid from Westchester County whose father suffers some business reversals like Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. He refuses to accept a change in lifestyle and because he's bright, he develops into a master check forger. He masquerades as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor and steals millions of dollars and lives high on the hog. Another scene I like is DiCaprio entertaining a high class model at a five star hotel and then we cut to Hanks doing his laundry at some cheap laundromat.Steven Spielberg allowed Walken to develop his father character a whole lot more than Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. This man for whom the American Dream became a nightmare got a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The Great Imposter with its accent on entertaining never allowed Tony Curtis to develop Demara's character as DiCaprio did with Abegnale. Basically DiCaprio finds it easy to con people because people do want to believe the best in you. Ironically he develops a telephone relationship with his pursuer in the same way Curtis had with his parish priest, Karl Malden. The reason is simple, Hanks is the only guy who knows what makes him tick. And in the end Hanks is the guy who provides a useful outlet for DiCaprio's talents.I like the way Spielberg developed his characters in this film. We get good three dimensional portrayals from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. It's a great film about another amazing adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished, Light-Hearted Crime Thriller About A Con-Man Par Excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Abagnale Junior is a teenager in New York State in the sixties, having trouble coping with his parents' impending divorce. He runs away and becomes a professional con-artist, posing as an airline pilot, a paediatrician and a lawyer, and scamming millions of dollars' worth of phony cashier's cheques. Eventually however, reality comes crashing in on him, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.This is an amazing true story about a consummate escape-artist, who crammed a lifetime of criminal adventure into his teenage years, paid the price for it, and started a second life on the other side of the law. It's hard not to like Frank, who genuinely seems to care about people, and whose obsession with stealing and fooling the authorities is more of a behavioural aberration than a desire to get rich quick. DiCaprio is iconic in the lead, with excellent support from Walken as his beleaguered father and Hanks as the workaholic Fed on his case. The charm of the picture comes from the ingenious and increasingly sophisticated methods Frank employs to commit his forgeries and realise his fictitious personalities. There is also a wonderful attention to detail in recreating the mid-sixties atmosphere, particularly in the groovy title sequence and the playfully tense Bernard Herrmann-style score by John Williams. A slick, enjoyable chase film, based on a book by the real Abagnale, who acted as a technical consultant and has a cameo as a French cop. Shot in California, New York and Ontario.</fullReview>

Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio's cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the '60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn't Steven Spielberg's best movie by any stretch, but it's sure a neat one. There is one scene that's probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin.

		<fullReview>OK comedy/drama telling the story of young con man DiCaprio, chased by Hanks' FBI man.The opening credits and score set the tone for this retro looking film. Overall, it has an air of being old-school. It's not very dark or foul mouthed, and it's not a pure comedy either. It has a nostalgic touch to it, which I guess is supposed to draw in the crowds for an old fashioned crime caper of sorts. However, I thought the film felt kind of schizophrenic. The comedy bits are those that work best (Hanks' best work so far in my opinion), but judging from the subject matter, this should have been a considerably darker film in tone. It's like Spielberg didn't know how to put the story together as it displays numerous mood swings - sometimes serious, sometimes definitely not. Structrually, the film also feels a bit weak, it would have worked better with linear storytelling, rather than jumping back and forth in time. The acting is OK, but I could never really get to grips with DiCaprio's character (and in some scenes, neither did DiCaprio). The production design, cinematography, and score work fine together but the story never quite holds up. There is nothing remarkable about the film, and towards the end, Spielberg's sappier movie sentiments makes for some not so good movie time, unfortunately. [6/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young man with a sharp brain and the face of someone much older takes the fast track to riches by way of wholesale cheque fraud.I know of only one or two scripts that have been going the rounds longer before being actually made. Caligula - the troubled Roman epic - is probably the one you have heard of. You can see why the original book (which shares the movie title) was hot-to-trot. The studio execs must have viewed it as a sure-fire winner that no one could really go wrong with. The only problem being the lack of talent waiting to take on this fish-in-a-barrel project. Maybe some projects are a little too obvious - Cleopatra anyone?Spielberg didn't really want to direct this one and through politics to complicated to go in to here had to switch from producer to director. His heart is not in it - so he just goes for the plod-plod-plod movie-by-numbers approach. Sad to see him not really extending his wonderful cineast brain.I read up heavily on the true life case of Frank Abigale Jnr and even read the press library interviews that he made after seeing the film. His escape from a plane showed that he was a true life James Bond! I always say: Knowledge is power!While the script was true in all its main facts it exaggerates the state of the French prison - that while tough it was not as tough as this. Although it was no holiday camp either. It also skims over how he got to practise law - the reason given here is a classic of stating selective truths.(He flunked the exam several times and was allowed to view his mistakes. There may have been bribery involved as well.)Tom Hanks and DiCaprio play off each other well, but they don't really have a lot to do with each other. The phone calls are a fabrication. They are really working in their own little bubble that only collide every now and then.What is the moral here? That if you say your name is Joe Blow and you are an airline pilot people believe you. That if you put as much effort in to crime as you do in to a real job it can pay better? Life has moved on since those days. CCTV, computers, the Internet, you wouldn't last five minutes doing all this today.The saddest thing is that despite his wealth Frank never looks happy. Not here anyway.Money doesn't make you happy seems the closing moral - but a look around the set of this film would quickly show that to be a lie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and the results are deadly: a technically flawless but self-righteous, humorless film maker, he is utterly incapable of embracing the joy of this cat-and-mouse chase, much less, appreciating the delicious irony of Abagnale's post-conviction life. Ironically, the usually-bombastic (and equally self-righteous) John Williams manages to reign himself in; his score was such a surprise, I though someone else had done it.Although DiCaprio tries mightily, Abagnale remains a selfish punk not worthy of our sympathy. He lets his father, for whom he launches his crime spree, drown in debt while he makes off with suitcases stuffed with cash. That Sr. has no problem claiming to be a Medal of Honor winner in a pathetic attempt to secure a loan tells us he wasn't above accepting "help" from Jr.Which leads us to Hanratty, who is not only self-righteous and humorless, but mean. He takes a perverse joy in telling Jr. what happened to Sr. And he wonders why Jr. escapes from the plane!The ER scene should have been written thusly: Jr. storms in like a general, talks to Mom while examining/comforting the boy, respectfully asks the interns for their diagnosis, forces himself to soak up the blood from the wound (which we get a gratuitous close-up of) while trying desperately not to pass out! That would not only have been funny, it would have displayed Abagnale's moxie and pluck. Instead, I found myself hoping he'd rot in jail.When Jr. is given a bogus check by the FBI agents, he notes that the paper is not perforated. Since we never learn how he mastered making bogus checks or obtained the tools needed, we must assume that he wasn't working with paper that wasn't perforated, either! How this minor detail got past the "experts" at the FBI (and Spielberg) is not for us lesser minds to ponder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Speilberg's world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to Steven Speilberg's world, a parallel universe where nuance, subtlety and personal interpretation are non-existent. In this world FBI agents are stumbling lead-footed stooges, wearing identical MIB suits and porkpie hats, who enter a suspected check-forger's apartment with handguns drawn, shouting "CLEAR!" as they stumble about from room to room. In this world a love scene must be accompanied by items on a bedside room service cart being knocked off one-by-one. A conversation between two secret agents must be shot in silhouette against an ominous blue background. A police station should be as glossily lit as a top European fashion emporium. The precocious hero must be able to escape an airplane lavatory in mere seconds, without tools, by removing 4 tiny screws. The love interest must be blonde, the in-laws stern, the failed father edgy, brittle and possibly nuts (Christopher Walken will do). And most of all the hero's dubious achievements must be shown to have benefited society in the long term and any of his character flaws attributed to youth, naivety and bad upbringing. After all, this is a movie and we can't have a fundamentally flawed hero or a morally ambiguous ending. Even if the said "hero" bilked countless innocent people out 4 million dollars.It would be nice if just once Spielberg could depict a story or a sequence of events as they might realistically occur rather than having to plaster everything with his trademark gloss and worn-out directorial flourishes. It would be nice if you could come out of one of his movies with an opinion rather than an answer.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Main character inspires no empathy &amp; no condemnation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a thief and con man between the ages of 15 and 21. It doesn't stick closely to the real story of his life but takes many liberties with the narrative. It makes him an only child instead of showing his three siblings and changes the timeline so that he does his first major theft and confidence tricks at the age of 16.It is told in a value-neutral way so that you can't admire him for his schemes nor condemn him for his wrongdoing either. You don't care enough about the character to admire or condemn him. He is simply a 'phenomenon'. The actor Lenny D is adequate in the role. He never puts a foot wrong but doesn't stand out either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple, Financially Escapist Fantasy That's Lighter Fare Than Most Spielberg Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lean, flirty material that lacks the emotional punch I've come to expect from Spielberg's direction. Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo. Satisfying at times, especially when it's inspecting the hard work and tireless attention to detail that's essential to such dirty work (not to mention the rewards), it whiffs on any aspirations to challenge grander themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's definitely an entertaining movie with all the decent elements that a good movie should have. Spielberg is there, Hanks, DiCaprio, and Walken acting, and a funny true story.The movie is evil in one way that makes you attracted to the smartness in tricking people. I've always enjoyed watching this "crooky" kind of intelligence and you cannot but notice that even Hanks admired the character of Abignale Jr.The only flaw in the movie, however, is that though a problem existed in the relationship of the parents, the leading character played by DiCaprio had no other dimensions. I think probably there should have been more work on how the character developed to become that smart, tricky and lovable. Still, DiCaprio is a brilliant actor and hasn't been fairly treated in Hollywood yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No kind of everyman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Frank Abegnale Jr., teenage conman extraordinaire, should make for an entertaining movie; but in Stephen Spielberg's hands, the story falls a little flat. Partly this is due to the casting of the dull Leonardo di Caprio in the leading role; and partly because the careful reconstruction of the 1960s is too familiar from countless other movies to be interesting in itself. Mostly, however, the film loses impact because of Spielberg's apparent determination to weave boringly quintessential themes into his story; instead of an epic tale of derring-do, at times it unfolds like a dull tale of a kid who loves his family trying to live the American dream. This may or may not be how it happened; but personally, I think there would have been more interest in the movie without the attempt to depict its frankly remarkable anti-hero as some kind of everyman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most underrated film of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is regarded by many as the greatest director of all-time by many, with the examples of Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park just being a taster of his remarkable work. But for me, his greatest achievement is the incredibly underrated masterpiece that is Catch Me If You Can. Sure it didn't win Oscars ( but it was was nominated), sure it wasn't a box office smash, sure it didn't show us the horrors of the past, but it did show us a heartbreaking REAL story, of a boy who couldn't take his parents divorce, who wanted to run away with it all, and frauded the USA out of millions of dollars, being chased along the way, baffling the FBI and the world as to how he could obtain the money, fool the professionals and simply get away with his continuous law-breaking.Leonardo DiCaprio, who is regularly snubbed in acting, probably because of his outrageous good looks, is the best actor of his generation, without a doubt. His performances in Romeo &amp; Juliet, Titanic, The Man In The Iron Mask, Gangs of New York, are all top-notch, exceptional roles that put many of today's actors to shame. Catch Me If You Can is by far his best performance.He plays the fraud Frank Abagnale Jr with such depth and realism that you feel almost intrusive on his life, like you know too much about him. We witness his confusion at the divorce, his disgust at his mother's new boyfriend, his despair at not having a proper home anymore. And yet Leo also plays the adventurous teen spot on when it comes to a certain arrogance needed to convince people he's a pilot or a doctor. Also the determination and focus to detail on Leo's face when making fraudulent cheques, degrees etc is quite unbelievable, you really feel that this kid is putting his utmost concentration into these scams because it's his only way to survive, and he's gotta keep on running or he'll go to prison. Tom Hanks, as always is on top form as a fast-talking FBI agent who lives and breathes his job, and who is on Leo's trail. Understanding of the young kids' obvious trauma at the divorce, Hanks does sympathise, but has to chase him because, as he puts it "it's my job".The chemistry between both Leo and Hanks is very enjoyable, for although they are almost enemies with one chasing the other, in the end they turn out to be the best of friends. The most intriguing and unique relationship in the film though has to go to Leo and his father Frank Abagnale Sr. played by the eternally mesmerising Christopher Walken. Walken's character is a man who is very proud and when he is in economic ruin he tries to fool everyone into thinking he's the successful man, however the only person he is fooling is himself. He convinces himself totally that lying makes everything better, and this is probably where Frank is inspired to run away from everything and lie his way around the world. It certainly is the case when Leo asks Walken to tell him to stop running, and instead encouraging him to stop, Walken says "You cant stop" and then carries on the web of lies his son has spun by asking " Where are you going tonight? Somewhere exotic?" referring to Leo's stunt as a pilot. Walken was deservedly Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance which is really quite fascinating. The most memorable and poignant scene of the film is where Leo learns from Hanks that his father ( Walken) died by slipping on stairs. This is where Leo's talent is really shown, as the pain and anguish fill his eyes in a mixture of disbelief, anger, helplessness, plus feeling physically sick. He slams the chair in front of him, his eyes swollen in tears. But it's just his moans, eyes or facial expression that makes us feel his huge loss, it is his body. Leo's body moves in the strangest ways, almost like he is consumed with grief and reaching out in despair, all in all making it quite hard to watch. I haven't seen anyone put across that kind of emotion since the great James Dean in the 1950's. Along with the fast pace, great songs from 1950/60's, the atmosphere of that time gone by, a hell of a cast (including brief performances by Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner), Catch Me If You Can is highly entertaining. Boasting a highly unique soundtrack, a truly uplifting storyline, world-class acting and some superb direction, Catch Me If You Can is Spielberg's most underrated and yet best work, and is a film that will become a firm favourite with all who view it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catchy if a bit overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of Catch Me If You Can is interesting to say the least. The Spielberg directed biopic is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr who pulls of a series of breathtaking and unbelievable but nonetheless credible in their execution scams, and all before his 19th birthday.However this is also essentially the story of a young man who witness's his fathers business failure and consequently the break up of his happy family life, and accordingly sets out on something of a reactionary and desperate, but unattainable crusade to try and reclaim that which he has lost.Leonardo di Caprio, in a Michael J Fox eternal youth stereotyping role, stars as the teenager who is pursued over a period of years by an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks who is determined to get his man no matter what.The movie opens by setting the scene of the relationship between Di Caprio and his father, played by Christopher Walkin, whom the son obviously idolises. Early on we see Frank Abagnale Sr. being honoured by the local Rotary chapter but it soon becomes all to apparent that his success is not as it seems and in fact he is on the verge of bankruptcy and being pursued by the IRS for tax evasion. Things rapidly crumble leading to the Abagnale's losing their house and soon after the break up of the family when his Frank Senior's French wife leaves him for his best friend. Frank Jr, forced to choose between living with his mother of father, instead opts to run away and very soon realises an ability to graft and deceive people, more often than not women, based on his good looks, charm and, as he discovers, the awe and glamour in which the public hold airline pilots in 1960's America.Frank Jr. starts by breathtakingly impersonating a Pan Am Co Pilot which, more than anything exposes the gullibility and trusting nature of people before an age of air terrorism. Buoyed by his success and the relative ease in which he manages to carry off his assumed role, Frank's rapid learning curve combined with the necessity to keep ahead of the FBI chase leads him to further roles as a James Bond type super cool sophisticate, A Night shift doctor and ultimately a State prosecutor. All through this he keeps in contact with his father holding out the vague hope that he can get his mother and father back together and all will be the same as before and the nightmare will end. As his star continue to rise and his daring reaches new heights his fathers conversely falls as he ultimately ends up working as a mail man to make things meet.The most striking thing about this movie is how it develops each of the deceptions or roles he adopts, so that we start out finding it hard to see how he can carry off a role when he introduces the concept and yet as we are led through his deceptions the, ease and credibility of his performance and the naivety or unquestioning attitude of his audience carry us along and make us too see how he could have really pulled the trick.In the end the movie does stretch on a bit in its telling of the story and introduction of additional supporting cast of a love interest and her father played by Martin Sheen so that the end product runs well over 2 hours but if you think you might be on for sitting that long it's worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't read if the truth offends you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was OK. It wasn't spectacular and was on the overlong side. That's really not what you would expect from a big name film with big name stars. I guess I got about what I wanted from it, but to say that it's as wonderful as what I'm reading here is just not accurate. First off, you know you're in trouble when Leonardo Di Caprio is the best actor in the movie. I'm not a fan, but he did do the best job. I like Tom Hanks, how could you not? However, his acting talents are incredibly overestimated. For the first 20 minutes I was having a hard time trying to figure out what his accent was- southern, East Coast or perhaps Australian? Weak. Next, there's the infamous Christopher Walken. Amazing how no one mentioned him in the 20 or so comments I read. Maybe they didn't want to say anything bad about someone so well liked. OK, leave it to me to do the dirty work. Once again I'll bash another extremely popular actor: Walken is a terrible actor and in this movie he actually was a little better than I've seen him- slightly less terrible. I also read that this was totally original and that the "cat and mouse" idea was just great. This film didn't have an original feel to me and just off the top of my head I'm coming up with 2 other chase movies that blow this one away: Heat (De Niro) and The French Connection. Sorry to have to burst everyone's ideas, but I can't lie to you. I must also do the unthinkable again; yes, I'm going to say a few words about Spielberg. He has some talent, but his movies are filled with a certain sappy quality that just doesn't ring true or have any relevance. Perfect example- that thing with the floating $ bill that someone said was a nod to Forrest Gump (a forgettable movie to be sure). I guess people like that sort of stuff, but it's just silly and overdone. Well, I think I've ranted enough. I just feel there are many other better movies to get excited about out there. For Tom Hanks fans I still say "Big" (1987) is his best. For Spielberg I strongly recommend his first and best effort "Duel" (1971). For Walken and Di Caprio fans- you don't want to hear what I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is great fun to watch, however the quality isn't that high.The amazing thing is that the movie is based on true facts. If you don't know this the movie seems totally unbelievable and silly. It's great fun to see how Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) commits fraud time after time and impersonated several professions that he is not qualified to. However it feels like some lose events that were glued together in order to make an 2 hours+ movie. I think that the story of the real Frank Abagnale is much more interesting.The actors are perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for the role and he even manages to play a convincing early teenager, certainly his best role till date. But the one that steels the show is of course once again Christopher Walken. It's wonderful to see him again in a non-psychopath role. Tom Hanks also gives a nice performance however i have seen him done better. Certainly some nice casting work!Visually the movie is eye candy because of the costumes, sets and especially cinematography.There are some typical Spielberg things in the movie which makes it worth to watch. Like the comical elements of the movie that are done brilliantly in a way only Spielberg can do. Bad thing is that the movie doesn't seem like one to watch over and over again.Not a must see but still a fun movie to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine "The Talented Mr. Ripley" retold as a 1950's beach-blanket flick (hot sports cars, bikini babes, parents unaware of their out-of-control, freewheeling children) and you have "Catch Me if You Can," another Spielberg flick that's in love with its own imagined sense of importance. Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams. Tom Hanks shows up once again (*yawn*) with his typical 'martyr of purity' shtick; I would've preferred less of him and more of Christopher Walken's impassioned (and far more brief) performance as a long-suffering father.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.Inspired by true story of the con man and runaway thief and fraud checker Frank Abagnale Jr. the story is really interesting in terms of how he disguised himself into so many professions, how many flaws are there in the system. How easy it is to become a pilot, doctor and even a lawyer, how worse are background checks in America and how spineless is FBI too. Now, all this was interesting premise and this is indeed a worth telling tale. Yet, Spielberg made this to a heroic tale of a famous man and how even he has a human side where he loves his parents and wants to be faithful to a girl he loved. I didn't want him to be humane, I would have rather loved if he was lethal and brutal than he is actually shown to be. Tom Hanks here tried to make a fool of himself and I did not like it coz, he failed even failed to make a fool of himself and that's really sad, coz Tom is a fine actor and his acting did not show up here. The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio who does a fine job and the now superstar who was still a coming up actor in 2002, did show that he had the potential of making it big and his choices have made his career great. Leonardo as Frank comes with all guns blazing for whatever he is asked to do but I just wish his role was more cold blooded and cunning in despising himself and making merry with what goodies he gets. The art direction seems to be fine, but soundtrack of Jazz caught my ears and that was some real good music and I loved the soundtrack. Now, cinematography is good too, yet this is over two hour two minute saga that loses steam by the end. I wish it had more pace and not as lethargic as it is. The supporting cast did their job well and Amy Adams was a really cute pie then and she has come a long way since then.The writing had been a bit more crisper and the scissors been much more tight would have made this chase a delightful one, in a heist and chase movie, we do not expect drama but this loads of it, the father intervenes and the son-father relationship was not so much to my liking coz it was more of a clichéd thing than a fantasy one. The son keeps saying, dad I do this for you, I do that for you, now you and mom be happy. Ah, just cut the crap man.Oh, did I go too harsh in criticizing this movie, yeah I would have coz this is a great film for few but not for me. For me this was kind of routine stuff from a director who made a distinction to himself of making movies or telling stories that are too very engrossing and make us move, be it a ET, Jurassic park or a Schindler's List. Now, Spielberg got down to this and it was an OK attempt not a great one though.I am going with a 2/5 for an average movie from a great director and two of the very good actors we have around. This is what your bread and butter is, I need your gold and diamonds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but romanticizing an evil, psychopathic criminal in this way is sick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd always thought these "pretender" guys were in it for the thrill, the romance, the acting out of diverse roles, etc. That they loved the challenge, and that kind of thing. Didn't Tony Curtis play someone like that 30-40 years ago, also based on a true story? Anyway--- I was a bit surprised to find out that the Leo DiCaprio character was a criminal--- a thief, a forger, a rip-off artist merely in it for the cash. As he was portrayed in "Catch Me If You Can," he seemed psychopathic, cruel and fundamentally evil.This movie is unquestionably well-made. DiCaprio has displayed admirable maturity and power as an actor--- he no longer looks like a girl. he actually resembles a young Johnny Depp (and that's a good thing). Tom Hanks is also typically great. The 60s period setting is all good. But what I saw on the screen was a lot of innocent people having their lives ruined, in both big and some small ways: The would-be stewardesses who were humiliat ed, the fiance was unnecessarily hurt, her father was abused--- and why? What did those people do that made it OK for the movie audience to laugh out loud at their pain? The people who lost the $4 million dollars ($15 million in today's money), the various folks whose jobs were threatened, etc. How many families lost their income? How many elderly people suddenly could not retire as planned, but had to crawl off, unwanted, to some corner to die?Part of this movie wants us to somehow cheer for the Abagnale guy, to somehow "see through his flaws" and yet love him anyway. Bulls***! Based on what the movie showed, he was a horrible, evil little vampire. Hurting, destroying, crapping all over decent folks. His victims weren't even guilty of that old cliche rationale movie con-men have so often used, that they were trying to gain unfair advantage themselves--- no, the victims had done nothing wrong. They were not "up to anything." They were merely trusting others, and being loving.For this reason, this otherwise very good Speilberg effort was a bit disgusting. Movies over the years such as "Fitzwilly," "The Sting," "The Flim-Flam Man," and "Paper Moon" all romanticize and celebrate evil, because they all make light of thieves and seducers. But think about the people they hurt, the people they destroy--- somehow the victims are always forgotten in that Disneyesque focus on the cute little heroes. I'm sorry Steven, but the subject matter of this movie has gone too far. If you want to make a movie about Charles Manson the monster--- fine. I won't watch it, but at least the movie would be honest. To have made this movie about "Frank Abagnale The Cute Misunderstood Thief Who Is Really A Romantic Hero" is sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most saccharine, sentimental depiction of sociopathy, ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank is a con-(young)-man. He cashes fake checks totaling up to millions, cheats and lies his way into several professions, and charms several women onto his sheets...but that is just because he is a lonely, lost boy, because his father was always in money trouble, and he had a broken home. He writes sentimental letters to his father, offers him expensive gifts, and talks about his mother rejoining them. He is actually a genius, see, and, when given the chance, proves himself to be virtuous by helping the authorities. And he has good, honest, hardworking potential too!! -- he passed the bar exam all on his own after loads of studying. This movie struck me as so false throughout that I couldn't help but see through it and overcompensate for its dishonesty and false sentimentality by continuously re-imagining it: what might REALLY have happened? How sociopathic might Frank have been to lie, cheat and steal so easily and continuously? How many women might he have slept, really? And how many times did people catch on to him? A brief look at a wiki article proved my suspicions. Frank's first victim was his own father. He ran away from home and never looked back. He failed the bar exam several times and his passing may have involved bribery and other methods of cheating. After being placed in prison he tried to escape to Brazil but was caught repeatedly. His cons sometimes failed as people suspected his lies. If this story was even mildly hollywoodized, I would have been fine with it (and if the writing, acting and visuals weren't as bland). But it takes sentiment and dishonesty to the oomphth degree. Take for example the window scene near the end. It again reinforced the theme that Frank was just a lost and lonely boy who committed all these crimes because he missed his mother. And the cheesy label-removing motif. That was just a waste. Tom Hank's character was worst at the beginning when he was going room to room shouting comically and trembling like an old lady. He got slightly better at the end. Leonardo's character was as I mentioned unnatural and flat, so I guess he made the best of it. The female characters were very fake and comic-booky and annoying, yelling "yes, yes" during the sex scenes or crying after being yelled at by their boss and falling bashfully head over heels for the guy who comforts them. The worst offenders might have been the FBI and law enforcement folk who were a bunch of bumbling cartoonish idiots, too shy to reach their arms over for a fork. There were also a whole bunch of random scenes that didn't give anything to the movie. Some, like the prostitute scene seemed to be out of nowhere and would have fit in more if the whole movie wanted to show Frank as mildly sociopathic (which would have been more realistic). The one scene that I did like was when the agent came to France to see Frank's setup. Money flying everywhere and tilted camera angles gave it a cool look. But even then you are given the dishonest condition of Frank in stress and somewhat unraveling, a condition which screams at you, 'hey! look! look how worn out and rambling he looks! This criminal spree is taking a toll on him too, you know. He does have a heart!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm normally not one who likes movies based on true stories, there are some that I like, but for the most part I just couldn't care less. However Steven Spielberg made one that I truly liked under the name of "Shindler's List." So if there was one person who can make a great movie based on a true story it would be him. Well, unfortunately, "Catch me if you Can," is not only Spielberg's most overrated movie, but his worst film to date. Now keep in mind that there are some that I haven't seen, like 1941, which is considered his worst.The reason I really don't think this movie is that great, is that it just isn't that interesting to me. This was praised as a hugely entertaining chase film, and at times it is, but for the most part its just not interesting.Is it bad, no. The acting is top notch, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio do very good jobs here. And there were no plot holes, at least from what I saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite featuring the wonderful Chjristopher Walken in another excellent performance, catch me if you can is a decidedly average Hollywood portrayal of the life of a playboy conman.Matt Damon (cue silly voice from Team America: World Police) is his usual wooden self as he continues his quest to become the new Keanu Reeves of his day.Tom Hanks is annoying as usual and only some good performances from peripheral cast members and a half decent story hold together and make it watchable.I'd watch it again, but only if it involved much beer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the four million dollar man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I admired more than I enjoyed. I'm glad I saw it, and moreso that it was rented from a local library. Worth every penny. Also it strikes me as the kind of film my folks should absolutely see, and will enjoy more than I did.But I did enjoy it somewhat. I mean it has a pretty fascinating story at its center (I had not read the original book, but might do so later.) In talking to a friend who did read that, or maybe he heard the book-on-tape, it is clear that changes made to the film presentation were significant. More people doing "based on a true story" should follow this example, as the changes honestly helped to advance the storytelling desired.Quest for father, it worked for Joseph Campbell, and it works for Spielberg as well. And speaking of fathers, imagine having the luxury of Christopher Walken in a subordinate role as the absent biological father. I truly enjoy his verb-excising and pause-inserting talent, although it is rare to watch him and not think, "hey that's Christopher Walken."Tom Hanks as the substitute father however is more malleable. I think his Boston accent comes and goes a little bit, but his uptight-as-John-Ashcroft attitude here was welcome...he goes one step further and slowly reveals a humane tenderness that normally does not turn up in such rigid rectitude. Add his absent family adds up in the equation.Speaking of luxury, imagine having Martin Sheen in a largely disposable role, and Jennifer Garner as your cheap eye-candy. Well at $1000 a 1960 night, she ain't cheap, but you know what I'm saying. John Williams' music was different this time out, and I think stole the show more than Hanks as others allege. It did it with a breezy cool as easy as a snap. I likened it to more like something from Harry Partch meets Lou Harrison, then 60's soul jazz...but it was tremendous. It created as much playful suspense as the film needed all by itself.Leonard DiCaprio, evidently one of the driving forces behind bringing this to the screen did not work so much for me. But I think a big part of his charisma was built from swoon power, indeed more often than not he's fatally charming some young femme. His Abegnale character rolls up unbelievable amounts of money, and I wonder if the drive of was more sexually sparked than the spiel we get here? A seventeen year-old plus stewardesses?? Smells like motivation.I imagine it was fun for DiCaprio, or any actor, to play a con man. If we are all actors, maybe when we are being fake we are at our most true. No but, fun to pretend.A con man relies on not only misdirection but of course, confidence. More emphasis is placed on the former here, especially with the hypnotic talisman of a locket on a necklace.The story is more "Amazing" than all the stories Spielberg did for the TV series of that name lo these many years ago. For me it had some troubles, as a caper film means you have to have a criminal. And making a likable criminal is something that I'm less susceptible to than others. On top of that, for this to be "I Was a Teenage Super Impostor" something did not click. DiCaprio's subterfuge never seemed so meticulously studied. I think we were supposed to buy a combination of some dumb luck and dumber FBI men. The ending intimates that Abegnale's skills were remarkably superior, but this is a film that did not want to get bogged down in the details of the crime.So the deader the head for this, the more one can enjoy the fanciful flight. The film is glossy, the DVD has some nice input and certainly paints a likewise glossy portrait of Spielberg as a consummate craftsman. And a pretty genial guy. Or is he just a master fake?? No, I'm sure he's a gracious gent, and I think this is a nice oddball in his oeuvre.Again for my mom and dad, I give this an 8/10, but on my own scale, it scores an even5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical problems of making a good flick on the basis of a true story. Truth seems to sort of stifle the creative juices. Having read the actual story, I'm afraid I had trouble following the movie, at times. It starts out in a French prison, but I don't recall anyone saying why he was actually in prison in France. I thought the movie version of his becoming a doctor was a bit raw and quite abrupt. The true story involved a much more natural flow of events and would have made a neat segment. I guess they needed a certain treatment in order to make transitions from one part of the story to the next. And they did a pretty good job of stitching the whole thing together, even providing (creating?) a background of family issues to explain, in a way, how he happened to get into his chosen lifestyle. Some very classy bits to watch out for. Well worth waiting for on video.BTW, lest anyone think that Frank's lifestyle would be fun to emulate, you should know that he spent a lot more time in prison than what appears in the movie. In real life, he nearly died in the French prison. And he has been working hard since then to prevent others from doing what he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip the movie -- read the book instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I see the same movie 90% of my fellow reviewers saw?I read the book and perhaps that's why I was sorely disappointed with this film. The film trivialized some of the most interesting parts of the book (the chapter on the French prison was easily the most captivating in my opinion), completely ignored others, and dragged insignificant details out to painful lengths. Leo did an okay job, but I found Hanks grating (not to mention the fact I spent most of the movie trying to figure out why his name wasn't O'Riley, the FBI agent in the book). Walken was good, but I found his character to be very much unlike the man depicted in Frank Abagnale's book.I was sorely disappointed that the green baby/blue baby joke wasn't even mentioned!Plus it distorted the whole image of why Frank did the things he did. He, himself, admits that his father's financial troubles were a factor in his actions, but if I remember correctly, he stated much of what he did was hormone-driven -- ie. his affinity for women.Instead of spending $8 on the film, spend $10 on the book and wait for the movie to be shown on TBS in a few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Steven Spielberg to direct and Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio as stars how can you miss right? Well what should have been either a 100 minute well edited fun movie or a mini-series but at two hours and twenty odd minutes it is way too long and paradoxically not long enough.You see there are some neat things in this story. What did Frank Abagnale Sr. , wonderfully played by Christopher Walken, do for a living? Was he a printer or just run a stationary store? I mean where did Frank Jr.( DiCaprio) learn about inks and paper and such? It would have given depth to the story and was not there that I saw.They spent time on Frank Sr's wife and Junior's mother Paula Abagnale played with a wonderful style by Natalie Baye, but was she a hooker in France or was she a money grubbing tramp and the whole divorce scene was played like Junior had not been living there for sixteen years? I couldn't tell for sure.Spielberg can do better work. Tom Hanks must feel greatly relieved that a picture can be made that he doesn't have to be the mainstay? He was slow to grow on you but ultimately very good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty. This is sort of fun for a matinee movie but it is not award class. Those who say it is must have seen the director's cut or something? It is an ok movie, but I would have not liked it at full price nearly as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spielberg is both politically backward (liberal, that is, rather than radical, reaching, humane) and, like his nut-job U.S. president, totally bereft of curiosity. [?] He remains enraptured by respectability, orthodoxy and the status quo. It's doubtful that enlightenment will ever strike him." - Dennis Grunes Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me If You Can" opens with a stylised credit sequence, a homage to Saul Bass and the caper/con/heist/spy/Pink-Panther/Saint movie credits of the 1960s. What follows is Spielberg's version of Tony Curtis' "The Great Imposter" and Wendell Harris' "Chameleon Street", though here our hero is teen-aged con-man Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), an emotionally wounded kid who lies to others as a means of escaping the lies he tells himself.All of Spielberg's pros and cons are on display. Moments of sexuality, romance and swearing ring awkward or false, the film's comedy is clunky, all female characters are whores, bimbos, nitwits or betrayers, the terrifying, darker aspects of "real-life Frank" are ignored and the film's last act is bloated. Spielberg cheats with some of the images as well, using postcard pictures, fancy clothes, an animated intro, chirpy music, cutesy nods to Truffaut and slick montages to convey an impression of either fun or loneliness. It's all very mechanical. A collection of references rather than anything substantial.Though it aims for a breezy tone, the film's start-stop narrative is more a collection of vignettes. Spielberg's camera also rarely conveys a sense of true three dimensional space, and like "Minority Report", one is always aware that there is nothing, no space, no landscape, beyond the edges of each sound stage, each set-piece, each street corner or those blazing shafts of white light which seem to cordon off each sequence. Watch, for example, how small the film's street scenes are, or how closed off its airport sequences feel. With Spielberg, there's never anything beyond the set piece, a facet which he tried to rectify with "The Terminal" (where space and architecture become the lead character).Still, there's a lot of great stuff on display. DiCaprio's fantasy world is infectious, Spielberg clearly having fun as DiCaprio does likewise. Forging cheques, playing make-believe, living a fantasy life, these are all things which appeal to Spielberg. The film's "real human drama" is also handled much better here than elsewhere in Spielberg's filmography, and unlike most con-man movies ("The Sting", "Ocean's Eleven" etc), Spielberg always stresses the pain (see "California Split") underlying each of DiCaprio's flights into white-collar fantasy (though DiCaprio's victims are given no voice). This is the post "A.I." Spielberg, the film-maker increasingly suspicious of himself and his art.If one ignores "ET", "Catch Me" is perhaps Spielberg's most autobiographical film (the director famously conned his way into, or rather conned us into believing that he conned his way into, a Universal Studios lot). All Spielberg's neuroses are presented (ie, a kid hiding in the fantasy world of cinema/con-artistry because his parents are divorcing), before the film eventually climaxes with Frank joining the FBI and using his powers of lying, forgery and imagination (aka his sweet film-making skills) for the "greater good" of America. The film then ends with title cards which inform us that Frank stopped thousands of criminals, raised a large family (all sons!) and became a millionaire by creating unforgeable cheques. It's Spielberg's own trajectory from little Jewish outcast to millionaire do-goods-man, his filmography untouchable, unforgeable, but built on lies and forgery.Some cite the film as a critique of the "American ethos", white collar America, and the hollow drive to "please the father", "get top jobs" and "be all you can be". But what the film really exemplifies is Spielberg's brand of confused, liberal humanism. The film's French authorities may be brutally indifferent, but America lets Americans act out, then, like a good daddy, rehabilitates them and brings them back home. FBI agent Tom Hanks, Frank's surrogate daddy, is after-all not a big mean G-man, but just another wounded guy looking for a son of his own. If daddy and son work and dream together, everyone will prosper.In this regard, Frank's motivations are completely ignored by Spielberg, who attribute them solely to "divorce". In reality, Frank's criminality stemmed from his father's own predicaments at the hands of the state (his inability to "turn cream into butter", as he says in the film), predicaments which led to real-life Frank noticing the disparity between America's economic reality and its empty promises of success through "unceasing hard work". What Spielberg's film does is bashfully circle around this truth before presenting the opposite. Here, Frank's flights aren't a means of debarring his father's problems but of overcompensating for his father's failings as a scheming businessman, failings which Frank believes caused his evil wench of a mother to leave daddy. Work hard, be smarter and cleverer than daddy, and mommy won't leave. But remember to do this within the boundaries of the state, the law, otherwise you won't make millions and have a cool job and big family. The film's goody-goody conservatism, which a better director would have pushed to parody, is epitomised by a series of conversations towards its ending when Frank reiterates that he "didn't cheat", that he "studied and worked hard" and "passed all his bar exams". In other-words, selfishly conning people only sidetracked our hard working, talented Frank from his true potential, from America's true "rugged individualism", true nature, and true work ethic. And if you do this as well, if you're an imaginative little guy who works within the boundaries like Frank/Spielberg, you too can be a zillion dollar high flier. Meanwhile, the film completely ignores the contempt con artists ordinarily have for their victims, for humanity in general, that pool of all-too-eager suckers.7.9/10 ? Worth three viewings.

		<shortDescription>Not Mr Spielberg's best by a long way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good films generally have good stories which have been rewritten as great screenplays. This film's screenplay fails to live up to the story it retells. Any film portraying the hero/villain (Frank Jnr) as a contestant in a game show as a first take has a lot of ground to make up before it ends.There is a hollowness in this film which begins with the tale of the two mice who fell into a bucket full of cream, because I thought only one of the mice was honest and, by the end of the film, I knew I was right. There is a nastiness in this film which is apparent via the targeting of the female bank clerks and others for trickster game playing during the film. The scams actually do harm people along the way although we are not credited with enough intelligence by Mr Spielberg of what that harm may be.We have an unlikeable character for the alternative hero/villain (Hanks's FBI investigator Hanratty) who is not allowed to show any redeeming quality at all, except for a crafty swipe at Frank Jnr whenever he can, and doesn't the lad deserve it? We even have characters playing 'suspicious minds' just in case we lose sympathy with Frank Jnr's game playing, but, unlike Hanratty, they are actually mostly clueless. And any who aren't clueless seemingly don't get a mention in case it spoils the plot. So what may have been a very believable book is not a believable screenplay.The acting is patchy. I enjoyed Frank Jnr's parents doing their thing, and, mildly speaking, Amy Adams's Brenda, but that is about it. The rest were just not very convincing at all.So definitely not Spielberg's best and if you'd like to see the man at consummate ease with his medium spend your money on a re-run of "Duel" which is still my favourite Spielberg film.3/10 because it is overlong and I wasn't entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie feels extremely disjoint. Three (counting the Xmas calls) years of Frank being tracked down compressed in less than two hours do not make for very exciting story telling. It is merely a case of Frank jumping from one role into another. His ability to act these roles proficiently is only tested once in each situation. However, a year in each of these roles would necessitate the construction of a more elaborate personality for Frank than what is depicted in the movie.Some scenes seem to have been put into the movie without reason. For example, the whole set of scenes starting from the 'james bond of the skies' comment to the scene at room 3113 serve no purpose. Frank at another role. What does it tells other than that Frank likes role playing?Overall it is somewhat enjoyable... but Frank's character is not interesting enough, despite its many transformations. The movie manages to take an interesting story and transform it into a purposeless mess.Positive aspects: The music. Negative aspects: Ill-placed emphasis on the plot and bad pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fascinating story &amp; fantastic cast are wasted in this sloppy self-indulgent slice of "Shpielberg." A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the beloved son of Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken) and the French Paula Abagnale (Nathalie Baye). One day, his father has a problem with IRS. The Abagnale family looses all their assets for the government, becoming very poor. But his great deception happens when his parents decide to divorce. He leaves home with nothing but his checks and a few clothes, and moves to New York City. There, it is very difficult for a boy alone get a job, so he decides to use his checks without funds. Then he pretends to be a Pan An pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, being chased by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), but always escaping. He becomes one of the greatest con man of USA, being in the list of the most wanted. Carl only arrests him in France. A movie directed by Steven Spielberg and with Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken in the cast is the synonym of a good and high quality movie. This one, about a con man living in a innocent and romantic time (like Butch Cassidy was a romantic bank thief), is also a great entertainment and very recommended for any audiences. My vote is eight.</fullReview>

The ending is dragged out ridiculously, and gives little satisfaction.The real problem i found was that Di Caprio is on-screen almost all the time, yet he spends so much time pretending to be someone else, we never get to know his character and therefore i found it impossible to feel any emotion to his situation.After 1 hour, the film wears thin, after another hour, i was barely awake.

		<shortDescription>The Sara Lee of films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This review contains spoilers***The biggest problem I have with this film is the same one I had with Coppolla's `Dracula': this film is a hodgepodge of vignettes, less a continuous stream than a series of carefully crafted scenes. Normally the editing process of a film patches the scenes together into a unified whole, so that the resulting film flows, but in this film nearly every scene opens and closes like its own little film, leaving little room for character development. I have no idea what motivates Frank Abagnale, for example. One might be tempted to look at the failure of the family business or his parents' divorce as a catalyst, but still we are given absolutely no insight into the character. It would have been nice to see the characters given a little humanity instead of looking and acting like stiff background characters from some crappy 1960s cartoon.In one of the most bald-faced product placements I've ever seen, three FBI agents, including Hanks, are invited in to Franks's mother's house for `Sara Lee'. One of the agents says: `nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.' That might be true if the only food you've ever eaten is tree bark, but the waxy, unsatisfying desserts offered by Sara Lee are the Keanu Reeves of the dessert world: they look good, but have no substance.Situations arise and disappear like zephyrs. Why does Frank apply for the job at the hospital, did he get tired of being a pilot? He gets the job at the hospital, okay that's simultaneously interesting and funny, but then what happens? Does he quit, is he fired? How does the girl get back together with her parents, did they forgive her, does she keep her job? How did Frank perform as an attorney? When and how did he buy a house in Atlanta? Who are all those people at his house? What was the deal with model/prostitute? The whole scene served absolutely no purpose. There are dozens and dozens of unanswered questions such as these, from start to finish, leaving a curiously empty, unsatisfying feeling, much like eating a frozen dessert made with artificial chemicals. That Sara Lee gets such a high-profile product placement in this film is no coincidence, I am sure.Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances as Frank's father. Like Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story, Walken's face tells more about the character than anything he could ever say. His performance is so rich and deep that he should be nominated for best supporting actor. LDC, having shown so much promise in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' is merely adequate in the role of Frank Abagnale; he's no Christopher Walken, that's for sure. Hanks plays himself, doing his best Robin Williams impression of Tom Hanks playing a dramatic role, occasionally raising his voice just like he's been doing since Bosom Buddies. Hanks is the Sara Lee of actors.All in all, this is an interesting film, albeit a curiously empty one. The day after you watch it, you won't remember any of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie twice, and the first one dazzled me with a premise that basically is a constant run and some fun in coning. Di Caprio is outgoing and charming. Everyone else is like publicity, you know it's there but you don't take them in account. Except Christopher Walken, who is Superb.At second viewing, three years later, I remembered only pieces, and was bored to death. The settings are urban boring and the action is heterogeneous but unimpressive. I think Spielberg rooted to make the story of the con man too sweet, to make him infantile and reachable phsycologically. I didn't like that approach being the character in real life a lot more interesting, obscure and harder. Tom Hanks character Hanratty tries to be smart at all times, guessing and boring, tires with his pseudo-hero role.All of the movie tries to make what would be an interesting, edgy film into a bedtime story, sweetened by all filmical elements (actings, directing, lights, script). Im sure you will like it, because you want a smile on your face. But I sure do enjoy stories like these being much darker, much more intrinsically approached and a lot deeper. A nice try though, Spielberg. Im still a big fan of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW, what an overrated film! The movie is simply too long and very poorly paced. It could have used some voice over narration from Frank. Similar to "Goodfellas". I kept thinking of Goodfellas while watching this film. A criminal, period dress, period music.....then they part ways. The pacing of Goodfellas is brilliant and length is no object. Those are the two areas CMIYC fails. It's all over the map with one too many endings. It is also an embarrassing role for Hanks. Leo is good. I cannot fathom why Spielberg wasted his time with this film or why critics are fawning over it. As a big Spielberg fan, I am disappointed. I'm one of the few who thinks A.I. is a masterpiece. There was just no magic in Catch Me If You Can, nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this wasn't based on a true story I would have thought it was just the figment of some screenwriter's imagination but it is based on a true story so it obviously must have happened. The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. must have been 10 times slicker than Leonardo because the character as he portrays him wouldn't have been able to con me out of so much as a dollar bill and the FBI agent that Tom Hanks plays isn't too bright. How he ever let Abagnale get away from him as many times as he did is beyond me, but then again, based on recent news the FBI appears to be about as bright as Barney Fife so I guess they really did let this kid slip through their fingers on more than one occasion and make fools out of them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg found a great story, but managed to muck it up. There is too much emphasis on the character of Christopher Walken. Spielberg continues his slavish devotion to making the father-son relationship the controlling factor in all of his movies since E.T. Here, it doesn't work, and the far more interesting character of Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is given short shrift.For a cat-and-mouse game, this movie felt more like a pleasant cruise. Frank Abagnale (DiCaprio) was fun to watch, but there was never any tension built up, and the score reflected this as well. The relationship between Frank and Hanratty was more assumed than developed, and thus a great opportunity was lost. Still, a fun watch, ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with this film. Acting is as strong as one might expect from people like Hanks, DeCaprio, Walken. The overall film is a good story told by a good storyteller, Spielberg. Not all films can be an E.T., Philadelphia, Lord of the Rings..and when they aren't it's important that they be a solid demonstration of the talents of those involved. Such is the case with this film. Cudo's, however, to Walken who demonstrated restraint from his usual over-the-top Walkenisms and portrayed his character within the story. I think if Spielberg keeps this up, he'll be a good Director (kidding of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the good stuff, and there's plenty of it. Hanks is not a back-to-back Oscar winner for nothing. His performance is the compassion-uppermost hardnut that we have already seen in Saving Private Ryan. But of the two I'd commend DiCaprio's performance more highly. His Frank Abagnale is stylish, charming but away with the fairies. It's quite bipolar.There's also a peach of a score from John Williams and (collaboratively) one of the finest title credit sequences ever, a 60s retro animation designed by Olivier Kuntzel and Florence Deygas for Nexus Productions (thank you Senses of Cinema for that information).Alas the subsequent film is something of an anticlimax. The pursuit comedy implied by the opening sequence never really has the zip that Spielberg might have wanted - he gets too bogged down with flashbacks and Freudian tangents. At at least half an hour too long the film is cumbersome. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot of Money Spent on a Slight Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "Catch Me If You Can" an indicator of the end of Western civilization? How to justify the enormous amount of money and talent that went into creating a slight entertainment with zero significance? As my son pointed out -- the idea was to make a profit and they doubtless are. The cleverly done details overwhelm the substance, almost hiding the lack of any.The opening credits by Nexus Productions are a marvelous salute to similar animated openings, like "The Pink Panther" and "The Man with the Golden Arm," period classics by noted graphic designers like Saul Bass.John Williams captures the Mancini feel of "Peter Gunn" etc. with the finger clicking accompaniment to the opener. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, costumes and art direction stunningly continue the period feel, as well as expensive use of appropriate songs like "Look of Love," so we really do see all the money on the screen. Because Steven Spielberg doesn't spend $1,000 where he can spend $100,000. The camera is constantly moving back to reveal huge, decorated sets, and swooping around to show us just how much environment has been re-created. This is to Spielberg's oeuvre what "Ocean's 11" is to Steven Soderbergh's. It feels like Spielberg was trying to do a tribute to Billy Wilder, without the cynicism that he simply can't do, but the film is dedicated at the end to the late Bruce Paltrow. Wilder would never see family deterioration and recreation as a motivator as Spielberg does, with a recurring theme of Christmas Eve reunions, complete with a wide-eyed little girl (with a similar divorce propulsion as in "E.T.").Leonardo DiCaprio is much better cast here than "Gangs of New York" as a protean teen-ager, while Tom Hanks is his usual obsessively dedicated employee. Christopher Walken is marvelous in a small, fatherly role and even gets to dance very briefly.But I kept wondering whether this story would have held up as a little indie film and decided it would not without the gloss.

		<shortDescription>Will Spielberg ever Direct another Classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a title like "Catch Me If You Can" I was expecting a story with pace and excitement. What I witnessed was a half-hearted and stunted film that seemed to be more concerned with style over content. Surprisingly the film is boring. Considering the strong premise and the talent of the Director I was expecting a light-hearted, fast paced, comedic romp. I was disappointed almost on every level.The opening title sequence was an absolute bore and seemed to go on for an age. The music by John Williams was insipid and uninspired.The Direction was laborious and stilted, almost devoid of emotion. What was he up to?I got the feeling Spielberg rushed too much during the shooting schedule and then refused to cut mercilessly in the edit. Twenty minutes could have easily been slashed to the cutting room floor, especially scenes involving the Tom Hanks character. Could Tom Hanks' ego allowed him to have taken a supporting role in this Picture? I think not. In fact I am sure his part was padded out ? to the detriment of the whole.Spielberg is a great Director, but has he got a Classic Motion Picture left in him or is he just painting by numbers as this Film seems to suggest?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I've been watching another film to some of the other people on IMDb, or perhaps it's because I've been having my own little classic movie fest over the past two days (with THE BIG SLEEP, THE THIRD MAN, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS etc). Whatever the case, I was decidedly underwhelmed by Spielberg's latest offering.The cinematography was very pleasing, Leo did a good job, the period detail was all there, there was some nice use of music (though not nearly as much as I was expecting) and there were some brilliant, laugh-out-loud sequences but... it just didn't work for me. The film's pacing was all wrong IMHO: far too slow at the beginning and between every major con; by the half-way point I was clock-watching, something I very, very rarely do in the movies. Usually I get very easily sucked into a film but in this case I just wasn't. Oh, well, my loss I guess. In terms of rating, the film gets points for craftmanship but is dragged down by the pacing and Hank's phoned-in performance to a straight average mark of 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**MILD SPOILERS**I was dragged to see this with the family on Christmas, and it was definitely my least favorite "present" of the day.The main flaw in the film was that of its main character: Frank Abagnale, Jr. I can't support a character being portrayed as a 'hero' if in fact they aren't one. Abagnale had no conscience, no moral center, no concern for all the innocent people he duped and tricked. Plus the film didn't show how he slipped from perfect schoolboy into cold-hearted conman; it just *happened*. If Abagnale had been portrayed as more of a villain, I would have liked the film more. Leonardo DiCaprio's largely sleep-walking performance didn't help.I give this film 4 out of 10: one point for Tom Hanks's excellent portrayal of Carl Hanratty, one point for John Williams's lovely musical score, one point for Thierry Kuntzel's lovely credit sequence, and one for the "airport pickup" gag; you'll know it when you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway)."Minority Report" has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC "care" -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit.A word of advice: don't watch "The Grifters" (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of "The Sting."Hell, don't even see the underrated "Harry in Your Pocket" or even "The Flim-Flam Man" before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$.Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see "A.I." or "Minority Report."And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in "Thirteen Days" (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's "Road to Perdition" is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod).Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene.The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think "Pink Panther" flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's "Ocean's Eleven" sans the cool.Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly "what's she doing here?" cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival).Though "based on actual events," several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont.By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?).But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history.Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, "The Great Impostor" -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well.Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE.Catch it not. But *do* rent "The Grifters." Or "Ocean's Eleven"... even the original. No wait -- stick with the *other* Steven's version ;)4/10 Out</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although taken from an intriguing true story about a teenage con-man, this Steven Spielberg film is neither funny enough to be a comedy, dramatic enough to be a solid drama, nor suspenseful enough to be a good caper. It's blandly straightforward film-making, hurt mostly by a script that needs us to fill in the blanks and a one-note performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead. Tom Hanks is far superior as the head Fed on the case, while Jennifer Garner has a superfluous role as a model-cum-prostitute and Christopher Walken is unable to create a convincing character as Leonardo's father. The period detail is careful but disappointing, and the overlong film takes a good 40 minutes to kick into gear. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Captain Sinks The Ship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good "con" flick and when I read about the exploits of Frank Abagnale recently in the prerelease publicity for this movie I was psyched to see this flick. Hey, it even has Steven Spielberg directing with a huge budget!The story as it was told in the publicity for the movie left me filled with anticipation because I could not understand how a teenager could do what Frank Abagnale is reported to have done, and after watching "Catch Me If You Can" I still don't know how he could have done what he is supposed to have done.Obviously this is a big problem, and the problem exists because Spielberg does not understand how Abagnale could have done these otherworldly things.Spielberg took the lazy way out; he decided that because the events are supposed to be "true" (hey the FBI says they are!) he as director was under no obligation to convince us.Wrong!If you want to see a great "con" flick see the film masterpiece known as "The Sting". That was not "based on a true story" and thus George Roy Hill understood that for the film to work he had to make us believe that Redford and Newman could pull off such a caper and he succeeded so well that under repeated viewings we have no doubt that these two could both devise such a plot, find the "talent" to do the job and lead them successfully to the end.In "Catch Me If You Can" Tom Hanks playing the FBI agent who tracks Abagnale around the country and in Europe (though he apparently went to South America as well and Spielberg or not South America never seems to fit into the budget) asks Abagnale to the very end how he passed the Bar exam to be an attorney in Louisiana.We never get a believable answer. After 2 hours and 22 minutes we don't know how a teenager could work as a doctor in a hospital (and in a supervisory capacity over other doctors no less!) or become a prosecutor (!) in Louisiana.What you will get though is all the "big budget Spielberg" that you could expect along with all the other Spielbergisms that you are familiar with. That's the problem with "Catch Me If You Can", it's a story that needed the recently departed George Roy Hill, but instead was bought by the director of "The Color Purple".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many dreadful movies can this Spielberg guy generate before the public catches on that he's a flash-in-the-pan non talent who got lucky with Jaws and Raiders, crash-diving every time thereafter. Sure, some were taken-in by Saving Private Ryan, actually taking it as a patriotic movie when, in fact, it thoroughly trashed our World War II veterans. Perhaps the day has arrived, as this and other Spielberg films (Terminal, Lady Killers) did poor box office.Herein Spielberg takes a hand at retelling the story previously filmed well by Universal in "The Great Impostor" starring Tony Curtis. The original film was definitely offbeat, but lighthearted. Impossible to believe, except they said it was all true. The newer version has a nasty tone to it, and fails to engage the audience. I like Leonardo De Caprio a lot, but thought he struck out in this one. Tom Hanks used to be an exceptional actor, but now seems content to be an extended body part to his one and only master. This is really half a review, as I couldn't get beyond 60 minutes of the dreary mess.</fullReview>

Its such a shame because the guy is obviously highly talented, doesn't need the cash, and should have the confidence in his own abilities and the audience not to need to stoop to Disney techniques in order to embellish a great, true story. So many things just didn't add up, particularly in some of the characterisations - the young girl's parents, for instance, just weren't the type to have thrown her out of the house when they found she was pregnant. No, reality really is better than fiction and all those things that Spielberg added in a naive attempt to interest the audience were just the things which turned them off. And, oh, what was that awful boring, long, pastiche of a title sequence at the front? Most of the audience were asleep, or talking, before they saw the first frame of the story. Hollywood yet again gets it wrong.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks AS Tom Hanks AS some character. Once again, Spielberg also is merely mediocre. He has no edge nor directorial creativity and hardly does anything but tell an interesting story in a very bland way. The best part of the movie was the opening credits which was a throwback to the classic graphics of the opening credits of the 1950 (eg. anatomy of a murder) Walken plays his role quite well though. Overall, the movie was pretty mediocre but DiCaprio and Walken make it enternaining enough for for me to have stayed awake amidst the tired work of spielberg and hanks.</fullReview>

Instead of a movie about a remarkable young man we have one about motivation for criminal actions stemming from a broken home and a dishonest father and the particularly unremarkable FBI agent trying to catch him.There is little description of how he charmed his way through cons as most of the movie is spent giving a completely false impression of his father(and hence him)or showing the plodding Hanratty one step behind him again.The characters are simplistic, one dimensional and worse dull. In one scene as Hanratty is reporting to his boss his assistant agents loitering at the back of the office are licking ice-creams, they're dopey and outsmarted by Abagnale, WE GET IT ALREADY!I would like to be able to say I was disillusioned having read Abagnales' book before watching the movie, but I can't.

		<fullReview>I lasted about ten minutes in this "gem" before running from the theatre in disgust. I'm so sick of movies that tell you every moment how you should "feel". Spielberg doesn't trust his audience to make their own decisions about what they are watching. Each and every single second is so manufactured that it is impossible to react in any other way than in the micromanaged specific predigested fashion in which Mr. Spielberg wants us to. Perhaps his movies are meant to be watched with the sound off. They are like panels of a cartoon. The visuals are clear and they certainly tell a story in a clear and distinct way, but there's no room to breathe, no air on the screen. It's like being at a Natural History museum looking at stuffed cavemen hunting a sabre tooth tiger. Sure is pretty. But nobody's breathing up there.Since I only saw ten minutes (which is enough for me if a movie is as terrible as this one. The film could've turned into "citizen Kane" the moment I left and it wouldn't matter, the damage had been done) I can only comment on what I saw, so here goes:The title sequence:I hated those faux-sixties cartoon drawings. Like everything in Spielberg's post-"Close Encounters" body of work, it doesn't quite make it. It was a cute idea, but instead of getting an artist who would really do a good job stealing from the Saul Bass school of design, he got somebody who fumbled the job, making it seem more like the cheapo animation in one of those 70's health movies like "I am Joe's Stomach" or something. Even worse is John Williams score, but the less said about him the better.The "To Tell the Truth" opening was one of the laziest first draft attempts at expopsition I'd seen since the Ndugu letters of "About Schmidt". Doesn't anybody know who to write dialogue anymore? Plus, the transition from the gameshow to the rainy sequence in France was both clumsy and non sensical. Once again, Speilberg gets a case of the nauseating "cutes". Gee, French people are funny, they can't pronounce this character's name. Gee, does everybody in the audience get that THIS is the guy that Leonardo De Caprio was talking about in the previous frame? That fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks? By this point I had one foot aimed towards the exit.Then we get another "cutesy poo" Spielberg moment when the fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks has to open an umbrella inside because there's a leak. Sacre Bleu! That's Hi-larious!Then we get another in a long list of what I like to call the "Pinnochio meets Faces of Death" moments that Spielberg seems so fond of. Where broad bad comedy meets the harrowing and gut-wrenching. Like in Amistad where first we get Matthew McCaughnahay doing his best High School Acting version of "Mr Toad's Wild Ride" and then we get African American slaves chained together and thrown into the sea. This is where Leo's consumptive hacking (which is better suited to "Midnight Express" than this lightweight ersatz caper/chase flick) is juxtaposed with the worst accent I think I've ever heard in a movie (even worse than Leo's irish? accent in the Gangs of New York). The fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks is nattering on under that umbrella, the faceless French guys are chimpering in inaudible francois and Leo is hacking up like John Hurt in Aliens. What's wrong with this picture? Why is Speilberd so determined to gross us out? (See "Minority Report" with its hacking of snot and rancid-food-eating scene for his most recent offense)Then we get Leo's attempted escape which of course is accompanied by the entire prison population shrieking and urging him on like the Forum crowd in "Ben Hur".When Christopher Walken arrives, he managed to use his own quirky acting rhythms to throw a pleasant monkey wrench into Spielberg's well oiled McMovie. But by the time Leo was watching his parents dancing the wine stain into the white rug, and then when Walken told Leo not to hit the curb while parking (guess what he does anyway!? Screams of knee-jerk laughter from the multi-plex crowd)I had seen enough. I want to have my own feelings, Mr. Speilberg, thank you. I have only to refer to "Far From Heaven" as an example of how to let an audience think. Even though the movie had an arch tone and over-the-top dialogue at times and looked like a techinicolor fantasy, it never told you how to feel. It allowed you to make your own decisions. But I'm afraid Mr. Spielberg has morphed past the point where he'll have anything meaningful to say to someone past an eighth grade education.Yuck. Ten minutes was tooooooo much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hank's Worst Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this is the worst movie for Tom Hanks...In other words...It's the first bad movie for Tom Hanks.... as Usual..Steven Spielberg ruins the movie as he did with Minority Report and he turns out the actors into machines and takes away their ability to show us the great emotions and drama ...that's what he did with Tom Cruise and this time with the other great Tom....HanksSpielberg turned him to a lousy F.B.I agent with no creativeness at all..doing just his boring job to catch a boring kid and for what ?..to work in the next office to him in the end in the same boring job. that's itSpielberg turned the great actors to machines-like and ruined the whole beautiful emotionable story..so I don't think this movie is gonna win anything in the Oscar and I think it's a great chance for Tom Hanks to start thinking again about his Old movies and to try to get his high level back in the future...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg had charmed and affected audiences all over, but there was no sign of a film based on a true story, that is until this one came along. Basically FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is picking up his inmate from French prison, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio), and through a series of flashbacks we see how he became the youngest and one of the most ruthless con-men in America. Hse has his mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) and father Frank Sr. (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken) separate, and just before turning nineteen, he runs away from home. He is determined to regain every penny that his father lost, and he successfully takes on many false identities in order to con his way to millions of dollars. In the process he passes as a history professor, airline pilot, a doctor and an assistant attorney general (lawyer). He also manages to have a one night stand with hooker Cheryl Ann (Jennifer Garner), before finding true (if that word can be used) love with nurse Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). Eventually his movements are being clocked by the FBI, led by Hanratty, who at one point comes face to face with his culprit, but he does get to him eventually. In the end, after many escapes and more attempts, Frank finally decides to stop, and finds a very good way to compensate by helping his now friend Carl catch other cons for the FBI. Also starring Martin Sheen as Roger Strong, James Brolin as Jack Barnes and Slither's Elizabeth Banks as Lucy. DiCaprio is fantastic as the young con, Hanks of course pulls his role off with ease, and Walken is a very good choice as the con's father, it is funny, moving and most watchable, a good fun biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Williams, and it nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, Christopher Walken number 34, and Tom Hanks number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im sorry, but this movie was beyond boring and way too dumb to take seriously. Over 2 hours of nothing. How can you drag out something as pointless as running around writing bad checks? Um yeah, because everything presented in the movie could really happen right. Dont believe the hype, a stinker through and through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How director/actors ruin a beautiful script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot about this film.I saw it today and thought it was a brilliant script and how the big name director and star actors ruined a beautiful script.This film was about brilliant characters of Frank and his father which should have been played in a unique way not just plain ,the way Martin Sheen and Leonardo played them.Tom Hanks looked like a stupid who could not capture a victim who is right in front of him like four times.Can you imagine that FBI would act like that and let the guy run around like that??? Leonardo, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner were more concerned about what they are wearing and how they look rather than getting into depths of these wonderful characters. It was not a comedy as I read the script and Spielberg could not get the script and just made it a plain movie .Give this film to British directors and actors and see what a wonderful classic film they will make out of it.</fullReview>
