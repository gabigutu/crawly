		<shortDescription>"How Do You Live?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a society known for freedom and justice, how is that justice truly measured and meted out? When an individual's very life hinges on a verdict of innocent or guilty, is there such a thing as an objective call? Or is a person's life subject to mere perception; a subjective evaluation of `facts' assimilated through a filter of bloated egos and personal agenda? All questions that many, perhaps, would prefer not to have answered, nor indeed, even asked at all. Those who are so secure in the absolutism of our justice system that they will willingly defer to the establishment in all matters, and with a clear conscience. The `system,' after all, is infallible; or at least good enough, isn't it? Good enough, that is, when it's being tested on `someone else.' But what if that glitch in the system becomes personal? What if `you' are the one who falls victim to a miscarriage of justice, and your voice becomes impotent, grinding your pleas into so much pulp beneath the wheels of a machine to which you are nothing more than another insignificant cog? It's a situation examined in the absorbing drama, `I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,' directed by Mervyn LeRoy, and starring Paul Muni.  James Allen (Muni) returns home from WWI to find his old job in a shoe factory awaiting him. But James is a changed man, with aspirations of doing something meaningful with his life; and he wants to put the experience he received in the Army-- in the Engineering Corps-- to use. He wants to build things-- bridges, roads-- useful things. And toward that end he sets out and scours the East Coast from north to south looking for work, but jobs are scarce. Finally, having taken to `walking the ties,' the rail leads him into St. Louis, just another out-of-work bum in the eyes of society. There he meets up with a guy named Pete (Preston Foster), who tells James he knows where they can get a hamburger as a hand-out. The trusting and somewhat naive James goes along, only to find himself on the wrong end of a stick-up gone bad.  From that point, the justice system moves swiftly, and James Allen finds himself sentenced to ten years at hard labor on a chain gang. His offense? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong guy. Based on the autobiographical story by Robert E. Burns, and written for the screen by Sheridan Gibney and Brown Holmes, LeRoy's riveting film is an inditement of the justice system-- specifically the brutality of the chain gangs-- but also of a society too smug and filled with self-righteousness to realize how fragile and tentative the freedoms we enjoy really are. America is the greatest country in the world-- a veritable bastion of freedom-- but those who would throw out their chests while holding up the Constitution, citing whichever amendment it is that suits their personal agenda, should be made to walk a mile in the shoes of Robert Burns/James Allen. Or for a start, be required to watch this film. Released in 1932, this film is devoid of the melodrama common to many films of this era, and instead presents the story in very realistic terms, the meaning of which is indisputable. Like Hitchcock's unnerving 1957 film, `The Wrong Man' (also based on a true story), this film is not only disconcerting, but down-right scary when you stop to consider the implications of it. It also evokes a sense of Kafka's `The Trial' (also made into a movie in 1963 by Orson Welles), but without the abstractedness; unlike `The Trial's' Joseph K., James Allen knows exactly what's happened to him and how. What he can't understand is `Why.' Nor would any rational man, betrayed by the very society in which he placed his implicit trust, understand. Paul Muni gives a dynamic, stirring performance as James Allen, capturing all of the confusion, exasperation, pain and anguish of his inexplicable situation, all of which you can see in his expression, in his eyes and in his body language and demeanor. You feel the darkness into which he is forced to descend, and with him you share that sense of hope fading away more with each passing day. From the tension of the moment when he first attempts to `Hang it on the limb,' to what is one of the most haunting endings ever filmed, you're right there, living it with him. It's a powerful, truly memorable performance by Muni. The supporting cast includes Helen Vinson (Helen), Noel Francis (Linda), Allen Jenkins (Barney), Berton Churchill (Judge), Edward Ellis (Bomber Wells), David Landau (Warden), Hale Hamilton (Rev. Robert Allen), Sally Blane (Alice), Louise Carter (Allen's Mother), James Bell (Red), William Le Maire (Texan), Edward Arnold (Lawyer) and Willard Robertson (Prison Commissioner). In no way does this film exaggerate the situation it depicts; it doesn't have to. In the end, `I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang' is a wake-up call of sorts, a warning to those who take personal freedom for granted or place too much trust in a flawed system mired in bureaucracy. That a film made in 1932 can still have such an impact today says more than enough about how good it is. And once you've seen it, you'll never forget that final, haunting scene, and James Allen's final words. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Facts For Fans Of This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the movie ends somewhat abruptly, I was interested in what happened to this character in real life, so I did some research. For those interested, read on:The man, whose real name was Burns, lived quite awhile in New Jersey, wrote the book with this same title, even smuggled himself into Los Angeles for two weeks to help with the movie, using an assumed name and acting very skittish. He then went back to New Jersey. The state of Georgia, home of these chain gangs, tried to extradite him but New Jersey wouldn't give him up.Regarding the film........"Powerful" was a word describing this movie when it came out over 70 years ago, and it still holds true today. It was based on a true story and if injustice bothers you, this film will be disturbing. It certainly was to me, at least the first time I saw it.I've seen it several times and am always mesmerized by Paul Muni's performance. Just the expressions on his face alone are fascinating. The other members of the cast are so-so, but it's Muni's movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took some courage to make this movie, and Warner Brothers was up to it. This is one of four such productions on the early 1930s that dealt with crime naturalistically. But the others -- "Public Enemy," "Little Caesar," and "Scarface" -- although investing the protagonists with recognizably human traits like jealousy or male bonding -- were nevertheless on the side of the state. Okay, he might love his Mamma, but he's still a menace to society. They all died violently in the end. Here, on the other hand, is a story in which the protagonist is completely innocent, guilty of nothing more than wanting to strike out on his own and accomplish something constructive after having been through hell in the army in World War I.The state -- Georgia -- convicts him in error. He was forced into participating in the crime by a stranger, although to be sure he acted guilty enough. And, what with the real James Allen acting as consultant, and the film being based on his autobiographical book, who can really tell how unwilling a participant he was? Still, the point of the movie is that even if were guilty of robbery, the punishment imposed by the state, the conditions at the chain gang, were inhuman. Let's say many sensible people would consider it "cruel and unusual." So Allen escapes the first time, just as Cool Hand Luke did. According to the movie he rises to prominence as a self-taught engineer, although, again, the point would remain the same even if he never rose above the station of busboy. Coerced into marriage by a domineering, greedy, and self-indulgent wife (whose autobiographical novel should have been a companion piece to Allen's), he finds himself falling for a "nice girl". But his past catches up with him. His wife betrays him out of spite. The governor of Illinois is understandably reluctant to extradite a prominent citizen who has shown how socially valuable he is, but the representatives of Georgia insist on a symbolic retribution. Return to Georgia voluntarily, says the soothing, expensive Georgian. There'll be only a token service of, say, 90 days in a cushy job, then you'll be pardoned. Alas, he's thrown into an even more horrific penal servitude and his hearing is suspended indefinitely. So he pulls Cool Hand Luke's Excape Number Two, right down to the admiring companion who jumps aboard the truck with him. This time there is no going back, at least not according to the movie. The final shot is heartbreaking. I don't know how much of this story can be believed insofar as Allen's character is concerned. Suppose you were to write an autobiography. Might you not come out looking a little better than you actually are? Oh, that God the giftie gie' us/ to see ourselves as others see us. But I believe the chain gang sequences allright. If Allen is fibbing about that, he's still done a good job of convincing me that these conditions were real. I've worked with Corrections Officers and while they might be tough and contemptuous towards inmates, they treated them fairly. But I can believe things were quite different in 1925 in Georgia. The South has an interesting way of dealing with deviance. Southerners tend to be polite, compassionate, and helpful. They go out of their way to be friendly -- until you break an important rule. Then you forfeit any claim to humane treatment. (You want to be executed? Murder somebody in Texas or Florida.) In the course of the 1960s, the state became as much of an enemy as the criminal himself -- maybe moreso. But this movie was released in 1932, a time at which it still took guts to depict a social system so thoroughly corrupt and sadistict.Catch this one, if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni comes back from the war (WWI) a hero. He's offered his old job back but declines it--he wants to make it on his own. He inadvetantly gets involved in a stickup and is (unjustly) sent to a chain gang for 9 years. The prisoners there are treated horribly--beaten by sadistic guards and forced to eat wretched food. After a few months Muni has had it. He escapes, changes his name, makes a living for himself and is very successful. But his past begins to catch up on him...A very early Warner Bros. social drama--and one of their best. It's pretty strong stuff. I remember originally seeing this on TV back in the 1970s and really being shocked by it. It's not graphic but what you hear is even worse then being shown it (the whippings in particular). It also shows a law system that doesn't give a damn about how they treat their prisoners. They should be treated like dirt--and are! The story moves quickly and Muni is just superb. This movie made him and you can see why. Also it has one of the most depressing endings I've ever seen in a motion picture. It hit me hard back in the 1970s and still works today. Muni's haunted face and the final line are harrowing. A true classic--a must-see.Be warned--some non-cable TV prints cut out the final line!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have an interesting point of view for you--I'm actually in favor of bringing back prison chain gangs/work camps (while at the same time being in favor of legalizing all consensual "crimes"), yet I think that I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a simply brilliant film. I mention my unusual view on corrections/institutional punishment to stress that one need not completely agree with the film's surface ideology to think that the film is a masterpiece. And that's as it should be. Films should be appreciated or not as artworks, not adopted or rejected as symbols of political or other views, as if films are campaigning for office and you are wearing a button.Still, this is a "social conscience" film and important as such. The story was adapted from the autobiography of Robert E. Burns, who ended up on a chain gang in Georgia after he stole less than $6 so that he could eat. Burns has been changed to James Allen (Paul Muni) and the chain gang was relocated in Louisiana (interestingly, Georgia officials still became incensed at Warner Brothers and issued what amounted to threats against studio executives and the artists behind this film).The film begins with James on a ship, in the military, on his way home from World War I. He returns as a war hero, decorated with a medal. Prior to joining the military, he had been working at a factory in his New Jersey hometown--a job he doesn't at all look forward to resuming. But when he arrives home, he discovers that his Reverend brother and his mother are expecting him to go back to the factory and not make waves. He obliges at first, but he really wants to become an engineer. Exasperated, he leaves home again, looking for work. Times are tough (remember that I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was made during the Great Depression in the U.S.) and James quickly moves from state to state trying to find and retain work.Things do not go so well. James ends up traveling along rail lines and staying in homeless shelters. At one, he hooks up with a man who says that he can mooch a couple of hamburgers for them from the owner of a diner. The mooching works, but the man suddenly pulls out a gun and initiates an armed robbery. James is forced into participating and gets caught, bringing him to prison. The first section of the film focuses on existence in the chain gang. Later, as one could surmise from the title, James becomes a fugitive, and the story becomes entrancingly complex as he tries to begin a new life. But difficulties keep arising.As he often did, director Mervyn LeRoy achieves a style that seems remarkably modern. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is extremely serious, but never approaches melodrama. Instead, it has a wonderfully gritty atmosphere that tends to be underplayed instead--there are similarities to more recent films that it probably influenced such as Don Siegel's Escape from Alcatraz (1979) and Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law (1986), both excellent in their own right.The plot is a bit sprawling in terms of the number of events, the number of years and the number of geographic locations covered, yet the screenplay, by Howard J. Green, Brown Holmes and Sheridan Gibney, is extremely tight and logical. Nothing is superfluous. The pacing is always right on target. LeRoy knows exactly when to dwell on a scene versus when to let months fly by with changing calendar pages. The cinematography is also very attractive. LeRoy includes a lot of subtly clever artistic touches such as symbolic continuity in his edits--for example, from a judge's gavel to a swinging sledgehammer on the chain gang.Muni is simply incredible. He's a perfect fit for the character. His performance makes the film extremely believable, even when the character makes some ill-advised choices. He seems as skilled at action as he is at drama (there are a few action sequences here in the modern sense of that genre term). I haven't seen many of Muni's films yet, but after seeing this one, I'm anxious to check them out. The rest of the cast is fine, but Muni receives 90-something percent of the screen time.In addition to the "indictment" of the chain gang system, LeRoy and his writers make the film a tragic parable of freedom versus regimentation. James is a freethinking individualist, almost in an Ayn Rand sense, who is constantly trapped in various conformist systems. The military is the first symbol of this, and so is the factory that James dreads going back to. His brother is a symbol of conservative systematization via religion. And of course, the chain gang is the most negative system in which James becomes entrapped. When James is the freest--when he's wandering from state to state--he's also the most disadvantaged in terms of societal norms. His eventual vocation in the film can be seen as a gradual climb towards existential authenticity, and his work is symbolic--he's not just literally building bridges, roads and such. Ironically, he was engaged in the same kind of work on the chain gang, and ultimately, James is not able to achieve the freedom/authenticity that he desires. It's as if the film is making the argument that extreme uniqueness entails marginalization as a fringe element in a way that's often actively negative. Of course, there are many other interpretations possible, but it's difficult to deny some of these messages.But, however analytical you want to get, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a must-see for any cinephile. The film is enjoyable on many different levels, and is far ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (Warner Brothers, 1932), expertly directed by Mervyn LeRoy, is one of those rare movies released during the early 1930s to really stand the test of time. Although not the very first film to deal with prison injustice and harsh conditions, this is probably the best of its kind. Based on the story by Robert Burns, a war veteran who twice escaped from a chain gang in Georgia, it seems likely that Warner Brothers would be the only movie studio willing to take risks dealing with a social protest story, but here it is. And while actors like Spencer Tracy or James Cagney might have taken up such a challenge for the role, playing it to conviction, as fate would have it, Paul Muni has turned out to be the best and only choice.The photoplay focuses on a World War Army veteran named James Allen (Paul Muni), who served his country, earning his medals and now respect of his small community. Regardless of being offered back his old job, he decides to find himself by drifting from state to state, job to job, until he finds something to his liking. Along the way, Jim innocently becomes involved in a robbery by a guy named Pete (Preston Foster). A shoot out occurs by the police, killing Pete and arresting Jim. Because the money was found on his person, the judge (Berton Churchill) sentences Jim to ten years of hard labor in a chain gang prison camp. Due to harsh conditions in a living hell, Jim makes a successful escape, becoming a model citizen over the years rising to the top of his profession in a construction firm, only to be betrayed by his gold-digging wife, Marie (Glenda Farrell) for wanting a divorce so he could marry Helen (Helen Vinson), a socialite. Because of his expose to the media, Jim finds he'll never be given his promised freedom after serving 90 days. He makes his second daring escape into the new world now hit by the Great Depression. In spite of his new found freedom, he finds he'll always be chained for life as a wanted fugitive.Not exactly a family oriented movie, "I Am a Fugitive" is a dark and very realistic drama told in documentary style with a touch of "film noir." It includes violence, though mostly taken place off screen, such as the flogging of the convicts who groan out their pain. Unlike other chain gang movies, this one doesn't feature punished convicts being placed in sweat boxes for long periods of time. While Paul Muni would achieve success in later years for his biographical dramas, winning an Academy Award as Best Actor for "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (Warners, 1936), his role as the doomed Jim Allen, victim of circumstance, is obviously his best and most remembered performance. What makes Muni so different from the other screen actors is that Muni doesn't just play a character, he BECOMES that character.Full of memorable scenes too numerous to mention, the one that stands out is the scene where Jim, after being brought back to the chain gang on a promise for parole and release within a year, is awaken from his bed by one of the guards to be told that his appeal has been denied and that he will have to serve out his original ten-year sentence. Hearing this, Jim, with unshaved face and looking fairly dirty, looks straight into the camera with tears slowly flowing through his eyes with the expression of disgust and betrayal, making fists with his hands before resting down his head on the pillow. As for the prison escapes, they are well staged, with the second escape more exciting than the first.Taking support in this hard-hitting drama are Louise Carter (Mrs. Allen); Sally Blane (Alice); Allen Jenkins (Barney, a fellow convict); Edward Ellis (Bomber Wells, Jim's cell-mate); David Landau (First Warden); Edward McNamara (Second Warden); Noel Francis (Linda, the lady of the evening who makes Jim's night's lodging "comfortable") and James Bell as the ill-fated convict who suffers from stomach pains. When the movie played on local television back in the 1960s and 70s, it was presented under a shorter title, "I Am a Fugitive," but when distributed to video cassette in the 1980s, its complete title was restored. Other than Paul Muni's Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his performance as Jim Allen, the movie was honored the Best Picture award, losing "Cavalcade" (Fox, 1933).After all these years, "I Am a Fugitive" remains a fast-pace man-on-the-run drama, which holds interest throughout its 93 minutes of screen time, and not so easily to forget once it is all over. With the chain gang system being virtually a thing of the past (younger viewers might ask, "What is a chain gang?"), the movie is a curious look back as to how prison conditions were like in the early part of the twentieth century, and how the judicial system has changed since then. "I Am a Fugitive" available on both VHS and DVD formats, has become a frequent revival on Turner Classic Movies. (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic AND a brave indictment. Excellent!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this is one of the finest films I have seen. Paul Muni's performance is so good, it's practically indescribable. I thought he was extremely believable as the unduly accused and convicted James Allen. This story will rip your heart out, and rightly so. The film is very well done in every way, down to the smallest detail (best example of this: the disgusting looking prison food ? if you can call it that). The use of newspaper headlines is extremely effective, as well as the very realistic scenes in the prison and work yard, and the whole environment in which Allen must live. The viewer can almost feel Allen's pain as the other inmate hammers away at his leg chains to give him a glimpse of hope toward freedom. However, even the scenes of Allen's life on the outside still evoke a sense of foreboding. This is a very powerful film.I saw it as part of the Essentials series on Turner Classic Movies, and Robert Osborne said that the real-life protagonist on whom this film is based acted as a consultant. Since he was still on the run, however, he was not credited. The whole situation is so sad, and this sadness and feeling of oppression hang over the film with such realism, that sometimes it is as though you are watching Allen's life caught on videotape, instead of a motion picture. It is extremely gripping and downbeat, with a killer ending. The fact that it's a true story just adds to the pervasive feeling of doom. Way ahead of its time, and a brave picture to make in its indictment of the justice system. WOW.TWO FAVORITE MOMENTS: 1) Allen looking directly at the policeman in the barbershop with a determined, steely glare, as if suddenly realizing that he will not be recognized, and simply defying the cop to recognize him. The barber doesn't recognize him either, even though the cop and barber have just been describing Allen. This scene, I am sure, meant to emphasize the incompetence of the police and justice system, without using any words to do so. Fantastically done. I am in awe.2) Chain gang inmate Barney Sykes (played by supreme character actor Allen Jenkins), finally released from jail, is offered a ride from the prison staff, who are carting the coffin of a dead inmate off the grounds. Very matter-of-factly, as though he has done this before (and thus demonstrating the de-humanizing effects of prison life) Sykes hops up onto the back of the truck and sits right on the coffin. Upon seeing this out the window, the other inmates ruminate on the fact that there are only two ways to leave the chain gang ? `get let out, or die out.'I will not give the ending away, but if it doesn't move you to tears, I don't know what will. Haunting.My ONLY (minor) problem with the film is that all of the ladies in Allen's life look so similar, I could barely tell them apart!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely powerhouse film, possibly the finest of the early sound era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is possibly the finest film of the early sound era. Considering how filmmakers weren't adapt yet to the new medium, its impressive how this film seems to be devoid of much of the awkwardness that usually plagues films from this time. There isn't too much music, but it doesn't slow down the pace or distract the viewer. Also, Mervyn LeRoy's workman direction is quite adequate. Between "Little Caesar" and this, he seemed to become much more comfortable with the new sound medium.While some of the supporting acting is a bit campy (I realize how many modern viewers don't enjoy pre-method acting), Paul Muni delivers a subdued and absolutely powerhouse performance. Its a shame he never became a bigger star, because as far as I'm concerned he's just as fine as Clark Gable or Gary Cooper. Also, the social message of this film was far ahead of its time in decrying what was a government institution. This was a very progressive film. In addition to the historical significance, the film is just as powerful as when it was initially released. In particular, the ending is a complete knockout (one of the finest closing lines ever for a film). Thankfully, this was made before the Hayes Code, so it includes some interesting (and realistic) depictions of sex. This deserves a ten the whole way, a rating I don't often hand out.

		<fullReview>Being a man who has a very unhealthy penchant for any film that deals with incarceration, it is with great elation that I can proudly proclaim this to be one of the greatest films of the genre. I had to finally give way and import the film on Region 1 to see what I was missing, boy it was joyous to see how this film has influenced some of my favourite film's of all time.This is one tough movie, it pulls no punches and the only surprise is that it was made in 1932, that the film is a grizzled masterpiece is down to the astute direction of Mervyn LeRoy and a quite brilliant performance from Paul Muni in the lead role of James Allen. Based on the real life writings of Robert Elliot Burns, the film is a harsh kick in the guts about the brutal penal system that existed when most of us were mere glints in our Father's eyes. It is part of a Warner Brothers controversial classic's box set that is available on Region 1, and its place on any controversial classic list is worthy.The film had major impact on reviews of the penal system, it caused uproar in Georgia (the film never mentions Georgia, but they knew it was about them), law suits followed and Robert Elliot Burns himself was constantly pursued by the authorities despite the state being privy to the actual facts of his case. I wont be boorish with the details as it is well documented across the net and those who haven't seen the film really need to address that issue! I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang strips it down to a primal story that begs a viewing from anyone interested in the genre-or actually for those interested in brilliant cinema from a golden era. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's chain gang movie from 1932 starring Paul Muni ruffled feathers on its initial appearance, and still packs a considerable punch when viewed today.James Allen is implicated in a robbery and is sentenced to hard labour - seeking justice and the ability to clear his name he escapes from the brutality of the prison regime and sets up a new life (as Allen James, not that much of a name change really). The new Allen is a man of influence and importance, who does good for his community. The State still wants revenge though and when he is betrayed, his life really goes pear-shaped.A sharp and perceptive script is the greatest strength of this drama, plus Paul Muni's exceptional performance in the lead during the different situations faced by his character. Glenda Farrell also makes an impression, but it is probably the last sequence you'll remember the longest, as a desperate Muni fades into the shadows and a lifetime on the edge of society. A heavy verdict indeed on American justice of the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just finished watching this film for the first time and I am not ashamed to admit I almost cried. What an understated epic this is, with full credit to the cast - the piece is carried by Muni as James Allen/Allen James. A war hero looking to re-adjust,he takes a hit for a blundered robbery, suffering injustice at a Southern chain gang, breaking free, making his mark as a model citizen and true American, only to suffer the ultimate humiliation. This exposes not only the system, but also the perfidity of fellow human beings. I have read the other reviews here and have absolute respect for them all. To my mind, the thread of simmering injustice, which finally comes to fruition through blantant reluctance,ignorance and fear within a twisted federal administration, leaves the viewer feeling "this must never happen again - in any modern format". For this reason, the film works, as I defy anyone to claim it does not promote a reaction.The final scene does have a 'film-noir' quality about it - I gather the lighting engineer faded the set in error, but the parting shot was kept in regardless - and as the truly dark side envelopes James Allen and the credits roll, you are left gasping "Christ! what will happen to him now?"The American film industry - the worlds greatest (true praise from an Englishman).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Really Made Him A Criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni's performance in Scarface led him to a long term contract with Warner Brothers and his first film with them was another classic. Unlike Scarface where Muni becomes a gangland boss, he's led almost by accident into a life of crime.Restless since his service in the World War, Muni leaves his factory job to see the world. On the bum, he gets accidentally drawn into a holdup of a greasy spoon diner by another tramp, Preston Foster. Foster is killed and Muni is left with the rap for a grand total of about $5.00 and change. Today that would be about $35.00 to $40.00 all told.No first offender status in this state and no one to speak earnestly for him, he gets a 10 year stretch for that holdup. Here's where the themes of I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang come into play. The brutal and callous treatment of the prisoners had never been shown so graphically on the screen before, although at RKO they were doing a film with the same themes in Hell's Highway at the same time.Muni got an Oscar nomination for playing James Allen in this film, but lost to Charles Laughton for The Private Lives of Henry VIII. Still he gives a riveting performance as a man truly a victim of forces he cannot comprehend. Overshadowed by Muni and sometimes overlooked unfortunately is Glenda Farrell. She plays a trampy dame with a heart of pure brass who latches on to Muni who marries her when she discovers he's a fugitive, then turns him in when he tries to throw her out. Her part as Muni's unfaithful wife may just have been her career role.Even though the film is black and white, the fashions are old, prison themes whether it's this one, Brubaker, or The Shawshank Redemption usually have a lot of the same themes and are eternal. This one is a deserved classic and should never be missed when televised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Man, What a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could watch "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" a thousand times and still be seized with suspense and anxiety during both of James Allen's escape attempts. The story of a man wronged by injustice, a man who gave his youth for his country, his past to his future, and his mind over to civil engineering. Forced at gunpoint to hold up a diner, he is summarily sentenced to 10 years hard labor- on the chain gang. If you have a soul, this movie will move you. You would have to be heartless not to get angry, whether during the scene where the warden causes the death of a sick inmate, when Allen is betrayed for the first and second times by the prison board, when he's betrayed by his loveless wife. It's a movie that draws out involuntary emotions. Strong emotions.You might just find yourself yelling at the screen, "It's not fair!" I noticed that Paul Muni, toward the beginning, is to a T the prototype of James Dean and Marlon Brando. He epitomizes the frustration of youth as he tells his mother and brother he doesn't want a factory job anymore. He wants to build. He descends into abysmal poverty. He gets caught and thrown on the chain gang. He slaves away before a black prisoner helps him escape. See how progressive this movie is? The guards are white; the saintly inmates are black. He builds a new life for himself from scratch, on only his wits and skill. He's caught again just as he's found himself a woman he really loves. Allen is a tragic figure- his tragic flaw is only his willingness to believe in the American criminal justice system.The title says it all. It's not "I WAS a Fugitive..." because he never gets away or is permanently caught. Like Al Roberts in "Detour," he flees forever. Parts of the movie are almost nihilistic, as he gets stuck on the chain gang for guys who were too tough for the chain gang. Prisoners cry, "I don't care whether I live or die! What are you gonna do, kill me?" The chain gang breaks a man. It destroys his spirit until he's just a hollow shell that works until it can no longer and then gives out, dies. All with stark B&amp;W cinematography to match the depletion of humanity, the draining of life from the individual and from the nation.This, along with "Scarface," is Muni's tour de force. He is eternally sympathetic, and we are eternally in chains with him. Stone walls may not a prison make, but when you're on the chain gang long enough, you clearly become stuck in an imprisoned mind frame. As everyone has commented, the ending is one of the greatest of all film endings. This surprising vision of Allen, more a rat than a man, leaping out of the darkness after his final heroic escape, obviously no longer a hero. In the sparse light we get, we see his emaciated and hardened face. He shakes his head when this woman, whose only thought is for him, asks if he'll need money or if he'll come see her. He backs out of the scene, clearly afraid that somebody's traced him there and will have him back on the chain gang in an instant, always running running running, and then she calls out to him like any normal lover would, "How do you live?" But his answer is not that of a lover. His answer is not that of a man. Nor of an innocent man, nor of a hero. We don't know what he is."I steal," he hisses in a ghoulish voice whose echoes linger in our ears long after the scene fades and out and THE END rolls with the Warner Bros. logo. "I steal," and we are forever haunted, cursed with this vision of what an innocent man can become. A fugitive. I shiver every time I think of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Socially Critical Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a stunning journey into the life of the wrongly convicted. The main characters portrayal of the emotions of someone who has done nothing wrong and must suffer the short end of a corrupt system is breathtaking. I find it amazing that this movie comes from the era that it did. It was very socially critical, aware and sought to bring to the publics attention the very things which they were trying to ignore. The camera work in this movie alone makes it worth watching. The camera adds a very cool effect in the action scenes (i.e. the car chase at the end) and a very somber effect in the scene of hopelessness. I found the use of silence in this film to be quite amazing as well. The scene where the main character is getting whipped and the music drops out and all you can hear is the sound of the whip striking and the painful breaths of the wrongly accused adds a stunning effect and truly heightens the feeling of cruelty and hopelessness that the audience feels. The plot of the movie was very well done and takes you on an incredible journey from hope, to despair, from rags to riches and back again. I find it very interesting that the characters motivation to be truly great and not just settle back into the normalcy of his life before he fought in the war was what, by an unfortunate turn of events led him to the very bottom of the social ladder. I find that this is a very accurate representation of how in American life, even to this day, trying to be more than people expect of you and break away from the norm to forge your own path is looked down upon and often punished despite the 'American Dream' of individuality and independence. The scene that I found the most moving in this film was the very last scene where the main characters fades into the darkness and all you can hear is him exclaiming 'I steal.' The irony that an honest man who up until then had never committed a dishonest act and was driven by the very system which was supposed to correct improper behavior to committing crimes in order to survive was truly emotionally cutting. I think that this film, besides being an amazing tale of woe and fortune was very important in its time for exposing the corruption of the chain gang system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Boy. I'd take Mr. Hamburger by the hand and say, "Pal, I haven't seen you for a long, long time." and with that line begins one of the darkest most refreshing moments in cinema history. This film is like a film that I haven't seen in a long long time, it's not a happy story or even a sad story, it's portrayed and shot in such a way that it's a story dipped in grit, reality, dirt and dust, a film where our hero loses at the game of life, he loses his love, his passion, his profession, his peace of mind and better yet we don't see how that turns out for him. The films portrayal of law and order is surprising especially for its time, I was truly frightened by the faces of the judges and sound of the chains and the hounds chasing our fugitive, about the fragility of any one mans peace in society, the viciousness and perhaps even the lasciviousness of certain women, the film oh how wonderfully it topples the notion of our old boy coming back home from the war, finding love and finding a job and making pa and pa proud and happy. Paul Muni's acting is superb as well especially his awkwardness at the train station when he's greeted by family and friends and his face of anarchy at the dinner table later that night and let us not forget the look of misery and finally utter deep desperation at the end all of which he acts out so skillfully. The ending and its final lines pack a wallop and is one of the best endings I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Social Injustice!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Little Caesar" director Mervyn LeRoy's riveting pre-Code prison melodrama "I Am A Fugitive from A Chain Gang," protagonist James Allen's appetite for a hamburger lands him in the worst place on earth?a southern chain gang?because his hunger prompted him to participate as an accomplice in the robbery of a short-order restaurant that yielded only five dollars! Scenarists Sheridan Gibney, Howard J. Green and Brown Holmes derived their sizzling screenplay from Robert E. Burns' autobiographical account of life on a Georgia Prison chain gang. Indeed, the author remained at large while Warner Brothers Studios produced this landmark film about social injustice that gave Georgia a black eye. Actually, the title of the Burns autobiography carried the name of the state where he served time.Paul Muni was ideally cast as Robert Burns, and he makes a highly sympathetic hero who pays the price for his split-second lack of poor judgment that sent him to jail. Allen was one of the thousands of troops that survived the First World War to return home a changed man. He tells his priest and his family that he does not want to go back to his old factory job, even after his boss meets him at the railroad station and gives him his job back. Instead, Allen wants to go into construction, but the market for construction workers is extremely tight and our hero finds himself moving from one job to another until he meets a shady character in a flophouse. "I Am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang" qualified as one of the earliest films to expose the legitimacy of the United States legal system. Indeed, as TIME magazine reported in 1932, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy sued Warner Brothers Pictures Inc. and Vitaphone Corporation for $1,000,000 each for "vicious, untrue and false attacks" in movie. In the film, Burns breaks out of prison and heads north to Chicago. Five years later he has made quite a name for himself as a respectable business man in a bridge-building firm. Bridge-building itself serves as a metaphor in this instance.Things sour when a dame, Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell of "Gold Diggers of 1935"), discovers his closely guarded secret. Marie blackmails him into marriage, but he falls in love with another woman (Helen Vinson of "They Call It Sin") and begs for a divorce. Ultimately, he is shipped back to Georgia. During his first stint on the chain gang, Allen learns to keep his trap shut when he gets whipped for calling the chain gang warden a skunk for wanting whip a man who is nearly dead from exhaustion. When Allen brings up the idea of escape, the convicts tell him the slang phrase for it is "hanging it on the wire." They explain that anybody who breaks out has to contend with three things: first, the chains, second, the bloodhounds, and third, guards who would rather bring you back dead rather than alive. Later, he entreats the African-American inmate to smash his ankle chains to loosen them so he can eventually slip out of them. Among many memorable scenes is the barbershop scene. While the barber is shaving Allen, a policeman enters the shop and describes James Allen to the barber. Allen demands a hot towel to cover his face. As he is leaving the shop later and trying to hide his face from the cop, the barber inquires if the shave were close enough. "Plenty," replies Allen and vanishes into the evening. The ending is a corker."I Am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is one of the greatest social problem movies to ever illuminate the silver screen. The film received nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Muni, and best sound. According to All Movie, "the publication of Burns' book led to the abolishment of that system and an erasure of Burns' sentence." A film not to be missed. The Burns autobiography was later remade in 1987 as an HBO telefeature: "The Man Who Broke A 1000 Chains" with Val Kilmer playing Burns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heady, Fast, Social Justice without the Justice--Muni is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932)Heady, Fast, Social Justice without the Justice--Muni is brilliantFilmed a year after Howard Hawks's Scarface (also released 1932), I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang shows the other half of Paul Muni's brilliance. There is no question that both films are masterpieces of their type, with Mervyn LeRoy pulling together a lot of periods and kinds of milieu into a coherent and fast narrative for the later one. But I think both films owe their critical success to Muni's presence on screen, a true Brando or Gable kind of figure with a short list of films to show for his abilities. Watch these both. If Scarface is more dazzling (almost to the point of being dazzling for its own sake), I Am a Fugitive is more moving, and Muni makes us really feel for his situation, or series of situations, as the film proceeds.The story is based on an autobiographical book written by Robert E. Burns, a man in prison at the time of filming, and one sign of the success of LeRoy and Muni combined is that Burns managed to be released in the film's wake. And to some extent that was the goal of the film--not just the fate of Burns, but the public awareness of the cruelty of parts of the American justice system. There are no secrets about the agenda--it is announced in large type at the start of the movie--but it worked. And works to this day. Of course, O Brother Where Art Thou (2000) owes a lot to this movie, but the humor in the original is incidental, or meant to give life to the characters, not as a way of making the film especially funny. The drumbeat of horrors makes laughing very temporary, and the social realism strikes me, 70 years later, as more or less real.Jaded (and brilliant) critics like Pauline Kael might refer to this kind of socially concerned film as "naive," but the movie strikes me as necessarily simple rather than blind or stupid in any sense. And it isn't that watching it is simple--there is so much going on, a lot of characters (including as series of women who come and go with surprising rapidity). It's more that the point is simple--chain gangs are cruel. And not unusual, back then. On the level of film-making, the film is sophisticated, rising above its message if necessary.There is one last element worth mentioning, and that has to do with it being made two years before the Hays code got modified and enforced to its famous repressive heights. This allowed the key, amazing, beautiful ending to survive into the theaters. If you haven't seen it I can say no more, but it's the kind of ending that the censors would have abolished, along with some of the rest of the movie, for its frank violence, its suggestion of sexual indecency, etc. So for another great example of "pre-code" brilliance, look here. A masterpiece for its time, and for ours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" I'm not a fugitive from the Law, but from injustice "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America has always prided itself on its just laws and it's sense of fairness. However, there are some segments of the country where law and justice, like money, have failed to trickle down into the general public. In some states, the legal system is as harsh and unforgiving as the crime itself. As a consequence, many heartless authorities believe the more brutal a punishment, the more justice is dispense. Indeed, the Southern states, established so sever a retribution on its criminals they became the focus of this accusatory film. The story is taken from the actual exploits of Robert Burns (Paul Muni) who finds himself convicted of the theft of $5.50 and sentenced to ten years Hard Labor. It's bad enough to be sent to a prison, but he's also sentenced to dehumanizing, torturous treatment. The bestial and barbaric practices drive him to dare an escape. Using ingenuity and daring, he makes for Chicago where he does well and soon climbs the ladder of success. Years later, he is discovered and threatened with a return. The Governor and many citizens sponsor his safety. However, using an old legal trick, the prison authorities convince Burns to return with a promise of release in a few months. Trusting them he voluntarily returns. However Burns learns he is not to be released as promised. The stripes, the Ball and Chain await him and upon learning of the deception, plots again to escape but the guards are waiting for him to try. A magnificent Black and White film and one which has established itself as a true Classic ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a native Georgian, I can relate to the horror that the Prisoner From a Chain Gang experiences. Although I left Atlanta, Georgia around thirty years ago, I can still recall the wanton cruelty and excessive violence towards both poor whites, middle class whites, and Negroes by the Georgia State Police, the Atlanta Police Department, and the Marietta Police. I can only imagine, by way of this horrifying film, just how awful things were back in the Thirty's, inside the Talmadge dominated Georgia prisons, with prison guards whipping and beating, and even killing prisoners,for little or no reason. It is too bad that so many Americans are insulated from the horror of the American penal system that they no longer understand just how destructive any prison sentence can be for their children and friends, or their friends children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Social Realism at Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Allen returns from WWI a changed man. He's not physically or psychologically injured, quite the opposite, he's inspired by his experience with the Army engineers. James feels he has found his calling. Unfortunately his family expects him to reenter civilian life as he left it, at a menial clerk's job at the local factory. James gives it a try, but it's now unbearable. So he abandons his disapproving family, girlfriend, and employer, and sets off for the South to break into the construction trades. But things don't work out as he hoped, there is no steady work, and soon he befriends the wrong person and ends up railroaded for a crime he didn't commit. He's given a long sentence on a chain gang. Released in the autumn of 1932, I Am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang exposes the inhumanity of the chain gang system. What now seems like a practice from the Dark Ages, chain gangs were still in common use in the early 1930s, especially in the South. The degradations of the system are given a human face in this excellent film.The movie has many plot twists that would seem completely at home in a contemporary noir film. Nominated for both best picture and best actor (Paul Muni in his portrayal of James Allen), the movie has aged well. It goes to show you that back in the 1930s some movies were not pulling their punches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp commentary of the conservative, egotistical ideology of the United States</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, this review contains criticism on the United States of America, reader discretion is advised.Firstly, the film is well made. On the one hand it starts out slow and some of the acting is sketchy, especially the mother and the reverend brother. Were I more optimistically inclined I would say his portrayal was religious satire, but being realistic, I exclude this point of view; it is hard enough to find religious satire in contemporary Hollywood productions, accordingly the presence of it in Hollywood in 1931 is highly unlikely. On the other hand the technical aspects are great for a production of its time, namely apt use of camera movement and good sound editing for such an early 'talky'.The film is commendable to any viewer who wants to explore the golden age of Hollywood, the early spoken films and the start of the prison genre.Now my take on the content of the film, which as previously stated contains some criticism on the ideology and working of the United States, in particular the 'Bible belt' states. The southern states, having lost their right to hold slaves after the ending of the civil war (which did not mean the slavery system was abolished in all forms in the years following the death of Abraham Lincoln), have found a new, just as profitable, way to exploit human beings. This is the only description I can give to the system of the chain gangs.The scene which conflicted most with my sense of justice was the defense of said chain gang system; a desecration of human rights and glorification of egotistical capitalism. How can a land be 'of the free' if capitalism is more important than individual rights; the effect of the economisation of all aspects of society, while also pretending Adam Smith was right about the free market (the economical crisis of 2008 proved otherwise, as did the one in 1973 and 1929). 'Land of the brave'? Yes, I can definitely see the people who opted to stay in the United States as brave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard-Hitting Social Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Allen (Paul Muni), a decorated American Sergeant in the First World War, decides he does not want to return to his pre-war job as a shipping clerk. From a window above his desk he can see a bridge being built, which fires his imagination as he had formerly served in the US Army Corps of Engineers. He decides to leave his small New Jersey town to explore a position in engineering. But if there were a post-war economic boom, it doesn't find Allen, who cannot hit upon permanent employ despite moving throughout the Northeast and Midwest. The situation is so bleak that the veteran cannot even sell his war medal to a pawn shop, which has many. Allen ends up in the Deep South. In a flophouse he meets Pete (Preston S. Foster), who tells him he knows a diner where he can freeload a hamburger. After the meal and without Allen's knowledge, Pete pulls out a pistol and sticks up the counter man and forces Allen to pick up the five dollar "take." Nearby cops rush in and shoot Pete to death and arrest the bewildered Allen. The hapless man gets ten years hard labor in a chain gang (Georgia), where he is harshly treated and poorly fed. Like other prisoners, he works long hours and is even shackled to his meager bed at night. After a year Allen, helped by another prisoner, engineers an exciting escape through the woods with bloodhounds in close pursuit. He changes his name to Allen James and heads north to Chicago, where he finds meaningful employment as an engineer in a construction firm. Building roads and bridges, he rises up the corporate ladder. Unfortunately for Allen, he meets wicked woman Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell), who recognizes his ability to earn a good salary. Reading his mail, Marie discovers Allen's past as a convict. Although they marry, the two are not a good match, and Marie is even promiscuous. Later Allen tells Marie he wishes to leave her for Helen (Helen Vinson), a society lady who is a good match. Of course Marie squeals to the authorities. But as Allen is a good citizen, the state of Illinois does not want to extradite him to Georgia. Besides as he has already been "rehabilitated," why send him back him to prison? After a federal controversy, a southern representative arrives at Chicago and convinces Allen to volunteer to be extradited to Georgia where he will supposedly be paroled after serving just 90 days on easy duty. If this settlement looks too good to be true, well it is. The Georgia authorities renege on their promise, and Allen is back in a chain gang.Allen again escapes dramatically, this time driving a dump truck (with the body in the up position), and ironically dynamiting a bridge. This last action destroys Allen's chance of returning to respectability, however. He is free, but is also on the run. At the end Helen asks him, "How do you live?" Allen replies, "I steal!"This powerful drama exposes the brutalities of the chain gang system. It features crisp dialog, realistic scenes, and such tight pacing that over a dozen years of Allen's life is covered in 92 minutes. As the perplexed Allen, Muni was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, losing out to Charles Laughton ("The Private Life of Henry VIII"). Muni, born at Lemberg in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, did win the Oscar in 1936 ("The Story of Louis Pasteur"). "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" was based on a true story and subsequent book by Robert Elliott Burns, who in real life did receive a pardon of sorts in Georgia: a commuted sentence and restored civil rights. Note that Burns did really steal the $5.29 in order to eat; he died at age 63 in 1955. Because of the book and film, many Southern chain gangs were abolished. In 1987, another similar movie was made with Val Kilmer, "The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great example of injustice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a great movie that shows the injustice that can happen in the world no matter how fair we try to make the justice system. It just shows that sometimes innocent people get convicted and the court system doesn't always catch it. Paul Muni did a great job as the main character, James Allen, who was a return soldier from WW1 who wanted to live to be more than some guy who worked in an office of a factory. Even though times were hard and many didn't understand why he would give up his secure job to search for a fantasy job of building things, he still persevered and traveled around finding little jobs to help him get to the next one. Being wrongly convicted of a robbery he was sent to work in a chain gang. The movie really shows the cruelty and horror of being wrongly convicted but also of what really happened in the chain gangs. You had to even ask for permission to wipe the sweat off your forehead or else you would get beat. Or even at a person the wrong way could cause you to get whipped. These things really did happen and Hollywood did a great of revealing it, especially since the movie was based on a true story. I have to say that the cinema photographer did an amazing job in this movie. There were really some great shots, such as the scene were James get whipped, just how you never see him actually get whipped but instead you as shown the shadows of what is happening and the reactions of his fellow chain gang members. The moral of the movie is great as well with the fact that a member of the chain gang can escape from prison and make a name for himself as a well respected individual in the community.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is one of those movies that really made me mad. Not because it's a bad movie, but because it's a very good movie. This movie really pulls you into the story, so that when something bad or unfair happens, you feel like it's happening to you. There are many instances in this film where you just want to jump into the screen and change things around so they'll work out for the better. But if everything worked out for the better, I don't think this movie would be as effective. This is a movie that really puts you into the environment. Most of the film has this very dark, claustrophobic feel to it, and it really gets under your skin. Whenever there's a prison scene, and they show how much time has passed (through a shot of a calendar passing through the months), you feel it. Another thing that makes this film so effective is the sound. For an early talkie, this movie really goes all out. With a soundtrack of gunfire, explosions, smashing rocks, rattling chains, and moving vehicles, it really makes the movie much more effective. Even the moments with no sound are very effective, because it gives the audience a chance to breathe and take everything in. "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is one of those movies that shows us a very painful reality. A reality that is very cruel, and sometimes very unfair to the innocent. By the end of the movie, you might be very mad, but in a good way. Being mad is a good sign, because it shows how engaging this movie really is. This movie is amazing from beginning to end. It may be dark and unfair sometimes, but so is reality.</fullReview>

The photography was excellent; the shading and how smooth the movie was really made it enjoyable because I figured the film would be shaky and grainy like most older films but it's not at all. They could re-release this film in 2012 and not do a thing to it and it would be a box office hit, and honestly I don't see why not! The story line was one that had much thought put in to it; it was both entertaining and sad; the movie was meant to be what seems like a tear-jerker, and they really show it in the last few seconds of the film when the main character back away from what was his lover in to the darkness and tells her that she will never see him again.Overall I rated the film a ten and it gets a ten because I found it VERY entertaining and honestly it goes up in my list of my ten favorite movies of all the that includes such movies as Forrest Gump (which i personally believe to be the greatest film of all time).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond being a captivating tale with lots of chase scenes, action, and explosions, this movie also inspired social change and reforming of the prison systems. Paul Muni does a great job with his character and really seems to communicate his thoughts and feelings well to the audience, and you really do begin to connect with his sense of lost hopelessness and frustration. Cinematography was great especially during the fast paced scenes where James Allen attempts his escapes from prison. The ending scene is absolutely the best, it was just downright chilling. The story is told very fluently, which is a good job on the writers parts. Although, I did find his second attempt at prison escape (which involves dynamite) a little absurd and unrealistic and even though I loved the end scene, from what I've read, that is not entirely the truth to Mr. Robert Elliot Burns actual life story, and I was never a fan of directors changing stories "for the better of the film", however in this case it works really well. I also found the part where the chain workers raise their axes and sing about the hard work they do to be a bit strange, it made me think of Snow White's Seven Dwarfs. Despite these small contrivances, it's as real as a story can get, with all the raw brutality and harsh honesty, it will leave you almost speechless for a few moments after it's all over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muni's outstanding performance is reason enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pre-code era picture, "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a kind of film one could easily pass. For one, it is from the early 30s and two: many of us haven't really heard about Paul Muni or seen him on screen, have we! I saw Muni first in Scarface (1932) and then in this. And am I glad I saw this film, 'cause it was such sheer pleasure to see Muni perform in this gripping film about a man named James Allen (Muni) wrongly accused of committing a robbery.Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, this film is based on a true story, more specifically, Robert Elliott Burns's autobiography, 'I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang'. It tells a man's long struggle in prison after he is sentenced to ten years on a brutal Southern chain gang.I was surprised to see that in spite of being from the 30s, this film presents a very disturbing picture of the 'chain gang' prison life and the horrible way the prisoners are treated. And all the while your heart goes out to James Allen who suffers in silence but knows that he has to escape or die trying.The story moves on in an unpredictable fashion and keeps the viewer hooked. There are plenty of edge-of-the-seat moments and superbly executed scenes. Mentioning any here would take away all the fun, so I'll leave that to the viewer.Paul Muni delivers a breathtaking performance as James Allen. After watching this film I was convinced that he was one of the greatest actors to grace our planet. Sure, we all talk about Pacino, De Niro, Brando, etc. all great actors as we know them, but how many of us have explored the era that was..much before these legendary actors came into picture? Watch Paul Muni in this and you will know what I mean. What sincerity, what charisma! He is nothing short of brilliant! This dark and haunting film deserves to be watched and is one that shouldn't be missed by any connoisseur of quality cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Is This Civilisation? "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Brothers' approach to the Depression was to make tough, uncompromising urban crime films, and this movie is a perfect example of the genre. Based on a true story, "Fugitive" is a blistering indictment of the chain gang method of corrections, a system which prevailed well into the modern era (and which, in a modified form, is making a comeback in the 1990's). Mervyn Le Roy's powerful film lambasts the inhumanity of the chain gang: but it also does much more. It inveighs against a society which cannot save talented, hardworking citizens from falling into dereliction. Jim Allen returns from World War One as a hero. The sergeant who won the Belgian Croix de Guerre has had his psychological horizons broadened by his experiences in Europe. He worked as an engineer in the army, and now he would like to make civil engineering his career. His dull old job as a shipping clerk no longer satisfies him, but friends and family seem unable to comprehend that Jim has new needs and new ambitions.  Jim sets off from his home town in search of work which will make use of his human potential. In a good visual sequence, we see him being hired and fired on construction sites across the USA - Boston, New Orleans, Oshkosh, St. Louis.  But America fails Jim Allen. This enthusiastic, intelligent man can't find his niche, and the slide into destitution begins. Penniless and unshaven, Jim shuffles from one flophouse to the next. His self-respect evaporates and he is forced into the company of desperate, unscrupulous men. A bungled robbery is laid at Jim's door, and he finds himself sentenced to ten years' hard labour. And so begins his life in chains. He and the other prisoners are permanently fettered at the waist and ankles, and when they sleep a long running-chain is threaded through their shackles, tying them together and symbolically uniting them in their despair. Shots of the camp's tethered mules remind us that the men have been stripped of all human dignity and are no more than shambling beasts of burden. To tell any more would ruin the story, but it will suffice to say that Jim returns to the real world and re-establishes his entitlement to society's respect, without ever truly shaking free of his psychological shackles. He is unable to conduct meaningful relationships: Linda, Helen and Marie pass through his life, either unable to understand his internal misery or seeking to exploit his weakness. Paul Muni is great as Jim, portraying with unforgettable power one man's gradual loss of dignity and surrender to despair. In one hard-hitting scene, the wretched Jim tries to pawn his war medal, only to be shown a box of military decorations - every hobo in America has army baubles to offload, and these symbols of decent patriotism are too cheap even to hock. The final image, of Jim retreating into the shadows and yelling, "I steal!", is apparently one of those lucky miracles that sometimes improve on art. The scene was meant to be filmed in full floodlight, but an electrician accidentally broke a connection, causing the lighting to fade at just the right moment. The effect is remarkable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang", is a taut, well-acted drama that to this day packs a powerful message. It's sad that even after more than sixty years after its' initial release, we still don't know much about rehabilitation, or how to treat fellow human beings.Movies such as this or "Cool Hand Luke" or "The Defiant Ones" tell compelling stories about the criminal justice system, they show the system, warts and all, but they are excellent because they do not stereotype the criminals. They show them as real, flawed people.This film also had some strong sexual content, which was also daring for 1932.At the core of this film is an outstanding performance by Paul Muni. Largely a star of the stage, Muni was a strong film actor as well. The role of James Allen, is a demanding one (he's practically never off screen), and Muni handles it wonderfully. His scenes toward the end, while he awaits his pardon, are some of the strongest moments on film.A great movie, with a strong social message, and a superb central performance. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The use of sound is greatly used in this film, off-screen sound is impactful, and all notable sound in this film is symbolic or significant, for either audience feeling or for meaning. These sounds include bells, sounds of metal clanking, belts, etc. And the use of close-ups are also masterfully used. These close-ups are indicative of character feeling at crucial moments, keeping the viewer emotionally connected. And the use of music, adding to the overall feeling of each frame. This film was powerful enough to prompt mass social outrage, from feelings of sadness, disgust, and true anger...the emotive impact on social views and action in 1932 was enough to push legislation, and it isn't hard to see why. LeRoy couldn't have done better in the direction of this film, nor could Paul Muni have done a better job of acting in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni's performance in this is incredible. He carries himself with such pride and grace and keeps it together through everything he goes through in this movie, but still conveys that tortured under layer. I think its great when a movie can take a political stance and have a role in the changing of politics. Paul Muni's tortured performance is what really makes an audience feel for this character that was innocent and forced to make deals to try to get out from under the justice system. I also loved the story and development, the rise and fall of Paul Muni's character and the range of experiences he has creates an interesting movie that is able to captivate and keep you entertained and invested throughout the entire film. I fully enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creating criminals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fugitive from a chain gang, directed by Mervyn LeRoy, is a look at how corrupt, and barbaric chain gangs were back then, during world war I. Godfrey was an innocent man and was unjustly thrown into the chain gang as a criminal. So he escapes and creates quit a life for himself in Chicago and becomes a very great architect, that when they find out who he is and that he escaped the chain gang, people fight for him to stay. Godfrey willingly goes back to the chain gang because he is assured that he will be released after a certain time. When he is not he escapes again. So even when Godfrey does the right thing time and time again, the chain gang basically forced Godfrey to turn into a criminal, because he had to escape again. I think this is an issue we still have in jails today. Sometimes the criminal justice system turns you into a criminal before you do anything wrong. It was filmed very well, and was made shortly after sound came out in films, and so the producer added many different sounds you hear throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very well made and was surprisingly enjoyable for me to watch a second time. Both the first and the second time this movie gave me emotions all throw out it. There was tons of times that the movie had my heart racing wondering if the main character would be alright in the end or not. This movies main character played by Paul Muni was a very likable and well acted character who always had me rooting for him to be happy in the end. Most of the characters in this movie were likable or not likable depending on what kinda character they were trying to portray and well acted except for one in particular that I hated in this movie.Rev. Robert Allen played by Hale Hamilton was my least favorite character and thats saying it in a nice way. Every time this character was oh screen I cringed from the moment he started talking. The way Hamilton portrays this character is terrible in my option and I'm not sure if that is the way the film makers wanted him to be like but I absolutely hate it. It just takes me out of the movie and over all brings this movie down a little bit in quality in my option. Now I'm not saying I can do it any better because I am terrible at acting but if I was the director or the casting director I would have either told him to act differently or just casted someone else. I also do not know whether or not Hamilton was like this in all of his movie or if they picked him because they liked that character portrayed that way or not. I don't know if that is the case or not but regardless it is my only really major complaint about the movie. It has a very interesting way the story is told and a interesting ending. Over all I would definitely recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man attempts to escape from a chain gang when he is wrongfully imprisoned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may just be my favorite pre-1960 film. It was made around the time sound in films was first being introduced. It utilized it beautifully. In fact, this is a movie that would not have worked in a silent medium, in my opinion. Sound is used to convey many feelings throughout the movie. For example, the sound of the chains while in the chain gang never really fades completely for much time at all. This is meant to give the feeling of being trapped that the prisoners are experiencing (for me at least). The film also included a fair amount of dialogue that was incredibly well acted. The protagonist did a great job of coming across as someone who could be anyone...which is really the point of the film. Anyone can be falsely accused and sent into an unjust justice system. The films antagonist was the government, which gave the whole thing a very daunting feel, as this is not as tangible as antagonists generally are.</fullReview>

From James being sentenced to 10 years on the chain gang for being at the wrong place at the wrong time and the conditions that he was kept in caused him to break the law again and escape from his captivity. The irony of this is that he ends up living a successful and honest life and ends up being tricked by the justice system and then re sentenced to the chain gang for the rest of his life.

Paul Muni does a fantastic job as James Allen. When watching him play this major role, I had trouble remembering that he was only an actor and was not actually in this situation.

Throughout the film you see a man's struggle to be free, you see him wrongfully thrown in jail, then he escapes, and once he tries to cooperate with the authorities, after living in freedom for many years, the justice system tricks him and he's locked up for the rest of his life. This was just a really sad but entertaining movie, the acting was incredible and very believable (at least for that time period) and the message Be careful who you trust was very clear.

This really showed the harsh reality of the chain gang and made me wince at the horrors of the time. I was really invested in the plot with great effects like the loud cracks of whips and the excitement and panic if being chased by hounds. I also enjoyed how at the end of the movie he blew up a bridge, something he enjoyed building, in order to try and escape towards freedom.

So going out and becoming something had to have been a relief for viewers in the early 30. Knowing the risks and troubles that can come with doing something out of your normalcy yet still doing it no matter the cost can be a great underlining storyline. As the actual filming and acting go. For the most part, very solid. I believe that Paul Muni played by James Allen was a fabulous lead acting role. Real emotion and passion stuck out. As well as Marie Woods as Glenda Farrell. Really having almost solid technical ability when acting is not celebrated enough. Also very abstract camera work for the time of the filming. All in all a very solid project with little to complain about. And for a 21st-century child to enjoy it, that speaks highly of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's use of sound, in what may be the best film of the early sound era, is profound as well as haunting. During his time on the chain gang James Allen, played by Paul Muni, is brought into a back room and whipped for being discourteous to the guards. The loud crack of the whip followed by absolute silence by Allen elicit an enormous emotional response from viewers. Alternating shots of hammers hitting spikes and pages being ripped off of a calendar, each producing their own distinct sounds, are used as an inventive new way to show the passing of time. While the acting may come across as campy to viewers not used to pre-method acting, Muni puts on a master class. The film was also used to restructure the harsh penal system of the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The introduction of sound films in the late 1920s opened the door for many more possibilities in terms of storytelling. Also, it increased an actor's ability to portray a certain character.For example, on the first day of his job at the factory after returning from war, Paul Muni's character, James Allen hears explosions coming from bridge construction outside the building. When he jumps, it shows that he may be it may indicate that he is experiencing after effects of the war. Also the fact that he is so interested in this indicates that what he really wants to do is be in construction and create things, rather than working in the factory.Another excellent use of sound is when he escapes the chain gang, and he can hear the bloodhounds in the distance on his trail, but when he hides under the water they barking of the hounds becomes muffled or goes away completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I Steal"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a culturally and historically significant piece of film that highlighted the problem of injustice in its time. It also projects the story of James Allen in a relatable way that can be gauged to modern day. The "American Dream" of Allen's rise to prestige from nothing is conveyed as well as other lesser themes that can go unnoticed such as the struggles for returning veterans then and still today. The struggle to find a job and cope with the new world that a veteran returns too is briefly presented through James Allen's job hunt that only produces low paying odd jobs here and there across the country. Another relatable theme, or even clich, that is often seen in even today's cinema is the main characters strive to do something more with their lives rather than fall into the familiar role of a cookie cutter pencil pusher that outside influences pressure the protagonist to become. Our protagonist James Allen eventually reaches the Chain Gang system in the south which is where the movies main overarching theme is realized. The corruption, misconduct, and legitimacy within the system at the time was brilliantly questioned and exuded within the film to give the audience an overall sense of what the chain gang was like. Paul Muni was brilliant in his role and i found many of the other in-depth characters to be likable as well. The film is a great work of film that i found enjoyable in each and every scene, especially the scene with the chain gang singing while they work as well as the poignant scene at the end which encompasses the overall message or lesson and provides cinema with one of its famous closers "I Steal."</fullReview>

All of these elements combined into a beautiful film that was able to reach out to a lot of people in its time period as well as the people of today.

Paul Muni the actor can do no wrong and I have enjoyed his movies and different roles in his career. This is one of his best. Fascinating too is that this movie is based on a true story and a book actually written by the one who lived all through this. It boggles the mind that these things can come and capture a mans life leaving him no choice but to react best way he can. Highly &amp; strongly recommended for entertainment and educational purposes too. Keep in mind that those scenes about the chain gang were probably toned down a bit. The real life chain gang would be too horrible to portray accurately. Recommend a light snack, a tasty drink and a sugar high of some sort. Enjoy</fullReview>

However this was in all likelihood the only reason I continued watching. This may have been a very thrilling watch in 1932 but I personally don't feel that it stands the test of time very well.Overall the film is relatively dull from the beginning all the way into the very end but their are a couple of twists to this very basic story that you may not expect (I doubt it though).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was my first time seeing this film and it was great!! my favorite part in this film had to be when he escaped the first time and hid in the swamp and when they showed him under the water you could still here the dogs barking with no problem. as this movie goes on you can pick things out that would never happen again in this day an age but you can also see some of the same things that still happen till this very day.the sound that went along with this film fit in very well and was well thought out for their parts. some of this movie showed true fact on how a women can cheat a men but also shows how a man can cheat a women at the same time. i did not think i would like this movie as much as i did but i would definitely tell my friends about this film and would love to sit down again and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an exceptionally made film, with an exceptional actor as the main character. It is shocking to think that this film was made only a few years after the first "talkies" were made.This film really had the invisibility element that Hollywood is after. There was always a slight cliff hanger after every scene that made the audience want more. The actor portraying James Allen did an amazing job creating a character whom the audience was really rooting for, throughout the entirety of the film. The dialogue was also very important; especially because sound in movies was still fairly new. Most of the dialogue was explicit, making it very clear and obvious what was going on in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i actually really enjoyed this movie, it captured the themes of the times and human nature well. I don't understand why the dude had to suffer when he actually didn't do the robbing exactly, just stud by and let it happen. but i guess in those times its the same thing as the crime, and just as worthy of punishment. i like that it had a dark and very realistic style. it made the audience feel triumph and bitterness and and disappointment as the lead felt them. Paul Muni does his role so well we cant help but sympathize with him. Most especially when he returns to prison, and after a year his appeal is denied, he then turns and looks at the camera with tears on his face and defeat in his heart. just hit you right in the feels</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am a Fugitive from a chain gang Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang is a drama about a man who is wrongful persecuted and how he deals with his injustices. When I say drama, I mean drama. This is a very slow film from the beginning until the end. Aside from the speed on the film, other aspects were great. Such as the lighting, there was a great contrast of lights and darks. AS our main character moved from being imprisoned to gaining his freedom etc the film went to light to dark. I found the sound effects to be quite rich as well, for example the hard metallic sound from the chains of the prisoners. Although the pace of the film is dreadfully slow, the other aspects make up for it if you can get through the entirety of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni fantastically transforms on several accounts in this film. From war hero to vagabond to criminal to positive figure and so forth. His acting was amazing to watch and compelling to invest in. Muni comes across a bunch of different cardboard characters in the film too and they are also pretty important in helping transform Muni, for better or worse. The overall editing was incredibly well done too. The use of off screen digetic sounds of whipping parallel with the lack of sound coming from Muni is something I will never forget. But simply in the way time passing was shown was impressive. For every hammer hitting the a railroad spike an overlay shot of a calendar losing a month would pass to show how long Muni was in jail. Brilliant and perfect idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) is a great film. The acting in this film was really convincing and due to this alone the movie was able to hold my attention from start to finish. The plot was also captivating, it has something that any one could enjoy rather it be the crime aspect or the cute love story. With all of the plot aspects this film was still able to get its message across, that being the mistreatment of chain gang members. Well this movie was great on screen it was also great off screen, after its release the mistreatment of chain gang members become more relevant to the public and reform came soon after. Overall this film was captivating and influential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. I had very limited knowledge of the original gangster films, and this movie set a great precedent for the rest of the movies in this genre. I'll definitely be watching more of these! I loved how the sound was used in this film. In the first movie of the semester, the Circus, my ears went fuzzy from the lack of noise. But this movie is full of sounds, and they're not just there for the sake of it either. The only time this movie is completely silent was when the main character was underwater, which makes sense. I found I also enjoyed the social commentary of this film, as the brutality of the prison system then was portrayed amazingly. I especially loved the scene that explained the two ways to get out of the chain gang. All in all, great movie, and definitely my favorite out of the whole bunch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film before and did not expect it to be that good, I never expect old movies to be very good. This movie was the complete opposite.I never knew what a chain gang was but I do think that this movie did a great job of portraying one and how difficult, brutal, and physically demanding they are. The sounds of the alarms and whistles played a role because it's the sounds James Allen heard at war and the sounds he heard at the factory, his old job, and the sounds that he no longer wanted to hear. This essentially lead to James being sent to the chain gang. The sound was very effective in the scene when James Allen was being whipped, it was completely silent besides the whip. The camera panning over the speechless prisoners in this scene was very moving. The lighting largely contributed to the movie being so great, at the end especially. It was extremely moving when James Allen slowly moved into the darkness and disappeared never to be seen again.</fullReview>

It really shows how brutal and how horrible it is to be on a chain gang anywhere let alone the south. The fact it is based on a true story just seems to make it more and more interesting. A movie like this really shows a certain unsteady transition but interesting transition into movies with sound. This was personally one of my favorite movies I got to see for my class. Mostly because it Is so raw and it is so gritty. If you want to see a classic prison type movie this is the one you have to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great story about the injustice of America and states. James Allen is convicted and placed into a harsh chain gang camp where he makes an escape. This is powerful because before this, he just got out of the military and was only roaming the country to find his dream of being an engineer which wasn't going so hot. After he escaped the camp, he finally became the person he wanted to be- an engineer who has made something of himself. When he gets sent back to the gang, he escapes again, and is forced into hiding. This is the worst part of it all: he was sent to the camps wrongly twice, being forced to become someone who lives in the shadows. Stealing for a living, when that's what he was ironically convicted of originally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I have never heard of this film before. To be honest, I am extremely happy I watched it. The story as a whole was well put together. James Allen is a World War I veteran who returns home and is struggling to adjust to post war life. When he tells his family he is fed up with his tedious office job and wants to pursue a career in engineering, they freak out. When he ventures out into the world, he hits a rough patch and is wrongly accused of being a part of a bank robbery. Allen is sent to a chain gang. Up to now, you feel for Allen. You feel he is just at the wring place at the wrong time. He escapes the chain gang and flees to Chicago where he finally finds success, and more betrayal. His past is found out by a woman, Marie, and James is practically forced into marriage with fear of his secret being told. Helen wins James' heart, and when he asks Marie for a divorce so he can be with Helen, he is betrayed and sent back to jail. He escapes again, only to find Helen to tell her he is falling off the map. He then delivers what I consider to be a cinematic masterpiece, when asked by Helen how he'll survive he replies "I steal" while the viewer see's nothing but darkness. You can feel the betrayal from that one line. There is a strong lesson that I learned from this film, and that is to only trust yourself. It also warns that the justice system is not always correct. overall, I found this to be quite the powerful and enjoyable film.</fullReview>

The situation, the characters, the events and outcomes are all very realistic and I suppose that's because this movie is based on actual events and people. All of the acting, writing, and directing is done so well that the characters and their situations feel very realistic and more importantly relatable and understandable. The understanding and relatability of the characters is true today just as it was back when this film was made, which is one of the best things about this film. As a film representing and bringing to light the injustices in the prison system at the time and the inefficiency of the judicial system, having the audience really relate and understand what horrific ordeal the main character is going through helps get across the film's actual goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was a surprisingly (to me at least) good movie. For being an early generation talking movie, Director Mervyn LeRoy made me really feel for James Allen. Paul Muni's character goes from every high to every low possible. LeRoy builds a strong bond between James and the other inmates. The most powerful part for me was when James goes in for the whipping for speaking up for another inmate. When he is being whipped you can hear (and almost feel) the pain, however James remains silent. The camera pans across the faces of the others. This was an exceptional use of cinematography and sound. I was impressed by the car chase near the end. I would imagine at this time period in movies it wasn't quite as easy to set up the cameras. The choreography was very believable and well done. This film was an early representation of what movies, especially gangster flicks would amass to. I would be really surprised if in my lifetime this movie is not remade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a 1932 movie, this was very well done. It really was able to make you feel as though you were in that time period because it was so realistic. The acting was fantastic, all the prisoners really made the jail scenes uncomfortable to watch, and there were several emotions playing across the screen; it wasn't as if the actors were going through the motions. The lighting was excellent, it was never too dark where you had trouble seeing but the lighting for dramatic scenes really made a difference on how you watched and absorbed it. Another key affect of the movie was the sound. In a couple scenes, like the one where James is getting whipped with the belt, there's absolutely no sound of pain, just the whipping echoing of the walls. In this scene in particular, made a statement because it was trying to emphasize the fact that he wasn't making any noises of pain. In other scenes, these kind of affects were used to represent important foreshadowing, personality reference, and suspense. Overall, well done. The plot was creative and realistic with plenty of excellent affects and suspense.</fullReview>

His acting is very moving and it gives the audience a sense of sadness towards him. This motion picture is black and white, however it still has tons of thrilling moments and suspense. Allen's journey throughout the film, with his success and misfortune is what grabs the audiences interest. The conditions of the prison he was placed in defiantly brings feeling to the audience. This motion picture most defiantly was a way to reach out to the country and strike fear to those who wish to pursue crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is amazing. Nearly the whole way through, it feels unfair. Unfair that he can't get support to do what he wants to, then that he can't find a job, then that he is convicted for a very small lapse in judgment that I think many people in that position would make, the entirety of the conditions at the camp, the list goes on. It is most apparent at the end when he is forced to steal to live, or go back to the brutal conditions at the camp, where he would more then likely be killed "by accident," anyway.Put in his position, I think almost anyone would have felt very similarly to how James Allen felt.The only part of the film I didn't wholly like is the second escape. I think in relation to the rest of the film, it required more suspension of disbelief to watch. That's not to say it wasn't great, just that him being able to escape twice is pretty unlikely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one that I will remember, it's a new favorite. from the great work with sound to the lighting and setting choice. There were many memorable scenes that were created and let the whole movie flow so well. With the sound, the constant sound of chains gives not only the characters current setting, but also signifies the chains that hold him down during a high point in his life. It's constantly there as a reminder and creates a great metaphor (speaking of metaphors this movie has so many good ones, though some include spoilers). The other work with sound would be the absence of music, it was all raw sounds like pick axes, whips, cars, etc. and most powerful of all would be the absence of sound in one scene where the character finds himself submerged. The camera goes from him, total silence under water, to the loud noises above him on land, really great. Another notable bit would be the choice of lighting, one moment in particularity that will talk about: The very last scene (no spoilers) the choice of fading into black was so brilliant to show how life had come full circle almost, for the main character. It left so much irony and tension in the scene that you as the watcher was left shaking your head in pity for what a great man had become.</fullReview>

However, right after the first scene that catches your attention, you simply can not take your eyes off the screen. The dialogue is very well written and there are no random fillers of needless sentences in the script at all. The effects in the movie really make it what it is. Between the explosions of the dynamite and the screaming of the prisoner getting whipped, the sound effects really keep you on the edge of your seat. The hope and forgiveness you feel for the character while watching is what really catches you though.

		<shortDescription>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a movie of transitions. Muni's James Allen is taken through a veritable whirlwind throughout. At certain points, it almost seems as if every extended appearance by Muni on screen is only meant to introduce the next transition, into the next chapter of Allen's increasingly upsetting story. This pacing was off-putting for me, and at a couple of points, took me out of the story a bit. That said, the transitions this movie nearly relies on carry their weight.Not only do they serve their intended purpose, they also instill in the audience a senses of hope, dread, anxiety, and righteous anger as needed. In addition to accomplishing all these things, they tend to use the same or similar noises: transportation vehicles, construction tools, the labor that Allen's character wishes to make something of himself with. Hearing them throughout the movie as time passed, I felt each of the above things for Allen. The strange pseudo-montages and the noises that punctuated them (such as the ringing of the chain gang's morning bell following Allen's disdain of answering to the warehouse bell following the military horn)served as an unexpected moon of sorts to ebb and flow the tides of emotion that this movie carried.Several shots took me by surprise, including chase scenes and the underwater shot during Allen's initial escape. Though they were the types of things that are commonplace in today's film, I simply didn't expect them due to the release date. This was naive. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a cleverly shot and recorded film that can stand next to many released today. Between these technical aspects, decent or higher performances across the board, and the ethical conflicts that ring true still, this film is hard not to like, or at least appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", I would most definitely rate it at a 7.5 but IMDb doesn't have half ratings. On the other hand, I was constantly thrilled with this film, I always wanted James to stay away and escape the chain gang style of imprisonment. This film truly shows how bad the incarceration system was back in the early to mid 1900's. After seeing how poorly James and his fellow inmates were treated, really made me think of how being put into a living hell could be a motif of this film. Considering James was just recently in World War I, and soon enough sent to work on the chain gang twice. Something I didn't like about this film was that it was too predictable. I wasn't expecting James to live to the end of the film, but I was expecting him to not get a pardon from the governor. Overall I thought it wasn't bad for an early film but, there were some minor issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (1932) turns out to be one of the best movies of that era and its a darn classic. Set in stone. Not only its well made for this early times (with human touch Frank Capra would be proud of), immensely popular at the time of release and very important in changing public opinion about prison circumstances but its kind of grandfather of all prison movies. One of those old black &amp; white movies that still have power to glue you to a screen.Paul Muni was nominated for Academy Award for this role and he should have probably got it for his portrait of ordinary, decent man swept away in circumstances. He is truly perfect for this role, with his sensitive face and honest eyes, basically a good guy who upon returning home from war with his medals finds himself restless and changed - he rejects murderous routine and stability of his previous factory job and wants to get out and "find himself" (very modern notion for 1930s!) ending in really heroic but ultimately depressing and dangerous situations. Trough the movie, again and again he is rising up just to be brutally crushed down and its impossible not to root for him since he is really the only nice, positive character around. Circumstances in his prison are not so much different from some later Nazi camps and its all shown with a very strong, effective cinematography (audiences must have been shocked) - hence the real circumstances of story behind this script raised public uproar and the real guy who was inspiration for Paul Muni character (Robert Elliot Burns) eventually got pardoned.Its amazing when you realize almost everything in the movie actually happened - this is not just some fluffy Hollywood melodrama but re-creation of Burn's true life. Thanks to this movie chain gangs had been outlawed in Georgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a 1932 film that has many powerful elements in the story. There is the injustice of the criminal justice system, from policing to the court system to jail, to redemption after a fall from grace and honor. Based on Robert Elliot Burns' real life story, the cinematography, lighting, sets and scenery are all very realistic. The editing is also very compelling, and I found the use of various modes of transportation to show the passage of time to be quite effective. This technique also served to enhance the mise-en-scene of the film as it progressed to different points in the character life, both in his experiences but also the movement around the country over the course of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . did not end with Kunta Kinte's foot being shortened; nor did it begin with the killings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. As Paul Muni observes toward the end of I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A (GEORGIA = censored) CHAIN GANG, local government--Dixie style--constitutes the biggest pack of liars and sadists in North American history. For instance, few of us realize today that Blacks were legally Free Men in Texas until Davey Crockett died to re-enslave them, because Texas writes ALL of the K-12 U.S. history books! (Their motto: All the lies, all the time.) So it's par for the course that Muni's "Jim Allen" character gets framed for a petty crime by Dixie bigots who dislike his accent or haircut, and sent to an institution good for nothing except making hardened criminals out of previously law-abiding citizens. Adding to Jim's injury, every level of Dixiecrat government perjures itself to lengthen his torture. Today the CHAIN GANG states try to outdo each other in dragging out the executions of random poor people (usually the mentally ill or the developmentally stunted) for as many hours as possible. Now that it's harder for them to enjoy their cock fights, bear-baiting, dog fights, and other exercises in cultural sadism due to the American Humane Society, they've gleefully decided that torturing defenseless humans to death is the next best thing. Conditions have gotten far more brutal down there than in the Good Ol' CHAIN GANG days, and continue to worsen as each new generation seems more Soul-less than its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang truly captures the Gangster flick idea. While not a terrible guy, a merely a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time (according to the film anyway), this movie gave the audience a protagonist they wanted to root for. Although he is thought to be a criminal by the warden and some within the movie, James Allen (Paul Muni) shows time and again he is just a man of misfortune, and a poor marriage. It shows the injustice of the supposed "justice" system at the time and as one of the earlier sound films it is remarkable. For me personally, the final scene was one of the best, as Allen fades into the shadows and Helen asks him if he needs anymore, his response is "I steal." The man who started off as a victim was turned into a criminal by the very people who try to stop them. Wonderful movie and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a movie that will keep you on your toes.</fullReview>

Maybe I have a guilty conscience, but I also love the perfect explication of what it feels like to be constantly put upon and on the run. Or maybe I just relate to the humanity of the story. A bonus is the borderline ridiculous screen presence of Hale Hamilton as James Allen's forthright older brother. Who is that guy, and where did he disappear to? So funny and so devastating in equal measure. What else? This movie has one of the coolest endings ever, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far this has probably been my favorite movie from this decade. From the acting to what they were able to do as of special effects. I found the story to draw me in almost immediately, a man home from war in search of a place and job that could help further him and allow him to make something of himself. But a chain of events and bad luck ends him up in jail. There are many parts of the movie that have you on the edge of your seat because you get completely submerged into the film. Like the scene where he escapes from the chain gang, for the first time, and gets chased by the guards and their dogs. Also during this scene, there is a part where he hides underwater and the camera goes back and forth between him and the guards, absolutely silent when showing him underwater. I found this water scene to be very impressive for that time and the contrast between the silence and the dogs' barking to have a great effect on the scene. Other thrilling parts of this film are when he interacts with his landlord/wife and how you're not sure if she is going to turn him in. There were many parts that kept you captivated, but those were just a couple that really stood out to me. Other things I liked about the movie were the way they showed time and distance changing, along with the film's repeated use of irony. Overall, I found this to be a very well made film that was very entrancing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised how good this movie was. The director Mervyn Le Roy was able to bring humor to the serious issue of people being mistreated in chain gangs prior to the 1930's. Paul Muni is wrongly accused of theft in the beginning of the movie and thrown in a chain gang. When Paul first arrives to the chain gang you almost feel like you are right there with him. When he makes the first escape I found myself routing for him. When he does get free Paul's character goes back to a normal life assuming a different name he gets hired on to work on the railroad and quickly goes from a laborer to an architect. The irony in the movie was great. Paul wanted nothing more than to build bridges and the last scene is him blowing one up with dynamite. Even the title is ironic because Paul may have escaped the chain gain, but in reality his life on the run was still being dictated because of his time on the chain gang. I repeat great older movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this movie I felt some deja vu. It reminded me a lot of the movie "Life" with Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy. I can bet that it got a lot of influences from this movie. I liked it a lot. I think the main reason why i couldn't look away from the screen was because of this character who was a just genuinely honest and a really nice man kept getting in worse and worse situations. As soon as he thinks he has something going, something else stops him or makes him have to hide his identity. As a member of audience I kept watching because I just wanted to see everything be okay for this guy. As far as what it did technically, I enjoyed the the was they used sound. This was around the time they finally were able to add audio to films and I appreciate what they did with it. The way they added sound effects and music to certain places to give you the feeling of anxiousness, like when he was being chased by the hounds all you heard was the incessant barking of the dogs as they followed him through the woods. As well as the way they utilized the lack of sound, like when they were in the dormitory of the prison when he had just arrived and there was music and people were shouting until they threw the chains in his face and all the sounds was cut. The harsh lack of sound there matched the harsh action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang tells the story of a young man named James Allen who has just returned from fighting in World War one. Although he is offered his job back at a factory, he has grown tired of being stuck in a daily routine and seeks to create a more prosperous life for himself. Leaving his family he looks for work, traveling state to state he falls short on luck; tired and hungry he finds his way into a hamburger joint at the worst time possible. Convicted of armed robbery he is sentenced to seven years of hard labor with a chain gang, refusing to accept his fate, he escapes. Now a free man James Allen peruses the life he has dreamt of. Now a prominent engineer in Chicago, James Allen has everything going for him, except his past.Considering this in based during the time of the great depression and he is a veteran, the audience cannot help but feel remorse for James Allen. Paul Muni gives a great performance, depicting just how fragile the human mind actually is when put under severe conditions, Mervyn LeRoy depicts a roller coaster that is James Allen's American Dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie directed by Mervyn LeRoy is one of the most amazingly edited movies i've seen from the early 1930's. The story of a wrongly convicted man that goes through the intense hardships of prison life is so eye opening. This movie shed a giant spot light on how prisons were handling their inmates. It helped shape the course for new facilities and old ones to making life a tad easier. The use of sound was so key throughout this entire film. In parts where the main character (James Allen) played by Paul Muni, was underwater hiding from search dogs was so intense. LeRoy used an effective tool regarding sound by deciding not to use any while James Allen was underwater. When the camera would cut up to above water there was noise and chaotic sounds all around. They also used the sounds of the inmates breaking up the rocks to show time passing by. The use of sound and camera shots throughout this movie really helped shape it into a classic film that was way ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is an interesting film that tells a fictional tale of James Allen and how he was wrongfully imprisoned based upon the real life story of Robert Elliot Burns. The characters in the movie are all either very likable or despicable and it seems that there is an obtuse divide between good and evil. Paul Muni does an excellent job playing James Allen and as the story progresses you really start to sympathize with the protagonist. Also, other minor roles such as James Allen's prison mate are strong supporting actors. Overall, the story was good and exposes the wrongs of the old, despotic chain gangs that were popular in past decades and I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys Paul Muni or black and white films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not normally one for crime movies, with a few exceptions (ex: The Departed). In fact, I had never heard of this movie before watching it so any of the bias I have for most crime movies didn't come into play. Overall, this movie is not only a really good film, but also sends a message, even if it's not a message for our time. I liked many things about this movie. The one element of it was definitely the story. It was a mix of irony, hope, and slight depression. As for the impact, one can only imagine who it left moviegoers feeling. Especially those who were associated with the prisons and their chain gangs back then. Exposing these problems and the inefficiency in helping the inmates get their life together proved extremely risky. But the strongest message would have to be the government's inability and almost blatant disregard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" directed by Mervyn Leroy and starring Paul Muni is a great film due to the plot, acting, and the overall message it is attempting to show. The main character, James Allen is wrongfully convicted of a crime and is sent to work in a chain gang where he first encounters this living hell. What I found interesting is how they portray this prison in such a horrifying way. The men work all day in filthy conditions, the food is atrocious, and many are whipped with a belt if the guards feel as if they aren't being productive enough. James escape from the prison was quite suspenseful and kept the audience on the edge of their seats. As James settles into his new life, you can soon tell that his wife is using him and you wonder if he will go back to prison if she informs the authorities. I thought it was very honorable of James to return to prison to serve out his remaining years. The end of the movie is suspenseful as the previous escape and leaves the audience wondering, which I enjoyed. Movies in which the viewer doesn't know how everything turns out are usually very interesting. I thought the message conveyed was clear and what makes this film significant. Director Mervyn Leroy aimed to show the mistreatment of prisoners and the corrupt men in the legal system.</fullReview>

A dark and thrilling story that's all the more gripping because it's based on a true story. Muni gives a brilliant performance as a regular guy wrongly convicted of murder and subjected to the hardships and beatings of a dehumanizing chain gang regime. This film was very well filmed, and it was an amazing dramatic film, it shows how the penal system for in-mates is so much different know then it was back then.

		<fullReview>I like "gangster flicks" so I had a feeling I would like I am a fugitive from a chain gang and I was right. I like how the main character, James Allen, went after what he wanted in life. When he returned from World War I, he realized that he didn't want to return to his job he had before he left but that he wanted to become an engineer. His family just wanted him to stay with the job he had but he pursued his dreams and left town in a search of a job as an engineer. He went from city to city and found jobs here and there but never found anything permanent. He eventually ran out of money and got involved with the wrong person. A man offers to buy him a burger at a local diner which Allen excepted because he was very hungry. However, when they got to the diner the other man pulls out a gun and demanded that the cashier gave him all the money in the drawer. Allen didn't know this was going to happen but he took the money from the drawer because he other guy had a gun and told him to. When the cops came it looked like James Allen was in on it too so he got arrested even though he didn't really do anything and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was sent to jail and became part of a chain gang. The men are forced to do hard labor and eat crappy food day after day. Allen decided one day that he had enough and he wasn't going to stay there and be punished for something he didn't even do so he plans to escape. One day when they were out working, he asked to go to the bathroom in the woods but he really got out of his chain and took off. The officers ran after him but he got away. He is almost caught while he is getting a shave because one of the officers came in to the same place. This was a funny part in the movie because of just how close he was to being caught. He eventually found work and even became a very successful businessman. He ended up marrying a girl he didn't love because she found out his secret that he was on the run and threatened to call the police and tell them. When he admitted that he loved someone else she called the police who came and arrested him again. He turned himself in because they said they would give him a pardon and he would only spend 3 months in jail. He soon found out that he wouldn't be getting that pardon and that he would be spending a very long time back in jail. He ended up escaping again! James Allen was on the run once again and when he was asked how he lived by the woman he loved, he said "I steal." After he said that he faded away into the darkness. Its ironic that he was a good man but ended up in the wrong place and that causes him to eventually become a theft for real even though he wasn't before he got arrested. This movie showed just how bad it was in prison and what those men went through everyday. I really enjoyed this movie and I understand even more now how the Warner Brothers were and still are so successful.</fullReview>

I love the ending scene when he disappears, because he pops up out of nowhere and he frantic he's tired and worn down and it just shows that someone would rather run away put their entire future at risk rather than being imprisoned on a chain gang at the time, lets you see how harsh they really were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'I am a Fugitive of a Chain Gang' tells the story of a man, James Allen, and his journey of escaping the corrupt justice system after being accused of a crime that he did not commit. This film explores the cruelty of the justice system and the abuse prisons faced behind bars. After Jim decides to escape from prison the first time, he find himself on the run and desperate for a fresh start and a second chance at his dream of becoming an engineer. Years later Jim is a successful engineer but he is made by his apartment tenant, who blackmails him into staying with her in fear of being turned over to the police. When he cannot take it any longer she tells the police of his location and he is arrested again. This time Jim cooperates and turns himself over with the idea that he will get a deal for a reduced sentence. When he finds out in prison that he will have to stay longer, he decides to break out again. The film ends with Jim still on the run, forever a fugitive.This film was surprisingly intense, symbolic, and even a bit humorous. The story line flowed well and was not contradicting. We were given a clear hero to root for even in his darkest hour. The greatest symbol throughout the film was Jim's dream of building bridges which comes back into play several times during the film. All he wanted to do was build bridges and at the end he blows up the bridge between him and the police who are chasing after him. Jim literally burned his last bridge, allowing him to never have another chance at the life he always dreamed of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" was a very interesting film, and it kept me on my toes. Although in the beginning I did not know what to expect, and it started out a little slow for my liking. I wasn't very interested at first, but suddenly things became interesting 20-30 minutes in. The story line continued to become more interesting as the movie went on and I was entertained the entire time. For this film being such an older film, and one of the first films with sound, it was very captivating. I thought they did a great job implementing sound in the movie, and the story line was great. I love that it kept me guessing and that I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. I was saddened that the main character didn't have a happy ending, but it ended up seeming more realistic without the happy ending. The film definitely captures your emotions, I could feel myself growing angry when his wife called the detectives on him, among other scenes in the movie as well. 8 out of 10 stars from me!</fullReview>

It's wonderfully acted, with likable characters and an apt approach of the subject of its time. It's probably been watered down content-wise since the actual event wasn't nearly this... charming (for lack of a better word), but for what it was aiming for and for how it was made, it was wonderfully executed and some of the best films I've seen in a long time. Black and white films are always very endearing, and they made use of the camera angles and lighting in artistic ways, especially with shadow and its stark contrasts in general.Overall, I gave it this rating because I thought it was brilliant; enough said.</fullReview>

The labor chain gang members had to do, and the living conditions they were subject to were extreme. The way the movie showed such harsh labor breaking rocks while hooked to a chain made you feel sorry for James Allen, especially since the circumstances that led to his imprisonment were unjustified.As the movie unfolded Allen gets a taste of freedom and as a viewer you route for him to enjoy his freedom. Towards the end of the movie I believe that James Allen established himself. In my opinion I believe that James showed that he deserved to remain an upstanding member of the community.

James Allen who was a World War veteran trying to live his dreams, happens to fall in these chain gangs for something he really didn't do. This movie would make a lot of viewers angry in their seats because of the stuff that happened to James. He was put into a lot of predicaments. He did manage to escape the camp and live like a normal citizen for a while. He became wealthy and was well known by the city. He was not a person deserving to be in those camps. James was promised a pardon for going back to the chain gang and never got it. It shows the injustice of the cities and their wrongful doings. James was a fugitive of this chain gang.The film really helped show the terrible conditions of these camps. The food that they were served that looked like watery, mushed up food, and then being whipped from not working too hard were some of the images that showed the harsh conditions. The songs the prisoners sung were dark showing how miserable they were and how bad the place was. These people may have been criminals but were treated severely bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is of no surprise that "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" was nominated for 'Best Picture.' This 1932 classic holds up today as well as it did upon release. While other films of this era get remembered for their effects or charm, Mervyn LeRoy's autobiographical tale concerning Robert E. Burns is all about the story. I found this film to be especially interesting for its tackling of serious contemporary subject matter. Modern audiences enjoyed "12 Years a Slave" will find parallels between the two stories.Ironically enough, "I am a Fugitive..." feels more modern than others released only a couple years later. This is obviously a Pre-Code Hollywood film. What makes a film like this so special is that it belongs in a pocket films that utilize the technology of sound and are able to artistically express themselves without being handcuffed by an arbitrary moral compass. The utilization of sound effects and ambient noise create an atmosphere that brings the viewer right in without a second thought. It would have been very easy to overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary sounds because they're available, however LeRoy puts the story first and as a result gives us something we'll never forget.Read my complete review (w/ possible spoilers) at CD1083.com</fullReview>

Now without spoiling the story too much, James Allen falls victim to participating in a crime forcefully and is placed in a chain gang for his actions. Now here is where the movie shines, with it's brilliant sound design each successive scene packs an impressive punch of realism about the corruption of the justice system during the era. Truly cringe-worthy moments are portrayed with frightening momentum, that honestly envelop you further in the feeling of resentment for the cruel punishment. Sympathy is something that you cannot help but feel for Allen, as the unwarranted treatment he endures is absolutely appalling. The most memorable scene in the movie that will undoubtedly stick with me for years to come is when the sound cuts completely and James has his chain whipped at his head after being pushed out of his bed, true disgust overtook me, and that isn't a feeling that I have had evoked from me in nearly any movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni's portrayal of real life fugitive Robert Elliot Burns is flawless. At every unbelievable twist and turn I was able to feel the anguish, despair, disbelief and pain. The story of a decorated WWI veteran who comes home and is urged to pick up where he left off with his dull, desk job by his mother and Reverend brother but really wants to apply the engineering skills he learned in the war ends up an unwilling partner in a petty theft. He is sentenced to 10 years on a chain gang where the men work 16 hours a day, eat the same disgusting food day after day and violence is a common occurrence. After much abuse Muni, whose character is named James Allen, decides to make a run for it and he makes his way to Chicago where he lands a job and works his way up to become a much respected manager. Unfortunately he had been blackmailed earlier in his career by a greedy female into marriage and when he tries to end the marriage because he's met someone he truly loves his wife turns him in. He agrees to go back to serve 90 days in return for a full pardon but 90 days turn into one year and one year turns into a suspended sentence and his pardon is never granted. Remarkably Allen escapes again but the authorities refuse to stop searching for him because he exposed the cruelty and the conditions he endured and has to spend the rest of his life in obscurity and is forced to steal to survive. This story is so gritty and real and the audience cannot help but feel sorry for Allen and sympathize with his predicament. The movie exposes the truth about power and corruption in a way that is unforgettable and moving. I recommend this movie for its realism and emotional impact and for the simple lesson, if you ever escape from a chain gang don't go back no matter what they offer you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warner Brothers is known for their series of rather well-made "Gangster" films, films focused on the crime life found during the same era, stretching from two-bit thugs to Mafia Bosses and Drug Lord, but here we are presented a different tale. An innocent man being imprisoned for a crime he was caught up in. A controversial plot for the time it appeared, being much more interesting than its parallel films from the same era, by bringing up the horrible conditions of the criminal justice system, specifically found in Georgia (which is never explicitly stated in the film to prevent legal issues). Besides plot the film holds a great high standard for its use of sound, there are many examples but I would not want to spoil any of it. The sound design is used rather well to emphasize the point in every scene. The Soundtrack is sparse, but appears where it is needed, and only then, usually with heavy orchestral power behind it. In the early era of Sound Film, this is a must see!</fullReview>

The viewer can actually feel sympathy for his character and he does a great job at relaying his emotions through his expressions and actions.

Not to see I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang in theaters, but to see the audience and nation react to it. An uncommonly prolific film, Chain Gang follows the life of a man (based on a real person) as he returns home from war and runs into a bit of bad luck while he's trying to make an honest career for himself. Through its many twists and turns, it explores his brutal and inhumane encounters with the chain gang prison system, and concludes with a harrowing, now infamous ending. The effect of the film is a cold bucket of water to the face, and sparked a very real protest of the chain gang system in America through its intense and emotional portrayal of the protagonist's mistreatment. If you're exploring the landmarks of western film canon, then Chain Gang is an absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My assumption for a lot of older films like this one, is that they weren't great with how the idea was presented. Yeah, I was one of those people that thought the older the movie, the worse it was. Well, Chain Gang surprised me for sure. One of my favorite things about the film was the use of sound, especially with the clanging noises made during the protagonist's hard labor. It was done in a choppy manner, and it was really on point. The scenes were well thought out, and the pacing helped demonstrated the real life social issues when it came to the unfairness of the justice system.During the movie, my mind kept pressing for the typical happy ending. I mean, after all the man went through, he certainly deserved it. But then with the way he appeared and then merged back within the darkness- it truly took me by surprise. One issue with the movie that I had, however. While the lighting was good, I noticed that one of the characters, a black guy, his skin looked very metallic. Yes, he was sweating a lot, but it still looked unusual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fugitive from a Chain Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say this was one of the best movies that I have watched in a long time. I don't get to watch too many movies or television in general so I found it refreshing to watch this movie. I found myself feeling the movie as a love story rather than a gangster movie. You were able to feel what the main character (James Allen) Paul Muni was feeling throughout the movie. The change in events within the movie changed him as a man. Being a fugitive he created this normal everyday life where he became rich and famous. He was forced into marrying a woman that he didn't love because she blackmailed him because she knew his true identity. He wanted to divorce her because he feel in love with another woman and being the bitter wife, she turned him into the authorities. His life was a struggle from that point on and it changed him as to who he was.The most effects of the movie that really intrigued me was when he was getting beaten and you could feel the pain by the expressions on the other prisoners faces. As he walked through the room the camera view made it so that you felt what he was experiencing at the moment. The chain gang songs made me feel that the prisoners were all connected as they simultaneously hammered the rails.The ending of the movie and how they had James character disappear into the darkness gave you a sense of how the chain of unfortunate events changed him and made him into someone that he didn't want to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm A Fugitive from a Chain Gang 1932</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) I think this was an excellent film. The movie illustrates a soldier named James Allen, who returns home, only to find himself working in a dead beat job. He decides to travel to different areas throughout the U.S. looking for that "perfect" job as an engineer, only to find himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. James is wrongly convicted of theft and is sentenced to time on a southern "chain gang". A "Chain Gang" is where a man is sentenced to work on a railroad in the south for a crime committed. He finally escapes, by squeezing his ankle/foot out of the chains and locks and makes a run for it through the woods and marsh. After several years on the run, he final lands a job and continues to build his career as an engineer and becomes very successful.During this time he has fallen in love and marries. When he tries to divorce his first wife, she threatens him and states she'll tell authorities who he really is, which she does. He remarries and during his second marriage, authorities finally catch up to him. After long debate, he agrees to the terms provided by authorities, that if he serves an additional six months on the "chain gang" he'll be exonerated and will be able to live his life to the fullest again. However that promise falls short and James finds himself stuck once again on the "chain gang".The movie ends with James on the run again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Powerful Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie that got its message out clearly and loudly. The film painted chain gangs as something that does the exact opposite of what the legal system is supposed to do. The legal system is supposed to reform criminals into model citizens, but instead this movie told the story of a man who was wrongly thrown in jail and slowly developed into a criminal because of his experience in the chain gang. The final two lines of the film are the most powerful dialog in the whole movie. The way Muni delivered the line, "I steal" was disturbing and chilling. This movie ended up causing the end of chain gangs, so obviously viewers understood the theme of the film.The cinematography of the movie was phenomenal. The scene when James Allen is whipped by the warden and the camera slowly pans from one inmate's face to another's was masterfully done. The final scene of the film had Muni looking like a mad man once he stepped out of the shadows and the shot of him fading away into darkness was also very powerful. The constant sound of chains while he is in the chain gang is almost overwhelming. It once again shows how awful the living conditions these men had to deal with were. Muni played a fantastic part and his role is unforgettable after seeing it. His character's transformation was really well done and a great acting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Muni struggles with the justice system in a 1931 chain gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie impressed me down to every last detail. Everything about this movie seemed so modern and relevant to our time and it honestly surprised me. I think the special effects and filming quality were way ahead of its time. Paul Muni as always was an incredible actor and played his role perfectly. His humor and sarcasm was far from out dated and had me laughing more than a few times. This movie had a definite impact on society helping rid the south of its terrible chain gangs. I think the movie made a good point of poking fun at that society that we live in. The character James Allen finds out the hard way that people don't always keep there word. In this movie the good guy who makes the right choice doesn't make it out happy in the end. This movie wanted to point out the corruption in the justice system of the time. It was put in place to turn convicts into people ready to be respectable members of society. As soon as we see our main character achieve that ,the justice system throws him right back. This creates the lifestyle we see James Allen living by the end of the movie. I like how the humor and the points this movie pokes fun at in society are all still very relevant. I like how we see the justice system fail to change Muni into a moral member of society. This can be seen in our own world when the corruption of our own justice system is exposed forcing normally good moral people to turn to a life of crime or evil. We see this in an eerie, dark scene where James is creeping through the shadows and only whispers for a few moments before running off like a thief in the night. A great cinematic ending but it left me wanting more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was a profound and overall amazingly made movie for its time. It's take on prison life is a subject that still rings true today. The rattling of the chains in the prison give it such an ominous feeling. Throughout the movie, even when he escaped the physical chains of prison, he was forever chained to prison life. Even after his first escape where he worked hard and transformed himself into an upstanding member of society, he still ended up back in a chain gang prison years later. The very end of the movie was so incredibly eerie, completely pitch black and his voice sounding full of terror, forever on the run, never able to escape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie was hard to watch and follow along at times because a lot of the same things seemed to be going on over and over. It didn't seem to keep my attention with the dramatic events or anything. The only really exciting things that happened were when James escaped from prison both times. It really kept you on your toes, ESPECIALLY the second time because you didn't think he was actually going to make it. However for it being a film in the early sound era, one of the biggest scenes that stood out to me the most was when they were in the jail and James was taken into the back and all you could see was the shadow of him being whipped but the sound was so loud and powerful. I also really liked the songs that they sang in between the work sessions that they did outside with each other to pass the time. Also, it was very interesting the sound effects used when the calendar pages were dropping to show how much time was passing throughout the movie (showing how much time he was serving). It just added more emphasis to everything going on in real time. Overall, I thought it was an okay. It's not my favorite kind of movie but Paul Muni is a great actor and I think he played a good part for this one. He had a very serious personality throughout the whole movie which made it that much better.</fullReview>

The different plot twists and turns it takes throughout the story keeps you interested and into what may happen next. The use of keeping time is well show from the use of calendars throughout the movie. The characters show excellent acting skills and the use of cars show in the movie and how its moving seems realistic for that time. The only thing I didn't like was that all the actresses looked the same and it was extremely hard to figure out who was who.

		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,is a very successful film overall with a clear plot and an interesting story line. The acting is well done, especially that of Paul Muni who holds the leading role as James Allen; however the acting of minor character, Hale Hamilton, who plays Muni's brother can be described as unconvincing and over dramatic. LeRoys use of maps and time cards serve a very useful tool in displaying the amount of time that has gone by for protagonist Allen as well as how far he has traveled when he becomes a fugitive. The sound was amazingly crisp as is well scored. LeRoy uses sound to indicate surroundings and settings as well as a dramatic effect, for example when Allen is submerged under water the sound immediately cuts off leaving nothing but empty sound. The scene shot under water is amazingly shot and edited for the time the film was created, leaving me to wonder how they achieved such a great underwater shot. My only two criticisms was the amount of reading that was necessary for the audience; i.e. they would leave a hand-written letter on the screen for for a lengthy amount of time for the audience to read. I would have suggested including a voice over or something of that sort. My second criticism is the way the film ended abruptly with little to keep the audience thinking. Perhaps included some insight into what happened to Allen afterwords. Overall it was an excellent film way beyond its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a great film that has you invested in the story minutes into the film. The story of James Allen is an intense escape thriller at one point but than shifts to him rebuilding his life and becoming a member in society like everyone else but later is imprisoned and escapes once again. I think that the performances by every actor is the strongest part of the whole movie because towards the end you really care what happens to all of them and so on. The chase at the end was also very well done but my favorite part was when the first escape happens and James Allen is under water and there is no sound and it cuts to above water and you hear everything with the guards yelling and dogs barking was very effective. In the end I enjoyed this film and kept me invested in it which makes a good movie, That's why I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang gets an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, realistic take on 1920's southern prison work groups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am Fugitive from a Chain Gang, might be one of the best crime films of the 1930's. As it's acting makes you to believe how awful prisoners were treated, as they were made to work till they pass out or die. The acting in this movie were done so extremely well with the lead actor Paul Muni doing a fantastic job playing James Allen, a World War 1 veteran who goes cross country to find a good job, but becomes nearly broke and gets caught up in a robbery and is sent to prison. Where he goes in to a prison chain gang and he escapes to Chicago and becomes a great part of society, but he gets caught up and marries a woman (who he only marries because she will go to the police and tell them he is wanted by the police which she eventually does because James wants a divorce so he can be with the real woman he loves). James is then caught where he accepts to go back to the prison chain gang in exchange for 90 days. Well months latter James realizes that he will be in prison for many more years. He then decor to escape again, where him and his friend trick the dumbest correction officer to get out of his dump truck and the two steal it and escape only for James's friend to get shot and falling out of the truck to die on the side of the road. James then escapes again by blowing up a bridge (which was done quite well for a film from 1932) and he then goes back to Chicago to tell the woman he loves that he will go into hiding and walks into the night. This movie is extremely well done with a great story with even better acting, the film itself was said to actually help reform the southern prison system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had me laughing and mad all at the same time. The main character James Allen or Allen James went through so much. It was sad and depressing all at once. He was so happy and ready for the world in the beginning. In the middle you can still see that he wants to make something of himself and he does, towards the ending it all changes, he's a criminal and it is upsetting because he had so much potential. It's crazy how two people managed to ruin his life. Sound was one of the most important elements in this film.The use of the chains each man wore and how they sounded when hitting up against each other was powerful. It made you feel as if you were surrounded by them. The train scenes as well, the train was extremely loud when James thought he was about to be caught by the police but instead they chanced another. When he was running from the guards and he managed to hide in a body of water, underneath there was silence but above you heard chaos. Dogs barking and men yelling while running made for an interested dynamic. I believe that the sound is what made the film. The ending scene is what bothered/ intrigued me the most. I say this because while he is talking to his beloved, James looks frighten, grim, nervous, as well as scared all at the same time. And also the way the scene ended...it leaves you guessing and wondering what Allen's life has come to and what it'll be like now that he is no longer himself. The scene that had me speaking out loud was when James first wife found out that he was on the run, she blackmailed him. I just couldn't believe that she would do something like that, it was so messed up on so many level. If you're going to watch this film prepare yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie does itself a great justice by having sound added. This movie couldn't be as powerful as it was without the audio. The sound of the chains when James first gets arrested was key to understand the noisy room. The bell as well as the whip where also key. The things you can't see but can only hear would be irrelevant without sound to begin with. Although the sound in this film made it as good as it was the ending chase made it worth watching for me. When James had to blow up the bridge in the end it was ironic because he built bridges for a living, but it was also symbolism for him blowing up his mind. His face says everything in the end and it shows he lost his marbles. When James visited his girlfriend after a year on the run he seemed crazy and steals for a living now. The movie was also about the rise and fall of a successful man, all because of a broken criminal system. I'm glad they changed some rules after this movie because this would of opened my eyes back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Oldie but a Goodie: A Must See Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that is not from the special effects era of our time, I was a bit skeptical as to if I would like this movie or not. And, the verdict is in: this movie is an excellent representation of chain gangs and what coming back from the war must have been like for the majority of men. This movie had the drama that we Americans so crave in our entertainment outlets: the drama of whether or not Jim will get caught after he escapes the chain gang, whether or not Marie will expose James for who he really is etc, etc. Throughout the movie, you find yourself rooting for Jim, crossing your fingers that he'll get away with everything and it will be almost like nothing ever happened. Of course, when you see the movie you'll realize that not everything is as it seems, and that words and promises mean nothing. This movie also did a good job of showcasing the segregation of the South, and the country, at this time. From the ticker of how many "Negro" to "White" prisoners there were, to the segregated wagons that each group took to work that day. Another thing that can be seen throughout the movie is loyalty and friendship. None of the prisoners ever tell or cause commotion when Jim tells them of his plan to escape, some even help him in his quest: one by bending the shackles with his hammer, and another by distracting the guards, twice! All in all, a great movie that you will think about even after it is over. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! The end of the movie was just perfect! I think the end is such a major aspect of the movie because it really shows how James Allen evolves from his first escape to his second. After his first escape, he believes he can have a normal life and be an upstanding citizen. After his second, he knows he has to hide in the dark and have his whole life amount to stealing and constant running. I think the irony in this movie worked perfectly. First off, he is a returning soldier from war that is getting locked up for a crime that he didn't even commit. Secondly, after he escapes he shows that he is an upstanding citizen and they still want to lock him up. And finally, after he voluntarily turns himself in, in return for a pardon, he is denied it over and over again. One part of the film that I absolutely loved was toward the beginning when one of the men was being beaten because he didn't work hard enough in the fields that day. James Allen was also going to get beaten because he spoke under his breath about the warden. When it was James's turn to get whipped, he was completely silent, in contrast to the other man who was screaming out in pain. I think this showed what a true man, and true soldier James was. While he was getting beaten, the camera panned over all the faces of the men in their bunks. I think this camera angle was perfect. The men looked as if they were proud he didn't make a peep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang tells the story of James Allen, a fictionalized version of the wrongfully convicted Robert Elliot Burns. James, played by Paul Muni, returns home from World War I a changed man and decides to give in to his ambition and become an engineer. After becoming impoverished in his search for work, he is forced at gunpoint to aid in the robbery of a small diner. After his arrest, he is tortured and subjected to the brutality of chain gang labor, but when he succeeds in an attempt to flee he finds himself the victim of a relentless and vindictive legal system that eventually breaks James, and he succumbs to an absolute, paranoid madness. The first thing you'll notice about the film is the ability of the leading man, Paul Muni. He commands a very captivating presence that allows his character to become completely believable. In the first half of the film, Paul Muni makes his character one deserving of both sympathy and respect. It was very easy to feel for this character, and this allows James Allen to have an unparalleled character progression. He changes very drastically, but for the most part it happens so gradually that you don't realize the starkness of his transformation until the very final scene. Paul Muni takes his character from an upstanding citizen to a delusional vagrant that you cant help but feel pity and a genuine sorrow for. His skill as an actor creates one of the most shocking and dramatic endings in a film that I personally have ever seen.Muni's performance is bolstered by a very moving script and an excellent director, but what had to be most important was an impeccable sound design. This film was able to take a relatively new innovation for the film industry and create a superb array of ambient sounds that you cant help but notice. It was so excellent that even now, nearing a century later, I was still shocked by the amount that it added to the film. Muni is so often surrounded by unfamiliar and daunting noises when he's introduced to the chain gang. The rattling of the chains, the pounding of the hammers against the rocks, the barking and whining of the hounds on his tail during his escape. I actually believed I was feeling exactly what James Allen must have been feeling. This really couldn't have been achieved just a few years earlier if the film had been made as a silent film.If you have an appreciation for cinema, this is a film you just can't ignore. It's a genuine piece of movie history. I cant believe I hadn't even heard of it before today. I didn't hesitate to give it a 10 because that's what it deserved. I don't think I'll ever forget this one, and I cant recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>key is lying, blackmail, and betrayal holding you down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's film illustrates a lot of interesting social tendencies and aspects prevalent in American life. James Allen (Paul Muni) returns home and as a veteran is hard pressed readjusting to his old life and decides to make a change and travel the country working. Although it was moderately insignificant to the plot, This could have potentially been a very subtle way of depicting what it was like to come home from war and be confused about what to do with life. After being innocently involved in a robbery in the south Allen is sentence to work on a chain gang for what will seemingly be the rest of his life, or at least a very long undetermined about of time. The chain gang is under the supervision of harshly abusive leaders who make life difficult for the prisoners. In this instance we see men come together for the good of each other to try and combat, or at least his the pain of, being so badly treated. A fellow prisoner helps him escape the life by distracting the guard. This shows how in situations where people are collectively being mistreated they will assist each other in anyway possible as a result of being brought together. The most significant aspect of the film is its iconic message regarding secrets, lies, betrayal, and blackmail holding people down. When Allen escapes he goes to Chicago, starts becoming successful, and enters a relationship with a women named Marie. Later when Marie finds out about Allen's past she threatens to expose his identity if he does not marry her. He then enters the relationship that turns out to be an unhappy one for the both of them, but Marie stays with him presumably for his wealth. The significance here is that blackmail can yield unhappy results for everyone involved. After informing Marie he wants to divorce her for a local socialite he has fallen in love with Allen is exposed by his wife. After much resistance and deliberation Allen is sent back to the prison camp to serve a 90 day sentence that was promised by the authorities. Once again he is betrayed by not only his wife, for exposing him, but also the prison camp authorities as once Allen is there he realizes he will be incarcerated for much longer than 90 days. In light of this Allen and the prisoner who assisted him before make a daring escape. Allen then returns to Chicago where he secretly meets up with the socialite he fell for, in the end he tells her his secret that he is a wanted fugitive represents a chain around his life that will last forever. The significance here is that secrets and lies can suffice as a type of imprisonment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) directed by Mervyn Leroy is a great early period film that revealed the cruelty and injustices of forced labor camps, and helped bring about social change. The main character is James Allen, a world war I veteran who is thrown into jail for a crime he didn't commit. The plight of James Allen is where the movie shines. The things he has to go through are tough and intriguing from an outside perspective. The sound is great, and the camera tricks/action sequences are executed to full effect. The movie is in black and white, and seems so advanced in its message, for a film of its time. I would give I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very important for the time and even the present. Men who went off to war in WWI, WWII, and Vietnam for example were coming back home with traumatic issues, but also no available work to help feed their families. Paul Muni character James Allen was lucky because he was offered his old job back, but he declined the offer. Subsequently Muni get charged with being involved in a pick-pocket and sent to jail. The film gave a close look of prison life in a chain gang, the harshness and the injustice. The movie was really dark and was basically a drama of, a man on the run after his breakout from prison. The movie was interesting because it dealt with blackmail, which forced James Allen to marry a women he didn't love and ultimately got him back in jail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that takes place right after the end of WWI takes us through the journey of the surviving solider of the war and what his life holds back home after fighting for his country. As the soldier returns home hoping to continue his work in engineering he learned from in the war, but his family rejects him to do so begins his notion to move around the country to find work in engineering.The returning solider learns that it isn't so easy for veterans of the war to get jobs after getting back home. A montage of James Allen going from city to city, state to state trying to find work and unsuccessful in it he finds himself in a bar where he is offered a free meal. Of course he takes the offer but leads him to be an accomplice in a robbery sending to the chain gang in Kentucky.This film tells any viewer who James Allen has to be a "fugitive" in the film before even watching it. This means he will have to escape from the chain gang.Knowing that this will happen the lighting in this film is mostly dark, not only for the scenes but set the mood for the film. The sound in this film is actually very modern for the time of the film, but not all sounds are in sync still it adds to the effect of the chain gang to Allen's experience. Some instances include the actual chains or belts used for whipping the prisoners.This film shows exactly the true life of soldiers that return form this war and how harsh life can be for them even though they just fought in a war. James Allen shows how the system of our country can be wrong and treat not only veterans but true good citizens of the country falsely. Which means that what Allen went through is a true thing for many people and opens eyes for people that some people have to live just like he has in the film and happened because our system of government isn't perfect and sent Allen down the wrong road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, poor James Allen. The guy just cannot catch a break. A WWI soldier recently returned home from war, James Allen (Paul Muni) no longer wants to settle for the life he had prior to leaving for the war. Deciding to travel as a skilled worker, Allen comes across a sticky situation that leaves him wrongfully convicted and working on a chain gang. However, he manages to escape and runs away to Chicago where he works his way up the "ladder of success" and eventually becomes one of the most respected people in all of Chicago. Now, if only this weren't a movie because otherwise he'd probably end up living a pretty normal life. Unfortunately for not-so-lucky James, this is a movie and his past catches up with him leading him to strike a deal with police that if he goes back on the chain gang for x amount of days and pays x amount of dollars, he'll be free to go. Too bad for poor James because he gets tricked again and ends up back on the chain gain...indefinitely. Escaping for a second time, James is now forced to live a life of crime in order to survive. So much for happy endings. Yes, it was a bit unrealistic. Yes, some of the lighting was so bad that you could barely see what was going on. Yes, that's really how screwed up the US legal system is (surprise, surprise) but is it a bad movie? Absolutely not. "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is gritty and powerful and gives us a peak at just how unjust the US justice system truly is. This film was not meant to be cookie-cutter clean. It is meant to be raw and gritty, and harsh because it is telling the story of just how harsh and unfair the world was (and still is in term of our Justice System) during the early 1930s. Quite honestly, "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" should probably on the list of most important early dramas to see because it is one of the first instances in film that you truly notice them showing the world as it is in that moment (e.g. the Great Depression/WWI for this movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-executed film... definitely worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932, Mervyn LeRoy) is a film about James Allen (Paul Muni), a man fresh off the boat from the war, and his story of being wrongfully convicted of theft, enslaved to a chain gang, escaping, and living on the lam. Paul Muni's performance is haunting and he fits the role perfectly. The ebb and flow of sound (There are some scenes that draw back more on sound, using just swaying music, and there are other moments that have no sound, or when you could only hear the crack of the whip as a prisoner was being punished) paired with the fading and frequently dim lighting (exemplified by the way the prison is lit and the way the lights fade out to end many of the scenes, like the very last shot, where darkness slowly eclipses Muni's face) all give the film an excellent feel. The editing is exemplified well by how the camera slowly pans around the prison to show each prisoners, who sometimes are just staring, staying perfectly still, expressing the gravity of the moment. Often the camera stays on Muni's face to show the changes in his expression. My main critique of the film is the script, which was a little cheesy and didn't really contribute to the film's integrity. LeRoy clearly and simply exposes the gaping flaws in the legal system in the early 1900s, and the harrowing true story of a man fleeing unjust punishment. It's stirring, gripping, and elicits sympathy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Allen just won't get a break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The luck of this man returning from war is honestly terrible! This movie makes you feel so much for the protagonist James Allen. While I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang pulls you into the tragic and unfortunate events a young man encounters for a majority of his life. It also manages to keep you wanting more, you don't know what table will be turned at some points. In a way it is a story of progression. For the sake of spoilers I will not go too in depth with the changes made to James Allen, but you should understand that this is not a movie to pass on! The changes the protagonist goes under create a triumphant story with true form. The effects in cinematography and sound complement the content and plot of the film very well. The only reason I'm not granting this film the 10 stars is because it comes off as predictable at what will happen next. Which can leave you just waiting around until the next exciting event at some points. However the predictable plot should not disregard the films impact on Hollywood and film productions of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Dream Turned Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Allen, returning from war, had only one dream. he wanted to build bridges. Unfortunately, his family has other plans. After running away to follow a life he wants to lead, Allen runs into some trouble. When he is framed for a robbery (of a hamburger and some change) and sent to a hard labor camp, Allen realizes that he must get out. After a daring escape, Allen is able to make a fruitful life, and becomes a civil engineer. He is eventually captured sometime later, and he must escape from the camp again. I noticed many scenes that I have seen replicated in modern films, so it was nice to see where these references came from. The camera work stood out to me as outstanding. When Allen takes his beating in the prison camp, we see his fellow prisoners watch on in horror. That and the scene where Allen hides underwater are two of these moments where I was blown away by the camera work. Overall, I would highly suggest viewing this, even if you are not trying to review it. It is simply spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was very, very clever for a 1930s film. Recently after silent films started to get advanced and sound was able to be added to the movie, I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang tells the story of a man just getting back from the war and tries to find a new job but gets framed for robbery and gets thrown in jail for it. I was very shocked as to how well this film was put together and written considering the time period it was made in. Paul Muni gives an amazing performance in this film and its ability to consistently tell a story was great. This movie was filmed very recently after movies started to have actual sound in them and the sounds in this movie were really clear and spot on with the timing to the actual actions being performed. I recommend this film and i would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie barely anyone has ever heard of? Usually that means it probably isn't that great, but I thought this film was pretty good. My first impression was that it was going to be boring and tedious, but it's well made with no real bad scenes. Not to mention that it's an action film that actually has some suspense in it. There are some parts in the story where you might feel aren't the most realistic. The main protagonist appears to be a bit too trusting, despite everything that happened to him. It isn't very relate-able to modern society, but it is a nice representation of the time it was made. I wouldn't call it perfect, but it's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film makes you feel all sorts of emotions, from excitement to despair, as you follow the main lead through out his struggle for justice. Right in the beginning of the film you feel for James Allen, the lead, when he comes back from war and all he wants to do is make a difference and not land back in his old routine. We follow him when he struggles with keeping a job and jumps from one old end job to another. James ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. The lighting in this movie sets the tone for a lot of the scenes, portraying the emotion we should as the audience feel. I feel that because this film was in black and white it only helps in conveying the emotions by making certain scenes more dramatic along with the lighting. One example of this is the end of the film, when James goes to see his love interest and all we can see is the shadows of his face as he lurks in the shadows, being a fugitive and escaping prison twice he has no choice but to live in the shadows. It's an eerie and sad ending. The use of sound in this film is also very apparent. From the whistling of the trains, the slamming of the hammer, and of course the clanking of the chains. We constantly heard the train whistle in this film, the train was the way James Allen went from place to place, whether he was escaping the past of his old routine life, or literally escaping from prison. However the sounds of the chains is the most noticeable, any movement the men made we heard the chains, a constant reminder that they aren't going anywhere. Before my film class I have never heard of this film before, and probably never would have. This film is a great example of a fantastic drama, keeping the audience engaged, and I believe it is extremely under rated and over looked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this was the most complete movie that I have watched in my Cinema class yet. I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The whole story was very cleverly planned out and it goes to show you how someone can make the best out of being at the wrong place at the same time and also how not to trust the government. The movie captured many themes, like drama, action and irony. It is one of the great gangster flicks that I have seen and takes us on James Allen's journey to be an engineer and work where ever he can find work. Just like everyone else he has to work his way up the pay grade and achieves what he wants for the most part. The drama and the thought of what in the movie was going to happen next kept me on my heels and intrigued in the movie. Overall I thought this film was very well done and recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent film about the tragedies of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Set in post WWI United States the film follows a soldier that wants to make his way in the world with the knowledge he acquired in the Army. Luck is not on his side as he travels the country in search of a job anywhere and everywhere. He is caught as an accomplice to a petty crime and is sentenced to 10 years to hard labor in a chain gang. He manages to escape and make a name for himself over the years as a hard worker and knowledgeable civil engineer. The past that he once thought that he left behind comes back to haunt him and he must once again serve time in a chain gang to appease the state, and once more he is severely wronged. He runs away and realizes that running is the only way to be free. This 1932 black and white directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Paul Muni was one of the first films to feature sound. It was so well done in fact that it was as if I had been watching a modern film. The sound effects of the chase scene after Allen's first successful escape were so intense that you could feel the stress in your body as the dogs barked and the sound of the train making it so imperative that he escape. The acting was also phenomenal. Muni's portrayal of the wronged victim was so well done that it was easy to empathize with the character as he was wronged yet again, and experience the fury that accompanies that sense of injustice. All in all a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a lot to like about this movie. For me, the main stand out was the social and political messages that permeated the film. They highlighted the corruption in government, as well as the horrible conditions in prisons, and though they may have technically toned it down from the reality of the situation, it still got the point across. The lead actor did an admirable job at the helm of virtually every scene of the film, making it easy to feel how this character was deteriorating with every set back. The only real flaw I saw in this movie was that the supporting characters around him did not even come close to his level.Best of all was the ambiguous ending. So often films feel the need to hit us over the head where the character/story will end up long after the film end. Instead, Chaingang allows us to feel just as bereft as the characters, as James Allen fades into the darkness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is an incredible actor as with many old black and white film actors of this era, and so under rated. The lighting in all of the scenes gives a texture that works amazingly with the texture provided by the cameras of that time. For one of the first movies to feature sound, the story does not lack in any way it still seems well written and consistent. The last scene where Muni is leaving and he yells "I steal!" is an absolutely beautiful ending that keeps the audience guessing. The blackness at that point when he says the line only serves to further implant the importance and memory of the line forever in the minds of the audience. Not only that but it shows the digression of our main character from when at the beginning of the movie we find a man who wants more excitement from his mundane life and he surely finds it as after that point his life is never settled again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really impressed by the acting in this movie, especially when it comes down to a narrow attempt to escape. This focuses on James Allen, who gets arrested for some money that he took from a hamburger restaurant. I found it interesting when he was forced to take it. It made me feel that something bad was going to happen. After a bit, he led a nice life with another person and made bright changes.This is a really nice movie. People were inspired by what James did for his city. He helped maintain a nice life, and he also landed the girl that he met at a hotel or apartment. It really brings out your inner self. After the second escape from the state prison in Illinois, I was a little distraught, but I knew that he had to make something happen. The last line almost scared me a bit. Overall, it's one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a really interesting one. First of all, it's pre-code, so you get all the best qualities of older movies, without the feeling that everything is censored. At the same time, it's not brutal either (not that there's anything wrong with that)?it's more implication. I love the character development in this film. There's such a progression from the beginning to the iconic end, and the closing line is still running through my head a week after watching it. Of course the excellent acting from Paul Muni helps. The subject matter is arguably the most successful aspect. The realistic portrayal of the justice system during this time period not only makes for a compelling visual and conceptual narrative, it also inspires action. The fact that this film caused many people to realize (and attempt to correct) injustice towards others in James' position is proof of the compelling formal and conceptual accomplishments of this film. Cinematography and audio certainly helped make this film successful. The lighting (or lack thereof) was so incredibly skillful and deliberate and contributed perfectly to the mood and plot. I absolutely cannot get over how gorgeous the up close shots and lighting in the barbershop scene were. As for sound, it was well used to increase suspense and create the feeling of passing time.</fullReview>

It also displayed a great use of sound. In my opinion, one great use of sound include the scenes where the prisoners are singing along with their work as they sledgehammer. Another great use of sound is when the main character of the film escapes the chain gang for the first time and submerges himself below water in order to escape a pack of search dogs. Before Allen submerges all that can be heard are the continuous barks of the dogs. As he goes under, everything is silent in an instant.</fullReview>

Being made in the early 30s after the first world war, there was a lot of things happening in our nation. This film did a fantastic job showing the skewed way that the justice system of the nation was working at the time, and especially how veterans were treated. Since it was based on a true story, it was very eye opening to see. It sparked a lot of negative feelings for the way people were treated, whether they deserved it or not.</fullReview>

The purpose of the film besides entertainment, was to show how horrible the Prison Chain Gang system really was. It did this very well and had a major impact on Prison Chain Gang reform. For me however, I got lost in the story. Knowing it was based on a real mans life captivated me and emerged me in his world and made me care about the injustices he endured.As for the technical aspects of the film, the use of lighting and suspenseful music together really helped to show the directors thoughts and intentions. The use of pickaxes to symbolize the time being chipped away from Allen's life was a brilliant idea. With each swing of a pickaxe a month was chipped away from his life counting down until his release. Overall it would be a great movie to safe for a rainy day at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) from Mervyn LeRoy tells the dark story of James Allen, who becomes mixed up in the prison system and placed on a chain gang to perform hard labor. The film starts off at a great pace and gets right into the story. This prime example of classic film making looks magnificent in black and white. The darkness the film-makers achieve magnifies the feeling of hopelessness. Paul Muni, the actor who plays the main character is quite talented. He does an excellent job of capturing the pain and longing of prisoners to be beyond the bars and free of shackles. Made when sound was being introduced to film, LeRoy implements many interesting techniques. Many establishing shots incorporate strong sounds. The sounds of the chains remind the viewer of being imprisoned. It is quite chilling. Many themes and ideas in this film are reflected in modern cinema, making this an awesome classic.</fullReview>

As James Allen searched for his path you really kind of felt for him. There wasn't the invisibility we see today in movies, but despite that you couldn't help but to feel for a soldier that ended up in dire circumstances. As James was caught and rendered to the chain gang, the pickaxes became a constant sound throughout the rest of the movie. The sound of the pickaxe appeared at turning points in the movie to remind you of his incarceration, driving home the change that is to occur. Also the sound of TNT exploding foreshadowed the second escape. Overall, the sound era came in strong with this film and I'd definitely recommend it to all.</fullReview>

With each battle James faces, your heart reaches out to him and you start to question what you hear about today's prisons.

Unfortunately, that turns out to be a disastrous mistake, as he is unable to find work, and ends up a vagabond. When he is in a diner with a fellow lodger who robs the place, he ends up arrested and imprisoned as an accomplice in a brutal and dehumanizing chain gang. James escapes from this nightmare, and manages to make a success of himself as a fugitive, but his old identity is discovered, and despite the fine reputation he has since built for himself, is arrested and sent back to the chain gang, where he escapes again, but is now a desperate criminal... Hard-hitting film pulls few punches in its portrayal of brutal prison conditions, and Muni is quite good, even if film is a bit too contrived at times, it does have a truly ironic and haunting end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim commentary on man's cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most striking thing about this film is that it is based on a true story. Made in 1932, it chronicles a time when sadism was practiced among the brutes who operated chain gangs in the South. We witness their use of torture in punishing convicts for the slightest transgressions. Overseers in slave times could not have been more harsh. We make the acquaintance of James Allen (Paul Muni), a good person who just can't win. He's beaten down by tendencies toward being both ambitious and trusting. Allen's first problem is that he isn't satisfied with remaining in his hometown and taking a safe job in a factory. His wanderlust shows him just how tough it is to land a decent job. The second problem kicks in when a trusting Allen doesn't realize he's dealing with a thug and gets coerced into participating in a hold-up. That's when he lands on the chain gang. After a daring escape, he finds a prison of another sort when a woman who knows his history blackmails him into marriage. He gets duped yet again when he agrees to return to incarceration to gain a falsely promised pardon. Finally he descends into a paranoid state of psychosis, doomed to a life on the run from a real or imagined pursuer. Sometimes the script in this film seems overly simplistic and childish. When James describes his aspirations, or his lady love Helen confides in him, they seem a little too squeaky-clean and idealized. Still, this is a powerful portrayal of some of the darker sides of life.</fullReview>

It's interesting to me that this corruption within the system was illustrated in such an old movie. 1932 seemed like it was not the right decade for this movie.

		<shortDescription>Powerful damning of the American justice system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Robert Elliot Burns' autobiographical novel I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!, Mervyn LeRoy's powerful drama follows war veteran James Allen (Paul Muni) who starts life as a drifter to pursue his dream of engineering. Out of work and broke, he is tempted into a free burger at a diner by a fellow drifter, only to be caught up in a robbery, to which he is forced into participation. He is arrested, and sentenced to ten years on the Georgia chain gang, where he and his fellow jailbirds are routinely mistreated and occasionally flogged. He manages to escape, and after a short spell as a fugitive, manages to work his way up in an construction firm. Years later, having established himself as a prominent member of society, he is finally tracked down. Unwilling to turn him over state lines, his new city Chicago becomes embroiled in a battle of custody with Georgia, who want to return him to the chain gang for the remainder of his sentence.Not merely a generic prison movie, I am a Fugitive... finds its power rooted in it's condemnation of the American justice system. It is claimed that Burns' experiences and eventual exposure of the barbaric nature of the chain gang led to its cancellation. These men work bare- backed in the blazing sun, hammering rocks and train lines and whatever else there is to strike, eating gruel unfit for an animal in between. These are hardened criminals (apart from Allen, who is certainly innocent, but whether Burns truly was is another question), so do they deserve a harsh punishment? Of course. Do they deserve to have their human rights taken away from them and to be treated like dogs? Certainly not. But it goes deeper than that, and, anchored by Muni's terrific performance, questions how a person can ever prove themselves fit for society. Allen becomes a pillar of his community, surely an indication of rehabilitation? And is the way to help a person get to this stage to beat them down at every turn, diminishing all sense of hope?This being pre-Hays Code, LeRoy is allowed to take the movie to places you wouldn't stand a chance of seeing just a few years later. Allen enjoys the comfort of a prostitute, looking up and down her body with an animalistic look in his eyes, adding depth to a complex character, taking his arc from squeaky-clean optimist to flawed, damaged human being. Special mention must go to cinematographer Sol Polito, who captures the sweaty claustrophobia of the chain gang, as well as framing a rather savage flogging scene with Expressionist flair, giant shadows creeping up the walls. I also ask you to try and avoid squirming during the scene in which Allen has his shackles purposefully dented for his escape, the mallet crashing down on his ankle repeatedly. 81 years after its release, Fugitive still packs a considerable punch, highlighting a heavily flawed justice system that hasn't really learned from its mistakes (see the incredible Paradise Lost (1996-2011) documentaries for proof).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a fantastic movie with a gripping plot that keeps you guessing. The movie is paced pretty well although some parts seem to drag on with nothing really happening to advance the plot. Though there are some dull moments, the rest of the film is exciting and full of tension. When he escapes the first time it's so sudden and not too far into the movie. The whole time that he was out I was overcome with anxiety just wondering when and how he was going to get caught and how bad his punishment would be. Paul Muni's acting is extremely sincere and raw. He really makes you sympathize with his wrongly accused character. Muni makes you want to root for him so much that you get wrapped up and almost feel like it's you that has escaped from the chain gang. This movie is the perfect gangster/drama film with the perfect ending that leaves you as troubled just as you are for most of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" was made just before the code era, known as the pre-code era. Overall the great part of this film was the storyline, it always kept you interested and wanting to see what happens next. In some ways it makes you cringe knowing someone innocent was accused and had to leave everything behind and now living under horrible conditions. This particular movie shows how fugitives in a Chain Gang were treated and the harsh living environments they had to endure. An interesting aspect periodically brought up in the movie was the calendars with hammers knocking down the dates that represented the amount of time Allen the innocent gang member had left in the Chain Gang. While in the Chain Gang it showed what people had to adjust to to survive and live out their sentence. This movie did take place during Great Depression and showed how unemployment and legal systems were unjust during this time period. Special effects in the movie did bring it to life and add an interesting vibe to it. The end scene is probably the most famous part within the film, even though it was unintentional. I would advise anyone to see this film that has a taste for excitement and a well done storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of the movie I was so interested in what was going to happen! I felt like everything that was happening was so awesome! It was going at a nice pace where everything was making sense and keeping me awake. But unfortunately, once he escaped and started living a normal life I started to lose interest in the film, I tried to power through thinking that it would get better but I just was not liking it anymore. Especially when he was put back in jail, I know it was based on a true story and all, but I was just extremely bored towards the second half. It also did not help that the lighting was so dark. I really wanted to fall asleep, I didn't but if I was watching this at home instead of in class I definitely would have. I would not recommend this to anyone, and if I did it would be the first half of the movie.</fullReview>

If the concepts didn't take forever to be revealed, it took a while to get past them. Overall, the quality of the film was great. The lighting played a significant role in the films art, ie. the shadow of the man getting whipped. The mise-en scene was good. It made many scenes feel as if though it were reality. The camera work was on point. Scenes where there were high speed chases, the camera worked at great angles to capture the effects. It created a feel as if you were right there in the passenger seat driving madly along with the actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with a powerful message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having being based on actual events, this film surprised me with its detailed accounts of the horrors of the prisoners of chain gangs in the 1920s and 1930s. A specific element that stands out in this movie is the sound, which had only been around for a short period of time at this point. The dialogue is clear and powerful and the sound effects are exquisite and profound. From the crack of a whip to the explosion of dynamite, the sounds in this film add to it immensely. One final important element is the lighting in the film, which is primarily dark and foreboding, which accentuates the message that is being conveyed. One scene in particular encompasses this idea, when James Allen visits Helen one last time at the very end and slowly fades away into the darkness, stating that he now lives by stealing. The irony of this is that Allen was actually an innocent and respectable man, but fleeing from the chain gang that was wrongly holding him actually turns him into a criminal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a powerful movie with a strong social message. Paul Muni truly nails the performance as Allen, with perfect expression that really creates a very realistic vibe throughout the movie. He makes the character believable (which could be made easier by the fact it was for the most part real). The most noticeable part of this film though was the sound. Stark but always effective, with no dialogue wasted. The whipping scene is particularly wicked on the ears, as well as the famous last line with its fade to black. The sheer darkness of this movie is what really got me though. I can understand how much of an uproar this must have caused by how it made me feel. I could see exactly how Allen felt and I could almost relate, the feelings of desperation, of being pushed around by a government far bigger than you that can lie without listening. Truly a riveting movie</fullReview>

The sets in each scene play great importance throughout the film and are very well done in order to show the proper environment at the time.it does a very good job of portraying the life of a chain gang and the harsh life prisoners that worked in them lived. It also incorporates an underwater shot which I found pretty amazing for it being such an early film. A lot of new avenues in the way directors shoot scenes seem to be explored.it also glorifies a criminal which portrays the 30's well because of the crime wave where tally people found the criminal lifestyle interesting and exciting.

		<shortDescription>Lessons to be learned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is an example of how people can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. A guy gets hooked into a crime, and is arrested, and forced onto a chain gang. Another lesson learned is to never mess with the law, as even though he manages to escape, he gets caught again. And the scene where the girl forces him to marry him, even though he doesn't love her... arranged marriages aren't a good system. People should be allowed to follow their own hearts, and be with the people they want to be with, not the person someone else wanted to set them up with. It was like a Romeo and Juliet Scenario. The car chase at the end was the most thrilling part of the movie, as car chase scenes generally are. This movie pushes people to never give up hope, even in the harshest conditions.</fullReview>

Most people will view James Allen, played by Paul Muni, as the victim, and rightfully so. A wrongfully accused man is throw in prison and left to the cruel and unusual punishment of the "chain gang" system that existed in early 20th century America. Allen makes a daring escape from prison. With the experience gained on the chain gang, Allen works his way up the ranks in a construction company becoming a well respected man in society only to get mixed up with a cold, selfish woman who turns him in.Allen agrees to go back to prison with the government promising to pardon him after 90 days of light duty. After 90 days Allen realizes the government he once fought for has betrayed him again. Allen finally makes one last daring escape culminating in an exciting chase scene. After a life of trying to finally be free, Allen is left to a life on the run from the same government that is supposed to protect his freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive of a Chain Gang" was a really compelling film. The surprising plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat. The story was really easy and interesting to follow along with and Paul Muni portrays every emotion that the character is feeling almost perfectly. It gave me a sense of what he was going through during his time in the chain gang. Following his escape, you can feel his sense of relief, but the ever present paranoia that he has. He has to constantly be aware of police in areas and he ultimately recreates himself, which helps for a while, until he ends up right back where he started. The rest of the story is pretty riveting, so I won't go into any more detail. What I was especially impressed with was the use of audio and sounds throughout the film. The sounds really helped emphasize different feelings and made it a bit easier to understand what these people were going through. For example, the use of sounds throughout the prison scenes were fantastic. The sounds of chains clanking, the rocks being hit with the pick-axes, the sounds of the whips, it was just all very impressive to me and really helped emphasize how terrible the prison was. I also liked how they handled the passing of time. They used semi transparent views of calendars changing months, as well as showing pay stubs. It was very effective. Great, great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B&amp;W drama, good example of early sound pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I am a Fugitive of the Chain Gang" is a black and white drama set in the 1930's. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy and released in 1932. Based on an autobiography, Paul Muni stars as James Allen, a World War I veteran who has trouble returning to civilian life. Travelling the US during the start of the depression era, James Allen is caught up in an ill-fated attempt to rod a diner. His prison sentence results in confinement with a Georgia chain gang. Rather than face years in the work camp, Muni's character escapes the chain gang, and builds a successful career. However, he is haunted by the prospect of someone finding out about his past. An early sound picture, most of the picture is filled dialogue and little musical score. Rather than fade to black, scene transitions are accompanied by a variety of sound effects. For example, the trial scene ends with the judge's gavel pounding, and then segues into the sound of pick axes hammering rocks as we see the chain gang working on a new railroad bed. The movie has several similar transitions, and makes effective use of many unusual sounds throughout the picture. The total run time is 92 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great piece of 1930's social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a 1932 prison drama about a man who keeps ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is an excellent movie. Most notably for its use of visuals and sounds, for example: when illustrating time gone by, there will be a cut to a calender, or a pay stub with the date on it. I don't know if this is the first use of such visuals in a movie but its the earliest such use I've ever seen. The movie also uses audio in very smart and clever ways. Like when Muni's character gets whipped for talking off to the prison guards, you don't actually see him get whipped, you just hear the cracking of the whip, which i think is worse. It allows for your imagination to step in and makes the scene harder to watch. This film is also a great piece of social commentary. The story and the protagonist is based on a real person. I think that's the most jarring part of this movie, that people actually had to live like that. Weather they deserved it or not is up to the audience, but it is important for people to know how 'criminals' get treated, and this movie pulls that off perfectly. Overall this is a solid movie, it joins the ranks of Metropolis, Citizens Kane, Taxi Driver, and Blade Runner as a movie that was way ahead of its time. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be simplistic, this film was well done. It had a an amazing plot and i would consider it a first kind of this movie for its time. Though in the beginning i had my doubts. I just thought it was going to be very plain and not have any real climax or anything. But i was wrong. It had a very well thought out plot and had me interested after about five minutes in. The movie really picks up and gets going after that point. I really liked the foreshadowing through out as well. The movie is about a guy who is just getting back from WWI and decides to go about and look for work around the whole eastern to mid western region. Although he doesn't find a solid job as he had hoped, he finds a semi-permanent job working in a quarry as a prisoner. Many events weave in and out until the end of the story from that point, but i can assure that it keeps a person interested. Which is really what anyone looks for in a movie.

		<shortDescription>Lighting and camera angles contribute greatly to the overall plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was overall a very good movie with an unexpected ending that accurately reflected the time period in my opinion. Paul Muni's character accurately reflected the attitude of a man during the time period; one who fought in the military and upon returning home seeks to do "mans work" such as construction and heavy labor. When Muni returns home to his family the lighting indicates the mood, portraying a happy family that is glad to see their family member return home. Upon returning to the house the picture is very light and relaxed when Muni comes out with his confession to his mother that he is a "changed man" and wants to turn over a new lead with his life. His mothers and brothers face also looks very dark which shows their concern for Muni's decision and feel that he should just return back to his old job doing paperwork because it is guaranteed. Light also plays an important role in the prison where is very dark and the mood suggests sadness and suffering among all the inmates and at the end where he is departing from the woman he loves forever; during that scene is completely dark outside and it sets the mood for secrecy and that some terrible news is about to be known. Throughout most of the movie the camera angle was stationary on the subject or subjects of the scene however during scenes of his escape from prison the angle where the guard and the surroundings can be seen tells the audience that his escape is imminent and during the scene where he is hiding under water from the pursuing guards allows the audience to see where he is hiding and that he will not be spotted. It is rather ironic that Muni recently got out of the military as an honest, law abiding man then turned into criminal by running away from prison twice; I guess it's safe to say that he definitely turned over a new lead. It is also rather ironic that he pursued a career in bridge building and then during his second escape from prison blew up a bridge to avoid being caught again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There some serious injustice in this movie!Charctor James Alan (played by Paul Muni)can't seem to get a break in life. When ever he puts a little trust in someone or excepts a helping hand he gets himself into to some big trouble! He seems to be a man with a bit of bad luck at times but he never backs down, he always stands up for himself( i liked that). At first i wondered why the traveling sounds are so exaggerated,but it soon came all together once James Alan made his first escape. Every time he is on the run you hear a train whistle or vehicle in the back round. This comes together even more so when James establishes himself as an engineer!There's one crucial quote from the movie thats James says when speaking to a women about what he builds "Anything you can get away on, but you cant ever get away" That pretty much sums up the movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" ("In brilliant black and white," makes me chuckle) impressed upon me both how influential a film can be when it reaches the proper level of attention with the public and how Paul Muni became one of the most recognized actors of his time. Apparently the success of the film led to a large population to question the legitimacy of the United States legal system and outrage great enough to lead to the release of Robert E. Burns, the original author of the memoir the movie was based on, who had since been imprisoned once more. I was struck by Muni's power?both in his presence and convictions as the protagonist. Many short scenes throughout the movie served their purpose without wasting time, such as when the re-imprisoned Allen is told that his pardon is postponed "indefinitely." A seven second shot of Muni's reaction is all that is needed to display how distraught this man has become, though he once stood respected in his community. He did not lose his cleverness or determination, though, and manages to escape once again, losing a friend along the way and continuing a life on the run through more theft?the opposite of what incarceration is suppose to influence in people, no? Though perhaps not for younger viewers, this film was great with excitement and twists that kept me engaged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a Pre-Code Era film that deals with what was, at the time it was made, the very progressive idea of government corruption. "Chain Gang" stars Paul Muni in one of his earlier performances as James Allen, a man framed for armed robbery. I enjoyed the movie while I was watching it, but I thought that some of the supporting performances were cheesy. Anyone watching the film will not be able to fully appreciate it if they use the same standards used to analyze modern films. As one of the early sound films, director Mervyn LeRoy uses stylized editing to draw the viewer's attention to the use of sound in the film. Sound effects are often used as transitions or as indicators of what will happen in the next scene. Dialogue is almost never used at the same time as the sounds. This effect is not overwhelming, however: it adds a sense of urgency to the film that helps the viewer sympathize with Allen.</fullReview>

Following the life of wrongly convicted James Allen really makes for a lot of action and suspense especially while watching his daring escapes from the chain gang or narrowly avoiding cops while on the run from the law. The message of the film though is really my favorite part of this movie. Watching the transition of James from a stern war veteran into a hardened criminal really makes one wonder if the justice system is in reality just counter productive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking film from Mervyn Leroy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although 80 years have passed since the premiere of this film it still remains one of the most smashing, distressing and harrowing depictions of prison violence in history. The story of James Allen (brilliantly and believably played by the up-and-coming Paul Muni) is both a significant, not-so-typical cautionary tale and a brave statement against inane jail systems and covert human exploitation. Upon his return home James - contrary to his family's requests - rejects the job offer from his earlier employer and decides to follow the dream of becoming a prominent architect. Unfortunately, the country's economic instability shows its true face when James rides around the country without any chances of finding real work. If this wasn't enough, one day he meets a shady character who invites him for a free burger at a nearby joint. Soon it becomes clear that this man is actually a small-time robber, and James is dragged into the whole intrigue with him, just to be found guilty with a proper trail and sentenced for 10 years on a chain gang. The enormous brutality and inhumane treatment of the prisoners make I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang a real punch-in-the-face. One day James finally finds a way of escaping from the nightmare and begins to re-live his life and finally fulfills his lifelong dream. While he soon becomes a master craftsman in the architectural industry, new problems arise thereafter. He is pressured into marrying his landlady - who happens to know his past - and when he begins to have feelings for another woman, she starts threatening his huge secret. Before long he is once again - this time voluntarily, due to his prior agreement with the prison chieftains - sentenced to hard work in the chain gang. Hoping for a one-month stay he endures another 10 years in the horrible, atrocious conditions. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a perfectly astounding expose of the unstable and literally bestial chain gang system. With its sinister ambiance and hard-hitting imagery, the film presents a grievous story of one innocent man's attempt at rescuing what's left of his already dilapidated life.</fullReview>

The darkish storyline along with gloomy photography and a rough setting really brings out the mood and themes to this film. This is without a doubt one of the best directed and put-together films of the early sound era that I have seen. The story is phenomenal and some characters in this really stick out. You feel an awful sense of sympathy for our protagonist here, and only hope he makes it through the unjust rulings of the legal system in the end...If you are a fan of the old Hollywood classics, this film is a must see.

		<fullReview>Based on a true story, "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" tells the story of the fictional James Allen, who is based on the real life Robert Elliott Burns. Paul Muni plays Allen, who is wrongfully convicted and sent to work in a chain gang for ten years. He escapes and reestablishes himself as a good citizen of society earning himself an honest living. If anything, this film is a testament to never underestimating the power of the narrative film, as this movie helped the real life Burns get out of prison and abolish chain gang slavery. The film's most disturbing aspect is it's treatment of the prisoners as well as Allen constantly being beaten by the corrupt system. Films like this are almost mandatory watching to make sure tragedies like this don't happen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting chain gang movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i can't honestly say it was the most exciting movie i have watched recently, but it did keep me entertained, and that is what movies are all about. James Allen(Muni) is wrongly accused of stealing from a burger stand and sent to prison to serve on a chain gang, and he can't handle being punished for a crime he did not commit, so he finds a way to escape and somehow gets away with calling himself Allen James instead of James Allen and gets a job on a construction crew, and a few years later once he is rich and famous he is found out by the authorities and taken back to the chain gang under the supervision of the same guard he escaped from the first time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was an interesting movie that kept the audience waiting for what would come next. It started off a little slow with a lot of traveling scenes which I'm sure had some importance, but they were definitely over used in my opinion. Then all of the sudden the movie became interesting filled with intense action scenes along an emotional side that connected you to the characters; you couldn't wait for what was going to happen next. I believe this movie was ahead of its time by having such an interesting story line followed by some really great acting. The director, Mervyn Leroy took a chance by taking someone real life story and making it into a movie, but this wasn't the only chance he took. He exploited chain gangs in general, which were seen as a useful way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prison. I believe the chance was worth taking because he made a phenomenal movie that showed a side of the law enforcement not everyone got to see. Leroy got his point across very clearly by combining the right actors, the perfect sound, and a true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is film is interesting in that it is based on actual events. The plot about him being veteran is something that we can all connect with even today. The lead, Paul Muni, did a great job of playing a desperate man pushed by everything in his life towards war, factory work, crime, prison, escape, marriage, back to chain gang. The director, Meruyn Leroy showed the lapse of time and space in several clever ways. Like a train, or moving calender. This movie deals with a lot of complex themes that is surprising to see so blatantly. I liked the film and felt there were a few redeemable characters. The story kept you guessing and really shows that it took a chain gang to turn him into a criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a WWI veteran, James Allen, who wanted to change his life when he came back, and he did. He was framed as an accomplish to a robing and put on the chain gang. After a while James decided to attempt the impossible and escape. James made it and worked his way to Chicago where he followed his dream of becoming and engineer. He was blackmailed into marriage which ended up forcing him to go back on the chain gang. When he was denied his pardon (that he was promised), he escaped, and was never seen again.This film was based off the true story of Robert E. Burns, but in the real story he actually stole the $5.29 to eat. The film hoped to show the hardships prisoners experienced while on a southern chain gang, and it was successful. This movie brought more attention to the real chain gangs and the true hardships. The ending was very dramatic because James Allen had to say goodbye to his true sweetheart forever (not his former wife). I give this film a 8 out of 10 because I thought it was very interesting and exciting (well as exciting as a 1933 movie can get)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Prison Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was a great movie. I loved the story about a man who was trying to start a new life for himself after the World War I. Paul Muni played a very sympathetic character. I really liked how they showed the horrors of the American Prison system. Paul Muni's character Sgt. James Allen shows to be a very clever man when he escapes from the prison the first time. The way he manages to be not only a respectful citizen, but someone who is an important member of society is very important for the message the filmmaker was trying to give. The warden seemed like a very one dimensional character. His reasoning for keeping Allen in the chain gang seemed very unreasonable to me. The way Muni's character changes throughout the movie was very well done considering all he has been through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A life lesson on how important ones life is, changes when he's placed into a chain gang two times. It's a remarkable how the fist time he gets thrown into this gang, he is rather accepting to an extent, he has nothing to lose. It's a totally different story when a man has something to lose, he loses it all when put into the chain gang this second time. Had me thinking of what I would do in his shoes, I would risk my life to escape myself. Also, for being a movie of an older generation, the special effects are pretty awesome, how the explosive blows the bridge into two halves is great, when Jame's friend falls from the truck nearing the end of the movie, that stunt is entertaining and must have been cleverly scripted to prevent injury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I have previously stated on this site that 'Sunrise' is one of my favorite films, and I think that i need to revise that: I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is undoubtedly THE favorite, the best I have seen come out of the '30s, the best I have seen in general. Paul Muni is truly an amazing actor who really brings his character to life and makes real the awful things that he's going through. The plot itself is just simply amazing, something I definitely wouldn't expect to come out of the '30s. It's just so complex and real, dealing with real corruption in the government, the penal system and the judiciary system. Obviously I don't know exactly what things were like at that time, but it seems like it was incredibly realistic on almost all levels (excluding the over-dramatized acting, which I feel is left over from the silent movie era when everything HAD to be over-dramatized) and is really a generally heartbreaking story. The sound quality is great and the cinematography is excellent, of course, with no more of the shakiness and much more mobility than the movies of the '10s and '20s brought. Overall just an excellent film, ESPECIALLY the ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I thought was very good, the techniques used in this movie helped tie in with the story making it better. This movie has humor, seriousness and sadness, you can tell through all the scenes in the expressions and emotions. You can feel the emotion between the characters without the words, particularly between the son and mother.The different angles that the director uses help show the differences in the characters, the low angle scene with the reverend help show him as a superior and a good man. The different angles and perspectives show how much the filming has evolved in a short time, it was not just a straight forward shot. They use panning to show scenes in a particular way. They even add an under the water scene which was a cool and different perspective that I wasn't use to seeing. They used fade in/fade out in a couple scenes to show two different images on top of each other. They had a map and the main character on the train, showing that he was leaving town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the movie the quality of the sound was not the greatest compared to present day audio but to the standards of 1932 it was amazing. The sound of the gunshots, explosions, and of the tires on the vehicles as they make sharp turns or crash is right on time and not overly dramatic. The sound of the voices were a little high pitched but that was not an issue when it came to watching the movie because you get caught up in all the excitement and the dramatic events that played out throughout the movie. The last scene as the main character steps away into the dark leaves the audience in a state of wonder, thinking about what will happen to him, the director did a fantastic job in directing that scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie thinking I was going to hate it. I knew that it was very old and possibly very boring. Being so over-saturated with special effects and large amounts of editing in film today, I've not only lost sight of what makes a good movie work, but I've forgotten what exceptional story telling is.And that is exactly what Paul Muni delivers in this film, exceptional acting. He delivers such realistic emotion, making the viewer understand his plight. The viewer becomes very caught up in this movie that come the end, we're practically cheering Muni on.Which brings me to the most memorable scene in the film, the car chase. Combining great acting and great editing director Mervyn LeRoy and actor Paul Muni show the audience what it takes to make a truly remarkable and sometimes comedic chase scene memorable. The end of the film left me wanting a bit more, not truly satisfied, I was hoping to find out where Muni ends up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film strayed away from many other films of it's time by being very unpredictable. I was constantly wondering what would happen next and found myself really hoping for the best for the main character, James Allen, played by Paul Muni. The film did a good job of making the main character likable and it was easy to get wrapped up in the film and feel the same frustration that Allen was feeling when he wasn't getting the justice he deserved. Of course no film is complete without a love story and this one contains that bit of romance needed to balance it out. This film captured my attention for it's entirety and told the story mainly through sound. The art of this film was spectacular and I found it creative that each scene was opened beginning with sound up full whether it be a train, a car, or the chains rattling.</fullReview>

This really sold the intensity of this scene! As Allen was walking through Chicago after his escape, as he walked around trying to blend in and the fear and terror he had every time a person of the law walked by, and you just held your breath as you watched these scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep harping on about abstraction in film, cultivating an abstract eye. This is not theoretical gymnastics from my view, quite the opposite. The point is that life, modern life as you and I know it now or as people did back in the Depression, is incessantly complicated and yields disappointment and suffering at every turn, it is not some ancestral sin that does this mind you, it only happens because the mind is built to compute that way. So we want to see clearly in all of this, why it is so, and preferably by illustrating examples in film.We could plainly swim across a river or find trees to forage on this side, but find it best to build bridges like the protagonist is driven to here. We're driven beings. We strive for crafty solutions to the universe. We are satisfied by complex narratives. These have to be complicated because the universe is, and building the first spears taught us to survive this way.So it has all been a conflict between the human engineer striving for complicated order and unseen forces meddling with the plans. But things will break down, sometimes for no apparent reason at all. Fate is only this notion we have invented where things break but according to higher plan and there was never any choice in the matter.In an indirect way this is correct, insofar as the universe regroups itself through spontaneous chaos, but this being part of the plan is difficult to sensibly communicate in the human level, in a way that will make us want to build anything at all to begin with. So we settle for bogus fate. In the East they have made their peace with that long ago and proof of that is their much more refined notion of fate, but they're busy these days learning from us otherwise.So this is what we have here, a film about a man fresh from chaos - World War I - who wants to create and build things that matter, yet being continuously foiled in his enterprise by callous fates. This brings him, among other stops, washed out in a barren limbo as a chain-gang member breaking rocks from sunup to sunset.He's only somewhat in control of swooping from one world to the next, prison to civilian life and back again, but each new world he enters is already preordained and carries remembrances of the ones before, usually some form of mindless laboring. He's only content when designing structures, providing plan.If the shots of chain-gang members breaking rocks bring to mind the statuesque vigor of happy worker-bees in Soviet films, the comparison is apt. The Soviets had got this part right, that you begin a world with breaking rocks, notice also in the film how simply content is the black to do what he must and always hits the nail on its head, proof of relaxed mind, but you also have to have freedom and ambition, a dream like the Americans had.So because we cannot be fully in control of dreams we have about bridging across to something and life keeps breaking down on us, remember the film was made for audiences of the Depression, we have endless karmic returns and all the misery and despair that go with living in cycles.We may contend ourselves that it was some blind crazy god who pushed him to the wrong diner at the wrong moment for a bet, but this does not bring us anywhere. Was it another god that got him out of the Belgian dugouts alive? No, sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and do the nine months in hell.So there you go, the third missing link of film noir. Dr. Mabuse had covered storytelling manipulation of reality. Blue Angel gave us the femme fatale, the staged dream of her. To my knowledge, this is the first film that presents such a despairing vision of an ordinary schmuck being crushed helpless in cosmic cogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like James Cagney, Paul Muni was a Broadway star who made it big in Hollywood, during the early sound era. And, like Cagney, his breakthrough role was that of a gangster, in a Warner Brothers film. In Cagney's case, it was in 1931's The Public Enemy, and in Muni's case it was a year later, in the original Scarface (yes, this was the film that the 1980s Al Pacino quasi-comedy was loosely based on). Later, that same year, Muni delivered his second powerhouse performance, in another black and white Warner Brothers social crime drama: I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang, directed by Mervyn Leroy, who was coming off the successful Little Caesar, which made Edward G. Robinson a star. Of the stars of the Big Three Gangster films of that era, only Muni totally escaped the shadow of gangster typecasting, but that did not mean he could not do a crime drama about another subject entirely. But, before I move on, let me return to the Cagney comparison, for while their career trajectories toward stardom were fairly similar, they also succeeded because of another similarity: both men were great actors whose styles were far more 'real' than the overt acting styles that were carryovers from the silent days, and would not be relinquished until the 1950s, when, first Neo-Realism, then the New Wave, changed film forever. And this was, like Cagney, in large part to being a Broadway and Vaudeville star before hitting film. Another similarity the two actors shared was an ability to dominate the screen. Cagney did so with sheer brute magnetism. He was, despite any roles, always JIMMY CAGNEY! Muni, on the other hand, was a sort of Lon Chaney who could transcend horror genres. Muni's face was like clay, whether in makeup or not, and one could read his characters' thoughts just by watching his facial reactions and the glint in his eyes. Simply one of the best actors in film in any era, and a good quarter century ahead of the curve in acting, in terms of realism.I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang is also a very good film, near-great. The only thing that holds it back from true greatness are a few plot holes and some weak acting from the supporting cast. It's greatest quality, though, is how relevant and undated a film it is re: race, injustice, evil, society, the so-called 'justice system,' etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God For Sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to seeing I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, I had never heard of Paul Muni, and I have no idea how. His portrayal of James Allen, a wrongfully convicted "burglar," and his transformation into Allen James, a revered construction foreman, is inspiring. Watching this film after having seen several silents, I was thankful I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was made after sound truly entered the mix in film making. There were several powerful scenes that would have been less dramatic (and thus, less impacting) if there were no audio components. One such scene depicts the group of prisoners being woken up by the sound of a chain running through their shackles. The clanking of the chain overpowers any other noise, which powerfully signifies the prisoners social and physical disabilities. The film also uses sound to juxtapose freedom and imprisonment. During his time in the chain gang, the film is full of harsh noises and yelling. As a free man, Allen's life is much quieter. Aside from being a great drama, the film serves as a sort of social commentary. It draws attention to severe injustices issued by our nations judicial system, and does a great job doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" directed by Mervyn LeRoy is an excellent film and a classic example of a suspense filled plot. LeRoy makes it very easy to identify with the main character Allen (Paul Muni) as he fights his way through a seemingly endless string of unfortunate events. At times it seemed as if LeRoy was trying to shine a light onto certain aspects of the criminal justice system shortly after World War I. The conditions shown in the film are very harsh and almost too intense. As the story progresses the viewer is sucked into the life of Allen. I found myself rooting for him the entire film due to the circumstances. The sound quality in the film is very good and almost flawless. For example, whenever the prisoners are moving in the chain gang, the sound syncs almost perfectly to the movements of prisoners. I also noticed that the acoustics of the sound change depending on the setting, specifically indoor and outdoor settings. Would recommend film to anybody interested in American classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chose to title this the false fugitive simply because the main character of the film originally did nothing wrong. He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. They did a good job at showing the characters true and honest side when they showed that he had the ability to hold a steady job and proceed far in a career of his liking. The concept i felt stood out the most to me was the questioning of the United States legal system and how truthful it actually is. Especially for the time frame of the movie i feel the audience would take a second look at how our government works. Finally i always like to bring out the symbolism in movies when i watch them and this one had a few. The sound of the train seamed to symbolize freedom to me, much because it tended to come around every time the main character was fleeing for his freedom. Whether from his original home, jail, or just running for his life, the train seamed to be his safest way of transportation.</fullReview>

In a time where chain gangs and hard labor were so prevalent, James Allen tries his best to change it. Through the hardships he endures, there isn't anyone better at revealing the horrific nature of the Chain Gangs then he himself. Not only does he have to escape legal incarceration, but he has to escape the incarceration of a woman so hell bent on using him that she blackmails him into marrying her.This move sort of began the clich Hollywood ending of dramas.

		<fullReview>Locomotion sound effects were used in this movie quite expertly to convey an additional level of depth to the occurring events. An example is when the train sounds are added to James Allen's (Paul Muni) initial escape from the chain gang; it suggested the freedom he was striving to attain. There were several additional uses of this sound as Allen traveled around the country looking for work ? all while free of the confines of his factory job back home.Similarly, the seminal ending scene's darkness was used very well to suggest Alan's loss of goodness/sanity/respectability/life as he was swallowed up by shadows of crime/insanity/failure/death.Not having seen any other movies of this style, I was struck by the overtness of the message. That the first minutes of the movie were dedicated to a message from the studio was interesting, if perhaps a bit heavy handed. It was also surprising the movie showed Allen living with a woman before they were married. It is interesting that aspect of the film was very contemporary, even though the direct subject matter (chain gangs) is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chain Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The significance of this movie portrays the idea of beating the system, or having it beat you. In the case of this movie, it is ironic how James Allen ends up escaping from the chain gang for a crime that he was forced at gunpoint to do and eventually is lied to by the authorities which leads to him back into the chain gang and a life of running and escaping from the law. In the end, the system ends up beating him; for he had to always be on the run to stay escaped from the chain gang. This film also portrayed the struggles of an ex army human being that struggles at first to make a living after the war, and leads into a life of crime. The irony in this film is enormous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow to Start, But Worth the Wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" is a great studio era drama, and features another impressive performance by Paul Muni (though his role as Tony Camonte in Scarface is admittedly hard to beat). Here, he is in a very different, far more sympathetic role, as a wrongfully convicted felon. One of this films greatest attributes is it's look and feel. The sets are well chosen, and help to make the film fairly realistic for it's time. The deplorable conditions of life on a a chain gang are emphasized heavily by this and also in the films use of sound; the constant clanging of pick axes's and hammers are maddening, and the singing of the convicts sounds absolutely hopeless. Even the sound of the hammer knocking away the calendar months to me sounded somewhat like the toll of a clock tower, sounding off the passage of time that, for the convicts, is essentially meaningless. Overall, I thought that this film was great, but I did think it had a relatively slow beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, definitely a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its age, this film is absolutely amazing and just as entertaining as anything you would see in theaters today. The crime film has always been an entertaining genre, but this movie presents it from a unique view, the view of a prisoner who has committed no crime. Being able to watch as the main character is torn down from his respected status as an army veteran and then a beloved architect, forced into a life of crime by a brutal and corrupt government power was a thrilling point of view. It also allows the viewer to get a glimpse of just how brutal the US prison system was during that day and age, and what kind of things it could do to a man, as well as how effective it really was. I enjoyed every minute of this, and would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. There is no greater life goal than the American Dream, and it's ironic how James Allen is trying to achieve this, but is being kept down by America itself. Paul Muni was a fantastic actor. He portrayed the awestruck young man trying to do big things extremely well. His descent from a hard worker with morals to a fugitive who steals is amazing, and I'm not sure any other actor could have done it as well. The use of shadows in this movie were amazing as well. The shadows that play on Muni's face as the movie goes on get progressively heavier. The best scene using these shadows was of course the end scene, where he appears from the shadows, just to disappear again and fade out. It's a fantastic, classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evils of the Chain Gang...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many films have the ability to both entertain and to tackle a social injustice. Not many films can do it well, at least. This one hits the nail on the head. Far too often, in these "crime dramas", the protagonist is someone of questionable morality that we feel drawn to liking. Not this time though. It's a refreshing twist to see the system play the villain. We really begin to feel for Allen and have no reason to feel guilty. "Fugitive" builds tension so effectively that I felt it growing inside me. I feared for Allen's well-being, and though at times predictable, I never could lose that knot in my stomach. Many of the characters were dry and brushed over and the actors that played them can be credited with this. (Yes, secondary and tertiary characters can be well acted too!) Muni steals the show however! It was a truly great performance by one of the eras greatest actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that has moral backbone to it as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a fantastic film. This movie has the suspense to make audiences hearts beat slowly. For example, The first time he escapes jail is very intense and leads you thinking for sure he's going to get caught. This movie is very thrilling from the moment he's arrested until the end. Paul Muni is great in his role of James Allen and he really shows the fatigue of what it'd be like to be in a prison labor camp. This movie is iconic and a testament to what great storytelling could be told through picture and sound. This movie also has some not so hidden messages in it. It shows how governments sometimes don't always work the way they should and how some prison conditions at the time were probably far from ethical. From the scene where he's whipped by a guard to the scene wheres he's sort of over sentenced for a crime he was forced to do at gunpoint, It shows there are certainly flaws to any system, and prisons, laws, and the courts are no exception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first black and white film with sound and I have to admit, I was captured by it. The way the camera moved around the room and the way the fading lights captured my attention was great! Certain scenes captured my mind and it made me feel as if I was right there next to James. A lot of movies now a days don't have that authentic feel anymore. The ending was depressing, in my eyes, but it made perfect sense for the rest of the film. I found it very interesting how it had so much life with sound, yet some scenes some sound was muted for dramatic effect. Some of the sounds were very important and got you to get a certain feeling you wouldn't have gotten if it was a silent film. But all in all, I was very impressed with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really was a staple in America Cinima history. The way they used the sound and lighting to keep the scenes moving or to show time lapsing. For example they use the clinks of hammers to drop the calender pages and the over lapping of a map and a train to show where he is traveling. The acting in this movie was also great, the main character Allen made you feel everything he felt. From being forced to steal money, the pain which he suffered in the chain gang, when he escapes from the chain gang, the freedom, and the pain of him returning to prison. As for the camera work the the film it was top knoch for 1932. the way they panned the camera, made the camera shake a little to make tension and zooming in on faces to get their true emotion. Over all this movie really keeps your attention and is worth watching!</fullReview>

The movie also kept you guessing unless you know the background story behind the movie. It also made me think about how the states with the chain gangs would get these fugitives in the camps and then try to find ways to keep them for free labor then when and if they try to escape they are either captured and brought back or shot and killed in the process.

The sound effects were especially good for that time period and the technology they had. The clanking of the hammers on the rails of the train tracks were very well done, as in they were in time with the scene. Although a couple times in the movie the sound was a bit delayed, I thought it was a very good attempt at making the scenes and the sounds go together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning to the movie I am a Fugitive from a chain gang through me for a loop. The all American life of a soldier returning from World War 1 was a pretty general start. I understood he was trying to readjust and go after his new hobby of building things such as bridges. Allen the main character I find to be most intriguing. His tall reserved and determined stature represents him as an honest man. Also how he travels job to job trying to pursue his "dream job" you could say. Allen runs into trouble when he decides to accompany an acquaintance to get a burger. This is when the film really started to get my interest. The sound and lack of sound in some of the scenes really made me appreciate the film more. For example in the scene where Allen is being whipped for speaking out of turn; he does not make a sound, when before him the man is whimpering and yelling. The other moment that I found to be spectacular was when Allen was trying to see if he could successfully take off his chains and it was dead silent. The use of sound in this film I think was imperative to some of the moments. I also found it moving when the chain gang was singing. It was an eerie / depressing sound almost. I enjoyed this film a lot and the action was much appreciated in this film. It did not lull or lose my interest during the duration of the movie.</fullReview>

The only things I did like about it were its metaphors for the army such as how in the army you have to do as you're told and you have to do the same in the chain gang. Also, when James just got home the girl told him he looked like a new man and the tailor tells him the same thing after he escapes the chain gang. The little things like that, I enjoyed. Just like how James finally got his hamburger at the train station. Another nice touch was how James said in the beginning that he wanted to be something special and he ended up being special because he revealed to the world how bad chain gangs were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is a great actor who puts emotion into his roles, &nbsp;unlike actors of the time. James Allen, a veteran of war, returns home wanting a change in his life. Going across the country state to state, job to job until he finds something he likes. James talks to a fellow that offers him a hamburger but soon finds out the man he is with shakes up the owner for free food and money, and forces James Allen to take it.&nbsp; Now part of a chain gang, James realizes how hard it is to get by from labor to guards that smack prisoners. He has to escape&nbsp; I really enjoyed this movie because of the action. I also enjoyed the sound aspect with the bang of a hammer as a month on a calendar The film really unfolds when James starts to plan his escape. &nbsp;My favorite scene is when he's underwater while the guard is in front of him. I love the irony how he built himself up to a good career then has it thrown away because he was blackmailed by the woman he was staying with. &nbsp; Then being thrown back into a chain gang, even worse than before, of course he's going to break out even if he dies trying.&nbsp; End scene is another favorite because a man who had fought in a war, wrongly accused of a petty robbery, good working man now has to survive by stealing and is always on the run.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent job Mr. Muni</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the movie I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang to be a highly effective and well made movie. Using the technology available at the time, (1932), it told a compelling story in a way that was moving and unforgettable.The plot was suspenseful and fast paced. It was also fill with a sad and disturbing irony. The protagonist, James Allen, is a WW1 vet who returns from the war and wants to go out on his own, be his own person, and build bridges and his own life. Instead, he's tricked into taking the blame for a crime he didn't commit and ends up serving on a chain gang. He endures unimaginably harsh treatment, survives and escapes. He then builds a good life for himself, only to be turned in by the authorities by his wife. He then gets duped into returning to prison again for what will be a very long time. He escapes again, fleeing as a broken man with no hope for the sort of life he wanted, a victim of circumstances he could never control and a social and justice system that seem intent on destroying him.Muni's acting was excellent. He made the character of James Allen both believable and sympathetic. In doing so , Muni made the movie even better because it helped the viewer care about Allen and hope that he'd somehow survive and have a good life.Adding to the effectiveness of the movie was the sound. It was new technology at the time, so it didn't always match up with the visual images, but overall, it did a good job and added to the story.The final element that I believe enhanced the story line was the fact that it was in black and white. While it was all that was available at the time, I think it was perfect for the dark and brooding world that Allen inhabited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with great use of headphone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was an excellent piece not only for the time period it was created, but also for today. Before viewing this work of art, you wonder how the headphone and the quality of the film will be, considering the early time period of movie making. However, you find yourself a part of the plot, lost in the scenes and you forget the fact that this is an early film. While there are the cheesy sounds every so often, the work of Muni and the overall work of Hawk keeps you enticed. The film is worth watching for Paul Muni himself, as he makes you a part of the film and through his words, actions, and expressions he collects sympathy from the viewers. He lets his emotions go, which is really powerful and moving in the prison scene when he cries. You'll find yourself siding and feeling bad for him in his number of unfortunate situations and events as he loses to the government(like always), and as you relate with Muni, you learn to dislike government more.The technology is another point to be brought up about this movie. While the use of headphone was obviously primitive at some points, it brought a whole new meaning and era to film making. The dogs barking during the hunt for Muni, and the chains while he was locked up are a little overbearing and unrealistic, but sound had to start somewhere and this was a wonderful example of it. Another neat technological point was the underwater scene during the hunt as well.Overall, a great film integrating new technology and a great actor, which captivates and makes you feel a part of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Hard Luck Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a look at the dark reality of James Allen. Allen, played perfectly by Paul Muni, is a decorated veteran from World War I that returns from the war a changed man. He isn't happy returning to his mundane life, so he strikes out to follow his passion, engineering. Life on the road, looking for work is tough on Allen and leads him into a bad situation. He is the unwitting accomplice in an armed robbery, and gets arrested, convicted, and sentenced to a hard labor prison camp despite his innocence. The film does a wonderful job of conveying the brutality and desperation of Allen's life as a prisoner, with great lighting and sound effects. Against all odds Allen narrowly escapes the chain gang, and starts a new life. He follows his love for engineering, turns his life around, and becomes a great man in Chicago. Unfortunately for Allen his troubled past is always lurking just around the corner, and it eventually catches up to him. He is exposed by his wife to authorities and arrested as a fugitive. His stature as a businessman affords him the right to negotiate a conditional surrender and he returns to the prison camp to serve a symbolic portion of his sentence until a full pardon is granted as promised. The deal Allen made was not fulfilled, it was actually a ploy to get him back in camp and let him rot. He will be in prison camp for a long time. As reality sets in for Allen it drives him over the edge. He makes a second escape, and is free from prison camp, but he is a changed man once again. His second escape leaves him broken, and ever fearful that he is about to be caught again and sent back. Allen's life is doomed to be a dark and dangerous one. The film is very well done, and the desperation and feelings of compassion for the main character are palpable. A very gritty, dark, well told story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a film that continuously grinds and abrases Paul Muni's character, James Allen, until it shows the tortured nature that he's feeling as he stays linked to the chain gang. It's horrible to see all the things that go wrong for this character in just the beginning of the movie alone. Muni's facial expressions are the best forms of acting I've ever seen in a long time. The way his face just contorts when he's angry or at the brink of tears is phenomenal. Also, the fact that he's a soldier really makes it hurt to watch, because despite the fact that he's a hero, he gets treated like he's just another homeless man, and then gets treated WORSE when he gets arrested. The scenes in the chain gang are haunting; sometimes they're filled with the sounds of chains or pickaxes, and then at other times, they're nearly dead silent. The abuse that the criminals take both out in the quarry or in their own quarters shows us what Allen is forced to endure for months overtime. You want to keep watching just to see what happens to Allen, and it makes for a great reason to watch this film. It's a film that shows just how far one man will go to live a normal life in a world that constantly throws chaos in his way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just started watching black and white films avidly in the last two years, and I must say this is one of my favorites. The sheer amount of emotion in every word James Allen says during his various trials and rants of escape from his internment would spark horriplation in even the strongest of men. During the scene where James is being whipped by the warden, the lack of screaming from James is a great use of the manipulation of sound to make a suspenseful moment even more powerful. Although many have disagreed with me I find the constant rattling of the chains to be quite moving, almost like the slow mournful chant of an enslaved man. I do hate to talk about the end of a movie so please, if you have not seen it look away. The ending of the movie when James fades away into the blackness is a perfect representation of a man who has lost himself to the darkness of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stark look at a "real story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? First and foremost, as a veteran this film struck a major cord with me on a personal level. I could relate to Muni's character, James Allen, and his quest to become his own man and not just do what he was expected to because others told him that is what he should do. That brings me to my first point, and a what I believe is a serious theme, or message of the film: self-determination. The inherent right of every person to decide their own fate and path. All James Allen wanted to do was live his life and be the best he could, and Muni's stark portrayal of the character was able to capture this both accurately, and with a chilling connection to the audience. It seems as though everyone else had a plan for James, and all the while, he had his own plans.Clearly from the outset things went awry, and then he found himself on the chaingang; but even the malicious treatment at the hands of the guards, and extremely poor food and housing could not deter his spirit. This is when the film really got good for me. The fact that even after his stint on the chaingang, James was able to successfully and productively rejoin society speaks volumes to the caliber of man he is. That is what I believe is also an extremely endearing message of the film, the unwillingness to accept defeat even in the face of so much adversity. To be sure, the very well done time lapse sequence in the film during which James rises in the hierarchy of "Tri-State Construction" showcases this message. To the casual viewer, this might seem to be just a visually stylish way to pass a long amount of time, however, to someone looking to glean a deeper message from the film, that is what I took away from it.Lastly, but in no way a minor issue, this film brought to light the rather deplorable conditions of the widely used chaingang system that many southern states used to employ. As most would know, this film is based on a true story, and although the name of the state where James is incarcerated is never revealed, some scholarly research led me to find out that the state was Georgia. Clearly, this film does an excellent job utilizing the relatively new technology of sound, it only having been around for about five or six years at the time, and nowhere is there more evident than during the scenes where James is on the chaingang. The scene where James and another prisoner are being whipped for "insubordination" makes excellent use of the contrast of sound, while at the same putting on full display the harsh conditions of the chaingang system. additionally, when the black prisoners begin to engage in singing old spirituals, the viewer, or at least this viewer, is immediately, for lack of a better word, "moved." It is hard to describe the exact feeling, sufficed to say, that the scene is very captivating. Overall, I enjoyed watching this film and would recommend it to others who might be interested in learning about what the world was like back in that time. Oh, and Paul Muni's acting was beyond phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Movie- Must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be absolutely incredible in every way given the time period during which it came out. From what I understand this was one of the first full-length "talkies" where actor's spoke and the sound portion was attached directly onto the film as to synchronize the visual and audio together. Although it was black and white, the editors did a great job of splashing hue's of colors onto certain scenes to suggest different times of day. For example, when Allen is in the midst of his 2nd stint with the chain gang the landscape is tinted a brownish-yellow as to suggest the hot sunlight beating down upon the laborers. Scenes occurring at night are shaded with dark blues, gray, and black, and so on.I believe the most surprising part of the whole film was the emotional connection the film was able to make with its viewers. Most old films I have seen are a bit dry in terms of feeling real or making any sort of connection with me as a viewer. Paul Muni does an excellent job of selling his emotions and making us really feel for his character- this was the first pre-1960's movie I've seen that has really been able to establish that connection (and this was made in 1932!).Funny, Dramatic, Exciting, Suspenseful, Action filled, Emotional. Even a car chase to boot! loved this movie, you will too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of the movie, the character Jim begins his desk job at the business his father recommends. As he gets settled in at the desk, you can notice the background sound effect dubbed in after editing of construction and yard work outside. At a cinematic point of view, I feel they did a great job with their tracking shots, vertical pans; as show at the scene when he walks down the train tracks. At the scene where members of the chain gang ask how Jim got in here, I noticed they cut all sound out of the film as Jim shrugs his shoulders in despair. I really cant complain at all about this movie. I really enjoyed it with the time era and storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a powerful and vivid film that effectively depicts the injustices of the legal system of the time. Paul Muni gives a masterful performance in his role as the down on his luck average Joe, who is unjustly imprisoned and forced to suffer the brutality of being in a chain gang. The brutality of the prison scenes are certainly effective in conveying the social critique desired by the filmmakers, and it showed as the public began to distrust the legal system's legitimacy. Prisoners in the real world began to appeal their wrongful imprisonment, and many won there release. The strong social commentary in the film make it good, but the acting and action escape scenes are what put this movie over the top. Paul Muni delivers in this Pr-Code gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a very socially conscious film. In a time when many people didn't see films as a means to push a social and political agenda, Mervyn LeRoy's film takes aim at the injustices of the prison system in America. Paul Muni turns in a great performance as James Allen who's wrongful conviction lands him in a southern chain gang. After escaping he is exploited again by the justice system in order for them to save face. On top of pushing a socially and politically charged message, the film is shot incredibly well. The lighting in various scenes captures the mood and feelings of the prisoners as well as portraying the solitude of prison life. The ending of the film contains a great fade out of the scene which has been said to have happened by a lighting accident. IN short, LeRoy was able to combine high artistic quality with a social/political agenda to bring together a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tackles the age old topic of a good guy doing a bad thing. Although technically a criminal we come to find that he is actually a decent guy and successful as well. This socially conscious film analyzes the faults and flaws of the American Justice system. The use of silence in this film forces you to focus on the characters and the images displayed. Heavy shadows and use of lighting has a dramatic effect and helps set the tone of different scenes very well. The story is well written and very interesting with a few unexpected twists along the way. This movie,although quite old is still relevant today and i think that makes it a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) marked the beginning of a new era in filmmaking; the rise in movies that tackled social problems. The film's stark and grim depiction of life on a chain gang was so horrendous, that it actually sparked some social change. The fact that a movie was able to do something so fantastic, says in itself how fantastically well made the movie itself was. Though a grim movie to be sure, the acting by Paul Muni, as a twice escaped chain gang member, is incredible. His superb acting is incredibly effecting, and as an audience the change in his demeanor as times goes on is totally organic. So that in the last scene, before the light goes out Paul Muni is almost unrecognizable as his former self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie! I think Paul Muni is an incredible actor. i was asked to pay attention to sound during this film and i noticed a few scenes where the sound really stood out. One was when James was taken to be whipped and everything goes silent except for the piercing sound of the whip striking his bare back. It really allows the audience to feel what James is going through. Also during this scene the camera pans across the faces of the other prisoners sitting up in bed listening quietly to the whipping. this substantially adds to the power of the scene. The second scene that sound stood out to me was when James is walking alone down the middle of the train tracks. The sound is similar to the whipping scene, where everything is silent except for James' footsteps on the tracks. It really creates, in my opinion, a sadness. Maybe not necessarily James being sad, but the audience feels sad for him because we know that he has been wrongly accused and has had to suffer a great deal for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far one of my favorite films Paul Muni the star of the film did a great job in playing the innocent man charged with a bogus crime. The film which was made in 1932 really showed the sufferable conditions of the penal chain gang system. He eventually escapes the chain gang only to be turned back in after a fem fatale transforms him from a successful civil architect living under a different name back into a prisoner. As far as cinematography there was a great underwater shot and by far the most striking scene was the last scene when Paul Muni fades into the darkness reveling how an innocent man had been transformed into a criminal by the unjust penal system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang (1932) directed by Mervyn LeRoy is based on a true story about a man who had escaped from jail twice. Paul Muni plays the role of the main character who escaped from jail twice, and he does a masterful job of being a round character. What really stood out to me in this film was how they imaged life back in the ending of World War I. Another thing that stood out to me was that they exposed how horrible the law was back then as far as convicting an innocent person. It makes me think that back then you were "guilty until proved innocent" rather than you are innocent until proved guilty. I think this film really opened the eyes of Supreme Court Justices and they learned from the experience that actually was a reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) featured an amazing performance from Paul Muni. I was instantly drawn in to the story. That is to say once he got put in the chain gang I was drawn in, everything before that was good, but it wasn't the pulp of the story. The escape scenes were suspenseful, I found myself silently cheering him on as he made his narrow escape. All the wrongs he endured throughout the course of the film, the audience can't help but feel a connection with James Allen (Muni) and hope for the best for him. And to think, it's based on a true story! The film had amazing lighting, and did an great job at setting the dismal mood of the chain gang experience. I especially liked the character's quick thinking when he took out the bridge. Who would have thought he would actually escape twice.</fullReview>

The story behind it is so captivating, compelling, luring and emotional that I completely forgot I was watching a movie. The acting was so intense and emotional that it really complimented the story and content of the film. Mervyn LeRoy is a genius. Paul Muni who plays convicted fugitive James Allen played his part so well that I think I actually grew too attached to his character? The film also had incredible photography, very interesting lighting and excellent camera movement. I feel the movie conveyed so much emotion I actually felt horrible during some parts of the movie, but in a good way. I felt for Mr. Allen and the other fugitives who were being brutally mistreated by their own state laws. This movie is outstanding, it is so well done. The story is just conveyed in such a luring way, I think it's impossible to hate it. Their is so much to learn from this movie, about how so many good people who are put in wrong situations suffer unnecessary negative consequences. It's sad to think it's based on a true story, but the movie itself was excellent.</fullReview>

While the acting is superb the film uses some effective lighting and even better sound work to provide powerful atmosphere and tone for the film. Sound makes itself very important providing ambiance and setting the mood. It acts as an emotional tool allowing events and situations to happen off screen but still be understandable. Sounds are used to warn of impeding events such as a siren or the barking of chasing dogs. With sound being included silence becomes a much more powerful tool and define several scenes rather than hinder the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and timeless social message...with a dump truck chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932) is a terrific motion picture that has two glaring faults. One, the title is way too damn long, but that had zero impact on my enjoyment of the film. The second and much more meaningful fault is the climactic dump truck escape at the end of the film. This seems like a case where the filmmakers were attempting to throw in some gratuitous and fantastical action into a piece about morality and righteousness as they didn't trust that audiences would pay to watch a film based just on social commentary. Perhaps the filmmakers were correct in that estimation but without the chase scene the film would have been a solid 9 for me, with the chase, it's a 7.The social messages of the film, the mistreatment of war veterans and the cruel and unusual punishment of the chain gang penal system are incredibly powerful. Seeing Paul Muni's heroic and well respected NCO treated so poorly by his family, his former boss and "his girl" upon his return from war and his struggle to re-enter civilian life provides a message that is still incredibly relevant today. The other message, that of the cruel practice of chain gang labor for prisoners, is also still relevant today as even though the practice is a thing of the past, the US continues to struggle with creating a penal system that actually rehabilitates criminals rather than just punishing them. Muni's performance as a strong but broken man is brilliantly complex and subtle. The story paints the character in a bit too positive a light, making him a complete innocent who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time but this was probably done as the filmmakers assumed the audience would have less sympathy for the character if he was an active participant in the initial robbery. But where the story makes Allen a flat good guy, Muni's performance reveals a more interesting dark side to the character.The final chase scene detracts from an otherwise great film that is definitely worth watching for the powerful message and equally powerful performance by Muni.</fullReview>

It was well done and had a very good storyline. After watching silent movies this film made me realize how much sound brings to a film. not only is it easier to sympathize with the characters but it is also a lot easier to follow the storyline. There were definitely scenes in this movie where sound had a large impact, and though i know, i missed probably, the most important of them (not being an avid movie watcher)i did notice the affect of sound was in the chain gang scenes; it added to the mood of the moment to be able to hear all the guys chains clinking and dragging, the sounds of their hard labor, and even the sounds of punishment when they didn't do as they were told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the ways we judge a film is by how much emotion t strikes up within us. If the cast and crew of a film can make us feel for or fell the same as a character their doing their job brilliantly. Hence why I gave "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" such a high rating.I couldn't recall a point where I didn't feel sad or angry for James Allen; occasionally happy but that was a rare emotion to fell during this "heart breaker". Allen was hit again and again with tragedy after tragedy occasionally spying a glimmer of hope only to be let down in the end. All this man wanted to do was make something out of himself and create structures that would help people go about with their life's everyday. Something that he could look at and say, "I created that,"but thanks to one crooked man and the corrupt legal system of Georgia he was incarcerated time and time again only to become a wandering vagabond who had to steal just to survive. Isn't life a bitch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen very many old films. But to me the progress that film has made is amazing. I just a short period of time films went from being silent to full of sound. The sound in this movie helps declare its accuracy. While working in the factory it helps to have sound. Hearing the level of volume and the machines at work shows how rugged of a job it must have been. The use of sound also shows Paul Muni's characters strength. While getting whipped he did not shout. The picture shows things in motion, for example the train moving. I was very impressed with that. This film is realistic. Everyone can compare to the struggles of life Muni's character faced. After being incarcerated he came back and was a successful part of society but those searching for him judged him on his past. There were elements of racism and slavery. The black man in the chain gang was perceived to be large and strong. The use of dim lighting in the film helps depict the gloominess of the jail. I like Paul Muni as an actor. He plays his mysterious character very well. I did enjoy this movie. Compared to others before that time it was advanced. The plot was rich and moved scene to scene frequently enough so I did not get bored with it.</fullReview>

I am shocked that a movie from the 30's could not only keep my attention through its entire length but make want to watch it again. Not only is the storyline interesting but quality of the filming was amazing. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang has officially been added to my top ten favorites. I believe there is nobody that would have been a better fit for James Allen than Paul Muni. The sounds in the movie really play an important role in helping the viewer get a feel for how the convicts feel. The way the sound of the chains made even me feel hopeless and a little depressed.I could tell a distinct difference in James Allen's voice once he was locked in chains. At the end of the movie when James is talking to Helen you can hear the desperation in his voice and it seems the harsh reality of being wrongly convicted and then double crossed has combined with the inhumane way the prisoners were treated to apparently drive him mad. I would love to see if a modern production company could re-make this movie and do as fantastic of a job with it. This is an excellent movie from start to finish and I will be recommending it to my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound techniques hit the nail on the head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I found particularly interesting in this film was the sophisticated use of sound and light alongside the acting and dialogue. Throughout the film sound was used to evoke imagery, where before in silent films expressions had to create imagery, films could now incorporate sound with movement to emphasise a change and create a connection with the audience. What really resonated with me was using sound to represent time passing. Like when they used the sound of work, whether from the "chain gang" or when the main character, James Allen, is working on the bridge, to make a calendar change from month to month as time passes.I also found the use of light to be equally stimulating. For example, I personally found it intriguing how the time of day affected how easy it was to detect the striped outfit of the "chain gang" members. When it was dark out, they all blended together much like a zebra herd would, but when it became light, you could individually separate them. Whether executed like this on purpose, I found a message in this stating how members of the "chain gang" are viewed in different situations.This film had an especially loud voice since it was based on a true story and uncovered some of the truths of our justice system at the time making it an irreplaceable part of our history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great to watch and I enjoyed every minute of it. I think part of what kept me so interested is that it was based on a true story and the events that took place, including escaping from jail twice was fascinating.I found myself on the edge of my seat at every moment, wondering what was going to happen next. This movie shows that our justice system has many flaws. All the main character, James Allen, played by Paul Muni, did was attempt to get food with a man he did not know. The man turned out to be a criminal who intended to rob the restaurant that they were at. The police showed up and it made James look bad. He was arrested for a crime that he did not commit and sentenced to 10 years in prison.This shows how unfair life can be and especially the justice system.

They were poorly done and over in 3 seconds. They basically consisted of Muni asking for work, they say sorry, then he travels 300 miles, repeat... I mean come on.

		<fullReview>Paul Muni acts as the devastatingly moving character, James Allen, who returns to his hometown a WWI war hero. Influenced by the work that he did while he was over seas, James, controversially, decides to give up his stable factory job and hit the road in order to find engineering work. Tough travel results in little reward because of the lack of employment opportunities. His true downfall begins when he meets a seemingly kind stranger who holds him at gunpoint while directing him to rob a food joint.James was wrongfully sentenced to 9 years in prison; from there the film begins to exploit the tragic living conditions for prisoners in these "chain-gangs". It was a bold move on Warner Bros. part considering the serious social statement and agenda-setter attitude of the film.Paul Muni managed to capture my heart as his character withstands the turbulent ups and down of then escaping prison, building his reputation as a very well respected engineer - while being blackmailed by his wife - and then having it all ripped away when she finally betrays him after years of marriage. Then he ends up back in jail. Throughout the movie we can feel the injustice through his effectively melodramatic performance.In my day and age is it difficult for young adults to understand this true injustice because of the severe ramifications that have been made to the prison system since the 30s; although it is absolutely correct that this film has withstood the test of time because it questions what our country stands for, Freedom, today we just ask the question in a different language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this wonderful film for my American Cinema class, and was a bit hesitant to let myself like this movie. I am not usually one for a crime drama, let alone a black and white movie. However the fast paced plot as well as Paul Muni's wonderful and believable acting kept me well intrigued. My favorite part about this movie was not the acting or the plot, but the use of sound. In a less than technological age, the use of sound in this movie was spectacular. Sound allowed the audience become aware of their surrounds, allowing for a new dimension of film. When James came home in the very beginning of the film, we heard the boats in the background and when he was on the chain gang, we heard rustle of chains and and hammering of rocks. Sound allowed us as the audience to suffer the pain the man was facing when he was facing a beating in the other room, with the sounds of whipping and yelling. Sound also allowed us to experience the passage of time when the effects of something as the train or the hammering of rocks would fade in out. Amazing movie, amazing acting, amazing effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This black and white film, in my opinion is ahead of it's time. The story line was dramatic and really realistic as it should be. What made this movie great was how the sound was used within each scene. The emotions that were brought up by just one's thoughts or even the character's facial or body expressions were very moving. For example when Allen(Paul Muni)returns home from WWI he is trying to adjust back into everyday life. Then he hears an explosion from a nearby construction site and his automatic reaction is to take cover. This simple piece of background noise is dramatic, emotion and memory invoking to the character and the audience. One easily sees him on the battle field and taking shelter. Another great scene from this movie is the whip and although we do not see Allen punished we hear every snap and it is even more powerful and emotional. The timing of the sound also creates a sense of foreshadowing.One thing that is very moving about this movie is that of the treatment of the prisoners. I might personally agree with maybe the labor for the criminals who committed horrible crimes. However for those like Allen who committed minor or even "twisted" crimes such as small theft or forced theft, the time sentenced is unreasonable and wrong. The movie does a wonderful job at making the viewer feel a sympathy pain for any of those suffering men and even more so when Allen (who is a good man) can not escape the doom over his head even when he has escaped. Overall I would suggest this movie to anyone even those who shy away from the old films. It is a well directed by Mervyn leRoy and is a movie that is sure to continue standing against time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Underrated, Unknown Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Allen (Paul Muni) returns from the military, hoping to start a new life. After venturing out, he gets unknowingly involved in a robbery and sentenced to hard labor. He hates it -- naturally -- and escapes. But how do you stay escaped if you can never return to your old life? This film is not well known these days, and it is is a shame. One reason I suspect this is, is because of the really bad title that makes it sound like an exploitation film or something. But, in fact, the story is excellent and Muni carries it with a great range of emotion... if you only know him from "Scarface", this change will be a treat.This film has the classic scenes of the bloodhounds chasing a man, and a very interesting way to evade detection underwater. I like the use of maps to show where Allen travels across the country. He may not be getting the construction employment he wanted, at least not at first, but he sure is seeing the country.There is a nice subplot of blackmail, a curious question of how the post office finds people -- or of people opening others' mail -- and a fair amount of twists and turns, perhaps even depth. By 1930s standards, this film is quite rich and should be seen by more people, especially if they like "O Brother, Where Art Thou".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful yet dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is film is an honest look at the treatment of criminals in a southern prison system after World War I. It depicts the effects of the Great Depression on the common man. The basic theme is that every person deserves their basic civil rights despite their background and that anyone can come from nothing to become a prominent figure in society. The lighting of this film is remarkable. Many scenes are dramatically bathed in darkness letting the viewer see only what is important. Sound also played a big role in setting the film, the constant sound of sledge hammers reoccurs to emphasis the constant struggle of the prisoners. The film also makes clever use of off screen action like in the scene where James is taken to another room to be flogged, the camera does not follow him into the room but remains stationary allowing the viewer to hear the hits of the whip and the cries of pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Muni</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1930's Paul Muni was as big a star in Hollywood as there was. Warner Bros gave Mr. Muni a wide berth because of his artistry and that Muni's films brought great prestige to the Studio. Paul Muni was known to be very difficult but who could argue with the results of his work? In the 30's Muni starred in "Scarface" "I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang", "Juarez" "Emile Zola" "Louis Pasteur" and on loan to MGM for "The Good Earth". Director Mervyn LeRoy-one of the true professionals in the Industry who could direct a harrowing film like this but also films of other genre's such as Gypsy- tells the story of the horrors of Chain Gang's that were used to punish prisoners. Brilliantly done. Brutal, harrowing and due to this film Chain gangs were soon to be eliminated in the US.Paul Muni was a great actor, and his work deserves renewed appraisal as one of Hollywood's greatest actors and stars. Bette Davis who worked with Muni and took second billing to Paul Muni in "Bordertown" and "Juarez" claimed he 'disguised himself too much' and felt in person he was very attractive. After Paul Muni left Warner Bros., Paul Muni found other studios less inclined to tolerate his temperament and his Stardom faded. Paul Muni returned to films in the late 50's and got a deserved Oscar nominator for Columbia's "The Last Angry Man". Paul Muni's last role was in a guest shot in the TV series Saints and Sinners</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually really enjoyed this movie. Its emotional and gripping. Kept me as viewer really enthralled and interested which I personally think is hard to do. And what a plot! Never once did the movie get boring. One of the highlights for me personally , is a chase scene on a bridge, with some major destruction. I was very impressed by this scene. Great effects for that period of time in my opinion. This was my first time ever seeing anything with Paul Muni, but he was extremely convincing and gripping as James Allen. The other thing I thoroughly enjoyed about I Am A Fugitive From A Chaingang is the great social point it makes. Depicting conditions in prisons, and how easy it is for criminals to get sucked back in. For example James Allen was placed in prison, when he really didn't do anything, but running from the law eventually makes him a convict. It's a great example of how well someone can do if people arnt aware of their past, and how easily people can get involved in criminal messes. I was actually surprised that this movie was allowed to have this message, due to the censoring of the time period. Overall, great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film and thought it was a great example of how crime movies were. What I really loved about it was how, it showed such crime and corruption, and a good example of it at that, but without too many guns, blood or sex. Most of the crime movies in the present day have too many ridiculous guns, dramatic ways that the enemies die or too many overly sexual women. Another point I found interesting was this movie was from when sound was just starting out and was done very well. I felt the sound gives the characters more depth and the audience can relate better to the characters on the screen. Before with the silent films, just the music would tell the story, now with sound, the audience can really get inside of the characters head. I feel that if this film did not have sound it would not have been as dynamic as it was with the sound. A perfect example of this would be at the end of the film when Paul Muni's character, James Allen, yells "I steal!". This is iconic because society had turned him into the person they thought he was and the person he never wanted to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie staring Paul Muni as James Allen; a bright and enthusiastic world war I veteran. Jame's experience in war changed his perspective on things and upon his return home vowed to make something of himself, some how, some way. i thought the movie is dramatic, but i noticed some subtle humor was thrown in too. I'd say that the movie's overall message is that you cant run and hide from your problems because eventually it will catch up to you. In Mr. Allen's case after escaping from a chain gang and becoming a success in Chicago his past caught up to him and was forced by law to serve out his sentence. The movie displays in detail how the southern states chain gangs were during that time period. grueling wok days that Mr. Allen wanted no part of. its a great movie, kept me on the edge of my seat at times. i would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Mervyn LeRoy's "I am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang" was a very entertaining, captivating, and well developed film. For starters I thought that Paul Muni fit the part perfectly. He pulled off the look of an early hard working post war veteran. What really impressed me was how well Muni acted out his characters feelings and emotions while locked up in prison as well as after he'd escaped.I also found the in-studio sets to be very impressive on accounts of how real they were made to look, like the prison barracks for example or the actual jail house itself. The characters were the most gripping part of the film for me. Muni made it extremely hard not to sympathize with James Allen and root for him in the end.</fullReview>

Where he has to do hard labor which he didn't want to do, and only after he escapes from prison does he make something of himself, but hes criminal on the run.

The actors were great were great the scenes and effects were pretty complex considering when it was directed. One thing I found funny was the two different girls Allen was with throughout the movie because I was unable to tell the difference between them also I found it hysterical that his wife used black-mail in order for him to stay married to her; I didn't know they used that technique back then! Now everyone says that one of the major points of this movie was to expose how brutal the jail system was; however, as far as I'm concerned if you did something bad enough to land yourself in jail then you deserve to live in misery for as long as the courts say. Although, I did find it unfair the second time when Allen offered to go back to jail on account that he would be let out in 90 days and never was!</fullReview>

I really have no complaints about this film other then a few bit performances but these roles are so small that you will hardly notice, and also because the focus is never really taken off of Muni.

		<fullReview>A very emotional and moving picture, this film portrays Paul Muni as James Allen, a noble citizen harshly effected by a crooked justice system and economic hardships. James Allen who quits his job in search of happiness during the great depression, struggles to earn anything and is falsely accused of robbery and sent to a punishing chain gang. This film is full of moments that seem unfair to Allen and infuriated me, which is what I think this film was made to make viewers feel. Like when Allen foolishly runs out of a dinner with stolen money, or when he is extorted into marriage by his (for lack of a better word) bitchy wife, or the worst of all when Allen receives word that he will not be pardoned. The emotions in this film are strong and extreme, and work in the best ways to represent a man who is ironically left with no other options but to become a criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's too much to say about this film. What's most disturbing about it is how relevant its social commentary still is, as well as its representation of all the evil* roles in the administrative world. The film makes constant comparisons between the army, the job life, and prison. Marriage too, which is hilarious. Allen(Muni) survives the army, escapes prison with his life, only to become a prisoner of marriage- which is the only one of those things he's unable to outsmart. The film is full of awesome subtleties in the acting and writing that I could go on and on about. For instance, I superficial remark Allen receives about the uniform by the girl that meets him when he gets off the train, and his flustered reaction to it was great. It's the first of many times in the movie where he's treated like an object. And it's been said, but, considering when it was released, it's a very gracefully directed film. For example, the scene where Allan escapes for the first time was fantastic. There's really nothing awkward about anything in the film. Again, the movie's horrifying. Today, in present time, there are people involved in similar situations in psychiatric wards and so on. So, 80 years later things haven't entirely changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Firstly, I thought that the writing in the movie was very good, I was really able to sympathize with the main character. Through the whole film all he ever wanted was to chase his dreams and do the right thing. The movie really makes you angry about the injustice of the law system and about the unfairness and inhumanity of the chain gang system. I was surprised at how suspenseful the movie was, being as old as it is. In my opinion the film makers did a really good job making the film exciting. Especially during the chase scene at the end.I am really impressed at how well sound was used in the movie, seeing as how it is one of the earliest films to incorporate sound; my favorite example being the depressed sounding singing of the men on the chain gang. It does a great job of producing a really sad atmosphere. I've seen the technique used in other movies as well, but this has to be one of the first films to use it, if not the very first. I did chuckle a little when I heard tires squeal on dirt during the chase scene, but I get why they put the sound effect in there. It's just one of those small things that film makers don't get away with anymore.The ending was exceptionally sad. But it was also really interesting. The main character slowly backing into the darkness shaking his head was a really effective sequence and I'm really impressed that film makers were able to come up with something cool like that so early on.</fullReview>

Since he got caught up in the wrong people and got into trouble, in the end he ended up turning into what he was claiming he wasn't.

		<fullReview>The film "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," is a very good story with much irony. This irony is shown at the end when Jim Allen explains that the reason he stays alive and lives is stealing. The irony in this is that he was put into the chain gang for stealing in which he did not do willingly. There is also irony because the people who represented the state of Illinois said that the chain gang turns people into good, hard working citizens, which was actually the complete opposite for James Allen.The effects of this movie were also very realistic. The car chase showed many good effects. You could hear the brakes, all the sound effects, the spinning of the car. This all seemed very realistic for 1932. It was also interesting that the ways of the chain gangs were exposed, such as the horrible living conditions, the lack of sanitation, and the uneatable meals. Along with the terrible working conditions, being hit and whipped by the wardens. For being made in the 30s, this movie had many great characteristics of a modern day film.</fullReview>

This film was much different than a silent film, although it was made only a few years after silent films were popular. The cohesiveness, editing, and picture quality were all impressive, not to mention there's sound. Most importantly, this film stands out for its time, revealing facts about life as a prisoner, and conveying that an ex-con can make their way up in the economy. Revealing that life in a chain gang is inhumane, was not a fact that was publicly expressed. However, the film was a good representation of social injustice. It was upsetting that at the end of the film Allen had to become a criminal again just to stay away from being part of the chain gang for a third time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had many interesting aspects. The greatest advance is the use of sound. There were many parts where sound added effect where a silent movie could not have. When the man first escaped from the chain gang the hounds were chasing him. You could not see the dogs but could hear them in the background which made it very suspenseful. Also while he was in prison during the lashing scene sound made it very dramatic. The first man to be lashed was crying out in pain while the James was silent. Silence was also used while he was escaping. When he hid under the water you could see the cops looking for him but there was no sound. He used a plant sticking out of the water to breath. I think this is one of my favorite parts because it reminded me of something you would see in a cartoon today. There was also a lot of irony in this film. James was an engineer who loved designing bridges and roadways. In the end he had to blow up a bridge in order to be free. You could tell as he held the dynamite that he felt terrible having to blow it up. It was also ironic that the chain gang did not make him a good citizen in society as the police forces claimed that it would. He ended up having to steal in order to survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gamble for Warner Bros deems itself a Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was instantly intrigued by the main character in this movie. Paul Muni is certainly a standout. Throughout the movie I kept thinking of how much he reminded me of James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. His method of acting and the way he carries himself is very similar to Dean. I also thought that in certain scenes, Muni almost resembles a young Sinatra, appearance wise. For 1932 this film was exceptional. It held my devote attention for the full 93 minutes. The fact that this film was based on a true story captivates my attention even more. The film takes the viewer on a journey back nearly eighty years to see first hand what prison was like. The lack of democracy was evident, the seriousness of crimes that are considered petty in todays standards really stuck out in my mind. The film encapsulates a sense of rebellion, which i think 99% of the population can relate to on differing levels. For me, I enjoy watching people defy the law, and rebel against set standards in defendance of their own personal values and beliefs. The year is 1932 and sound in movies is something new. Warner bros goes against the grain and takes a risk by adding sound. Honestly, I do not see, nor comprehend why people wouldn't want sound to run alongside of a movie. Perhaps its similar to the mid 1950's when Elvis introduced a whole new wave of culture, only to be caster-sized by the generation before him that was into tight buttons, short hair, and traditionals. The sound really makes this film what it is and validates Warner bros gamble as being a big success. Interesting to look back into the mindset of society in that day. The chain gang was instituted to a man in need of correction, based upon their offensive of the law. This film is constructed to show James Allen ( the main character ) doing unjust time, and in the process is supposed to conform to a " better sense of character ", but instead learns to steal, and break the law to just-fully obtain freedom. The film basically is set out to indirectly mock the Georgia chain gang system. I love justice, and believe that no matter what your title, position, or rank, you should be held accountable or your injustices. Robert Elliott Burns boldly stands up for himself, and all the men who were victims of this cruel, and disgusting form of criminal rehabilitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty prison social drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So begins the gritty prison drama, or at least an early incarnation of the genre. Paul Muni stars as James Allen, a young man freshly back from WWI who wants to make a name for himself. Instead of returning to his job at a factory, he hits the road looking for an engineering job. He soon arrives in New Orleans, where he is falsely accused of stealing $5 and change. He is sentenced to work on a chain gang. The inhuman conditions eventually drive him to make a daring (and painful) escape. He moves to Chicago where he finally gets a job as an engineer. He works hard for several years, continually being promoted. He ends up being one of the most respected members of Chicago society. Along the way he meets a girl who discovers his past. She uses this blackmail him. He finally calls her bluff when he wants to marry the girl he loves. The blackmailer turns him in to the police, who want to send him back to the chain gang. The city of Chicago does not want him to go. They feel he had paid his debt to society. The prosecutors from Louisiana promise him that if he willingly returns, he will be pardoned after 90 days. He agrees, as he merely wants to move on with his life. Once back on the chain gang, the prison system soon recants on their promise. He escapes once again, this time doomed to spend the rest of his life on the run.It is imminently clear that this film has a social message. The story is based on the true memoirs of Robert E. Burns. He had hoped to expose the cruelty of the chain gangs. One scene in particular that is highly effective is where Allen his plotting his escape. The prisoners are working on removing railroad tracks. He asks a fellow prisoner to hit the shackles on his ankles so that they will bend. He will then be able to slip out of them. This means that his ankle is being hit with a sledge hammer. His desire to be free and the escape the torment of the guards is so strong that he is willing to endure this. In the end it is implied that the injustice of the system has turned him into a fearful, desperate criminal. He is willing to do almost anything to stay alive and free.One particular movie that is of the same vein is The Shawshank Redemption. Both are about a man wrongly accused. Both are about a corrupt system. Both involve escapes. Shawshank is much more about the people and their friendships. IAAFFACG is more socially aware. It is effective at making us empathize with the convict. Paul Muni does an effective job in his role. He has almost a boyish quality about him. In this movie it makes him seem like an innocent everyman. Muni was also in Howard Hawks' Scarface. In that film, Muni's boyish quality makes seem a childish truant, which is what his character essentially is?a heartless, sadistic one at that.LeRoy's direction is very good. His visual style is not overly complicated, but it is nicely creative at times, and far from mundane. There is a scene where footage of the chain gang working is overlapped with the picture of a calender. The men are singing and swinging their hammers in time with the music. The pages of the calender turn with each strike of the hammers. I thought this was an interesting touch. The final scene is also very memorable, as James Allen gradually faces into darkness. Very effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal realism stifled by an improbable (but true) story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", released in 1932, was meant as an indictment of the inhuman conditions faced on chain gangs of the era. While the intent is admirable the execution strikes me as somewhat dishonest.Although the screenplay appears to be pretty close to the truth (at least Robert E. Burns' version of the truth) the character of James Allen seems precisely designed to evoke our sympathies. Of course we'd feel sorry for an innocent man but how many of those on chain gangs were actually innocent? Personally, I'd be more sympathetic if Allen had been driven to commit the crime due to the desperation of his situation. That would give more weight to the secondary theme of the mistreatment of returning WWI vets.As for the acting, Paul Muni gave a good performance in the lead role and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his efforts. The supporting cast is uniformly competent but not particularly notable. The direction by Mervyn LeRoy is capable and shows some verve at times. Overall, the film is technically sound if not especially impressive.In the end, the truth upon which the film is based resembles Hollywood fabrication so much that it hurts the picture, especially since realism is one of the film's goals. So, while the film may not be truly dishonest the message is adversely affected by selective honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wrongly convicted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie dealt with the tricky subject of our legal system and how justice is truly measured. In this film the character of James Allen is wrongly convicted of a crime that he was forced to participate in. As a result he is sentenced to ten years on a chain gang. I found it very interesting that this movie was based on true events and I wonder how realistically the events were portrayed. When I learned that this film was based on real events and the director even worked with the real James Allen to make it I was more appreciative of the film. I think Paul Muni did an amazing job playing the character of James Allen. He captured all the confusion and anguish of a person who is wrongly convicted by the legal system. I thought the film had a very strong message and I would recommend that everyone see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the whole, "message" pictures don't tend to do that well. Audiences go to the movies to be entertained, not preached to. But there are exceptions. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang works because it has the "It could happen to you" factor. It brought the issue home to audiences in a way that they could relate to, and such is its power in immersing us in the plight of its protagonist it still has an impact today.In many ways, Robert E. Burns's autobiographical book on which I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is based seems tailor-made for cinematic adaptation. When I first saw the movie, I assumed it had been heavily story-fied to add excitement and make the character more sympathetic. However it is more a case of exaggeration than total misrepresentation. Burns was not completely innocent of theft but it's true he was coerced into it. His first escape was more or less exactly as it is represented on screen, although his second was a little less spectacular. Other than that I understand the only changes are to names and other inconsequential details.But it's not so much the fact that this is a true story, it is the way we are drawn into living it. Paul Muni is the perfect player for the part. He basically looks like an average Joe, innocent and good-hearted, but is just about rugged enough to believably get involved in some kind of trouble. More importantly however he is an excellent naturalistic performer, not trying to romanticise the situation but simply reacting like an ordinary feller under pressure. He is absolutely believable in that midpoint of someone who is not quite hardened enough to simply accept his fate, but is plucky enough to make an escape ? as most of us in the audience would probably believe ourselves to be. Interestingly it was around this time that realistic acting was starting to go head-to-head with theatrical hamming. In the end it was an example of the latter ? Charles Laughton as Henry VIII ? that won the Oscar, but this is fair enough. Laughton's is perhaps the most captivating ham act ever committing to celluloid, whereas Muni is merely very good at what he does.The director of I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was Mervyn LeRoy, a largely forgotten man these days, but at the forefront of the industry in his own time. LeRoy was skilled at giving his pictures real bite and pace. The effect he goes for here is to really involve us in the hero's story. In the first scenes on the chain gang he directs the action so that Muni is out of synch with everything that is going on around him. Muni is effectively us, a stranger in a strange place. After opening a scene with some attention-grabbing close-up, LeRoy often has the camera follow Muni closely, sometimes using point-of-view shots to make our experience match his. In the later scenes, LeRoy makes more use of grim reaction shots and stylised compositions, replacing realism with nightmarish oddity.But what is perhaps the biggest key to I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang's powerful punch is its emphasis on danger and tension. In Muni's cross-country flight during his first escape, we cut between frantic close-ups of Muni and the pack of dogs, too fleeting and indistinct to tell the distance between the two. This was in the days before incidental scores were commonplace, and in this case it's a good thing. How much more exhilarating this scene is with the barking of the dogs as the only backdrop to the frenzy. Paul Muni is an everyman who becomes the wrong man, back when Master of Suspense? Alfred Hitchcock was still in England making half-arsed melodramas. The formulae that Hitch would one day make his own are at work here, in one of the boldest and most haunting pictures of the pre-code era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the story because I could not guess what was going on. Besides, I learned how the prisons spent their lives in the jail, and learned the law in that era that it was very stick. I think this is not fair for him ,and he is a good person. Why the person who just was hungry had to go to jail for ten years? If I were him, I would do as he did. Moreover, the scene that he tried to escape from the dogs and the polices had many barks of the dogs. I think the purpose would be increasing the exciting of the audience. In that scene, I noticed that something was wrong. When he was hiding in the water, and the police followed him to the water, we would see the level of water that was lower than waist, but when the camera photographed in the water, we would see the level of water that was in the chest level. Lastly, the scene that he drove to escape from the police was enjoyable as if I was watching the racing car.racing car</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things Aren't Always So Simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film is an accurate portrayal of conditions in these prison camps, it should have really rankled people. Having been privy to the punishments of some people who were involved in relatively minor crimes, I can see how the disinterest of the general public can feed into things. For instance, sex crimes. An 18 year old who sleeps with his girlfriend who is 17 can have a conviction that stays with him the rest of his life. People won't see him any differently than a level four offender who attacks little children. Nothing is that simple. This film was extremely intelligent for its time. It shows us a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He gets in over his head and finds himself on a chain gang where people are literally treated like animals, all of them. Some of the criminals are extremely violent but many are marginal with relatively short sentences. Prison reform is certainly an ongoing process. Perhaps this film contributed to some humaneness.</fullReview>

After watching it and doing a little research, I found how truly ridiculous the legal system was (and still is in a way). I remember having so much empathy for Paul Muni's character and wanting everything to be OK in the end (which it wasn't). Throughout the entire movie, being at his mother's house, in jail, as an escapee, in jail again, and as an escapee again he had no freedom. At his mother's, she wanted a different life for him. Also, as an escapee he had his freedom stripped despite a rising career by his manipulative girlfriend. This film was very powerful and deserves to be preserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a drama with a crime theme. I thought it was a very interesting movie to watch. The movie action was easy to follow along with and the camera shots throughout the movie were great. In particular, I think that for the time the movie was filmed, the technology they used when they were in the car was a realistic scene, instead of some of the fake scenes that can be shown in driving car scenes. The array of shooting locations kept the movie interesting as well. Paul Muni's character is that I found I liked. One can't help but feel sorry for him because of being wrongfully accused and rooting for him to be freed. The lighting in the final scene was done really well when the exchange happened between Helen and James. She asks him if he needs anything, he says no, and disappears into the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mervyn LeRoy's film of a man wrongfully accused of a crime and his life on and off a chain gang.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an excellent combination of social commentary and entertainment. The plot of the movie is centered around Paul Muni's character, James Allen, who was wrongfully accused of robbery and sentenced to 9 years on a chain gang. The main theme in the film is the mistreatment of prisoners on chain gangs. Paul Muni does an incredible job of causing the audience to sympathize with his situation as a fugitive. His facial expressions and tone of voice throughout the entire film really causes you to understand and feel the anguish that he has to endure. Muni's mannerisms also do a great job of showing his change from prisoner to a man of high social standing. The way Muni first shuffled his feet after escaping and then began walking normally was a great indicator for me that Allen was regaining his confidence and once again becoming a member of society. The music that seemed to be music playing throughout the entire film added to the excitement of the chase scenes and the happiness of his success. Other than the acting in the film the way it was shot also made this film great. The chase scene at the end was seamless although it was so fast paced and hectic. Each element of the film whether it was the acting or directing was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was well done. It's depiction of the government and law I feel was realistic. To elaborate on that, is that the main character Allen, who was jailed for just being at a robbery, was truly innocent. He was placed in a prison where the inmates were treated horrible and with absolutely no respect what so ever. Allen proved that he could be an outstanding, respected citizen, but the people of the law did what they could to deceive him. Allen had met all aspects of life, inside and outside of prison. This movie goes to show that many innocent people are jailed with out the ability to be freed. I would recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience. A younger audience would not understand a lot of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "I am a Fugitive of a Chain Gang" is a great film that is a major leap in cinematography from the other classic films that I have previously seen. It was film that was released in 1932; a time in which was suffering from the Great Depression. Color had been introduced into the film industry by this time, however this was created as a black and white film mainly to save money during tough times. i honestly feel that by doing this it helped to show more of the drama and heartache the film was trying to portray on its viewers.Paul Muni plays the main character James Allen brilliantly. He is able to pull his audience in through his acting and not see him as the bad guy, but instead have empathy for the situation that unfolded in front of him. Allen starts as a young man recently out of the military who needs to find himself and who he truly is. Along his way, Allen is wrongfully accused of a crime that in turn changes the rest of his life. He is convicted and sentenced to become part of Chicagos Chain Gang system which he fearlessly escapes. His story from there is one of a good man who is constantly checking over his shoulder. This is a film that you don't want to take your eyes away from so you don't miss one action or emotion. This is a film that has stood true for decades and will still be there in the future to still be enjoyed by everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a black and white film from 1932. Historically, this is during the time of the Great Depression, and it's theme and sort of depressing mood is portrayed throughout. Although colored pictures weren't being produced very much at this point, I appreciate the films simplicity and it's use of black and white film. Not only is the acting in this film representative of the times, but I believe that the actual lack of color in the film gives a sense of very little hope in Allen's (Paul Muni) life as well. Along with phenomenal acting, the cinematography in this movie is astounding as well. It is so interesting to see such long scenes with very few breaks in them. This only proves that the actors involved in productions like these are well rehearsed in their lines and movements. Due to the expense of these older films there was no extra time or funding to allow for many outtakes or mistakes to be made. The acting in this movie made it very enjoyable as well. The star of this film, Paul Muni is so well animated. With every cynical stare,the flaring of his arms, or his enormous eyes filled with rage, I found I liked his character more and more. I enjoyed this film very much. I rate it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The camera being mainly present on Allen when cretin events occur, the viewers are able to see how events went down. Because the viewers see how the event that Allen will get convicted for truly unfolded viewers see that Allen is wrongfully convicted. This creates compassion for Allen character.

		<fullReview>I am a fugitive from a chain gang is an accurate depiction of how people were treated on a chain gang. The Realism you see in the eyes of Paul Muni as he worked on the chain gang would put fear into anyones eyes. It would make you think twice about doing a wrong or crime because you wouldn't want to end out on the line. The scores in the movie were so good that they got an academy award nomination for Best Recording and sound. The scores set the stage for life on a Chain Gang and also matched the feeling of what was going on at the moment. The best example would be when Allen James(Paul Muni)finds out that he won't be getting pardoned from the chain gang. He clutches his head and the music takes off in a climatic,loud and scary abstract beat that makes you feel the pain and suffering that he was going through.</fullReview>

I felt the background music of this filmed helped to further enhance the suspense I experienced while watching. Paul Muni who played the role of James Allen made his role very believable as if he was truly fighting for his freedom.

Paul Muni is great as James Allen. He gives an intense, emotional performance as a good man wronged by an unfortunate set of circumstances, who is trying to find freedom. This movie explores the brutal and harsh life as an inmate in the chain gang. What I found interesting was the questions it asked, specifically about the chain gang system, but also about the ideas of justice, freedom, and fairness.There are some interesting performances from the supporting cast, particularly the other inmates, and from Glenda Farrell as Marie Woods. There was one detail, a part of James Allen's life on the run that I found a bit ridiculous. Overall though, this is a suspenseful film with a great main performance by Paul Muni.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Great Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a real treat. The plot is riveting and the themes are very relatable. The main character, Allen, is such a dynamic character that the audience is invested in him from the get-go. The film starts off with Allen, fresh out of the army, having to deal with his parents, who have a different vision for his life than he does. This is certainly a relatable problem. Allen rejects their vision and takes hold of his own life saying, "I don't want to be a soldier of anything!" Surely he didn't anticipate the twists and turns his life would take in the following years.This film is interesting because it makes the audience sympathize with Allen and the convicted criminals in the chain gain. We see how Allen is wrongly convicted of a crime. He was truly in the wrong place at the wrong time. The movie makes an enemy out of authority figures such as the police. Furthermore, it makes you wonder how many innocent people are really sent away due to the injustice in our justice system. When Allen escapes from the chain gain, he becomes a valued member of society only to be sent back through another act of deception on part of the justice system, a system that is supposed to be honorable.Cinematically, this movie is truly enjoyable. A strong point of the movie, I thought, was the clever use of transitions. Shots of a moving map compliments with sounds of a boat horn and a train whistle are a creative way to establish the setting and Allen's movements throughout the country as both a vagabond in the beginning and a fugitive in the end. These map shots are also coupled with another layer of film, creating a very cool, translucent shot. Shots of his marriage license and newspaper articles showing that he is on the rise in society are also good transitions. The camera work when he initially escapes creates a really riveting scene. Quick shots of him running through tree branches and of him looking back to the dogs chasing him really make the audience sit at the edge of their seats. The truly amazing part of this movie is the underwater shots when he submerges to avoid detection and capture by the dogs. You see him sitting there as the guard wades closer and closer to where he is. This scene is complimented by the use of subjective sound from Allen's point of view. Above the water the dogs are noisily barking and the guards are shouting. But when the camera is submerged?silence. The movie's ending is also clever. It ends in darkness, showing that Allen will spend the rest of his life on the run, forced to slink in the shadows.This movie is beautifully done and is complimented by great acting, suspense, and unpredictability. The film is fast-paced so the audience is never bored. And when the movie is over, you are left looking at our government and the (in)justice system in a whole new light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a 1932 pre-Hay's Code crime drama and an arresting denouncement of the American penal system. The film explores themes of freedom and justice by way of a man who is constantly imprisoned by a society which claims to be "free." Questioning the roles of morality in the world while never coming off as preachy, "Fugitive" works for two reasons: the screenplay, which uses an interesting symmetrical structure and is rife with symbolism, numerology, and amusing one-liners and double entendres, and actor Paul Muni, who bleeds emotion in every scene.The film utilizes some classic "bad to worse" storytelling devices which have made works from the Book of Job to "The Big Lebowski" so entertaining. Namely, a series of wrong place, wrong time coincidences, a corrupt and apathetic authority, and a femme fatale with a hidden agenda. Never becoming melodramatic, the film contains plenty of clever, lighthearted dialogue to ease the mood.The cinematography and lighting is striking throughout, especially during the final scenes. The post-production sound design is ambitious while still amateurish and experimental (screeching tires on a dirt road?). Other than those notable exceptions, the film is solid from a technical standpoint.Muni's portrayal of wrongfully accused convict James Allen is the strongest aspect of the film. Muni turns in an honest, heartfelt performance which slowly crushes the audience as the character himself is crushed by The Powers That Be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very entertaining from start to finish. Paul Muni does a great job of portraying the man sent to prison basically for being in the wrong place during a crime. His dream of working in the construction industry before he went to the chain gang made the story better because it showed the dreams he had after World War 1 but was unable to find work. The scene were he was underwater was amazing because it went from being a huge intense chase to being silent while he was underwater.When he escapes from the chain gang and starts succeeding in the construction business you worry that he will be caught and lose all that he has earned. The women he is forced to marry is really deceiving and blackmails him into marrying her. Another amazing advance in movie making was the car chase scene towards the end, it's amazing in 1932 that they could do that with cars. The only problem that I have with this movie is that they could of expanded the ending better. Although the ending makes you think a lot, it would have been better for the court to allow him to be free. This movie shows problems with our justice system, but filled with suspense the whole time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang had some nice filming elements to show passing of time, traveling, and promotions. The fading of the ax with the combination of the calendar showed that time was passing, but the work at the chain gang stayed the same. The fading of the boat with the combination of the map was a smart effect because scenes of actual traveling didn't need to be filmed. The promotion slips also saved filming scenes, but served as a good transition.Probably the most two enjoyable scenes for my own viewing pleasure would of had to have been when Allen was in the bush attempting to get his foot out of the chain and the scene where Allen went into the water. When Allen was in the bush I enjoyed the scene because of the sounds of the axes in the background that were effectively building up the anxiety. Even though I knew the use of the sound, it still effected me as a viewer. When Allen goes into the water I thought the positioning of the camera was perfect because the director could have used the camera as a perspective, but with having the camera at a farther point it showed the actor committed themselves to the scene.Despite all the positives I don't feel that the film had a sense of fullness or completion. I don't say that because of the actual ending I more so feel that way because I felt it could have ended at several different other points throughout the movie and I would have received the sense. The feeling of an almost ending several times kind of throws off the viewers and when it comes the actual ending your just kind of over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugivtive from a Chain Gang was an excellent movie. From the acting to the cinematography to the directing were all do well. I really enjoyed the director use of light in the movie. If you noticed the scene's when he was in jail was always very dark and gloomy except the times when he was about to escape or planning his escape. The end wrapped in all up when he disappeared into the darkness confessing his life of stealing.One aspect I found confusing was that the women in the movie all looked very similar, it would take a few minutes into the scene until I could figure out which blonde it was. I also enjoyed the pace of the movie. The never took to long on boring parts a good example was in the beginning when he was traveling around looking for jobs.I enjoyed how this movie had an anti-government theme which was something very controversial at the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this movie. I felt that the story line was a little out there. Who could really escape from jail? Twice to say the least. My favorite part of the movie was when the men in the chain gang were about to leave, to work for the day. They filmed everyone's faces. The expressions of their faces showed what hard times they were going through.This movie had a lot of sounds. From the chains hitting, to the fast beat music in the background from escaping. I found the Paul muni to be a great actor. One minute he was sweet to his mother and then being arrested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is a very powerful, well written piece of film-making. For such an early film, it delivers all the essential criteria much desired in today's movies: a strong plot, well-developed characters, incredible dialogue, thoroughly developed scenes, along with plenty of action and suspense. I must say that for the duration of the movie I was immediately hooked into the story of James Allen and his struggle to obtain a normal life and put the past behind him. It kind of reminded me in some ways of the character Jean Valjean from the musical Les Miserables; both men wanted to be able to live in society, but were constantly tormented by their pasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie brought to light the questionable reliability of the United States legal system at the time. The theme is strong in this movie and continues to be in movies today such as crash, and changeling. This shows that this movie has a lasting impact. The use of sound helped to emphasize dramatic themes or moments in the movie. the sound of the chains on the prisoners gave a chilling and cold tone to their life there. Possibly reinforcing the more permanent situation the prisoners were in and, like the chains, the unyielding attitudes of law enforcement. Paul Muni contributed great acting with his use of dramatic and convincing facial expressions throughout the film, which made his character seem more real. The plot of movie kept me in suspense throughout the entire film. the audience never could expect what was going to happen next, only hoping that he would be let free in the end. I believe that the outcome of the movie made the audience want to fix the legal system in the United states.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an excellent movie. Throughout the whole movie it never stopped being suspenseful. This movie kept you wanting more. Paul Muni who played James Allen did a great job making it such a suspenseful movie. He was a man who fought for his country and wanted to change his life for the better when he got out of the service. But in doing so his life took a turn for the worse. He ended up hanging with the wrong people and had gotten in a lot of trouble even though he didn't do anything wrong. One part of the movie that was shown was when he was in the jail and had said something right before some of his jails mates were going to be whipped. He ended up getting whipped himself but when he was he didn't let his guard down and took whatever they hit him with without making a sound. His facial expressions in this movie were really good. Especially, at the end of the movie when it got dark and his eyes got really big cause he knew that he would always have to watch his back and that he would have to keeping running for the rest of his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive of a Chain Gang is a well written, well played out film. Paul Muni, who played the main character of this film did an outstanding job in playing the role of James Allen, a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Muni helped make this suspenseful movie jump to life.The beginning of this movie kept you wanting more with a good interesting scenario. Possibly making the watcher want to keep watching to find out what will happen to James Allen next. As the film ran on it started to feel as though it would never end, basically it looped to be like the beginning.The editing in this film made it fantastic for its time of the early 1930's, pretty much the beginning of the vita phone (sound and music added to a film after the filming). With the words added into the film, it makes a person more entranced into the film, making it more realistic and exciting to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exposing the real chain gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's 'I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang' (1932) portrays an innocent man in a living hell. Paul Muni stars in this film as James Allen, a man with a promising future ahead of him. James is falsely accused of a crime and is sent to jail where he becomes a member of the chain gang. After living in the awful conditions of the jail, being forced to partake in manual labor and being abused by the Warden James decides to make a break. During his suspenseful break to freedom he hides underwater. The underwater shots are completely silent which adds to the intensity. James ends up getting away and begins to start a life again, only to end up back in the chain gang. It is so tragic when James goes back to jail because he turns into this broken, miserable man. He couldn't live any longer in this hell on earth so he breaks out again. His life after the second break is completely different. He is constantly filled with fear of getting caught, he has no relationship with anyone, and he is all alone. At the end of the film James slips away into the darkness and ironically admits "I steal" in order to live.This film is meant to expose the horrid, awful conditions of jails across the country. Even when James breaks free of the chain gang he is never fully free in life. He is always on the run, constantly looking over his shoulder and living in fear.I really enjoyed the film, I loved the tragedy. I thought it was compositionally put together well. A gloomy feel to the film really added to the alarming and devastating conditions of the chain gang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I had to watch this for my history of cinema class, and I would have to say its the best black and white I've seen probably behind Dr. Strangelove(which is b+w, unless I am mistaken from the 60's.) I thought it was a movie with a powerful story behind it. Just think, if he said no to that hamburger it wouldn't have made for a very good movie. It really makes me mad because of the similarities between the 1932 chain gang prisons and the privatized prisons of today. We have this great movie, that sheds light on unfair prison system and still here we are, putting people in prison for personal gain. Jailing good people just to make a few extra dollars, and permanently wrecking their lives. What I liked most about this movie is how it has a message, a clear message. Movies today don't usually have messages, unless its abstract, and I think if they did people might actually listen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" had such a high level of suspense, frustration and stomach-turning anxiety that I stayed perched at the edge of my chair throughout the entirety of the film. This movie was an enormous success and extremely advanced for its time, not only in its skillful use of sound and camera work but also in its purpose and content. It is clear that the intent of this film was to educate and inform the public of the corrupt brutality of the government and its prison systems. At the time this was a very bold and maybe even risky subject to speak out against and in result caused much controversy. Although much has changed and improved since then, It would be naive of me to not recognize the many flaws, heart-breaking injustices and corrupt ways of our prison systems that still exist to this day. And it is due to this recognition that I believe this movie to be timeless. "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" has certainly become one of my top five movies from its era thanks to Paul Muni's flawless performance, its passionate political purpose and the over all high quality of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie I figured it would be mediocre at best since I am not huge into movies that are as old as our grandparents. However, after watching "Chain Gang" I found myself eating my words. Considering that this movie is over 70 years old I cannot believe how captivated I was throughout the entire movie. In my opinion I felt that suspenseful would be the best way to describe the film. You're always on he edge of your seat wondering what's coming next. My favorite was his initial escape with him running through the woods, being chased by guards and dogs and than hiding in the water my heart was racing wondering if he was going to be caught or not. I was a little surprised at the brutality in the film but it did well in aiding the movies purpose of exposing these "chain gangs." There was interesting use of lighting in the film, I really enjoyed the scenes when they were working outside and the sun would just gradually rise. The sound for the movie was pretty good for the time as well minus the fact that as previously mentioned when he was escaping for the second time in the car chase scene you could hear tires screeching even though they were driving on dirt. In the end it was a great film showing the story of an army veteran turned prisoner turned fugitive all because of the injustices of society and our political system. It was highly enjoyable and I definitely recommend it to any movie buff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" follows the life of a man, James Allen, who is struggling for control. It seems that his life is not governed by his own choices, but those that are forced upon him. He is an army veteran, returning from basing his day-to-day life off orders and returns to living in his mother's house with dreams of change and finding a job that has importance to him. His mother finds him a clerical job at the factory where he used to work and she tries to force him into it. James spends his days working at the factory with his mind wandering to the construction site he can see through the window and goes there during his lunch breaks. He finally leaves to pursue a life working in construction and hops from town to town looking for work. He finds himself at the mercy of fate when he is offered dinner by a new friend. At the diner, he is held at gunpoint to steal money from the cash register and runs away during the confusion when cops come in. Since he was caught running away with the money on him, he is found guilty even though he was forced to steal. James is sentenced to ten years of labor in a chain gang and successfully escapes after a year. He finds a new job under the name "Allen James" and through hard work becomes very influential and wealthy. His landlord Marie reads a letter from his brother and learns that he is a fugitive. She blackmails him into marriage so she can live off of his money. He falls in love with another woman Helen and wants to divorce his wife. His wife betrays him and spills his secret and he is approached by officials to negotiate a pardon. James fulfills his requirements for his pardon but is retained to finish his previous sentence. He escapes again and approaches his lover Helen. Before he leaves her, she asks how he will live without money and as he disappears into the dark he replies "I steal". These last words have a great significance to the theme of the movie. He is ultimately forced to steal because he was wrongly accused of stealing. The misfortune he encounters takes a good, hardworking man and reduces him into exactly the thing that society was trying to prevent: a criminal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang was an interesting movie. Normally, I don't enjoy early 20th century films, and to be honest I had never heard of the title before, but I had heard of Paul Muni. Muni played an interesting role, and he has an on screen presence that he uses to reel the audience in. One thing I noticed, and I'm not sure if it was purposely done this way, but I found it interesting how Muni's character was tired of the same old routine he faced in WWI, yet it was his trying to escape the routine and do things on his own accord that brought him to being on the chain gang, with the same routine and not having a choice. Also, the sound quality was great for a movie from this era, and really added a lot of emphasis in certain points in the movie. Overall it was a very good movie that I would recommend to anyone interested in early 20th century film.</fullReview>

The government is corrupt. I really enjoyed the usage of speech in this movie, which as a result, i didn't fall asleep through it. The story line of this film was very interesting as it kept my attention. The whole movie was very intense. It was quiet depressing how Paul Muni, a World War One hero, becomes a victim upon his return back home, even though he was innocent. All in all i give, "I am a fugitive of a chain gang" 5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is one of the greatest actors I have ever witnessed. Muni really puts Bruce Willis to shame in "Chain Gang". The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking. My favorite scene was the car-chase. Although repetitive, the scene set precedent for probably millions of movies in the decades to come. Honestly, what movie does not have a scene with a car-chase? I'm pretty sure there was a car-chase in "Brokeback Mountain". The dialogue was very impressive in this film. Muni had a certain believable un-easiness in his character during each individual scene. Not many actors ever displayed such conviction. This movie will rank up there on my all-time list, amongst the likes of Toy Story and Billy Madison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely amazing for the time period it was created in! For filming something then adding the sound later on, you wouldn't be able to tell that was done on this film. The lip syncing matched very well. The setting and the background looked amazing. Paul Mooney did a great job. Good diegetic sound when the man was being whipped for fainting while doing his work. You could hear his cries but couldn't see what was happening, but we still knew what was going on. This was one of the films that rally introduced that to us. There was a good plot to this story and i believe its purpose for making the film to create an outrage against brutality in prisons was shown quite well. The movie kept the viewer very interested because there was very few pauses when changing into a new scene. I loved how smart Jim (Mooney) was throughout this film. One of my favorite parts was when he was sitting in the barber shop after he escaped from the prison the first time, he was getting a shave and the cop walked in. He asked the barber to put a hot cloth on his face to cover it up so the cop could not see his identity. The scene where Jim was hiding under the water to get away from the cops when he escaped the first time was also well ahead of its time. I thought it was very smart that when the film was being shown with him under water it went silent and when it was being shot above the water you could hear all the commotion going on around him. I liked int he car scene how you felt like you were in the truck with him. There was great suspense throughout this whole film. The viewer understood the feelings of the scene as soon as they were present. Over all i believe the movie was well thought out and well directed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fantastic movie!! Suspenseful and exciting! Muni's character was well developed I sympathized with him at every step and routed for his escape each time! I mean this poor guy serves his country in World War I, tries to find himself instead of settling for a desk job, falls on hard times, is convicted of a crime he did not commit, and then is subjected to most inhumane treatment as his sentence in the chain gang. He is a victim of circumstance. He was a stand up guy for returning to complete his sentence . I appreciated the camaraderie between the other convicts which paralleled the camaraderie of the soldiers in the very beginning of the movie. Both of the escape scenes were so tense and put many modern movies with all of their special effects to shame. The car chase scene was fun to watch. I did not like the ending-I had hoped that once he returned, he would be protected. I think the social commentary is lost when watching it today, but would have provoked more outrage when this type of punishment existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American Justice System, with all its rehab,community service, and prison systems, have made a huge progression towards improvement throughout the past century. Prison systems today, treat their prisoners fairly and help prisoners move their way back to a normal, crime-free life. By serving time, prisoners learn that committing crime is a bad thing that they can't escape from in life. The prison system, from the late 19th-20th century, was horrible. Prisoners were often put into prison for crimes that they weren't committed for while other prisoners were put into jail for the usual crimes of theft and murder. The prisoners were given unhealthy food to eat, had to wear shackles on their legs all the time, and washed their arms and face in a single bucket. When the prisoners misbehaved, their officer would push them to the ground or whip their backs with a belt buckle until they bled.Burns has shown the hardships of prisoners in this film well and to the point. The background music in a few scenes was filled with recorded music full of train whistles, moving machinery, bombing sounds, and barking dogs. The actor's performances throughout the movie were believable and made you wonder what was going to happen to the characters. The cinematography from scene to scene was really neat as the cameras double exposed pictures, letters and numbers to show how much time had elapsed in various scenes.I would recommend this movie to anybody that is interested in learning about the early functioning of the prison system and is interested in being immersed in a great storyline that will keep you wondering what is going to happen to the characters in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time when talkies were new and needed to prove how much sound was necessary, a movie came along and showed how great directing, editing, and acting could come together. This movie wasn't the only movie or the first movie to prove that sound wasn't just another novelty, but it used it to tell a story very well without revealing too much to sensitive viewers. One scene which involves inmates being flogged as punishment doesn't show anything more than the shadows of the people involved and the sounds of the beatings. The scene came off as very dark and showed just how dark the rest of the movie was going to be. Other uses of sound and lighting made the movie more and more immersing. Another good use of sound for story telling was when the main character tried to hide in a creek and it switched between shots of him which were dead silent and shots of the guards looking for him. Moments like this were very suspenseful. It can be easy to forget how old this movie is.Except for the occasionally optimistic scenes, it is either suspenseful or depressing or both. It is not a movie to watch to feel better. It is a movie to make people think which was innovative for 1932. It was one of the first movies to be this political. Paul Muni's performance as James Allen is extraordinary. It reminds me of Humphrey Bogart, another great actor of the time who stole the show in any movie. He makes you believe in his character and understand everything that is going on with him. One interesting theme in the movie is James' constant need to make a choice about what is a worse way to live. As an inmate slave or in a life that suppresses him just as much? This movie also doesn't forget its silent roots. Like silent movies that have little blurbs narrating a scene, this movie has that but in the form of a paycheck or a newspaper headline to get the viewer more into the story and world. If you want a good political movie brings out many emotions in you, then this is for you. Ignore the year it came out. It's about as exciting as some of today's movies. It also has a very interesting conclusion that will leave most thinking about the movie for a while. I wish I could talk about it more without ruining it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang, directed by Mervyn Leroy is a film that was far ahead of its time. Being one of the first sound films, director Mervyn Leroy wasted no time utilizing the new sound technology. Numerous scenes stand out with excessively loud sounds and noise that help depict the feeling of the characters in certain situations. The chain gang is given its character through the sounds that are produced by chains, pickaxes, and blood hounds. The sounds in these scenes create a particular mood that makes one feel and understand the brutality of the chain gang. It is interesting to see how and where Leroy used sound excessively throughout the movie, the only scenes where the sound stands out is in the chain gang scenes. Perhaps this is Leroy's way of drawing the audience in during the important scenes, it certainly makes the brutality of the chain gang much more real and present for those watching the film. Throughout the film there are some very interesting small details that a presented in the script and cinematography. For one, Leroy uses cinematic foreshadowing throughout the film, one of the most noticeable is the driving scene in the start and the final chase scene of the movie. Early in the movie Allen is driving a logging truck through treacherous steep hills while on the job somewhere in the country, this scene seems to portray some sort of darkness and doom but at this early stage in the film you wouldn't know what Allen's future held. The end chase scene is shot exactly the same, still creating some sort of feeling of impending doom. Perhaps Leroy didn't plan this minor foreshadow, but both scenes paint a picture of Allen running from something, trying to make it towards the future. I Am A Fugitive From a Chain Gang is a must see for any movie watcher, Leroy creates an astonishingly modern feel with his cinematography and sound. If you want to see good acting and a developed plot, check out this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often, a movie with a political message about a certain time period loses its significance with age but one of the criteria that makes a movie great is that it can stand the test of time.Chain Gang both showcases the plight of the common man during the Great Depression and criticizes the forced labor penal system prevalent in many US states then. It is a gritty, hard-hitting story, with a haunting performance by Paul Muni.It is notable that this movie is pre-Code, which effectively means pre-severe censorship, so it manages to convey a strong political message and - I feel - convey an unrelentingly bleak story.It might not be relevant now, and boy, is it depressing, but this is definitely one of the best movies of the 30's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Charlie Chaplin in MODERN TIMES, Paul Muni in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG finds himself caught up in the gears of The System. While I can understand why the factual theft was rewritten as a robbery gone wrong (with Muni left holding the bag, as it were), I think that the truth, in this case, is far more potent than the fiction. Ten years for the theft of five bucks, even Depression Era bucks, is mind-boggling. (And the Muni character's "involvement" in the robbery marks a very clear distinction between him and, say, K in Kafka's THE TRIAL: K has no inkling whatsoever of the "crime" he's accused of having committed, whereas the Muni character knows all too well that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. In real life, ironically, he was not THE WRONG MAN...) One need only sit through a chilling, claustrophobic drama like SHORT EYES (or I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG or NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR) to get an idea of what it might be like to get caught up in The System, with no way out. Celebrities can buy their way out of time in the slammer, but the rest of us... We better keep our noses clean...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Muni Steals Away Into The Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following service in World War I, decorated soldier Paul Muni (as James Allen) wants to pursue a job in engineering, rather than keep to the monotonous factory job that was held open for him. While struggling to find a job in construction, Mr. Muni meets similarly downtrodden Preston Foster (as Pete). The men go to a diner where Muni is promised a free meal; instead, Muni becomes an unwitting robbery accomplice. After a shooting, Muni is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to work on a chain gang. The title, "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", is an accurate description of what comes next...Another great performance from Muni, who was also seen, during the year, in "Scarface" (on screen) and "Counselor-at-Law" (on stage). Returning to films in 1932, Muni clearly established himself as one of the best and most respected professional actors in the business; he reached #2 in the "Academy Awards" voting for "Best Actor" of the year (behind Charles Laughton in "The Private Life of Henry VIII"). His "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" deservedly won the "National Board of Review" award for "Best Picture" and placed on most film organizations' "Bests" lists.Director Mervyn LeRoy, photographer Sol Polito, and the writers were also award-worthy. The story is based on (more or less) Robert Elliott Burns' autobiographical account of his experiences on an actual Georgia chain gang. It brought about changes in, and attitudes about, prison "correction" facilities, which were obviously encouraging individuals to become more hardened criminals. The supporting performances are a mixed bag, with Glenda Farrell (Marie) and Noel Francis (Linda) standing out, as two women unabashedly eager for sexual relations with Muni... Definitely recommended.********* I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (11/19/32) Mervyn LeRoy ~ Paul Muni, Helen Vinson, Glenda Farrell, Noel Francis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the real life true story of Robert E. Burns, Warner Brothers offers yet another in a long line of social conscience films that made them a studio juggernaut as early as the 1930's. Unlike Cagney, Bogart or Edward G. Robinson however, this picture's star Paul Muni isn't remembered today except by true film enthusiasts. In his time though, Muni was such a prolific actor that he became a victim of his own success. The studio began billing him as MR. Paul Muni, thereby alienating the common man audience that built him up in the first place. In "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang", Muni is front and center throughout virtually the entire movie, and as the story progresses, it's impossible to take your eyes off him.What makes the central character's story truly horrific begins with his sentence - ten years of hard labor based on circumstantial evidence pointing to a robbery of five dollars. In a split second, James Allen's (Muni) life is derailed and sent into a tailspin of unintended consequences. His life on a chain gang documents such indignities as having to request permission to wipe the sweat off his face, or repeated lashes from the duty guard's whip for making a snide remark. It's no wonder that Allen is driven to 'hang it on a limb', insider code for bustin' out. The irony of Allen's breakout is not so much that he's eventually tracked down by the authorities, but that he's subjected to another round of inhumane prison treatment after he turns himself in as part of a phony deal with the state in which he served time (Georgia, though it was never mentioned by name in the picture).Aside from the gripping story, I'm always intrigued by films of the Thirties and Forties that reveal glimpses of life from so long ago. James Allen's cross country jaunts while looking for work reveal that a flophouse bed and meal go for fifteen cents each; throw in another nickel for a bath. As for wages, Allen took his first paying laborer job at four dollars a day, and was living pretty well by the time he made the grade as an assistant superintendent at fourteen dollars a day! But the real sit up and take notice scene for me was during the conversation Allen had with new found girlfriend Helen after leaving the dinner party - she declared she could do anything she wanted being 'free, white and twenty one'! I'll agree with most viewers who hold that the picture's ending is one of the most powerful in cinema, a haunting image and line uttered - "I steal' - to cement the sense of desperation in the main character's doomed future. Watching the picture tonight on Turner Classics, host Robert Osborne mentioned that Paul Muni's dramatic fade into darkness was one of those most fortunate accidents in film history in which a light blew out precisely as the scene ended. It was almost re-shot too, until someone said wait a minute. I just love those throw away bits of film trivia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredibly great and powerful movie this is about a common man who becomes a victim of the prison system.It's a social critical movie that's right in the alley with movies from the same period such as "All Quiet on the Western Front" and other pre-code movies that weren't afraid to show the ugly side of society and show its imperfections and flaws. The movie shows a WW I veteran who wasn't a criminal in the beginning but had to become one after his escape in order to survive, after being wrongly convicted and was forced to serve in a brutal chain gang system. So you can say that prison turned him into a criminal. This especially perfectly shows in the end of the movie, which is quite a legendary and effective ending and certainly something you wouldn't expect from a 1932 movie. I like how this movie subtly picks to social critical approach without ever getting preachy or anything about it.It's an early '30's movie, so it's not just a movie for a tastes though. Some sequences and style of acting could today be described as being laughable but once your familiar with some different early '30's movies and its style of film-making this obviously shouldn't bother you.Paul Muni does a great and powerful job with his performance of James Allen. He's not heroic, he's no angel, he just is who he is, which really makes the character such a compelling one. Muni also received an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, which was his first and also wouldn't be his last and he would eventually also win one in 1935 for his role in "The Story of Louis Pasteur".A great powerful movie. And yes, I consider this to be a better prison movie that "The Shawshank Redemption", which always is being considered to be the ultimate prison movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging the effects of prison life in the 1920s; thought-provoking and also quite entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I discovered that this film, starring Paul Muni was airing on TCM one night, I could not resist watching it despite being quite exhausted that day. Well, so much for that; after ten minutes I was wide awake, completely captivated by the performances, direction, dialogue, and, most notably, the treatment of a subject which remains as relevant today as back then: the effects of prison life.Set during the 1920s, I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG covers the struggles of honest and kind young man James Allen (Paul Muni) as he is wrongly accused of a robbery. Allen soon finds himself sweating as a member of a chain gang in prison, carving stone and experiencing brutal treatment from fellow prisoners and officers alike. He eventually manages to escape to Chicago, where he slowly works his way up to success and becomes a highly respected construction engineer. However, while things finally seem to get going for him, the prison has not forgotten his escape? I won't reveal anything further. The movie speaks for itself. Being released in 1932, this haunting depiction of a brutal life inside an American prison has scarcely aged a bit. True enough, American prisons have undergone changes during the seventy-five years that have passed, few of them forcing prisoners to carve stone anymore, but CHAIN GANG explores a question which is still too often ignored: what should be considered the precise purpose of prisons? Does the legal system live up to its title and reputation? The movie appears to be quite critical as to how prisons are devised, Muni's character serving as an example of one man who really wasn't very bad before being tied to the chains, only to be changed for the worse once that happened. At the same time, it should be noted that the movie does not appear to carry any agenda, as most of the prisoners are actually characterized rather unflatteringly. Then again, a next question would be, of course, if not many of the least flattering aspects of the prisoners become even more pronounced after they've entered prison life.All this being said, if you believe the legal system to be excellent, or even if you don't care for the topic at all, CHAIN GANG offers plenty to enjoy in any case. The persons involved in the story undergo strong character development; there are several action-packed sequences included; and even quite a few hints of sex (after all, the movie was fortunate enough to be a so-called Pre-Code). Hats off to director Mervyn LeRoy, who did his possibly best achievement throughout his career; he took great advantage of camera- setups and "fade-outs" which were technically quite impressive for the time and added further to the emotional impact of the film. Also worthy of a special mention is Robert Burns, author of the book on which the movie is based, and Howard Green and Brown Holmes, who did the screen-play and are the brains behind some of the memorable dialogue. Yet, the man whose contribution remains the most outstanding is the lead player himself, Paul Muni. Muni was one of the very first movie stars who did not cling to one particular "image" or way of presenting himself in every movie he was in. Instead, he actually tried to understand the particular mental state and situations of each character he played, developing his own personality along with his character; hence his performances stand out as captivating now as back then. It is hard to compare the gentle Allen we see at first with the Allen of later on in the movie, as the prison arguably makes a criminal out of him.I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG did quite well at the box-office when originally released and was nominated for no less than three Academy Awards, which, I'd say, confirms that America was open for some criticism of the legal system even in those years. Oddly, the film has by now become quite obscure and is, like Muni, seldom given a mention even among buffs of "the classics." Showings on TCM and a release on DVD may help to increase its popularity, which is not a day too soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly brutal portrait of a primitively crude and barbaric penal system which existed in Georgia as well as across the whole county.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we view a Drama, a Good Drama that is, we can get so wrapped up in the story that we forget that the story in front of us is just that-a STORY! As a work of fiction, even a good, well written and well made movie is still make believe. As such a fictional storyline is subject to lean toward the beliefs of the Writer, the Director and whoever is involved in the production. Even the Actors can cause a story's political content; but it's definite that Writers and Directors who have the most influence.And in not being unfair to the Author, Mr. Robert E. Burns, whose autobiography was the basis for the screenplay. The story is brutal, unglamorized and put together in the best tradition of the early talkies.But we still must approach this and any fiction before us simply because of the irresistible trend of Hollywood to show us the story of the wrongly accused, the guy who is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hence we can offer examples of this plot gimmick.Next to our film to be examined, I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (1932); we could cite Alfred Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959). We could, so we will. In it, Cary Grant's character is victimized of not only being the killer, but also is a victim of one big case of Internal Mistaken Identity.And from 1963 to '67, we all sat by our TV sets watching Actor Barry Morse as the Guy from the Indianapolis Police Department wit the super-big Expense Account, Lieutenant Gerard as he dutifully pursued Dr. Richard Kimble (David Jansen) from one end of the next corner. Once again we have a case of another innocent man's being falsely accused Mel Brooks even spoofed the situational premise in his Hitchcock spoof, HIGH ANXIETY (1977)..As for our CHAIN GANG Movie, it was obviously painstakingly constructed and was given a firm, sound foundation. In a story such as this, you can't just get to the incarcerated road crew without a big build-up first.So our story begins with a view of a multitude of American Soldiers, called "Doughboys", aboard a transport ship returning from World War I, from that "War to end all Wars." We meet up with our main character, one James Allen (Paul Muni) who expresses his desire to become a construction engineer; utilizing his experience in the Army Corps of Engineers.Once home it seems that everyone is out to map out his future; so he sets out to find his entrance level job in construction as a start. Jobs being scarce, he starts an Odyssey across the Eastern part of the country, traveling by any means; be it Steamship, Passenger Railway or hopping freights. He is reduced to the status of a Hobo, but still he persists and winds up in the middle of a robbery, which go him into his being sentenced to the Chain Gang in the first place.Aside from the story of the falsely accused and his dealings with a brutal, overbearing penal system, we are given a closely crafted look at the conditions of poverty that existed, especially in some rural areas. And remember, this was before the Great Depression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Instant Classic In My Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang" is a instant classic. It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and released to the public in 1932 and yet you can still find similarities between our generation of films we watch on the silver screen today, making it a timeless masterpiece that was nominated for three Oscars. The film incorporates a thrilling plot telling the story of a young man named James Allen, played by Paul Muni, who was wrongly convicted in the state of Georgia for robbing a diner when he was merely forced to do so by a man he had just met. He is then sent to a prison were brutal tactics are used to help put prisoners through a rigorous correctional program known as chain gangs. After escaping from the "correctional institution" James Allen makes his way to Chicago were he become a prestigious engineer. He is soon caught after being blackmailed and sent back to Georgia were he was promised to serve 90 days and then he shall be pardoned. He soon discovers that he would not be pardoned but would serve the rest of his nine years in one of the toughest chain gang camps there is in Georgia. He escapes for a second time and finds himself losing everything and living as a thief to make ends meet. Ironic that he is put into prison for being wrongfully accused as a criminal and only to later to become a actual criminal. This movie demonstrates the early stages of the film industry that has now become a media giant in the world we live in today. The advancement of dialogue, music, ambient sound and sound effects are clearly present in this film. Clearly we are far more advanced today in our generation of film; but when we look and marvel at the advancement made in just a few years from the early nineteen hundreds to the production of this film, it is clear to see that they had come a far way. The mise en scene, meaning, the transition from scene to scene and the angles in which the film was shot allowed you to be better submerged into the plot. There was great continuity were films in earlier years such as Muybridge and Edison films left you with experimental elements and the study of motion and sound. This continuity is demonstrated when James Allen arrives in prison and throughout the transition we will see a transparent calendar appear that turns pages as we can still see the main character working hard in his daily chores. Slowly you start to see the character transition from what was a clean cut perhaps determined man and is soon rundown by the prison camp and the passing time. Other tools that helped transition from scene to scene was the display of the map. As James Allen makes his way from place to place we see a visual stimulation of a map that presents us his location. This helps because without this assistance the viewer would be left to assume that perhaps he never left his home town.The diegetic sound in any film plays a key role but in the case of this particular production we see a need for more of a clean cut transition from scene to scene. Sounds that played a key role were perhaps the gunshots you hear as James Allen attempts to escape or even more important are the sounds of a bridge being built near by. James Allen had a dream to become a construction engineer and while working at the factory he so desperately detested that was the only sound that brought him comfort and even joy. He had a fascination for building bridges and roads, which later allowed him to become a prestigious man in Chicago before being captured. The sounds as well helped the transition when the director wants us to know that the character is traveling; we hear the train on the tracks or the sound of a boat hitting the waves as it makes it way down the coast line. The non- diegetic sounds do not play a role at all in this film. There is no background music, or theme song that helps derive any emotion from what is going on in the film. This is another difference perhaps between this newer age film then opposed to older films in the nineteen hundreds. There was no dialogue. You would have to read subtitles or script cards while listening to a record player that would be located in the theater and not on the film were it could be linked to go simultaneously with the events taking place during the film.Cinematography has come a long way and will continue to grow through the ages but it is always important to know were we began and still admire the work of those who helped us transition forward in time. This movie presents us with many elements that make it a great film that demonstrates the time while providing great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni was terrific! This is a classic movie about injustices in the criminal justice system. Paul Muni's character is similar to that of Jean Valjean in Les Miserable. If you like the feel of very dated movies, you will love this movie. There are some great lines in this movie and some discussions that still ring true. Muni's character doesn't want to settle for the old job he had before his stint in World War I. He has bigger plans. Any of you who have ever been depressed about trying to find a job will relive that experience through Paul Muni's character as he burns a lot of shoe leather looking for a job. There's also a very short scene that shows cars driving passed the Art Institute in Chicago. I still remember the first time I saw this movie (on television), probably when I was about 10 years old, with my father, who enjoyed watching old movies with the great actors. There were no color televisions in those days, and, of course, this movie was in black and white anyway. One of the great lines was when Muni is asked something like "What will you do? How will you survive?" I think this is at the end of the movie. Muni's reply is, "I steal."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a cracking film! Hollywood really hit its stride in the early 30's with musicals, action thrillers and docu - dramas (such as this), amazingly just a few short years after the introduction of talkies, the earliest examples of which were weighed down with stagy or worse, hackneyed silent-movie type acting (all hands and eyes to the heavens, if you get my meaning), prosaic dialogue and set bound locations. I really couldn't believe such a gritty, well acted, fast moving film could emerge in only 1932. Not only does the film take a morally brave stand against the brutal chain - gang regime prevalent particularly in the southern states(although never naming Georgia as the offending state, the frequent interpolation of a U.S. map always just stopping short of Georgia gives a clue as to the intended target), it never lets the message get in the way of good old-fashioned cinematic tension and thrills. There are two great scenes I particularly enjoyed. Firstly, Muni's daring escape from the pursuing prison guards and their baying pack of bloodhounds, climaxing in a brilliant underwater shot of Muni breathing underwater through a hollow tube of vegetation as a guard moves ever closer to where he's lying down and secondly Muni's later encounter with a friendly prostitute after months of degrading incarceration in an all-male confinement - the camera subjectively but not lewdly takes in the woman's form from head to toe, with a tantalising glimpse of stockinged ankle demonstrating subtly, especially in the pre - Hays days, his manly urges, ending with a lovely fade as they inevitably come together and her line "We're all friends here...". There's a little bit of hamminess in some of the playing (I'm thinking of the melodramatic demise of his fellow inmate off the side of their getaway truck and the over the top playing of his shrewish wife) and the insertion of the goody two shoes minister brother jars, but at the film's centre is a powerhouse performance by Paul Muni which engages and inspires in equal measures. The direction is excellent using realistic locations and climaxing in a superb off-beat final scene - no happy ending here. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>072: I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) - released 11/19/1932; viewed 7/2/06.The second wife of Josef Stalin, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, is found dead in her home.BIRTHS: Petula Clark.DOUG: In late 1932, Warner Bros. releases a controversial and unforgettable film, based on a true story, exposing the brutal chain gang system of Georgia. Easily one of the best films of that year (along with 'Trouble in Paradise' and 'Scarface'), 'I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang' is an excellent example of the kind of films that the Warner's studio specialized in. I'm really getting a sense of the brand identity of the various studios. Warner Brothers delivered these gritty, controversial, hard-hitting films about relevant topics, mostly gangster films. Paul Muni plays James Allan, a man arrested for petty theft and sentenced to ten years, suffering under a brutal, inhumane chain gang system. He escapes and manages to become a successful businessman in Illinois, but his past soon catches up with him. The two states engage in a tug-of-war, with Illinois wanting to hang on to its illustrious businessman and the southern state (which is never named) wanting to retrieve an escaped fugitive. (Get a load of the Chairman, using Allen's own "rehabilitation," to justify the effectiveness of the chain gang system, but still advocates bringing Allen back to serve his time.) You know it's all true. It's good to see Paul Muni again. His character here is in many ways the opposite of Tony Camonte. James Allan is trying to get by within the law and is cheated by the system into serving time while Tony gets away with all manner of crime while remaining untouched by the law. James tries desperately to be a good man, while Tony delights in being bad. James Allen's situation creates a feeling of "This could happen to you!" During the Great Depression, it was probably a very relevant notion. The movie was controversial enough to be banned in Georgia. I wonder if there was a meeting in which the Georgia representatives told Warner Brothers "We'll release the film if you remove all direct references to the state of Georgia," to which the WB guys would have responded, "Okay. Oops, there aren't any, jerk." By ending the movie the way they do, it not only gives the audience a chill, but also makes it so that the story of James Allen could be the story of anyone in the audience, and it's up to the audience to solve it. The moral of the story? After you escape from prison, you NEVER go back.KEVIN: No film we've viewed before this has showcased the gritty despair of the Great Depression as much as 'I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,' a film that ushered in an era of Warner Bros. Studios as a maker of socially conscious films. Before this there was 'The Big House,' but even that film seemed bright and campy compared to this one. I totally buy the harrowing experiences depicted in this film as what prisoners really went through at the time. You're charged with a crime, and you're sent to a place where you are less than human. It doesn't matter who you are or what you did, you are going to pay for all your sins ten times over. This film shows one of the reasons why police officers are tasered before they are issued a taser to use. The people who pass down that sentence simply do not know what it's like for the prisoners because their minds still operate under the just-world phenomenon of "you get what you deserve." If it hurts, you had it coming. They neither know nor want to know what goes on behind those walls. Paul Muni's performance as the titular prisoner is 100% perfect. There is not one moment in the film where we're not feeling what he's feeling. This is one of the most intense movies that we've watched. It's the most riveting kind of social commentary because it ends with a problem. The hero doesn't win when the credits roll. A good man is on the run. What are you going to do about it? It's kind of like stopping in the middle of the story, but it's completely necessary because in reality, the story isn't over. Robert Elliott Burns, the man upon whom the film is based, was still a fugitive when the film was completed, and the film became another part of the story in itself, showing on the silver screen his true suffering at the hands of the justice system.Last film: Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932). Next film: Sign of the Cross (1932).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as wrenching in its own way as COOL HAND Luke would be, years later, is I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG. Paul Muni gives an unforgettable performance as a tragic man who becomes a victim of circumstance simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong timeThe depression-era drama is said to be based on a true story, but whether it is or not, it is presented in powerful fashion by director Mervyn LeRoy, usually not a director one associates with this kind of gritty material. After leaving Warner Bros., he was responsible for films like LITTLE WOMEN and RANDOM HARVEST at MGM.There is almost no humor throughout the tense running time with the possible exception of the good-humored ALLEN JENKINS as one of the luckier prisoners. Muni's character is punished for a crime he committed at the point of a gun (by PRESTON FOSTER), and finds himself committed to a chain gang for a holdup instigated by Foster.After witnessing the brutal treatment of prisoners, he's determined to escape and he does succeed, even managing to assume a job in the construction business and rising within the ranks to become a productive member of society. But when his whereabouts are disclosed after several years of freedom, by a jealous wife, he decides to make a plea deal that allows him to return to a prison camp for a period of ninety days, after which he'll be automatically released. He goes back but soon learns that the deal is off and the state wants payback for his former escape and an indefinite time of service.Muni pulls another escape and the film ends on a stark note with him retreating into the shadows as the woman he loves pleads with him not to desert her again. The memorable final scene has her saying, "But what will you do? How will you live?" and his reply, with a frantic look on his face, is "I steal." Muni is excellent in the lead and confirms his reputation as the great dramatic actor of the Warner lot with this iconic role. It's a commanding but natural performance, never overstated and the film remains a powerful exposure of injustices in the penal system of the '30s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Workin' on a Chain Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" was Warners' first major bid at prestige film-making, but it's essentially a gussied up version of the studio's bread and butter, the cheap, gritty gangster films, which were enjoying enormous success at the time "Fugitive" was released.The Warners knew they had a sure-fire box office formula with their gangster films, and "Fugitive" sticks closely to it. There's the same emphasis on the seedy underbelly of mainstream America, where the hobos, prostitutes and criminals call the shots. There's the inexorable struggle of the protagonist against a cold fate; the film records his slow and agonizing slide toward destruction. And there's that instantly recognizable Warners look, ratty and realistic.The first half of the film is strong stuff--the screenplay is taut and economical. There's a harsh indictment not only of the chain gang system, but of post-WWI American life in general. James Allen (Paul Muni) move from one symbolic chain gang to another, whether it's the strict regimentation of the armed services, the mind-numbing sameness of blue collar labor, or the suffocating entrapment of a miserable marriage. He starts out as an innocent, and is made a criminal by a harsh and unforgiving society. Of course, this is 1932, so subtlety is in short supply, and the liberal Hollywood guilt at work stacks the deck shamelessly in Allen's favor. The second half of the film sags and becomes ever so slightly ponderous, but the final image of the film, and that final line, delivered by Muni out of the pitch dark -- "I steal" -- leaves a powerful impression.I wasn't that familiar with Paul Muni before seeing this; he's one of those actors I've heard more about than actually seen. I know he became infamous later in his career as a hopeless over-actor, but he does pretty well here. He's got a tough job, as he's in virtually every frame of the film, and it's only toward the end, as Allen nears the end of his rope, that his histrionics threaten to cushion the impact of his performance. But director Mervyn LeRoy keeps things moving at a decent clip, so there's not a lot of time to dwell on individual scenes.It's astonishing now to think that this film was a tremendous box office success, but it was. How times have changed. I can't imagine a film this downbeat finding an audience today. Maybe the Depression created an atmosphere in which people found comfort in seeing the suffering of others -- the "it could be a lot worse" factor. Or maybe it was just good timing or good marketing.This is a harsh film that has aged well, and retains a surprising ability to shock and enrage, even today. Well done.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong classic that never ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Allen (Paul Muni) returns from military service after World War I to an America pocked with poor job prospects. Forced to travel state-to-state, seeking work in his trade, the engineering field, Allen winds up in a flop house. He quickly establishes a friendship with the equally desperate Pete (Preston Foster, bursting with a sleazy smile) Pete turns vicious and involves the innocent Allen in a hastily planned diner hold-up. The police kill Pete and capture Allen. The courts believe Allen to be a culprit, and not a victim. Allen is sentenced to ten years hard labor on a chain gang.At the camp, Allen and the other prisoners are forced to endure 15 hour work-days pounding rocks in the hot sun. They are fed greasy, indigestible food, and are subjected to nightly beatings by sadistic wanna-be tough guy guards. In a scene staged and edited well ahead of it's time, Allen escapes.Two very talented men help shape CHAIN GANG into a still riveting classic, actor Paul Muni, a veteran of Second Avenue's Yiddish Theatre, and Mervyn LeRoy, an under-appreciated studio director who knew how to tell a story in a fast, brisk cinematic manner.While Muni in other films (SCARFACE, THE GOOD EARTH) would perform over the top, here he's restrained and calculating. Just watch the way his body jerks and his eyes shifts when he's on the run, fearing the police are right behind him, or in more simpler scenes, the way his body slumps when his minister brother chides him for reaching beyond his means. It was a shame Muni made so few films. This honest, believable actor is surely of the Russell Crowe/Tom Cruise caliber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the Most Powerful Scenes Ever Filmed are In This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG is a great example of 1930s drama and a statement about the inhumanity of the chain-gang system. It works beautifully on both levels, but is best viewed as a drama. Muni plays an optimistic veteran of the Great War who, through unfortunate circumstances, is arrested and sentenced to work on a chain gang in the south. The tragedy continues with depiction of the cruelty of the guards and various attempts at escape. Once our hero does escape and proves his worth to society with success, he finds that he isn't quite out of the woods yet. Despite the obvious restrictions of film-making at the time, this film is very potent. Some bits are genuinely heart-rending and the ending is one of the saddest and most powerful I've seen. I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG is a movie worth searching for. Like many great 30s dramas, if you give this movie a chance you'll be well rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not only an early masterpiece of suspense and action. It carried a powerful social message that helped bring to an end the savagery of chain gangs.Compare this to other movies of that era and you will see the towering achievement it was at the time -- and still is. Muni plays a down-on-his-luck depression-era engineer. (The poor were treated badly in the broken society of that time, as they still are today.)Muni plays the indignities of poverty with a quiet strength and shares his pain with us. But he plays a man with fortitude, and he struggles with setbacks again and again until the end...I won't give it away, but in the last scene they were shooting outdoors and they had run out of money. The generators failed. So they used auto headlights to light the scene and the result is one of the most memorably haunting moments in screen history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Piece of 1930s Social Comment. One of the BEST.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG gives a wonderful and realistic (based on a man's autobiography) look at injustice and barbaric punishment in the 1930s. Paul Muni plays a World War 1 veteran with the typical corny dream who ends up being wrongly arrested in the south. The film honestly depicts the hellish conditions of life on a chain gang at that time. The scape sequence has genuine suspense. The sequences that follow display LeRoy's considerable talent as a story-teller. The last act is beautiful in its.... well, just watch. This movie has lost nothing with age and is still powerful. It has drama fine enough to outlast any technological or artistic advancement. It's blessed with good performances and the determination the filmmakers had to their purpose. I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG is a classic later joined by COOL HAND LUKE (1967) in showing the horror of the chain gang system, and later made fun of in SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS (1941). All three are worth seeing, this most of all. A perfect ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story line is well known........Muni plays the "forgotten man", a WWI hero who finds himself enmeshed in a nightmare of injustice inflicted upon him by the Southern "justice" system that was prevalent at the time the film was made. I feel that Paul Muni may be the only actor who could have portrayed James/Allen....he brings such pathos and realism to the part and becomes totally immersed in the characterization. This is a man who could play such diverse roles as Louis Pasteur and Benito Juarez and you never think "Oh,that's Paul Muni"......his playing is such that it is almost reflective of a newsreel instead of a movie. The supporting cast is quite good with help from Glenda Farrell as the whorish wife and Edward Ellis as the convict friend, Bomber. Helen Vinson does not get much screen time and appears rather colorless; however, she and Muni speak the two of the most famous lines in screen history as he backs into the darkness at the end of the film This is a must-see for film buffs and will give newcomers to film appreciation, an insight into the artistry of Muni and films from the early years of Hollywood</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wise man once told that it isn't "what" it's "how" when it comes to film. Meaning that how well a film is directed, acted, written, executed, photographed, etc. etc. etc. is much more important then what a film is about or the message it is giving us. What I'm getting at here is that when this film was first released it wasn't well received by the public due to the subject matter of it, which is a shame because it really is a good, excellent, and engrossing look at a man who has nothing left, but then gains it all back again, and ends losing it all again. It's obvious that people in the 1930's did not understand that it's not "what" it's "how". Anyway, "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" is a good film because of how extremely well it is acted, and how wonderfully it's executed, directed, and written. Paul Muni is exceptionally well in an Oscar nominated performance, as is the rest of the cast. Another thing that makes this one something to remember is how much a connection the viewer is able too make to the character of James Allen/Allen James, you find yourself rooting for this man, feeling this mans pain, and feeling sorry for this man. A film that is definitely worth a look. By the way, the scenes where James is trying too get the chains off of his feet are especially disturbing and somewhat cringe worthy (in a good way).</fullReview>

However, as it was meant to expose, excite and inspire the masses about the real-life case that inspired the movie, it does a wonderful job. Paul Muni is practically a one man show playing the lead character who is wrongly convicted and then repeatedly brutalized by a sick system. On top of that, there is lots of action and the movie is well-paced and difficult to ignore. I think that an excellent idea would be to watch this movie and then watch one of the documentaries on the real case.

		<shortDescription>Excellent 'bio pic' from the 30's: worth a rent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film by director Mervin Leroy from the fledgling years of sound back in the early 30's. It has been referred to as a "bio-pic". The story line was riveting, so much so that I despised the ending even though it delivered the most powerful and appropriate message for this movie.The movie begins below deck of a states-bound ship from WWI. James Allen, (played by Paul Muni) appeared a bit rushed and unnatural in delivering his lines as did all the characters at first. Time leveled this out and there was a better flow of acting as the film progressed. Muni began to resemble an early "rebel without a cause" character in the dinner scene when he voiced his dissatisfaction with his brother's and mother's plan for his career. It must have seemed very defiant to the audiences of that day as was the provocative dialogue between he and his landlady/first wife. Her come-ons were considered aggressive even by today's standards. I enjoyed the cinematography of this film especially the use of shadow.I also admired the message portrayed by Leroy when he showed James Allen to be a man willing to pursue his dream and passion despite the cost. The cost was the wrongful charge and unfair punishment of hard labor for stealing. The message of irony in the end that demonstrated how the legal system accomplished the exact opposite of what its designed for was brilliant. The court system, hard labor camp, and cold society made a thief out of an innocent man with a dream. This was successful in eliciting emotion in the audience. I identified with Muni's character in that I wanted to see more of his story: how he evaded the police, wrote/published his book, and secured a position as a Hollywood script consultant. The abrupt "I steal!" ending was very meaningful but I left the screening wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive and Unforgettable Story of Social Injustice and Brutality of the Abbusive Penal System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the World War I, the decorated for bravery sergeant James Allen (Paul Muni) decides to quit his job as a worker in the local factory in his hometown and find a position in construction business. He travels through many states, but is not well-succeed. Without any money, he is cheated and involved in a robbery of a dining place in the southern. He is wrongly convicted to serve in a brutal chain gang system for ten years. He escapes, moves to Chicago, where he becomes a prominent citizen and superintendent of a construction business. Due to a letter of his stupid brother, Rev. Robert Clinton Allen (Hale Hamilton), his girl-friend Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell) finds his condition of fugitive and blackmails him, forcing James to marry her. He becomes upset with the situation of permanently cheated husband, asks for the divorce and she denounces him to the police. During an intense dispute between the States of Illinois, asking for his pardon, and the Southern State, demanding the return of James to the prison, the brutal chain gang system is exposed, with tragic consequences for James.This movie is an impressive and unforgettable story of social injustice. The saga of James Allen seems to be inspired in the unfair misery of Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo's "Les Misrables"; however, it is incredibly based on the true story of Robert E. Burns (see IMDb Trivia). The sad and heartbreaking conclusion of the story, with James Allen becoming a criminal, is cruel and a severe critic to this medieval penal system. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "O Fugitivo" ("The Fugitive")</fullReview>

I was certainly made aware of the brutal practices used on prisoners and I experienced the rightful amount of outrage. But I was never entertained. And however noble a goal film has, its main purpose is still to entertain. And keep in mind topical films can still be entertaining. Paul Muni's Scarface exposed the lawless brutality of organized crimes but still entertained along the way. But had no attributes other than topical reference. The main character wasn't particularly endearing. The plot was simple and dry. I never felt like the movie was enticing me to keep watching.

		<fullReview>I strongly dislike I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. This is solely because of personal opinion based off of a negative emotional reaction to the film. It was depressing and dark with no hope in sight for the main character James Allen. The use of sound did add to the film's story telling ability though, and without the use of sound and voices the story would have been difficult to understand. I found Rev. Allen to be an annoying, stiff, and dry character that reduced the films quality. James Allen was dynamic though and the actor who portrayed him, Paul Muni, did a decent job at expressing the plethora of emotions that Allen experienced throughout the film. The plot was complex enough to be interesting and it was a suspenseful film. It could have been greatly improved with better acting and portrayal of emotions. It could have also gone more in depth into how Allen was feeling and what he experienced as a soldier and as a member of the chain gang.</fullReview>

So that makes things more interesting! In this movie he's more innocent and respectable, but the complete opposite in Scarface.I felt bad for his character, James Allen. The entire time I found myself rooting for him, but he just kept getting bad luck. All I kept wondering was... why didn't the burger stand guy stick up for him? It was pretty obvious that he didn't want to steal from him. He was also held at gunpoint. He ran because he was scared, it's just a human response. So I really don't understand why he got into so much trouble.I'm glad to hear chain gangs were gotten rid of after this movie came out, because they seemed like disgusting, awful places. Imprisonment for crime is one thing, but slavery is awful. It's just really unfair how he even went back willingly to serve time and then the government pretty much spat in his face and kept him there. It's completely wrong, I can't understand what kind of people would do something like that.I personally couldn't get into this movie at all. It was just sad and upsetting to me.

		<shortDescription>This Chain Gang is Riveting ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni gives a riveting performance in this 1932 film for which he received an Oscar nomination.It's as if we're with Inspector Javers and Jean Valjean but this time it's the state of Georgia who ruthlessly goes after James Allen (Muni) when the latter was trapped into participating in a robbery. Muni's one mistake was that he tried to flee when the real culprit was shot dead.The picture beautifully showed the brutality associated with chain gang jails so many years ago. Muni escapes and builds an outstanding life for himself though trapped in a marriage with a woman who will turn him in unless he stays married to her. After volunteering to return to finish his sentence, he is betrayed by the state who keeps him in jail as a punishment for leaking the story of how bad the chain gang system was.Society itself is really on trial here. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely memorable and quite fabulous to put it mildly.This film was definitely a stinging indictment of our criminal justice system years ago. Though 75+ years since it was made, it is an inspiration to those of us who strongly believe in equality and justice for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Melvyn LeRoy (Little Caesar, Mister Roberts), this film featured in the book of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was one that I was looking forward to, because I really like classic crime based films. Basically James Allen (Oscar nominated Paul Muni), a sergeant in the army, has returned home to civilisation having served in Worlf War I, but is restless following his experience, and he cannot get to grips with working a tedious office clerk job, he wants to become an engineer, and his family do not react well to this announcement, they are outraged. He tries to find work after leaving home and he is open to any sort of career where his interest would be used, but only labour jobs without any skill required are available and in many places, he finds it hard to get work he wants to do, and he sinks slowly into poverty. Living in a shelter he is one day asked to come out for a hamburger with his friend, but the friend actually intends to rob the diner they go to, and despite it not having much money his friend places the money in Allen's pocket, and he is caught and wrongly accused of robbery. He is sentenced to ten years in prison and made to work as part of a brutal Southern chain gang, and these chained men are all forced to do manual labour, such as pickaxing rocks and fixing rail tracks, and the prisoners know that there are two options to get out, escape or serve your time with good behaviour. Allen decides when he has the opportunity to escape, and to do this he has another prisoner bash he chains with a sledgehammer to loosen the cuffs, and then he is able to sneak into the woods, take off the shackles, and he runs and escapes. Back in the city of Chicago with some money from one of the other prisoners he buys himself a new attire and has a shave, and then with an address given to him he is able to find a person to let him hide out while the police search for him. Looking for work and giving himself the new name Allen James he slowly builds himself up in the world of construction, until he is much higher up in the business world and becomes successful, but he does have some problems with his boardinghouse proprietor Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell). Having become involved with her she finds out his secret of being an escaped chain gang prisoner, and she blackmails him that if he does not marry her she will tell the authorities, so he agrees to this, and they stay married despite being unhappy with each other. He then finds true love with Helen (Helen Vinson) and wants to marry her, he asks his wife to grant him a divorce, but she keeps him on a leash and refuses, and worse, she betrays him and gets him caught to be sent back to prison. The authorities determine that if Allen hands himself in serves a set time in prison he will be pardoned, having become a respected member of society and creating successful business and construction, Allen accepts and returns to prison. Of course it is when the time he was told he would be released comes that he finds out the pardon was in fact a ruse, the authorities simply wanted him back behind bars and in chains, so again he sees the only choice of freedom is escape. Allen manages to get away again, but he cannot go back into the business world and will be forced to stay on the run, so before he disappears he visits Helen in the darkness and tells her he will be leaving forever, before departing her she asks "How will you live?", and going into the shadow he only replies "I steal." Also starring Noel Francis as Linda, Preston Foster as Pete, Allen Jenkins as Barney Sykes, Berton Churchill as The Judge, Edward Ellis as Bomber Wells, David Landau as The Warden, Hale Hamilton as Rev. Robert Clinton Allen, Sally Blane as Alice, Louise Carter as Mrs. Allen and Willard Robertson as Prison Board Chairman. Muni gives a terrific performance as the manly wrongly imprisoned who makes a good name for himself in business but cannot escape the prison system and the sadistic guards, it is a fantastic story of a framed man and assumed criminal turned respected man but forced back to the low life, and doing everything possible to escape punishment, it is a must see classic drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Sound, Recording. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Social/Political Statement - not a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am glad that I was watching this movie for a film class, because I would have been disappointed to have watched it for my own enjoyment. I wasn't drawn into the world of the chain gang and several things in the movie, while they are based on factual events, just seem too fantastical to have happened. I have to believe that they were dramatized for the movie at least to some extent, because while they were culturally relevant in the 1930's, they aren't today.The only reason this movie doesn't have a rating of one for me is because of the social/political statement made by the movie with respect to how the chain gangs operated. This is a movie based in fact - and the book and movie led to the eventual end of using chain gangs by showing the politicians and the public what was going on and how horrible the conditions were on the chain gangs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the inhumanity towards WWI vets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title may make the movie sound like a silly comedy, but what "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" portrays is no laughing matter. Based on the true story of Robert E. Burns, WWI vet James Allen (Paul Muni) is falsely accused of robbery and sentenced to work on a chain gang in Georgia. The horrible conditions on the chain gang are worse than what anyone might have imagined. Fortunately, Allen manages to escape. Of course, then he has to live his life on the lam.Above all, "IAAFFACG" is a staunch indictment of the criminal justice (or rather "injustice") system in the early 20th century. It shows how this man served his country in wartime, and was subsequently treated like dirt. Movies like these should serve as a reminder to us all of how prison life is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and Understated; Fictionalized Biography of Consistent Quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fictionalized biography, "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" was one of the most influential films made in early Hollywood. It starred character actor Paul Muni as a man who had participated in a small robbery who was hounded because he later escaped from a chain gang--in Georgia, but not identified as such--for years afterward. In fact, he was again a fugitive at the time the film was released. The story line takes up the cautionary tale of Robert E. Burns, here named James Allen, who returns from WWI after doing engineering work; unable to find paying work, he goes with a man because he is hungry to commit a $5 robbery. The other man pulls a gun and shoots at the police who are called; when the other man is killed, he is sentenced to ten years at hard labor. This means being chained within barracks and wearing a striped uniform, being fed swill and breaking up rocks on the roads from dawn until dark. Whippings for the least criticism are common; and Muni suffers such a punishment. He gets a black fellow victim to bend his shackles; a friend gives him $7 and an address. During a bathroom break, he slips away and manages to escape men with rifles and their dogs. He grabs clothing off a line and several times barely escapes detection. He buys a train ticket and while the police chase someone else, he makes it to Chicago. Changing his name to Allen James he works his way up to foreman, surveyor and eventually superintendent. He rents a room from a hard blonde, Glenda Farrell; she wants him to love her, and complains when he tries to study. She learns of his past, and threatens to tell about him unless he marries her. But when he does, she cheats on him with other men and spends his money. He grows interested in another girl, Helen Vinson, and asks Farrell for a divorce. They quarrel and she turns him into the authorities. While awaiting extradition, he tells the press about the chain gangs. The state he escaped from offers to pardon him if he will return serve 90 days voluntarily. He talks to Vinson and decides to go back. But the commission there break their word and refuses to think about pardoning him until he has served a year's sentence, on a chain gang. His brother, a minister, champions his cause but Muni escapes after a year has gone by and there is no end in sight. He uses dynamite in an escape. After finding Vinson to say goodbye, she asks him how he lives. His chilling reply is, "I steal...". The ending is invented; but the filmmakers' purpose was to dramatize the injustice of the punishment system being indicted, all along. The script was adapted by Sheridan Gibney, Brown Holmes and Howard J. Green, from a story serialized and published in several places shortly before the film was made. The details of Burns's life were altered; but the essential spirit of the film is true to the details of his unjust sufferings. The real-life Burns eventually returned to Georgia and without being pardoned was cleared of further charges. The Georgia authorities tried to sue the producers and the film was banned in the state. Director Mervyn LeRoy gave the film a spare B/W documentary look, with plenty of action and intelligent dialogue. The art direction by Jack Okey and the cinematography by Sol Polito are memorably straightforward also. Orry-Kelly is given credit for the gowns used and Berhard Kaun for the terse and effective music. The large supporting cast is filled with familiar names, from Preston Foster and Robert Warwick to Edward Arnold, Lionel Atwill, Everett Brown, Dennis O'Keefe, Jack LaRue, Douglass Dumbrille and Roscoe Karns. Among the more prominent cast members are Sally Blane, Louise Carter, Allen Jenkins, Hale Hamilton, Willard Robinson and many more. Of the leads, Foster is very properly menacing, Farrell is very good as Muni's wife and Vinson sympathetic as his girl. Paul Muni is earnest, never flamboyant and sincere; his rugged and solid performance helps sell the normative nature of the man who is so much more sinned against than sinning. This was merely the first award- nominated look at the injustice of the no-longer American US public interest government's justice system; even though the road gangs were done away with in the late 1930s, but later revived, the theme of the lack of individual justice in many spheres in an increasingly undefined and bureaucratic system==however many honest individuals serve in it--was one taken up often, though not often enough, by Hollywood filmmakers for decades afterward. The genre of hero victims was carried on largely on the strength of the commercial success of this classic expose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot was lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall this movie was ahead of its time with the camera work and the screenplay. But honestly I don't like the scene where James Allen got caught up in the robbery and then proceeded to get sentenced to jail. I feel like their should have been a scene in between the robbery and the the scene when James was placed in Jail. The scene would be in a court and it would have a judge talking to James explaining why he is getting sent to jail, I feel like there would be more suspense and it would make the movie flow together better. I really do like the scene where he is under the water hiding from the guards I thought that was creative and unique. I would recommend anyone who likes old movies to watch this one but don't be discouraged with the plot because it bothered me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are all the Chinese people???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having read anything about it seeing how it always tend to spoil films a bit and not knowing one heck about terms for American prison labor camps in the 10's and 20's (being Norwegian could explain some) It was only natural for me to assume that the "Chain Gang" was a term for a Chinese/Asian Triad (As I seem to recall there are only Japanese triads, but that were escaping me at the time) what a surprise I got. I where suspecting Asian gangsters and ended up with a prison "noir", one of the best films of the 30's but still I was puzzled for a while. Where the hell are those Asian gangsters I kept wondering.Anyways. It's a perfectly handled film and way before it's time. It's also very dark and did a few things that would not have been allowed while the Hays code was at it's strongest.It's a masterpiece by all accounts. A must!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A World War I veteran (Oscar-nominee Paul Muni) denounces the factory system and falls into poverty and trouble in the deep South. After being wrongly convicted in the robbery of a dining joint, Muni is forced to hard labor on the chain gang. Escape is always on his mind and is finally realized, but his past catches up to him later on in Chicago as he is blackmailed into marriage by a cold and unfeeling woman (Glenda Farrell). When Muni falls in love with Helen Vinson, it seems that Farrell will indeed force our hero back to the brutal chain gangs of the south with horrific results. A social consciousness in the hopes of changing the prison system in the deep South is very prevalent throughout in this film which is based loosely on actual events. Muni, one of the most under-rated and under-appreciated actors the cinema has ever seen, does arguably his greatest work in a complex and heartfelt role. Definitely shades of "All Quiet on the Western Front" as the film goes beyond the medium to convey strong messages and accurate truths associated with social morays of the early 1930s. Thought-provoking and dominant in every way, "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" continues to be an imperative piece to the American cinema today. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic film where in the title says it all.The film delivers and do prepere to be depressed.The chain gang system in the South is exposed for the inhuman slavery system it is.This is why it is not a joke moving around the innards of the U.S.A. as a trasient fish out of water job seeker.You just might get sucked into this slavery hell which by the way is still very much alive at the present time in a slightly different form here and there but still the same cat.The acting here was splendid and the script/screenplay was very good.The problem is that through the years,there have been many other films created like this that are more grander in overall production quality.These later versions may not be as original but the technology offered better results compared to the very primitive style offered by the best of 1932.Only for big fans of prison system genre movies,quality 1930's movie fans and big fans of the lead actors....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang (1932) is a film that Alfred Hitchcock might have enjoyed making, for it develops the wrong man scenario with impeccable panache in vestiges of the human condition turned on its end. The film stars Paul Muni (a largely forgotten actor today, but one of the greatest chameleons on film) as a returning war hero, James Allen. Rejecting his old position at a work house, James soon discovers that other work is hard to come by. Reduced to hobo status, he is accidentally framed from a train robbery and put to work on one of the most ruthless chain gangs. After much suffrage, James manages to make a daring and successful escape to Chicago where he embarks upon transforming himself from unemployed bum into a titan in the construction industry. But reality intervenes his ascendancy when former girl friend, Marie Woods (Glenda Farell) discovers his secret and threatens to expose James to the authorities unless he marries and provides for her own self financial securities. This latter complication is further put to the test when Joe discovers that he has fallen in love with Helen (Helen Vison) instead. In keeping with director, LeRoy's penchant for spinning yarns to the lovelorn, the latter half of this would be gangster and police flick is maudlin melodrama, built up with frothy resistance to the corruption and hard-edged bite of its preceding hour or so.While this film has never looked great on home video, there are marked improvements available for the first time on this Warner DVD. The B&amp;W scale seems more refined than was previously available, with subtler gradations. Flickering of the image is persistent and a tad distracting in some scenes. Age related artifacts abound throughout. There's more than a hint of film grain, and, while I am not adverse to having grain present, there is way too much grain here to suit even my liberal tastes in several key sequences. The audio is mono but nicely balanced. Richard Jewell's commentary is informative. Other extras include a couple of theatrical trailers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...if this thing got four stars. I was really looking forward to this film, but it let me down in nearly every way imaginable. The plot line is improbable (no one could be as dumb as the protagonist seems) and jerky/rambling (no vignette really develops before we're on to another misadventure by our hero). The acting runs from forgettable (the best performances were probably by a couple of fellow inmates) to simply awful, as Muni simply gnaws on the scenery from time to time, especially in the final pathetic scene. Some details, like camera-work and costuming are nice, but not nearly enough to rescue this from the stink-heap.I think what really irked me was this film's supposed commentary on America's penal system, when really it seemed like a snarky attack on the Deep South. If Hollywood wishes to perpetuate regional stereotypes, they really should produce a better film in which to do so.4/10...watchable but certainly not memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stale acting and B grade direction and script make film tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is hardly a "classic", nor is it a "social protest movie" that most of these misguided reviewers would have you believe. It falls into the realm of impressionable 'exploitation' films that attempted to substantiate struggling theaters with their wealthy competitors. Warner Bros. looked for "controversial" themes to release them from their box office slump and found it with topics like this, packaging emotional rubbish into the screens in the form of low budget B grade "content films". Anyone who thinks Warner Bros was a "redeeming and caring company interested in the plight of man" is deluded, they were merely out to make a profit, nothing more. Examine their union records, dictatorial management and abuse of rights at the time if you don't believe me. Surely, a film which pulls at your heart is only intended to pull at your wallet.The film itself has a weak script, stale acting (bordering on dull to over anxious), B grade direction, poor dialogue and is tedious. It meanders through one half hearted empty skit after another, dislodging us from any sincere interest at all. Muni is a boorish actor, neither disguising his brusque acting method nor elaborating on any convincing emotion. Standard film shots are scattered throughout, of locations and events in history, a parade from WW 1, a real street scene in Chicago, and this further aggravates the authenticity of the whole subject, making the film look "cut up" because most of it was filmed on cheap Warner Bros sets in Pasadena. The chain gang scenes are unrealistic, exaggerated, and only attempt to garner instant condemnation from the viewer. I don't need a mediocre film to instigate that "chain gangs are evil", I should know that from my own knowledge, and further more, this film contradicts itself because capitalism itself is slavery and there is so much insane dialog about the "virtues of work" in the beginning. I fail to believe that there is a difference between a worker at a factory occupied for 12 hours a day like a slave and a man stuck on a chain gang! An average film reduced by film historians and buffs to a "classic" merely because they can not understand why films had to make a profit for the capitalistic and authoritarian film companies which produced them. Do not tell me about "social awareness" when only profit to powerful monopolistic companies was involved!</fullReview>
