		<shortDescription>M. Night is Back, Baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to talk about any M. Night films these days without discussing his career trajectory, how he started off incredibly strong with a triple knockout of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, only to have his potential squandered, or at least questioned, with films like The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth. As a fan of Shyamalan myself, even I had to admit that he may have lost his luster. With that being said, I'm overjoyed and elated to say that The Visit is Shyamalan's best film since The Village over 10 years ago (my personal favorite). And it's not so bad it's good. The Visit is a legitimately good film, with great performances, terrific setups and even better payoffs, and an overall simple but satisfying story, which is all Shyamalan needs right now.It's difficult to say much about the story without revealing too much, because The Visit is essentially the type of film where it's better the less you know going in. It's not to say the film is filled with plot twists left and right, but how cleverly it subverts expectations, especially based on the film's misleading marketing campaign. Let this be known: The Visit is a horror AND comedy. It's downright hilarious (intentionally so) during a majority of the film but also equally scary and creepy, which is what M. Night is known for. I was laughing hysterically and screaming, sometimes at the same time! The success of the film is how effectively it jumps in between the two genres and frequently on the dime. The third act showcases this in the best possible way and in full Shyamalan fashion.Though there are plenty of laughs and screams to be had, The Visit is also filled with surprising moments of drama. There are, at the very least, three genuinely beautiful scenes. One of those involves a zoom in of a certain character, and it's utterly heartbreaking. Credit must be given to Shyamalan who manages to get great performances from his actors, a welcome change after the stilted and wooden performances in his last few films. Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play the leads, and they're completely likable in their roles. Oxenbould, in particular, steals every scene he's in, providing many of the film's biggest laughs. Seriously, the jokes in here are funnier than most comedies released these days. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie are also rightfully creepy as the kids' offbeat grandparents. Last but not least, Kathryn Hahn leaves a great impression, despite the limited screen time she has. She's truly wonderful here.Overall, The Visit is ridiculously entertaining and a total crowd pleaser. It's the film we were all hoping for Shyamalan to make to get him out of the slump. No, it's not as great as his first four films, but it's a step towards the right direction. Recently, it's been revealed that he'll reunite with producer Jason Blum and Joaquin Phoenix for a new project. If it's another low budget feature like The Visit, which it most likely will be, we might be witnessing an era of Shyamalascance. After all, going back to basics is his greatest asset right now. Who says horror/comedy can't work?UPDATE: The film is even better the second time around, and I noticed a lot of details I missed during the first viewing. There's even clever meta humor sprinkled throughout that might not be apparent at first. Additionally, I'd like to put a spotlight on Deanna Dunagan, who I didn't give enough credit to beforehand. She was fantastic. How great and fulfilling it is for an actress her age to have a role that is complicated and complex as is the character of Nana, to be sweet and motherly in one scene only to switch (convincingly) to creepy and insane the next. In one especially dramatic scene, you will even ache for her. Only if you stop to think will you notice the many layers Dunagan has to play with, and for that reason, she should be praised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's still originality in Hollywood horror movies !!!? I'm scared !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the rarest horror movies that managed to keep me totally scared and mostly uncomfortable from start to finish in years and years. I don't get this new trend of hating everything Shiamalan does. This new movie is one of the best horror concepts I've come across in a very long time and uses simplicity to the best effect. I don't get what people these days expect an horror movie to be. If you don't think this a good example of a simple concept that works like a dream...or a nightmare, I don't get what passes for horror in Hollywood no more. The idea for this movie is fantastic, and it's very well executed. I really don't get why people complain that nothing happens in this story. It's that type of simplicity that keeps the scary atmosphere throughout the entire movie. This is not a cgi crap action so called horror thing for teens, this is a classic old school horror, it's filled with a creepy atmosphere and uses perfectly all the ideas for each character to keep the viewer feeling uncomfortable all the time. There's a couple of good scares ,but most of the horror really happens inside our minds. This is the best thing in this movie, it creates such an atmosphere of tension with simple things that when something really dramatic happens on screen we get ten times more startled and there's no need for any cgi on this movie at all to scare teenagers and bore the rest of us to death with the usual clichés. Not on this one.This is clearly an horror movie for adults, its not edited at two hundred frames per second and it has a classic structure that simply is not targeted at young audiences. This is an horror movie for horror fans, it's not a popcorn movie for general audiences so ignore the bad ratings on IMDb, because if you remember the good classic stuff from the 70s like The Omen, The Changeling, or all those movies built on atmosphere instead of action, this movie is for you.Absolutely brilliant. In my view the only thing that does not work is the final sequence after the twist is revealed, simply because the movie stops being a a story that creeps us out and becomes the usual fight for your life action bit we've seen hundreds of times. But until that happens this story is scary. Not because of what it shows but because of what keeps making us expect it's going to happen next.Shyamalan is really back and this screenplay is the best thing he's ever written since the sixth sense and unbreakable. Also the casting is simply perfect with brilliant performances from everyone.True horror is back folks. Ignore the bad hype from the multiplex popcorn crowd. This is a real gem that deserves to be among the very best horror titles of recent years and it will creep you out if you like your suspense atmospheric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it had any right to be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I've been severely burned by M. Night Shyamalan's commercial misfires (or rather miscarriages) like Lady in the Lake (ugh!), Airbender (what the hell was he thinking?) and After Earth, I decided to give him one more shot in the shape of The Visit. What worked in his favor was his superb work on the small screen in the form of the 2015 mini-series Wayward Pines - which made me believe that deep down inside Shyamlan's heart still resides a true artist, and not some lazy hack who tackles big-budget flops just to get paychecks from the studio. His recent talk in interviews about gaining back artistic control of his products was another positive step in Shyamalan's long path to cinematic forgiveness.And so I entered The Visit, a somewhat short and intimate tale of two precocious teenagers, a brother (13) and sister (15), who travel cross country to meet and spend a week with their estranged grandparents, whom they have not seen or met since birth due to a big family feud their divorced mother (Kathryn Hahn, the most recognizable face in the cast) refuses to talk about. The sister, Becca (the promising Olivia DeJonge) also happens to be an aspiring filmmaker, out to make a documentary about the big reconciliation, which ever so conveniently sets the movie up in the popular found footage sub-horror genre - but also opens a wide crack for endless jokes and self-aware nods towards the unsuspecting audience.Anyway, as you could probably tell by the previews, something isn't quite right with Poppa and Nanna, and even though at first they seem like reasonably nice elder folks, their strict rules (do not get out of the room after 21:30, do not go down to the basement) and strange manners (you'll see what I'm talking about) soon enough make it clear to both Becca and Tyler (the smaller brother portrayed by the superb Ed Oxenbould, who at 14 shows endless promise) that they better get the hell out of there - as fast as they could.Besides the trademark Shyamalan twist, which actually works here and seems reasonable in hindsight (unlike, say, The Village), the extremely self-aware script and the very natural and authentic brother-sister relationship between both co-leads, lends further credence to Shyamlan's pet project. You can see that he cared for the characters, and you can also easily remember that this is a director who made a reputation for himself because he managed to facilitate such an emotional and iconic performance out of then-11-year-old Haley Joel Osment, so obviously he's good with kids. I don't know if young Ed Oxenbould is the next Osment, but he sure does deliver the goods through and through - and gives one of the best children/teen performances I've watched in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfathomably Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking into the over crowded theater to see yet another over hyped M. Night Shyamalan movie, I already missed the money I had spent on the 90 minute torture. Let's face it, Shymalan has not made a fantastic movie in over a decade and this movie does not show any signs of him getting any better. We all know as soon as we turn on a Shymalan movie that there is going to be a plot twist that is so obscure that we would never have thought of it, but the Visit fails to deliver this mind blowing twist. The idea that the 'grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. Not only is the twist a complete failure but the movie delivers no real scare. There are a few cheap jump scares throughout, but no suspense or build up.The children in the movie are seldom frightened by the bizarre behavior of their 'grandparents', but they do make a lot of jokes about them and are very sarcastic about everything that happens. This strongly takes away from the horror factor. Think about it. You're stuck in a place with 2 elderly people you have never met who are very strange and at one point you even record one of them knocking on your door with a knife. Witty banter is the last thing on your mind. Finally the very last issue with this movie comes from one of the last scenes in which the 'grandfather' shoves dirty diaper in the young boys face and in retaliation, the boy kills the old man all the while yelling like the hype man at an 8 mile rap battle. No not like he's yelling because he's a minor killing someone who just shoved crap in his face, but literally like Eminem's on stage hype guy. As if that wasn't enough to defeat the end of this movie, after a touching scene with their mother, the movie cuts to the young boy in his sisters room rapping about his visit. If a kid had crap shoved in his mouth he wouldn't be writing a rap about it. If a kid had to kill someone to go home he wouldn't be rapping about it. He would be talking to a therapist and not acting as if nothing had ever happened.In conclusion, this movie was unrealistic, the emotions of the kids were very unnatural, the plot twist was barely a twist, and I would never see this movie again if I was paid to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A contender for the worst film ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is wrong with people? This film is currently rated 7.0?! I didn't think that I would see a film worse than "Knock Knock" in 2015 but M. Night Shyamalan's "The Visit" could possibly be the worst film I've ever seen. Every aspect of this film is terrible. It has all the cliché problems of the "found footage" genre - the shakiness, the perfect Hollywood cinematography when these are supposed to be teenagers with hand- held cameras. The plot is Swiss cheese and the twist can be spotted a mile away (the web cam did it for me). The children are so incredibly obnoxious and their dialogue so pretentious that I wanted them to die as soon as possible.There is a scene in it where an elderly incontinent man slaps a diaper full of feces into a child's face and I can't help feeling this is a metaphor for Shyamalan's career. He can't help producing this trash but he chooses to slap it in our faces and, like the child in the film, we all just stand there and take it. Seriously, no joke - worse film ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait am I in the Right Theater?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing I found out (to my dismay) that I did not know before going to the theater was that a lot of this movie was shot in the long over-used and abused "home movie/shaky cam" format. If I had come in the theater in the middle of the movie, I might have assumed I had accidentally wandered into the 7th, or whatever, sequel to Paranormal Activity. And to add insult to injury M Night is about 8 years late to the party for that trick. Or was it suppose to be some type of irony or mocking of the standard horror movie fare? Perhaps this once creative director has finally succumbed to audience expectations --if all you want is cookie cutter, unimaginative, thematically barren, shaky cam, scary movies then here you go...... Another let down for me was that in his earlier movies there were always a number of positive sub-themes running through the movies that I found as interesting, if not more so, than the obvious scary movie theme. I failed to find any such redeeming parallel plot lines in The Visit. Again maybe he is just simplifying his movies to match his audience's wishes.On the upside, I did find this movie to be something of an improvement over his most recent efforts. There were a few good chuckles. There were a couple of OK jump scenes. There was some tension here and there, but overall still a disappoint for me. Of course, I eventually liked The Village and Signs a lot better after I had watched them several times on DVD. Maybe there is a jewel in the rough hiding here, just waiting to be found. Rating a 5.5 of 10 on first impression though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only ever liked a very small number of films by M Night. And this one won't be joining that short list. It was a waste of my time and money. Slow, boring, and easily predictable. I couldn't stand the 'documentary' style of filming, hated the characters and the acting, and wanted to walk out of the movie before it was finished. I keep giving this movie guy the benefit of the doubt but time after time his movies bite the big one.The gist is a mom has a falling out with her parents. Many many years later, out of the blue, the parents want the grandchildren to come visit. Even though she hasn't seen her parents in years, she lets the kids go off on their own to hang out with people they've never met. Then weird stuff happens and an annoying kid tries to rap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan since Sixth Sense his movies are usually good. with great plots, good acting. but after Signs Shyamalan you went nuts or something cause the movies you have put out have been completely absurd. I made the mistake of reading into the reviews and got excited that M. Night Shyamalan has returned to form. HAHAHA the jokes on me I actually spent money on this retarded movie. by the way You forgot to expound on why the effects of dementia only come after 9:30PM? or maybe you did and that was one of the many parts I fell asleep. what about what was the connection to the psychiatric hospital? were they neighbors? if it was a small town as you suggest then everyone would know everyone and more than one person would come looking for the elderly couple. Sixth Sense awesome, Unbreakable was great, signs OK, the village stupid, lady in the water stupid, the happening even stupider, last air bender OK, the devil OK, after earth OK, the visit was just stupid, the twist, a child can guess. M. Night Shyamalan this is last time I will fall for your nonsense. I will never again pay for a movie of yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Night we knew and loved is finally back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well that took a while but I can now say that he is back. I think this is the kind of film where he thrives? low budget, small and intimate domestic settings and a smaller scope. It has echoes of Signs, The Village and The Sixth Sense. I see that critics are comparing it to The Conjuring and I would agree to an extent yes, it has the same level of information withholding.It's amazing how this film manages to be so wonderfully terrifying without the use of much cgi or special effects. A couple of points in the film I yelped and let out a nervous laughter (and I'm a tough guy).M. Night Bashers will continue bashing this film but I feel this will stand the test of time, much like his best films. I hope he keeps this up and makes two or three more of these 'small' films quickly and then perhaps, people will eventually forget his larger failures.I say, watch it. If anything, it's a fantastic lesson in directing horror through restraint.</fullReview>

But it wasn't Scary A few jump scares Thats about 40% of the movie is a Kid rapping swearing And making no sense or want to see a old woman's butt then this is the movie for you The most scary thing in this movie was seeing a naked old woman. it was a Little funny but it was mostly weird and awkward. Some may like it but to me its just very weird. It looked WAY different in the ads in the ads it looks like a REALLY good movie but Before the kids even get to the grandparents house its already getting awkward so if you want to wast your money go and see this movie. Or if you want to see a shaky camera Or a grandmother clawing on the floor and scratching on walls Or grandpa Pooping and putting it in a boys face And Getting dressed every day in a suit or hiting a guy walking down the street.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best worst movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this expecting it to be terrible, and terrible it was. I couldn't contain my laughter at the entire stupidity of this movie. Half of it didn't make sense, the jokes weren't funny, the main girl is pretentious and annoying, the boy is also extremely irritating and his raps make my ears bleed. The only part that kept me walking out of the cinema was that twist in the middle. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA???? WHO FUNDED THIS?!?!?I tried writing a review of this, but I couldn't, so instead I'm just going to do a quick Cinema Sins thing and list all the things that don't make sense in this movie. Spoilers ahead.Why didn't the mother show the kids any pictures of her parents, how did they afford two really good quality and expensive cameras, why did that kid rap in front of his grandma, why did they keep going out after 9:30 pm if they saw their grandma not only puking, but NAKED, why didn't they tell the mother everything they saw, how were the grandparents always 'out' when visitors came, why did they leave that girl hanging on that tree for all to see, what was up with that alien story, why didn't THE KIDS RUN, why did she actually get inside the oven, why did he all of a sudden get all weird and personal with that 'you think you're worthless' talk with his sister, why was he zooming in on the camera why did they not just pretend they were sick, how were the grandparents paying the bills, how did the grandparents have internet, why did the kids not fight back, why did the boy just stand there while the grandma LOCKED HIS SISTER IN THE OVEN, why the boy just stands there and let the grandpa shove literal s**t in his face, why did the boy go absolutely insane, why did the grandma stare in the water, why did the fake grandparents kill the real grandparents and take care of their grandkids, why was the grandma smart enough to ruin the girls laptop camera but not smart enough to destroy the ethernet cable, why did the police not suspect the kids of just being murderers, why were they absolutely bats**t crazy, but only at certain times, why did the grandma get uncomfortable when they talked about the daughter, why was the ending so terrible, why did the boy have an expensive camera and laptop, but a s**t mobile phone?But, the most pressing question of all, why in gods name did that girl wear that UGLY yellow turtleneck sweater?!?!?!I have so many more questions, but my brain needs a rest. 10/10 worst movie ever would see againTL;DR: Terrible movie that doesn't make sense but funny sometimes without meaning to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbingly funny and interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good: The most surprising thing about this movie was how it uniquely found a way to be scary, but still include funny moments throughout the film. It knew when to be funny, and when to be scary, without mixing the two together. The scary parts will provide quite a few jump- scares, and in some scenes they will simply disturb you. The young boy, "Tyler" (played by Ed Oxenbould ), will quickly become a favorite in this film with his various remarks, "swearing", and "skills". I think it's fair to say that "Nana", played by Deanna Dunagan, does a really good job of playing the crazy grandma given all the versatile things she did in the movie. For some, the plot twist in the story will be mild, but good nevertheless.The Bad: As we've come to know from director M. Night Shyamalan (The 6th Sense, Signs), the "big twist" is to be expected. Because of that, if you're an over-analyzer of movies like me, you'll probably see the twist coming from a mile away. So in that aspect, the story is mildly predictable. (That doesn't ruin the movie though) Many of the scary scenes you'll see coming, and for the most part are not terrifying to the point that will give you nightmares. It's very generic horror and scare tactics that we've seen before.The Reason: Okay, so here's the real deal about this movie. M. Night Shyamalan is known for having a really bad reputation for putting out movies like Lady in the Water, The Village, The Happening, and others. He started off great with The 6th Sense and Signs, but since then, audiences have been generally disappointed. Luckily for The Visit, this movie was not one of his bad films. It was disturbingly funny and scary at the same time. This film is like his "makeup movie" to audiences. For example, in a relationship, if a guy messes up and constantly disappoints his girlfriend, he may give her flowers as an apology. Now the girlfriend may like the flowers, but that doesn't mean the boyfriend is completely forgiven. Shyamalan is in the same boat. The Visit is his "flowers" to audiences. We'll take it, but he's still got a lot more work to do to make up for all the other not-so-great movies he's given us.Take caution if you decide to see it. It's a unique movie. Not a Hollywood blockbuster by any means, but I wouldn't be surprised if many would enjoy it. To see this movie I recommend: Go in with low expectations, pay the matinée price, and go with a friend or date. (You'll want to talk about it afterwards)The Rating: 7/10For more of my reviews visit: www.EmansMovieReviews.com</fullReview>

Among the many possibilities are these: #1:Why did I do it? #2:Can I get my $$ back? #3:Have I just wasted precious hours of my life I will never get back? #4:Is there anything worse than a 12 year old kid with a lisp repeatedly rap singing into a shaky camera held by his older sister who uses language reserved for grad school Art History pseudo intellectual students who smoke cigarettes &amp; discuss cinematic themes pretending to be smart? #5:Is there a worse Director than M Night Shamalammadingdong? #6:Is there any possibility that there could be a movie in the last 5 years that I have seen that I enjoyed less than this one? #7:Will I ever let my Wife select another movie for us to go to? #8:If you are involved in some way in the production of this movie, do you realize at that time during production that you are infecting the universe? #9:Do they really make a residential oven about 7 feet deep that you would crawl into after your deranged Grandma who you have known for 3 days asks you to clean it? #10: Just how often do you have to clean this type of oven? I could go on &amp; on &amp; on, just like this movie went on &amp; on lisp rapping &amp; cringe inducing without end. The only way M Night could have improved the script here would have been for a meteor to destroy the earth in the first 5 minutes &amp; spare me the torture of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the return of M. Night was... A long boring ride of over the river and through the woods and can we just go somewhere else? This would have been a great half hour Sci-fi flick! Unfortunately it lasted an hour to long. The daughter was a long drawn out artistic bore. Watching another movie where the cast films the movie is showing me just how unoriginal And out of ideas M. Night really is. As far as a comedy horror flick the funniest part is the 12 year old white kid rapping like he's straight outta Maine. The daughter wants to create a film about "the Visit " which she might as well got directing credits. I don't think M Night actually showed up to work on this disaster we will call a movie but at least it only cost 5 million dollars so which leads the viewer to ask what happened to the other 4.9 million dollars. Just a boring ride to Grammys house. Maybe the next M. Night movie will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Sham is back and as lousy as ever. Presenting the one director most famous for living his career in reverse. His great masterpiece was his first movie and it has been nothing but downhill from there. Each film gets worse and worse. And believe it or not, in an attempt to make a big comeback, he resorts to the found footage genre, the cheapest, sleaziest and laziest genre in existence today (sometimes I wish Blair Witch Project was never made so I didn't have to suffer through one of these lousy movies after another). This film might have been something where we saw some promise if it was some director's first attempt, but it's not, it's freaking' M. Night Sham's umpteenth freaking' film and so it's a pile of garbage. The big surprise twist is obvious from about twenty minutes into the film and from then on it's just another stupid found footage film. This could have been a pretty scary film if it WASN'T in the found footage genre. The found footage concept detracts from everything as we wonder, who is still filming? why is the camera still filming? how convenient that the camera fell to the ground and is still filming at such a great angle. Blah blah freaking' blah blah blah like EVERY other found footage film ever made. Too lazy to actually make a film, well then, resort to found footage. The crappy cinematography can be blamed on the concept. Yeah, M. Night Sham is back alright, back to the same old crapola.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit - Trailer Trash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? Misled by a movie trailer, yet again. I should of known better. The trailer gives off this 'cool' horror air to it; crazed, psychotic grandparents. That was so far off the mark. It's basically a film about two young kids who visit their demented grandparents. I walked out. The granddaughter walks around the house filming everything. At one point, I wanted to stick my hands through the screen and smash that video camera to pieces. A couple of scenes are chopped. One scene in particular that annoyed the hell out of me was the 'oven' scene. In the trailer, the grandma demands the granddaughter to "get inside" the oven to clean it. I'm thinking "That's pretty creepy. Grandma is going to bake her." Nope. The granddaughter goes inside the oven for maybe a second tops and guess what, she wipes the oven and NOTHING happens. Why am I livid? I paid 12.00 stinkin' bucks to see a HORROR film (like the trailer depicts) not a drama about senile old people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Contains Spoilers &amp; Gripes!** I saw the trailer for The Visit and was hooked instantly - it really looked great, had fantastic atmosphere and suspense. Unfortunately it was one of those cases where the guy who edited the trailer should have made the movie as the bar had been set much higher than the finished product came near to delivering.Firstly this movie is (yet another) "found footage" film, a sub-genre which has arguably overstayed its welcome and I started getting itchy feet within the first few opening scenes. Secondly (based on the trailer)I thought I was in for a supernatural thriller but it's not. That's not to say it's without its moments of suspense and laughs on our trip to Grandma's house but sometimes these laughs feel almost unintentional. Speaking of unintentional, The dialogue of the two young protagonists is clearly the words of a 45 year old man trying to write for what he remembers young teenagers speaking like 20 years ago (and the camera-work for young teenagers with cheap hand-held cameras is almost Hollywood-like cinematography).Overall a film that's oddly less than the sum of its parts and a clear missed opportunity. It'll be a long time before I get suckered again to see another M Night Shyamalan film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The impossible has happened... it's an M. Night Scamilan film and it didn't completely suck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, OK, it had some sucky components.As usual - * Overblown characters with excessive dwelling on them doing cartoony, cute, 'stuff', as a substitute for actual development. And them doing ridiculous things that nobody would actually do.* Speechy-preachy dialogue.* Long, drawn-out scenes, over and over - except that this time most of them - MOST of them - actually *contribute* to the overall effect rather than just boring the viewer.* Focus on the completely wrong targets: the guy always makes the film he thinks he's making, rather than the one the viewers actually end up seeing, so you end up with these completely non-sequitur, irrelevant 'development' scenes. In this case there is a completely tacked-on pre-ending that leaves the viewer going 'Why is this here? Why are we supposed to care?'-Amazingly, NONE of which destroys it:-The intro is attention-grabbing.The build-up is stately and involving.The Weird piles-on quite disturbingly.And the twist is a GOOD one instead of something DUMB!-This is the first thing I've seen since The 6th Sense that wasn't write-off rubbish.Maybe he's got on, or off, the right medication?? - -- ---</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just why?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is garbage. There were only two times in my life in which I literally wanted everyone in the movie dead, good or bad, that being 'Knight and Day' with Tome Cruise, and this piece of garbage. - I came to watch a horror movie, not a silly 13 (9?) years old white boy shaming himself while trying to rap. I fast forward those parts, they were just too shameful to watch. - How come anyone could possibly believe that someone would let her kids go to their grandparent's house after 15 years without seeing each other, alone?! F*ck at least go with them in order to be sure that your parents are able to take care of 2 kids, you neglectful mom. - I won't deny that the parts where the grandma was acting strange were somewhat creepy, but there was a minute in which it became just forced and unrealistic. - I'd rather gouge my eyes before watching those kids trying to act again.- The kids tell their mom that 'something strange is happening' and she doesn't even ask what it is, she just tries to make her kids shut up by saying 'oh they're just old, don't worry' 'But mom grandpa poops himself and grandma is crazy' 'shut up and make me go watch my boyfriend winning the most hairy chest competition'.- As I wanted the kids to die quickly so I could go away, the best part was when the grandpa shoved the poop-covered diaper in the kid's face. That was glorious yet it wasn't enough to keep him from rapping.- After your mom finally pays attention to you and she tells you that those aren't your grandparents, what do you do? Nothing. You play Yatzee with the guys and then you don't even try to smash the chair in their faces, and when the fake grandpa locks you up in the room with the crazy woman, what do you do? Keep recording and screaming. You don't put the camera down not even for a second so you could, I don't know, beat her up for good?- Why does the police take so damn long to arrive there?- Why nobody felt the smell of decomposition?Long story short: the movie is horrible. Go spend those 5$ in something more constructive like food.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't See This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my defense; I didn't know this was an M. Night Shyamalan until the movie started.Does anyone honestly enjoy shaky, hand-held camera footage in the year 2015? Specifically - documentary style in the hands of two kids? Without revealing much about the twist at the end I will say I knew what it was going to be the moment the kids got on the train (alone) to go see the estranged parents of their divorced mom - Whom they've never seen, and mom hasn't spoken to in 15 years. Most of you can probably guess what the big twist is just from this paragraph.YES it's that poorly written.Please don't go see this movie just for the sake of never seeing that little boy rap three times throughout the film. No, not just something quick and silly. It's complete, self-written songs that even make it into the end credits. I could easily have granted this movie 2 stars if Tyler (played by Ed Oxenbould) was edited out of this dull waste of time.Secondly, please do not go see this film if you want to hear five thousand instances of the name "Pop Pop" throughout the 94 minute run time of this 15? budget. But please feel free to make it into a drinking game just to validate it not getting 0 stars.Third. Which should definitely be FIRST; Do not see 'The Visit' because it was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Writer of Stuart Little, The Happening &amp; After Earth fame) - Who I shall forever deem "Midnight Shabadoo" simply because I can't stand hearing his name.Have I not convinced you? If you are one out of half the US population that claims to be gerontophobic; Do not see this film.I for one, do not have an unreasonable fear of the elderly, so an old woman playing chase with two kids underneath a porch does not horrify me. An old man that keeps thinking he has to go to a costume party isn't going to keep me on the edge of my seat.Dementia? Dementia would have been a great plot point to work with! You wouldn't need to bother with the "fake grandparents" twist. It could have been a straight story about two kids trapped with their elderly grandparents as they suffer the symptoms of Alzheimer's. But the problem is - is that Midnight Shabadoo isn't a good writer. He thinks "good" means "plot twist", and he'll never write anything I'll ever care about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I'll say about this film it that it is truly terrifying. I screamed out loud several times and on more than one occasion I contemplated getting up and leaving the theater so that I wouldn't have to endure yet another image to send my heart into my throat. I did, however, stay through the entire film to watch the madness unfold. Other than the accomplishment of turning the entire audience into a frightened bunch of individuals screaming and covering their faces, this film is less than amazing. The cinematography is almost too good for what it is conveying. It is done from a first-person perspective with the two children are filming everything or placing cameras around the house. The premise of the story is that Becca, the 15-year-old daughter, is making a documentary about her grandparents to try to mend their relationship with her mother. However, the quality of the filming makes it hard to believe that it is the work of two young teens. That being said, the quality of the cinematography on its own is exceptional, but it does not help the realism of what the film is trying to portray.Then, there's the acting. The mother, played by Kathryn Hahn is the only recognizable face in the cast full of breakthrough actors, so this is probably the first feature length film that many of the actors have starred in. Let me say that the performance by Deanna Dunagan (Nana) is the best out of the entire film. She is truly frightening and does a remarkable job transforming from a kindly and forgetful old woman into the sinister character that still haunts me.Then, there's the rest of the cast. Many of the moments in the film appear entirely forced and anything but organic. There is an awkward sense of comedy that comes into play at times that seem inappropriate and unhelpful for the plot. On occasion, the comedic moments give way for some relief when the horror aspect becomes intense, but mainly it takes away from the integrity of the film and feels too forced to be enjoyed. Another reason that the acting in this film is questionable is that way too often, characters in the film go on rants that last longer than necessary and slowly unravel into a performance that is less than believable and feels more like an audition tape than a blockbuster moment. I began to lose interest and belief in the characters and it took me out engagement in the film.The film revolves around Becca, Tyler, Nana and Pop Pop. The mother and a few concerned neighbors drop in from time to time, but the majority of the film focuses on these four main individuals. It is very important that these well developed characters since they are the focal point for the whole film. However, the characters of Pop Pop and Nana are simply overdone. Nana is by far the most provoking character in the film, but there are moments when she spirals into unnecessary behavior. Nana and Pop Pop are supposedly insane, suffering from what some might deduce as schizophrenia, dementia or Alzheimer's. This makes for a frightening cocktail of mental illness, triggering the terrifying nature of the film. However, M. Night Shyamalan goes out of his way to give them every textbook and stereotypical symptom involved with this batch of mental illness. Pop Pop is the most noticeable as he has just about every single symptom that is associated with being old and crazy and it completely takes away from the authenticity of the character. He goes on rants explicitly showcasing all of his symptoms and, when this happens you could hear an audible sigh of disappointment and boredom from the audience. Nana's character is not as affected by these excessive textbook-symptoms. But there is one scene when Nana is having quite a moving moment in an interview with Becca and then she spouts off about creatures from another planet and goes onto say "oh and they have antennae...but they're invisible...but only I can see them...and one day they will take us back to their planet and we will be saved." None of this contributes to the story and it is the only time that Nana exhibits these specific symptoms. So, it does not help build her character nor does it aid the plot.The last main complaint I have is the ending. The film appears to end in such a perfect way and if the last five minutes of the film were cut out, I probably wouldn't be sitting here writing this. After the assumed ending of the film fades to black, it pops back up with an interview of the mother. Here we have yet another monologue moment where she shares "touching" and "meaningful" information about her parents and then ties in the supposed moral of the film..."Don't hold onto anger." She sheds some tears and then shows some fake home videos of the children as toddlers. This is an unnecessary attempt to tie in some deeper meaning to the film and create an emotional ending that is not needed in the slightest and left me, and from my observations, many of the other audience members quite disappointed. The film finally ends with a comical rap done by 13-year-old Tyler, which, while entertaining, is an unnecessary addition to the ending that made me forget the genuine and fearful moments I had experienced previously that make this film worthwhile. I give The Visit 2.5 out of 5 stars. This movie did scare me, but other than that it is all over the place and felt very forced. However, if you're looking to be scared and disturbed, then check out The Visit. Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 18.

		<shortDescription>Flawed but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan has suffered like few other directors as a result of his later films not measuring up to the exacting standards set by The Sixth Sense and Signs. Part of this is self-inflicted, because he has refused to veer from the"M. Night Shyamalan" formula: modern fairy tale crafted to take an unexpected turn approximately two-thirds into the fun. When the twist fails to impress or the fairy tale is dull, the movie disappoints audiences on on two levels. Not only is the movie judged mediocre, but it is criticized for failing to deliver on the promise made by Shyamalan's earlier efforts.The fairy tale and twist delivered by The Visit do not disappoint. Hansel and Gretel effectively employ today's media and technology for narration and exposition, leading the viewer down an increasingly foreboding path. The fear and anxiety caused by Nana and Pop-Pop's odd behavior appeal to our politically incorrect subconscious: we shy away and are even repulsed by displays of dementia and senility, no matter how clinically explicable we understand those displays to be. I was pleasantly surprised that the predicted twist was not predictable, and I felt a sincere surge of a-ha! at its revelation.The Visit falls short with respect to the traditional elements of film-making. The children, particularly the brother, are portrayed as cloying, non-credible 1980s sitcom characters with cheesy lines. Attempts at humor come off like a toast at a Dirty Dancing era summer camp in the Catskills. The siblings show no sign of being actual teenagers from the 21st century until approximately 45 minutes into the film, when they interview each other for their "documentary" and reveal certain vulnerabilities. The forced nature of this scene serves to highlight the otherwise inauthentic personalities assigned to them by the director and script. The mother's character is painted with the same superficial gloss, a problem magnified by her limited time on screen. These weaknesses prevented me from empathizing with the family members and reminded me throughout that I was indeed watching a movie.Perhaps Shyamalan was so focused on invoking his brand upon The Visit that he was distracted from maintaining its essential quality. Like many other viewers, I still look forward to the film where he regains that balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Shyamalan Film After A Long, Long Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having spent years squandering the studio money &amp; garnering the wrath of film critics in his past few outings, M. Night Shyamalan takes a break from big-budget productions and decides to return to small-scale projects constrained by shoestring budget in an attempt to rediscover his creative side and with his latest feature, I'd say he has found it.The Visit tells the story of two siblings who decide to spend a week with their grandparents at their farmhouse while their mother is planning a vacation with her current boyfriend. The two kids, having never met their grandparents in person before, find their company strange at first but as the days pass, they discover a deeply disturbing secret about their hosts.Written &amp; directed by M. Night Shyamalan, The Visit finds the director away from all sort of studio involvement, thus allowing him to rely on his creativity to overcome the restrictions imposed by its low budget and he does a really good job at it. The film makes use of all his trademarks and successfully blends different genres &amp; shooting techniques into one solidly crafted thriller.Shyamalan's screenplay isn't bad either. The plot is quite simple, the number of characters are kept to a minimum and all have relevant roles to play in the outcome and it's effectively brought to life on the film canvas. The found-footage camera-work is nicely carried out and its tight editing only helps in establishing an increasingly tense &amp; suspenseful atmosphere, which is brilliantly sustained till the end.The expected Shyamalan twist is also there, following which the movie becomes somewhat predictable and the pay-off isn't much rewarding. The performances are a definitely plus for the kids waste no time in becoming a nuisance, especially that 13-year old rapping douche, but it's actually their grandparents who leave the most lasting impressions with their eerie renditions, which only gets more menacing as the story nears its end.On an overall scale, The Visit is a welcome return to form for M. Night Shyamalan after his lengthy string of critical &amp; commercial failures and is a strange mix of horror &amp; comedy that is able to balance the elements of both genres quite nicely. It does create a friction at times but for the most part, the narration is smooth. The few bad decisions taken in the picture lie within the characterisation range and as a whole, The Visit succeeds in delivering a thrilling movie experience, that comes loaded with odd laughs in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My heart sank. Great story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am the first to admit you have to be in the mood for one of M Night Shyamalan's films. He intentionally tries to throw you off guard when you are watching one of hid films, you constantly question if all is as it should be, or quite simply is he messing with you.I had ignored all info, trailers and chat about this film, as with all his movies once you know what's going on they change somehow, it's the first for a little while of M's films I can say I really enjoyed.I won't go into too much of the plot, a single woman estranged from her parents receives an online message from them, she allows her two kids, Becca and Tyler to stay with their grandparents for a week. The kids use the experience to make a film, some behaviour they capture is rather inexplicable.Excellent acting, but it's the kids that steal the show, I really thought they were brilliant.At one point in the film my heart truly sank, I felt uneasy being the viewer, I felt powerless, and for that reason I give this film an 8, it's been a while since a movie has done that to me. A bit slow for the first twenty minutes, but the ending is worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Actors Can't Save a Sinking Ship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason this got a 3 instead of a 1 (my initial response) was that the four main performers worked really hard to drag this dead horse across the finish line. Unfortunately, the film is so poorly written that I never believed any of the characters or situations so it was hard to really get involved with what happens. When a director devotes extensive footage to a thirteen year old White boy from the suburbs attempting to rap, you know he's desperate to stretch his story out to feature length.This is a textbook example of what would have been a tense and exciting thirty minute TV show and stretch it to feature length. The hand-held camera business was irritating enough that it in itself cost the project several points. There should be a special rating of S added to any film that tries to induce nausea in viewers by trying to induce motion sickness.Now, I will admit that when the Big Plot Twist came along I was surprised. Sure, variations on that twist have been used before (DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT comes immediately to mind) but it was effective.Better luck next time, Night. It's good to see that you're still in there trying (if I had directed THE VILLAGE I'd have gone into the Witness Protection Program because it was bad enough to be considered criminal) and you can't hit a ball you don't swing at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, this was bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I had no expectations of this movie. I have no bias against M.N.S. and have enjoyed some of his movies before. Unbreakable is great and one of my all-time favorites and The Sixth Sense is very good as well. The rest have been "ok" to "poor".Forget all the logic holes in the movie...the kids having never seen a photo of the grandparents, the kids acting normal after all the weirdness going on, the fact that no one knows two lunatics have escaped from the local mental hospital and their two counselors have gone missing. Forget all that.The premise of the movie could have been interesting, but the way it was handled was just terrible. The word "ham-fisted" popped into my head over and over again as I watched this mess. There was no subtlety about the Nana and Pop-Pop characters at all. M.N.S went out of his way to show the audience, "these people are friggin' crazy!" There was no creepiness to it, only hilarity with how over- the-top the grandparents were made out to be. The "twist" was nothing of the sort as it was obvious as soon as the "don't go into the basement" line was uttered in the first 20 minutes. Sure there were some jump scares and a few funny moments, but horror film? Really?The acting wasn't too bad, but the script was God-awful. My 12-year old daughter and her 2 friends thought the movie was hilarious and enjoyed it. My wife and I couldn't wait for it to be over. If you have pre-teens, drop them off for this and you and your significant other go see something, anything, better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one who's grown to hate the found footage filming style. Going in that was my biggest worry. But I must say M. Night does a fantastic job behind the camera. Even though this style of filming has become stale (to me anyways), Shyamalan makes it feel refreshing and new. There are also some truly beautiful and impressive shots throughout the film, which was really good to see. I also really enjoyed the performances from everyone. Especially the two kids, they were surprisingly pretty fantastic. The little boy comes off as annoying at first, but he grows on you. And he ends up being hysterical. Both the grandparents were good as well, but the grandma stole the show between the pair.In the end, I very much enjoyed The Visit. It was an absolute blast. The whole audience was really into it, which really added to the experience. This is one of most fun times I've had at the theater in quite some time. I recommend anyone to go see this movie, and see it with a crowd! Who would have thought Shyamalan was capable of making an intentional comedy? The Visit is truly one of a kind, there's no other movies out there like it. It's so original and so unique, the more I think about it the more I love it.And yes, there is a twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until I saw 'the 5th wave' this year, I had never left the theaters this insulted before as a paying viewer.The movie's idea is actually not that bad and I really had hopes for it ,but this all fell apart in the first 15 minutes.1. The first time the boy raps into the camera it is really bad, horribly acted and it takes way to long. Not to mention that this happens twice more. I will go into my idea of why this occurs at the end.2. The movie is never scary, just disgusting. Which is easy seeing that he just films naked, sometimes pooping, elderly people.3. The twist is not really a twist, because it is the only explanation possible, a half hour before the so called twist.4. I think as do many others, that the analogy of the sh*t being shoved in the kids face is actually a f*&amp;% you from M.Night to the viewer.5. This is possibly the worst. If you make a hand-held movie the worst thing you can possibly do is only accept danger when the camera is facing it. If you are being chased by something scary just turning away the camera does not make the danger go away. Too bad M.Shight seems to think so.And last but not least the end credits, where the kid feels the need to rap again. This is just the director adding insult to injury and smearing the fecal matter that he previously threw in our faces.I will not be watching an M.Night movie any time soon again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit is kinda worth visiting. It was an alright movie for the most part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While, the movie isn't really that funny, or scary. This horror movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan was surprising, not that bad. It had the right amount of horror and comedy to make it, somewhat entertaining. The Visit proves once again, that this where Shyamalan belongs. After all, these are the genres that M. Night Shyamalan is known best for. It also helps that the movie was marketed as a small-budget independent film, rather than a huge money blockbuster. This allows, Shyamalan to work harder on the story asset, rather than focusing his time, on over-the-top visual effects. Unlike Shyamalan's recent films, there is an emotional depth to The Visit that is worth seeing, alone. The movie tells the story of contemporary grief/loss and how not to hold on to anger to your loves ones, because you don't know if you'll ever get a chance to forgive/reconcile with them. It's a very strong message that anybody can related to. I really did get invested in the story of a family is trying to recovered, from a recent divorce. Hoping to give their mother, Paula Jamison (Kathryn Hahn) a well-needed vacation with her new boyfriend; two young kids, Thirteen-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and 15-year-old Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) agree to spend a week with their grandparents, even though, they never met them. At first, their "Nana" (Deanna Dunagan) and "Pop Pop" (Peter McRobbie), seem fine, but things started to unravel, when night falls. Can the kids survive their week with them, or will something deadly happen? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie is clearly not a 'found-footage' movie, like some critics label it. It doesn't have, that raw factor that many found-footage movie, has. First off, the camera visual style isn't that amateurism. There wasn't a lot of blurry shots, shaking cam, or pitch darkness shots. Thank God! I like that the movie was mostly well-shot. Shyamalan uses the style with more creativity than most other filmmakers, displaying his unique visual motif. Some great examples are his use of reflected images for dramatic and thematic effect. Others are his use of intimacy long-takes and how he creates a Mise en sc?ne. Plus, the movie, zig-zagged, heavily, from traditionally In-Universe storytelling camera shots to hand-held. It's felt more Cinéma vérité, with bits of documentary style. It's really hard to bypass this as 'realistic found-footage' movie, when there are credits &amp; day title cards, being shown, throughout the film. It's a bit jarring to see that. However, I get, why it's filmed on a hand-held camera. There is in universe reason for this. It was film, this way, because Rebecca is an aspiring, documentary filmmaker with a big heart. Rebecca wants to document the whole thing as a form of therapy for her mum, whose reasons for the bad blood with her parents remain a tightly-kept secret. The characters themselves are even aware of certain cinematic theories that could make their "documentary" more interesting. They're refreshingly intelligent and self-aware, and they never blunder stupidly into any situation. I also love the straight-to-camera confessions scenes. You really get to see, their desires and anxieties through it. Using this, Shyamalan was able to show, a large range of emotional, within his actors. In my opinion, most of the actors give great performances. The child actors were very likable. The grandparent are downright creepy. However, there were a few things that didn't work for me. I really didn't like how the film establish the kid's phobias. It wasn't use, right. I really don't get, how Becca is afraid of looking at herself on camera, but she's okay, at looking at herself, on Skype. Another thing, why Tyler is afraid of germs, yet, he's willing to play hide and seek, under the dirty stairs. It doesn't make sense. For the grandparents. I really didn't like Grandma's over the top, "alien" theory. Remind me, too much of his previous awful films, 2006's Lady and the Water, and 2002's Signs. Her jump scares and suicide attempts were also pretty lame. It seem, more silly than disturbing. I also didn't like, the poop or cleaning the gun jokes for the Grandpa. It really seem way too cartoony and fell really flat. Nevertheless, I still like their Yahtzee scene. By far, the best part of the film. Some of the grandfather's dialogue, is kinda choppy, and unrealistic in tone, too. The film has also been criticized for its use of dementia equals violent, approach, by other critics; but in my opinion, I just glad, it wasn't cause, by, anything supernatural. Overall: I came into this movie with very low expectations. After all, it's been a while, since director M. Night Shyamalan made an alright movie. While, this movie isn't bad, it wasn't really good. It was pretty mediocre. As much as people might hate him, in my opinion, Shyamalan is a filmmaker whom somewhat deserve a comeback. Hopefully, his next movie will be a masterpiece. Sadly, this movie wasn't it</fullReview>

By now, it's hard to feel any enthusiasm for a new film from Shyamalan (who was once described as "the new Steven Spielberg"); but after all the big missteps he has had in his filmography, I keep thinking he's an excellent director sabotaged by a huge arrogance and bad decisions as a screenwriter. For better or for worse, The Visit doesn't confirm either of those facts; the direction is nothing spectacular, and the screenplay isn't as bad as I feared. The young actors Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould make a pretty good job in their roles, keeping a credible fraternal dynamic with each other whose naturalness helps us to accept the rancid home video technique. However, the screenplay makes their characters seem occasionally precocious and over-articulate, not in the post-modern way from Kevin Williamson, but on the more pedantic style from... yes, Shyamalan. On the positive side, I appreciated the almost total absence of music, highlighting the atmosphere of isolation and rural melancholy. And even though The Visit has been labeled as "horror" by many people, I think it would be more precise to describe it as a psychological thriller which examines the gradual mental dissolution from two old people separated from society, and whose traditional values contrast with the vivacious and irreverent attitude from two "tweeners" plunged into gadgets and digital technology. Or is there a supernatural explanation for the erratic behavior from the grandparents? In my humble opinion, the best moments of The Visit are the ones which make us question that premise. There's something sad and almost tragic in the "they are old; that's why they behave like this" phrase to justify their most bizarre behaviors. Or I might be projecting my fears, now that I'm not very far from senescence. Anyway, there are many much better films to receive thrills; but I appreciate the fact that Shyamalan decided to include those reflections in the movie. On the negative side, The Visit feels longer than it should. There are too many repetitive scenes which pretend to bring deepness to the characters, but they feel like excuses to streeeetch the periods between "thrills", and delay the unavoidable final twist as much as possible (I found those rapping aspirations from the boy almost insufferable). So, the answer is: no. The Visit didn't end up being Shyamalan's triumphal comeback, even though it might seem so when we compare it to atrocities such as The Last Airbender and After Earth. I found it a mediocre, but moderately entertaining thriller, whose main problems come from the forced "homemade" technique and a monotonous screenplay which isn't as surprising as Shyamalan (and the audience) hoped so. Nevertheless, The Visit at least reinforced my hope for Shyamalan to fully redeem in some moment of the future. That twist would truly leave me shocked. Might "the new Spielberg" be able to become "the old Shyamalan"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film did hold my attention for the entire viewing okay but really did not have a lot else going for it. It's a horror film with precious few moments of real menace: in fact, it almost seems that Shyamalan did not go for them.Another thing that puzzled me: why are the kids so unafraid when they're spending days with two people who go totally nuts every evening after 9:30? I admire Shyamalan for trying home movie making, just about, after recent setbacks. He picked two great child actors also, and the adults do more than justice to their parts. But this film doesn't even begin to mark a return to his heights in past films and he nastiness at the end feels very contrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither Comedy nor Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this after viewing what was a quite promising trailer. I left disappointed and almost with a feeling of confusion about the actual point of the film.The casting of the young boy was poor, his acting rigid and his rapping in the film, surreal and really not having any purpose but to add some slightly awkward comedy value. Now there were some moments in the film that were jumpy and added to a quite dull story, but it was nit enough to distract from a lacklustre event of a film. Not the worst film made, but will not rush back to watch this film again even if it was a freebie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers a few scares, laughs and even a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were effective moments. Some moments succeeded in scaring the audience. Some moments of over-the-top fake scary moments that came across as funny. Both these types of scenes worked. Even with the entire theater expecting a twist, it still managed to surprise and serve as the scariest moment in the movie. The twist's reveal was perfect because it was delivered in a single memorable, quotable line much like "I see dead people." Certain moments in the movie were supposed to be scary but simply weren't because they didn't really make sense. They were just odd moments. Odd doesn't necessarily make something scary. Many times the grandparents acted strangely but not in a scary way. Just odd.I think the main reasons the movie bugged me were: the girl was phony. I saw this pretentious wannabe film geek that didn't really know much about making films. I saw a lot of M. Night in her. He thinks he's super smart and capable of making deep, provocative movies but for the most part he isn't. His movies are typically pretty bad.The movie was a mess. Sloppy. It didn't know what it wanted to accomplish. It's a family relationships movie. It's a horror movie. It's a comedy. It tries to be all those things but it winds up missing the mark on all of them.If you aren't looking for anything more than a movie with a couple scares and laughs with a fun twist at the end, you may enjoy it. If you want something more, watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Picture I have seen for a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know as soon as we turn on a Shymalan movie that there is going to be a plot twist that is so obscure that we would never have thought of it, but the Visit fails to deliver this mind blowing twist. The idea that the 'grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. Not only is the twist a complete failure but the movie delivers no real scare. There are a few cheap jump scares throughout, but no suspense or build up. The children in the movie are seldom frightened by the bizarre behavior of their 'grandparents', but they do make a lot of jokes about them and are very sarcastic about everything that happens. This strongly takes away from the horror factor. Think about it. You're stuck in a place with 2 elderly people you have never met who are very strange and at one point you even record one of them knocking on your door with a knife. Witty banter is the last thing on your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more mainstream horror film by Shyamalan. I liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan's new film is called 'The Visit': A single mother sends her two young kids for a short visit (a week) to their grandparents in a village in Pennsylvania. She hopes that the visit will rekindle the affection of her parents towards her. Years ago she had an argument with them and had to leave the house because of that, not keeping in touch until now. She hopes time has healed things. Time, however, sometimes can have other plans in our lives.The kids eventually go to their grandparents and record part of their experiences with a small portable camera even taking improvised interviews with both grandma and grandpa. Things however soon turn out strange and the kids will need to find a way out.Shyamalan directed some very good films in the past. Among these I would like to mention some of his best (according to me) :'The sixth Sense', 'The Unbreakable' and 'The Village'. These films contain certain horror elements but are not horror films in the true sense of the world. They can be categorized as thrillers with some supernatural or psychological elements that still do not make them traditional horror films.'The Visit', in contrast, is a mainstream horror film. I liked it. It does not give something new in the genre. Instead, it follows certain rules of traditional horror films: First, the setting is a bit unsettling and creepy; the kids visit an isolated village with no possibility to make any new friends. Secondly, most of the occurrences take place at night or at claustrophobic environments. Also there is an unexpected 'twist' in the plot towards the end that makes the situation that the kids face dramatic and unpredictable.Shyamalan cares for his protagonists and approaches the plight of the two kids with interest, portraying even small details of their personalities. The brother relies on his sister and vice versa. Together they find a way to go on in life and join their mother who awaits them back home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The Visit is a 2015 American found footage horror film written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn Hahn. The film was released in North America on September 11, 2015 by Universal Pictures.--Critical response:-The Visit received mixed reviews, but many critics considered the film a return to form for Shyamalan. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 184 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "The Visit provides horror fans with a satisfying blend of thrills and laughs ? and also signals a welcome return to form for writer-director M. Night Shyamalan." On Metacritic the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "B-" on an A+ to F scale. -Scott Mendelson from Forbes called Shyamalan's film a "deliciously creepy and funny little triumph". He also wrote: "The Visit is the one we've been waiting for, folks. It's good. Oh my word, is it good. But more importantly, it is excellent in that specific way that reminds us why M. Night Shyamalan was once such a marvel. It is richly humanistic, filled with individually sketched characters that often sparkle with wit and surprising decency." And in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis described the film as "an amusingly grim fairy tale". Shyamalan has gone back to basics, "with a stripped-down story and scale, a largely unknown (excellent) cast and one of those classically tinged tales of child peril that have reliably spooked audiences for generations". -In his column for The Observer, Mark Kermode panned the film, saying it may be worse than Lady in the Water: "Is it meant to be a horror film? Or a comedy? The publicity calls it 'an original thriller' but it is neither of those things. Only 'endurance test' adequately describes the ill-judged shenanigans that ensue." Mike McCahill gave the film one star (out of five) in his review for The Guardian, and said it was "Dull, derivative and flatly unscary."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have done without the rapping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big question on people's mind seems to be, is The Visit a return to form for the once promising director, M. Night Shyamalan. The answer is yes and no. While the film is leaps and bounds better than his last 4 previous efforts which include: the dreadful After Earth, the boring Last Airbender, the inane The Happening and the disappointing Lady in the Water, it fails to be anything more than another entry in a long list of horror found footage films. Yes, M. Night Shyamalan has fallen far my friends, so much that just his name on the screen invokes laughter and groans from the audience. He has to fall back and rely on an overused horror genre to bring some sort of credit to his tarnished legacy.His entry into the found footage genre is The Visit. What Jaws did for the water, The Visit might do for old people. When a mother of two young kids is contacted by her estranged parents, asking to finally see their grandkids, she decides to let her kids go live with their grandparents for the week, while she goes away on vacation. The kids are so excited that the film loving daughter decides to make a documentary about it. Bringing her trusted camera along for the ride, she captures some odd footage from her grandparents and weirder and weirder things start happening after 9:30. So we have to ask ourselves, what's wrong with NaNa and Pop Pop???The one thing this film does right is something that Shyamalan seems to do well or at least use to, is create a terrific atmosphere. The old home has just enough corners here and there to raise the tension, to make us as ourselves, "What's behind the corner over there?" Having the film be a found footage picture, gives Shyamalan more control over the camera. He can choose what to reveal and when is trickier ways which put the characters in a bit more danger. One terrific sequence where Shyamalan is really at his best is when the kids decide to play Hide and Seek under the house. You expect the unexpected and Shyamalan delivers probably the best scene he's done in years. The grandparents are excellent; they convey just the right amount of oddness and sympathy. Each scene that they have alone with the kids is when they try to explain away the weirdness of the other. NaNa describes why Pop Pop does the things he does and vice versa. It was an interesting dynamic between the characters that immediately tells you that they are hiding something. Unfortunately, the same can't really be said about the children. Two unbelievable kids, which means I did not believe anything they did was genuine. Whether it is rapping, yes the kid raps a lot, or the cinematic dialogue the girl uses. Nothing they said or did ring true to me, which took me out of the experience. The Visit is creepy enough to warrant a watch for those that love the found footage films. It's shot in a way that doesn't lead to vertigo or nausea. You finally have a film where you get to see everything that happens on the screen, which was a nice change of pace. Shyamalan might not be back in the good graces of people, but The Visit is a decent start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Horrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The visit is a thriller movie based on two children (a brother and a sister) who are with their single mother who sends them to their grandparents house for a week so that they could meet them. The sister Becca (Olivia DeJonge) wants to make a really cool documentary about her grandparents and also about the broken relationship with her mother (or their daughter) and the little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) tries to help her with it. As they stay there and film their documentary they find out that their is something wrong with their grandparents. Will they survive?To be honest this movie sounded really stupid and was also directed by M. Night Shyamalan so I thought this movie was going to suck. I WAS RIGHT. This movie has to resemble everything wrong with not only the horror genre, but with movies nowadays in general. So let's just see why this movie sucked so bad. First characters and character development. The characters in this movie have to be the worst characters that I've seen in my entire lifetime. Not only are they horribly written and are nowhere close to likable, but they don't develop as characters whatsoever. They were so static that they were like the TV screen in The Ring, and even when we started to learn more about them personally it either didn't really matter or we didn't really care which all together made them really boring to watch, and that's just the protagonist. The mom was also a horrible character just for the fact that she is SO stupid. She sends her kids off to her grandparents that she hasn't seen in years, and might still have two crazy people living with them. Second the plot which is a piece of absolute crap. I found it to be not only be stupid, but also extremely boring. All the way up to the end it was absolute boring and horrible because it had no suspense whatsoever. A Lot of the moments in the plot would have most likely been interesting if they built some sort of suspense (and if they did build suspense it was so horrible that I didn't noticed it), but they didn't. So combined with the found-footage type cinematography (which I will talk about later) and the lack of any score (which I will also talk about later) this plot had no interesting, suspenseful moments, which made it overall boring as hell. Third the Score?????oh wait I forgot THERE WAS BARELY ANY SCORE so let's talk about cinematography. The cinematography in this movie (just like any other found footage movie INCLUDING Unfriended) SUCKED ASS! The found-footage style of filming is just so awful and confusing to watch and it really makes it hard to make the movie come to life, or at least be mildly interesting. Sadly no one has pulled this type of filming off (and no one ever will) Overall I can only this movie 3 stars because it's that bad, but not 1 or 2 stars because at least they tried (barely).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit - to the Dreadful Pit of Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I just watched M. Night Shyamalan's latest flick, "The Visit." If you haven't seen it yet, SPOILER ALERT!! Continue reading at your own risk.Firstly, I'm quite disappointed in Shyamalan and I really think he's losing it. He hasn't made a movie in like 5 years, and this is what he comes up with? Oh yeah, he did have a part in last year's "After Earth," which is a children's movie, so it doesn't count.I've loved pretty much all of his movies, except of course for the notorious Airbender, which honestly I never even bothered with. Needless to say, I was very pleased that he was finally making something back in his genre and was quite looking forward to it! I'm not a big fan of the found footage style, though there have been a few cool ones. The movie starts out okay ? a little slow paced, with a creepy kind of undertone, similar to many of M. Night's previous works. I waited patiently to be fascinated by some amazing plot twist, or at the very least, mildly frightened by a few good scare scenes.However, the creepiest scene in the entire movie was about 90% of the way through, when the Mom says, "Those aren't your grandparents." So that was pretty cool and I really was not prepared for that. I was thinking "yes, here is where it escalates." But, noOoooo. That's the entire punch-line. Grandparents were murdered and replaced by random crazy old people.That's all. That's the whole story.Not aliens that live under the water and lure unsuspecting victims into a deep sleep, only to devour them later. Not monsters that morph at sundown and feed on young children ? which is actually what I was expecting ? something more "Coraline" style. Besides, there's absolutely no reason to repeatedly ask someone to get in the oven if you're not going to eat them!!! So, since pretty much nothing is explained except for the fact that the grandparents were murdered and their 'replacement grandparents' just wanted a week with the kids, we'll have to conclude that everything mentioned earlier in the movie in regards to the fake grandparents' condition is what the true plot was meant to be.For one, I think it's a little bit mean to say that those who suffer from Dementia, Schizophrenia or Sundown Syndrome are likely to spend their evening hours running around on all fours. Next, all the previously creepy scenes like fake grandma's incessant laughing before trying to strangle herself, fake grandpa's story about the white creature with yellow eyes, or fake grandpa trying to shoot himself, are now merely the product of none other than actual mental illness. While those may not be considered 'plot holes,' they are to me. I don't know how they really thought they could get away with explaining the entire movie away with: they're crazy. Just pure laziness, really. Someone came up with a kind of interesting plot, then just got bored and stopped before the punch-line.All that to say, next time I'll think twice before blindly watching a Shyamalan film without bothering to read reviews. Actually, that's not true at all. When the next horror/thriller flick comes out with M. Night's name on it, I know I'll still do exactly the same thing: Excitedly go out of my way to watch it, despite what anyone says. Sigh? old habits die hard.But seriously, unless you also suffer from the hopes that M. Night will one day make another beyond awesome movie, and will therefore watch all of his movies while waiting for one to blow your mind?. Just ... don't even bother with "The Visit."</fullReview>

The plot is very good and as far as i know original. The way it was filmed was great, any other way wouldn't be the same. I thought the director of this movie was great before and my opinion def didn't change after seeing this one. The acting was good. It says that it's a comedy/horror, you cant really expect to get scared in it like some people complain about. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend but it's worth the watch if you have spare time and don't know what to do with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Exactly a Return to Form But Fun Anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit (2015)Back in the summer of 2008 I was ostracised by two good friends. I had arranged to meet with them for a couple of drinks before viewing The Happening, the then latest twist-in-the-tale flick from twist-in-the- tale merchant M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan had made his name with 1999's The Sixth Sense a film with a twist that became a major talking point (even if it was effectively pulling the same end 'shock' as Jacob's Ladder and the original Carnival of Souls before it) and both critics and audiences alike felt subsequently cheated when he repeated the same stunt of plonking a twist in each tale he then committed to the big screen.What I felt was missed by mainstream critics is that Shyamalan may have incorporated the same gimmick of w twist each time however he was also bold enough to come up with an original story that was indeed unique that in itself is a rare beast in commercial cinema. I'm not saying his ideas necessarily worked but fair game to him for attempting to pull off something different. 2008's The Happening being one such example.I was unable to meet my friends for The Happening as my bus back from Exeter, some hundred miles from home, was caught up in bad traffic. My friends saw the film and both shunned me soon after telling me I didn't show up on purpose. It was some months later that I watched the same film with my then partner and I could see why.There was an interesting idea at work in The Happening but the execution of it was shoddy. The Happening also played as if the studio had recut the film to a shape where it played shorter but made less sense than it should have. Subsequently Shyamalan's name on a film became a dirty word. But that could be about to change. The Visit is about the writer/director wrestling back artistic control after seeing many of his prior movies taken away from him and final cut denied, such as with the aforementioned The Happening.Teenage brother and sister Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are packed off by their mother Paula (Kathryn Hahn) to spend a week with their grandparents as she pops off on a cruise with her new boyfriend. This will be a baptism of fire for both the youngsters and the wrinklies as the kids have never been in the company of their grandparents. Rebecca uses the occasion to make a documentary given her aspirations to as a budding film-maker.The reason for the teenagers having never met their grandparents is because their mother eloped with her high-school teacher leading to a 'disagreement' - full details of which are unknown. Naturally, given this is a horror film of sorts, their grandparents' abode is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't you just know it their elders prove to be rather bonkers. Things start strangely and become increasingly bizarre for the teenage siblings.The Visit sees the man formerly only revered for The Sixth Sense back to some sort of decent form. It's by no means perfect and doesn't work well under close scrutiny but it is entertaining and it IS scary. Mark Kermode slated The Visit but then he's traded being a proper critic for easy headlines whilst nursing his Zec Efron man crush and making an unneeded appearance in the recent Absolutely Fabulous episodes - hardly leaves him in a position to throw stones at others. After all he's as much a one-trick pony as Shyamalan still dining out on his reputation born out of waffling on about The Exorcist.In the same year that his The Sixth Sense broke records there was another horror flick that became a substantial hit. This other film's success gave birth to the found-footage sub genre. It was called The Blair Witch Project. Jump forward fifteen years and here is Shyamalan aping a format rather than creating his own but unlike many that came in the wake of Blair Witch Shyamalan's movie actually works. Shyamalan's voice is still evident in the writing, especially in that of the documentary-making daughter, and it irks a little. It is far more restrained than when he wrote himself a character in his Lady in the Water, a character that happens to write something that will change our world for the better - talk about delusions of grandeur.The feel-good ending may jars tonally and feels tacked on. No one would be so smiley and casual about recounting such horrors even a few months on from the event. You'd be scarred for life. To detail my other niggles about The Visit would mean giving away spoilers so instead I'll summarise. There are laughs, there are scares, it's well acted but hugely flawed and it's a far better film than the director's previous form would have indicated and bodes well for his next outing despite what Mr Kermode says.Check out more of my reviews at www.mybloodyreviews.com</fullReview>

Two children visit their deranged grandparents and film the entire thing. Turns out the grandparents are murderers yet the idiot children still make a movie about them and film themselves even after getting a diaper full of sh*t mushed in their faces.What makes it even worse is after having a diaper full of sh*t thrown in one of the main characters faces he raps about how it tasted while dressed like a rap artist as his sister looks on laughing. Yes you read that correctly, a boy eats an elderly mans fecal matter and raps about it.Unrealistic. Even upon finding out that these elderly people are not their grandparents, they stay and play Yahtzee with them, they also have endless opportunities to escape and instead go back to film these people</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Self-Awareness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The past years after Signs or The Village or something haven't been kind to director M. Night Shyamalan. He keeps ending up making horror films with the same formula, silly twists and other nonsense. Now, it seems like Shyamalan has seen what most audience think of him and thus here's The Visit. Which seems to be a found-footage film gone wrong (I mean seriously, the illusion of this technique is almost nonexistent,) the movie centers two kids meeting their estranged grandparents which seems to have a dark secret from their odd behavior. And in case the trailers of this movie have fooled you to expect a total horror film, The Visit is actually Shyamalan's way of making the audience laugh with him and not at him, by poking fun of his own tropes, however manages to bring some inspired horror elements. But the punchline is the main spotlight here, which makes it a rather fun film.This might be an example if the director made another bad horror movie and did it at the worst ways possible. Firstly the technique, it's not very convincing. The camera is too steady, it shoots pretty angles, even when the characters aren't aware of it, it has transition effects of random exteriors that no one has any idea who filmed them, and the camera is way too high definition for an amateur footage. Though maybe it made sense to the fact that the protagonist is an aspiring filmmaker. Anyway, also like most found-footage movies, it keeps breaking the rule of casting familiar faces, when this technique is supposed to represent totally realistic that even the cast should be played by lesser known actors. But even good found footage movies don't seem to care about the rules anymore, either, which now makes it totally pointless. Now the story itself takes place in the same absurd universe of any bad Shyamalan movie. For the antagonist, the secret behind their behavior is extreme nonsense, but in a delightful way. It shows a silly paranoia about old people's dementia. It is kind of stupid, though the twist, while simple, does seem worth the surprise and it gets really darker afterwards.There are still moments that tries to be scary, some may work while others are basically for the sake of shock value, that specifically happens at the climax where things really go crazy. It may be ridiculous, but their threat is still quite effective. Then again, what really triumphs is what a kind of a joke it is trying to be. There are also humor that doesn't involve the scary old people, like how pretentious Becca sometimes is as a filmmaker and the fact that the little brother is basically meant to be a comic relief. There's also a running joke about random people they come across while recording suddenly make monologues out of nowhere. It's priceless enough to fill in to an already ludicrous environment. Back to its craft, despite of my complains about how anti-found-footage this found-footage, the movie still looks nice. It shoots the terror well, even when it pushes the aesthetics a little too far.The acting is quite solid for a modern Shyamalan movie. Olivia DeJonge carries the film well as the aspiring documentary filmmaker and she has some genuinely strong moments, thought it's the young Ed Oxenbould who steals the show; again, he is supposed to be the comic relief who replace swear words with pop singer names (well, not always) and make rap music, but he doesn't go too broad and manages to be as relatable as the protagonist. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie seem to be having the time of their lives as the crazy grandparents.The Visit won't work for you if you're seeking for a straight up horror film. Sure, there are moments that works as a horror film, but it's not without acknowledging what a funny movie this also is. So the real question is, is this really the comeback of the Shyamalan we used like? Not much. It's too stupid to be akin to The Sixth Sense, but also too self-aware to be akin to (insert Shyamalan movie after Unbreakable.) It's basically it's own personality, to be honest. It's weird and somewhat creepy, but as the story goes, it keeps getting delightful. That's the main pleasure you may find in The Visit, embracing the strangeness and its amount of ridicule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Knight has redeemed himself! Movie is a trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love horror and some flat out just suck but I have been wanting to see this one.Tyler and Becca are sent to see their grandparents, whom they have never met since Papa and Nana had a falling out with their mother years ago. Some bad blood between them and Mom wants to go on a vacation with her boyfriend so she sends the kids to meet their grandparents for the first time. They live on a rural farm in the middle of nowhere with no cell service and little internet access.At first they seem like a normal old couple but soon after it becomes obvious something is off esp with Nana. They maintain in constant communication with their mother. It is obvious Nana does not like to talk about their mother so the kids are still trying to figure out what the estrangement is all about. Things then get weird! A good solid flick. Great job M. Knight for keeping me entertained and scaring me a little</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intentional yet Imperfect Horror/Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Scream was an ode and a self aware spoof to slasher films, The Visit is spoof/ode to found footage films. M. Night said that he filmed the film in two versions (comedy and horror) and then he combined them to make a horror comedy that comes out to be a fresh air of bizarre yet entertaining filmmaking that I have honestly not seen in a horror film in a very long time. This time its on purpose unlike The Happening, which was not a comedy by the way, it was ode to drive in horror Z-Movies like The Blob. Back to The Visit though, the two main characters represent the mindset of someone who would want to make a found footage film. They also represent the two sides of M. Night himself. Their is the "celebrity" who jokes around tries to constantly get attention and thinks of himself as "THE NEXT BIG THING" and is also trying to uncover secrets about his subjects while throwing his moral compass out the window. This represent the "reality show / cash grab" side of found footage. And then theirs the pretentious artist who thinks way too highly of herself and refuses to do things that go against the honor of filmmaking. It all comes together as bizarrely entertaining mix of pure art and shock value. There are genuine moments of drama and horror towards the last act that are so intensely scary that I was shocked that I could still become this scared in a horror film again. True horror comes from the situation of the event, not just jump scares. Which brings in my gripes. This film is anything but perfect. Even though there are moments of true horror, the shock value side undermines the drama a lot. Their are way too many jump-scares, a lot of bad horror movie clichés, and inappropriate humor in places where there doesn't need to be humor. I liked the characters a lot, but there were moments in the film where kids antics (especially the rapping) became very out of place especially within the context of what was going or what just happened in the film. Other than that, this movie is a descent baby-step forward from M. Night. This is definitely better than The Last Airbender, The Happening, and After Earth. Lets be honest though... You can only go up after those movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT Nearly As Bad As Most Reviews, and NOT A 'Found Footage" Film. Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost didn't see this film because of all the hate for it on this site. I was going to skip it - considering it wasting my time, but my wife insisted. Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised and glad we watched it.It's not really a very typical horror film. It's not even a typical M. Night film. It is scary at times, but mostly creepy. It leaves you glued, wondering what's going to happen next. Which is what a film is supposed to do.It's low-budget. There isn't anybody in it you would recognize. Which, to me, made it seem more "real." It's not perfect. It does have some clichés, some jump out and "BOO!" kind of scares, which turn some people off. It is NOT a 'found footage' film. Reviewers who labeled it that don't know the definition. The young girl is trying to shoot a documentary and SOMETIMES you look through the camera lens as she's filming. But it's NOT the whole movie and nobody finds the footage. The camera is sometimes shaky, but they are kids, not pros, and it doesn't do that very long. It does have very few plot issues that you kind of have to "go with." What horror film doesn't?But - I've certainly seen worse thriller/horror type movies. I've even seen worse M. Night movies. This is the best from him in years. The acting was decent and the characters seemed real and flawed. The story was intriguing and it kept you guessing. Just when it seemed like it might be getting long, it was over. Not my favorite movie, but certainly not as bad as people are panning it. It's worth your time if you like this sort of movie.I'll make you a deal -- If you don't like horror thrillers, don't watch them or review them and I'll do the same for romantic comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So after M. Night Shyamalan movies started to go downhill. This is suppose to be his comeback movie. Now this isn't a groundbreaking return or anything like that. But for a found footage style movie that has been getting old these days. This is one of the actually enthralling and entertaining ones. There is quite a bit of freaky and creepy moments in this movie. Mainly because you as an audiences isn't quite sure what is going on and why the creepy people in this movie act the way they do. Now kids in horror movies are usually super annoying and difficult to watch because of how irritating it is. But the kids in this movie acted like kids without them being annoying. The interactions with one another I thought was realistic enough. And the kid that wants to be a future rappers, I thought he was pretty cool...And funny. A lot of M. Night Shyamalan movies or maybe all of them. Has a message about family and this one was more of a endearing movie than I thought it would be. This is well worth the rental. I just hope it doesn't go downhill again from here.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night is making a comeback.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie knowing nothing about the film so when I saw, "an M. Night Shyamalan film," I let out a frustrating sigh having been disappointed by him for years. This movie was different though. There are no viral outbreaks, no creatures chasing Will Smith, and no air benders. It's simply two kids visiting their grandparents while their single mother goes on vacation. I've noticed that M. Night does his best work when he puts the focus on ONE main story and lets the other dynamics and plots unfold around that story. In Signs, he focused on Mel Gibson's crumbling family life with an alien invasion as a backdrop. In this film, he puts the focus on the two children's relationship and lets the rest of the film follow suit. Anywho, enough about that.This movie has the essential elements of a creepy movie. House in the middle of the woods, crazy lunatics for grandparents, and a couple of tech savvy teenagers.The film is shot in found footage style which has definitely been done to death, but is not "in your face" in this movie. M. Night cleverly writes the teenage girl in the movie as a film buff who focuses on cinematography and "setting the mood," which allows him to use depth of field, good lighting, and good framing unlike other FF style movies like Paranormal Activity, etc which are more jumpy and gopro-ish. The visuals and camera work are refreshingly crisp and smooth, given the method of filmingFrom day one, you can tell that something isn't right with the grandparents and the kids decide to set up cameras and capture the action. Long story short, things get crazy. The most surprising thing about this film is how naturally comedy, suspense, and overt horror are blended together. Nothing really felt forced or unnatural in acting, pace, or action. At some points the horror felt a little campy, but that can't really be avoided with so much humor in the movie and most of the people I saw the movie with were cool with that. Looking back on it, the twists were somewhat predictable but at the time I was so engrossed with the movie I didn't even notice the plot twist creep up.Great movie and I really hope M. Night can continue with this excellence! see this movie if you can!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how many times we (Jay and Nick) have watched the "found footage" movies and just constantly roll our eyes! "Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity" etc, you get it! Somehow The Autistic Reviewers were able to look beyond that and see something quite unique and original.The acting was fantastic, both by the kids and the Grandparents. Ed Oxenbould (who's an Australian actor) puts on the best performance. He's both funny, dramatic, charming and a great (hilarious) rapper! The plot is pretty simple. Nothing too fancy! The kids, for the first time ever decide they want to meet their Grandparents and want to film every second they get! Sadly...it doesn't take long for things to get weird. After 9:30 Grandma runs around, vomits, scratches the walls naked and sometimes like to pick up knives! While Grandpa likes to hide things in the barn and put guns in his mouth! Normal behaviour, right? As the final 20 mins sinks in, the twists and turns start coming and it's quite surprising to say the least, but at the same time, has you on the edge of your seat! There was un necessary comedy thrown in there, which didn't seem to fit, but what the film was good at was keeping every scene both funny and serious and spooky at the same time.All in all The Autistic Reviewers give this movie a 7/10. It's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wish I was kidding. I'm not; this movie was garbage. The acting we got out of the two children was just not up to par for the big screen- possibly an infomercial, but that's being generous. Everything from the awkward acting, poorly written dialogue, to god awful screen writing- I'm a bit disappointed that it currently has 6.5 stars. I've come to know IMDb as a pretty decent judge of movie quality, even sometimes a bit reluctant to give many horror films a high rating... But this is absolutely nuts. I'm convinced that M. Night has hired people to boost positive reviews, because once you leave the theater (assuming you choose to stay to the end), you will be thoroughly disappointed. Don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan back in form? Hardly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning Spoilers!The concept is simple. A teenage girl with a love of filmmaking and her white-rapper younger brother go to spend a week with their beloved grandparents. Within the span of about ten-minutes the kids and the viewer start to grasp on to the idea that grandma and grandpa aren't playing with a full deck, and whenever one grandparent is discovered to be doing something really 'weird,' the other explains it as a condition of the mind; always adding something to the effect of "oh, you're disappointed in us" or "you're not having a very good time." Those are sentiments that could easily describe my reaction to this movie, as once again I am disappointed in M. Night taking a fairly cool concept and wrecking it with an idiotic script, and no, I did not have a good time watching this at all.First question is why did Mr. Shayamalan make this a camcorder movie in the first place? He's just setting himself up for a movie awash in unbelievability, and I know I am not the only one who is sick to death of camcorder movies anyway. Putting that aside, he casts truly mediocre actors for the pivotal role of the grandparents and just OK actors for the kids. Third, why is the 13-year old boy portrayed as an obnoxious, mouthy white kid who thinks he can rap? I disliked that kid from the very first time he opened his mouth to rap, which basically had me caring less what happens to him in the film ... and a lot does happen to him and his sister, as the film goes for the gusto in the final segment. The problem is, the 'gusto' is a twist in the story that anyone could see coming, and even if I had not seen it coming, I could have cared less. The movie was over for me long before the trade-mark Shyamalan story shift.OK, so there's the concept and some concerns. But beyond all that, this is without question Shyamalan's worst film ever, and I am even placing it above "The Happening" in pure stupidity. It is not scary and the humor which is primarily the kids, especially the boy, saying profane things when they're scared, is just not effective. But the humor is not the only element that is not effective, neither are most of the horror elements in the story, which Shyamalan liberally steals from almost every Asian horror film ever created.Bottom line: M. Night Shyamalan takes another wonderful premise and destroys every chance of that premise becoming something special in the annals of horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure if M. Night is waving at us or giving us the finger ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, per IMDb, this movie has made its financial return five times over. I'm hoping it's just M. Night's way of saying that he can still pull because for the guy that gave us The Sixth Sense, The Visit is nothing spectacular. I admit that I didn't get the twist until its reveal -and- he got me good as I was looking for something much deeper. Still, it was underwhelming... in a 'The Village' sort of way. The best (okay, second best) is yet to come and I believe it will come within these indie excursions. This review comes from someone who gives Lady In The Water a thumbs-up so I am on the generous side. As long as I don't get another 'Devil' with its totally misleading adverts or 'The Happening' which has me still wondering what happened, M. Night is cool with me. I may be missing one or two stinkers here but he's entitled to a few.</fullReview>

Do not waste your time on this one, it's not even a comedy. Apparently, the guy who was sitting next to me was getting a bit scared at times, but still can't figure out why.

		<shortDescription>Don't wast your money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to go see "The Visit" last night. I figured we could give M. Night Shymalan one more try. He failed. He failed hard. It's billed as a horror/comedy, but it failed miserably at both the horror part and the comedy part.The main characters are two kids who are completely unrelatable in any way, and are so annoying I wanted them to die before the "scary" parts even started.The comedy is pretty much "haha old people are weird and kids like computers, fart joke lolz".The dialogue was... It actually made me angry. Like, legit furious at points. Shymalan earned millions writing something that sounds like it was written by a Sonic Fanfic writer. Like, he seems to think that the only way to make the female lead kid seem smart is to have her use the most obnoxiously pretentious words possible, and the boy... Ugh. He's an OCD white kids who wants to be black. He raps. Repeatedly. Constantly. Horribly.The "villains" were the only redeemable part of the movie, and they got far too little screen time, and didn't do much in general. The crux of the movie was "Old people are scary because they're weird."The twist at the end, in Shymalan form, was okay, but not amazing. It's kinda telegraphed....so, yeah. Don't waste your money. Don't give Shymalan any indication that he's welcome in the movie business anymore. I've given him so many chances, and he's failed every time. He's not even a one trick pony anymore. He's a no trick pony, with three broken legs and needs to be put down. Or, alternatively, forced to take writing classes until he understands that thesauruses are a good tool, but should not be the only thing you use when writing dialogue, and that A TWIST IS NOT THE ONLY THING A MOVIE NEEDS.It's truly rare that I walk out of a movie angry that I spent money on it, but this was one of those times. The only reason I didn't walk out halfway through is that I'd spent nearly $30 on tickets for myself and my wife, and I wanted to make sure I got as much out of that money as I could.The only reason I'm giving this movie anything higher than a 1 outta 10 is because Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie's performances were great, and honestly the only thing I enjoyed about the movie, and I want to give them the credit they deserve.</fullReview>

SUCH GARBAGE!!! Is M, (forgettable last name) a soulless demon who found a body to inhabit for the purpose of foisting this hell upon the world and tormenting humans who DO have souls. THAT would make sense as to why everything he/it writes is just plain boring, pointless, meaninglessly shallow tripe with his sad 'signature' punchline at the end. Who taught this creature how to put pen to paper? An insane, soul-trading politician!?! Someone with their brain-stem detached, existing on life support!?! THAT also would at least explain the level of writing throughout this hacks career and his continual acts of cruelty towards the public every time he/it (not ruling out the demon theory) sits down to "write". GIVE UP and get a job you're more suited to, M. Blight Shamscam, like 'physically' torturing people for the war-mongers in Washington. That would be less of a travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointment! The Visit breaks down into two concepts: what worked and what did not. What did not work: Another Blair Witch documentary style horror film! Shaky camera amateurish look with over long narration just like all the fake documentary genre horror films. The Visit comes across as self-absorbed and amateurish which annoys the viewer, and gets old fast. A granddaughter wants to meet her estranged grandparents which creates a stretched out boring personal narration, which adds little to the story line. The estranged grandparents exhibit clinical behaviors of paranoid schizophrenia and dementia, which becomes hard to watch. What worked: The plot twist where the mom lets the kids know via skype "that's not my parents". The end is tension filled of how will the children escape. The protagonist finds out the grandparents were murdered, and that the grandparents volunteered at the institute was not a great idea. Strong conclusions for a painful to watch story. Shyamalan (writer/director) has great concepts, plot twists, but regrettably Shyamalan's movies become bogged down in deep details which do not translate from word to film well. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Mom and I were figuring our movie selections of the week she was excited to see that. I should point out that I, Bella Friedman, is a cat. So my Mom usually takes me to the movies.M.Night Shymalan had a new movie out. He last movie "The Last Airbender" was not a favorite of mine but before that Mom said he directed some great movies like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village." When we saw "The Visit" was set in a small town,like The Village, we were excited. Unfortunately it wasn't as good.The story was about two kids who were visiting their grandparents for the first time while their Mom went on vacation with her boyfriend. The Mom hadn't spoken to the Grandparents in years. I couldn't imagine my Mom pawning me off of my Grandfather when she went on vacation. The truth is most of our family is allergic to cats so that wouldn't work.While the kids stayed with the grandparents things started getting weirder. The story moved slowly with the grandparents doing a lot of strange things. The cast was fair. The people who played the Grandparents were totally creepy, especially the Nana, played by Deanna Dunagan . She was a piece of work. I liked the Olivia DeJonge who played "Becca". Ed Oxenbould who played "Tyler" gave me a headache. He was obnoxious , especially with his attempts to be a "Rapper".The one thing I will say about this movie is that I am glad there was not a cat in it. One of my brothers and sisters would have ended up in the basement somewhere. Overall it was creepy and I really didn't like it that much. I think M.Night Shymalan should watch some of this older movies and get back on track</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M Night continues to slide downhill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't liked any M Night Shyamalan film since Unbreakable, and the quality of his output seems to have been on a downward spiral ever since then. Reliance on twist endings that got more lame with each outing soon got tired, then he dispensed with the twists and concentrated just on making films that were really terrible. So it was that I only ended up watching this film by accident. It was my daughter's choice of film and I'd agreed to see this and was in the car on the way to the cinema before I found out it was an M Night production, and in my seat before I realised it was a Found Footage film. These were the only genuine feelings of shock and dread that came out of the experience.This film is just very poor. It combines many things that have had their day and have become tiresome - M Night twisty plot lines, people who don't put the camera down even when they're in danger, manufactured attempts at scares by going quiet and then turning the sound up - and doesn't do any of them well.The plot is predictable and preposterous, and relies on what Roger Ebert used to call the Idiot Plot, a story that can only take place if no one has or uses common sense. The shocks are pretty feeble and there's no real sense of believable danger. M Night also seems to believe in a world where it's not just scary horror film old people who are scary, but in fact all old people. We're expected to believe that reasonably intelligent people (who know about films) would think that old people behaving exactly like scary characters in horror films are just regular creepy old people.Apparently M Night financed the film himself in order to have total creative control so he has no one but himself to blame how badly this film has turned out. The inexplicable good press this is getting and the reasonable box office performance means he will probably be encouraged to make more films, which is actually quite depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not see this in theaters! Or even at home when it goes to DVD... Don't even pirate it, it's not worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So let me just start by saying that I had low expectations to begin with seeing as how this director has failed me in the past MANY times prior, that being said the trailer also wasn't very promising, however my significant other thought it would be at least worth a shot as it was at least a bit of a interesting idea. So this movie is supposed to be a video documentary recorded by the two main characters, similar to "Blair Witch Project". The basics of the plot is that the two main characters are sent to their grandparents home for a week to get to know them as the mother had separated herself from them and never really allowed the kids to meet them, nor made the effort to bring the grandparents or children together, and throughout the film the main characters will at times hear things over night or even find the grandparents up to some rather strange things. The problem with this film is really the fear factor feels as though it is missing, most of the movie is shot in plain day and things are "Relatively" normal, whilst getting a bit of information on the characters. This is not to say that plain daylight can't be scary, quite the contrary, but even the moments when the movie is trying to really put on a show and frighten the viewer, it just seems to fall short, so much so that I found most of the theater in laughter whenever something "Scary" even happened. At times the movie can be slightly creepy, but not enough to warrant it for the overall garbage that it was. Overall just a terrible movie you could take infants to so they can laugh at it, not worth your time, even if you downloaded it illegally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 2014, when you heard Shyamalan, you either thought of movies like The Village, The Happening, The Last Airbender, or After Earth. So you could imagine me being a little skeptical about him coming back, and even with the edition of comedy. But, it was a genuine surprise to me, as this movie had me both peeing my pants in laughter and terror in all the right moments. The premise of the movie is that a mother drops her two kids off at their grandparents house, while the daughter decides to film it kind of documentary style. But, things aren't all that they seem at their house. The camera-work that Shyamalan did was absolutely great, and the performances are spot on, unlike the planks of wood that were Mark Wahlberg and Will Smith in previous movies by Shyamalan. The film that this guy put out with just one location, a handful of actors, and a really low budget, this movie is amazing, and it's good to see that Shyamalan is back and here to stay!

I had no preconceived notions about the film or the director; I went into this completely cold.Two kids, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) go spend a week at their grandparent's (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) place. Their mom (Kathryn Hahn) had a falling out with her parents at a very young age, so Becca and Tyler have never met them. This basic premise leads to various jump scares and unintentionally hilarious points of terrible dialogue, acting, and overall stupidity. At it's core, The Visit, could have been an interesting horror flick about dementia and old age. However it just ends up being a dull and uninteresting horror. From the onset we can tell something's not right with the grandparents. They act very peculiar from the first time we meet them until the very end. No subtlety to the performances and it's clear their nuts from the very beginning. There's no slow build to anything because we've already seen so much. By the end, when we're suppose to be truly scared for the kids the audience is just tired from the prior 80 minutes of film.But nothing seems to register with these kids. Tyler starts to question their behavior but not before he's already seen some truly odd things that would make any kid question the situation. A big problem with this film is how unbelievable these kids are. Becca is annoying and is written way too smart for a kid her age. Not to mention the actress, Olivia DeJonge, can't act for anything. Ed is a written as if M. Night has never even met a thirteen year old. The moments when we are forced to learn a little bit more about these kids are just uninteresting and painfully heavy handed.M. Night is trying so hard to get his message across that when it finally hits, it done right painful to watch. It's so heavy handed and over the top it hurts. I would recommend this to people as an unintentional comedy, but the humor doesn't come nearly enough to warrant somebody sit through this mindless wretch of a film. Avoid it at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M.Night's worst film yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I went to see this with a lot of anticipation, I was hoping that this was the return of M.Night after a few of his previous films fell flat on their face. But, for me, it was not meant to be. I have a few problems with this film but it is down to the writing and down to the directing. When the main kid actor uses the word "swerve", that's strike one, when he starts rapping, that's strike 2 and finally, strike 3 comes when they have 2 different cameras that are both being used with the intention of making it seem like they are making a documentary but instead the footage is the same quality from both points of view, very clean and very crisp. That is such a stupid idea from M.Night's crew, a found footage style film is supposed to be gritty and is not supposed to be perfectly filmed, it's supposed to put you in the moment, make it seem like you are there filming them, not sitting in a cinema watching it, it's not a fantastical genre, it's a genre that's main intention is to scare you. I wasn't scared, at all.I really do not understand how this film has got a score of 7/10. People seem to enjoy this film and I have no clue as to why. If this was a small name director or a cast that has ever been heard of before then I would give it a little more credit, but not much, certainly not enough to where I would actually watch it again. But, for a huge name like M.Night to come back and try to take the film game by storm with this pile of garbage, he has sadly shot himself in the foot. I feel his career should be done now, but with everyone else liking this pile of crap, it seems he will be back, just don't expect me to buy a ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea why people continue to let M. Night make movies.A PG-13 horror movie without any sort of actual horror, along with attempted jump scares without actually making you jump or be scared. Horribly unlikable characters, especially the kids. Pretentious girl throwing out big words and constantly acting like an idiot, and incredibly stupid rapping boy who attempted to bring comedy but in the end brought nothing but hatred, all while both spewed out buzzwords of today, ie: yolo, reddit, and many others.As with any M. Night piece of trash, you know there's going to be a twist. Within 15 minutes, I had already guessed it. The only true swerve is the disappointment when you find out that there is literally nothing supernatural about this movie, which everyone should have known after The Village.Don't waste your time or money. Forced bad comedy, bad attempts at being creepy, and just not good at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beware? this is one of those irritating jerky hand-held camera movies. This was 90 mind-numbing minutes of two insipid kids talking/rapping into a camera with a few intermittent scenes of crazy grandparents. You pretty much see all the watchable parts in the trailer and it takes a good 30 minutes before anything interesting happens. It definitely had the potential to be a pretty cool movie if M. Night nixed the "video camera" motif and just made it a real horror movie. The actors who played the grandparents were very believable and could have been used so much more. The last 15 minutes of the movie, at least, added a little tension, but the lackluster ending just leaves you sitting in your seat with blank look on your face. The only horror was realizing I had paid to see this. The acting all around wasn't bad; it was just a pointless movie. It was an even bigger waste of time than The Village. M. Night owes me $7.50 and an hour and a half of my life back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With unlikeable children as protagonists and cheap jump scares, The Visit serves as less of a comeback for Shyamalan and more of a reminder as to why I haven't seen any of his movies in theaters since Lady in the Water (yikes to that one too, by the way). While this movie follows Shyamalans traditional game-changing-twist-at-the-end formula with an attempt to balance in a sentimental dramatic storyline as well (in the style of The Sixth Sense and The Village), the jump scares and irritating dialogue (why does the boy decide to say pop stars names instead of swearing? Why is this girl so pretentious and irritating?) undermine it in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film for its seemingly original storyline and the subject matter.... Ugh.... Just..... Ugh..... There are many potential great moments in this film that are squandered almost in totality based on the gimmicky use of the "found footage" technique. I won't dwell on the unrealistic reactions or dialogue of the children to these creepy moments and events (think 80's horror idiots whom do not take every hint thrown their way to get out, get away while they can- without the charm or simplicity of those 80's camp films). Nearly everything is filmed with the first person camera angle where throughout most of the film it makes no sense at all. No- I would not film myself running, screaming while being chased.... No, I would not film myself creeping through a dark house at night, catching an eerie activity or two of my "grandparents", and then filming my own reaction to said activity.... Dumb. Forced. Predictable. Basically, this movie fails in just about every way in which it banks on succeeding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devil &amp; Unbreakable Standards This Is Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan movies can be very much hit-n-miss, and unfortunately The Visit is a bit of a miss, although it doesn't miss by much and at least it was better than snorefests like The Village and The Happening. If it had a wee bit more happening (no pun intended) through the 2nd Act instead of scenes just cutting off when they were getting interesting, it might have been better. This just ruined the flow for me because it was stop/start too many times, and because of this the tension ended up lacking too.I've read reviews where the viewer complained about it being shot documentary style, but I didn't actually mind that it was filmed this way. Would it have been a better film if it was shot like a more regular film? Very debatable because it was explained as to WHY the film was shot this way, so I doubt not having this aspect in the story would have made it better.Like I say, though, that didn't bother me. What got me was the slow pace and the continual stop/start moments, which is actually a bit of a trait with Shyamalan's movies (ones he's directed at least) along with relying on a shock/twist ending to make them better. The Sixth Sense, The Village, The Happening - all slow paced movies that rely on the ending to make them better than what they were. Well, the Sixth Sense was a decent enough overall, but take away the ending and it ends up being a below average film. The Visit is along the same lines. There are some good tense scenes scattered throughout (just enough to keep you watching), but just too few &amp; far between.I have to give a quick mention to the performances of the main cast too. Deanna Dunagan &amp; Peter McRobbie who played Nana &amp; Pop Pop respectively stole the show in my opinion. The way they turned from sweet-natured grandparents to, well, something else was enjoyable to watch.Overall The Visit wasn't that bad, but it's just a pity it was nowhere near the standard of Devil or Unbreakable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense with a Very Disappointing Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**ALL SPOILERS** I had very low expectations going into The Visit but somehow managed to be deeply disappointed nonetheless. Of course it was eighty minutes of suspense and ten of the twist. I thought to myself in the freaking start "Okay well there's no way the old folk are going to be escape mental patients; that would be insultingly platitudinous and in 2015, also pretty cheesy." So anyways the twist was that, yup, escape mental patients. And you know how they reveal it? One of the first things the old folk say to the protagonists is 'Hey don't go into the basement'. So immediately you know something's down there. End of the film, girl goes down and finds none other than... jumpsuits embroidered with the name of a mental hospital! What is this?? 1980??? That story and storytelling does. not. work. today. It's freaking cheesy. It can't be escaped mental patients, it just freaking can't. You can't do that anymore today. It's freaking cliché. It's been done to death and now it's a punchline. Mediocre as he is, a seasoned suspense writer like Shymalan should have known better. And you know what? I was hoping he was taking it in the aliens direction. As dumb as that would have been, it would have been more satisfying. Like "Oh so aliens took over your grandparents' bodies and they get sick and freak out like possessed dogs in a thunder storm when the sun goes down because, oh I don't know, maybe on their home there is no planetary rotation." If I saw that I'd think Oh man that's freaking stupid, but at least it's something new. Okay and what twists my biscuits almost just as much was the pretty much only scare in the movie. It was a jump scare, which is fine since it was a 'found footage/hand-held' film. But precisely like the idea of escape mental patients, it was insultingly trite and cliché. Video camera set up in living room. Old woman crosses frame left. Pause. Old woman crosses frame right. Pause. Old woman pops up (literally springs up into view) right in front of the camera and goes "Rawr!" The literal exact thing you'd see in a you-tube scare video. Okay not only was that jump scare freaking stupid and predictable, but it was again, so cheesy, I questioned what year I was in. There wasn't one single moment in the entire film I ever felt remotely impressed with anything. At least in The Village, like, I liked the design of the 'monsters', liked the color pallet and even the twist was interesting enough. The grandparents' behavior is so totally bizarre and suspicious, I felt like Shymalan could have taken it in a variety of directions; even until the end, it didn't feel like everything could have ONLY been written off as violent mental instability. The old man's incontinence and that part the old woman crawls like a mole-man under the house- I felt both those could have alluded to them being not human. When the old woman told that story about the aliens in the like I thought/hoped it would turn out to be a body-snatchers thing. But no, he went with mental patients with whom we didn't even get to know the story of their escape, their relationship to one another, what they were doing, why they were doing it, who made the plans to invite the kids over (the real oldies or the impostors), why the kids were even there, what the impostors were even planning to do with the kids and why the community didn't recognize that the two beloved active counselors suddenly looked and acted totally different overnight. All of these unanswered questions could easily be written off by saying 'they were crazy people.' Which is a cop-out. They freaking advertised for The Visit like it was a demon, creature, ghost, alien thing. Curse you advertising! You got me again, you strategic hairpieces!! **SPOILER-FREE CONCLUSION** All in all it's a decent movie to put on while you're cooking or doing something. It's a decent movie if you're blazed and have already melded with the couch and lost the remote. It's not a decent movie if you're looking to be impressed or scared. Shymalan knows suspense well enough to keep you just barely interested enough to commit to seeing the end but provides no satisfying reward for the watch. The merit in seeing this film is not the story, characters or ending, the merit is, with all of Shymalan's films, the ride on the roller coaster of suspense. However The Visit would be the boardwalk coaster that doesn't have any loop-De-loops and only one big hill. I rate it a 4/10 because the cinematography was decent enough to the genre, the story pacing accurate, the budget wasn't cringe-worthy and the acting was tolerable. Everything else was bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Concept, Mixed Results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the movies that go down the middle that can be the hardest to talk about. When a movie is awesome or just terrible, a lot of stuff springs to mind really quickly. When a movie is kinda mediocre, you struggle to separate the positives from the negatives and it all kinda blends together in a pile. Luckily, even though I gave this movie a 6, there is stuff to talk about and even though this movie didn't completely work for me, it's still a step up for M. Night. But considering his recent output, take that with a grain of salt.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Paula (Kathryn Hahn) is a single mom who has 2 kids, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould). Rebecca is a teenage aspiring filmmaker and Tyler is a wannabe rapper who Rebecca describes as "ethnically confused." Paula works hard and gets very little for herself so the kids want her to spend some time with her new boyfriend Miguel. So she goes on a cruise with Miguel, while her estranged parents John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan) are going to look after the Rebecca and Tyler for the week. There is some tension with this decision as Paula has had little to no contact with her parents since her teenage years after she moved out with her boyfriend when she was pregnant. But the kids genuinely want their mom to have some time for herself so they board a train and head off to their grandparents.I don't want to go into the plot more to avoid spoiling things, so I think the strength of this movie is that the story/concept is interesting. When you're a kid, being handed over to strangers for an extended period of time is pretty scary, you ease into it of course but initially it can be pretty frightening. This movie plays into those fears well, I can tell you if I had been left with these people, I would not have been so calm and willing to roll with the punches as these kids were. I found it to be intriguing that they found a fairly unique way to tap into a natural fear instead of manufacturing a ghost or a demon from another realm.Another positive is that the acting is largely good. Peter and Deanna are pretty creepy respectively, they really put a lot into their performances, they display some physicality even. Now Olivia and Ed are also solid, their characters themselves are annoying, Ed's rapping is pretty bad and Rebecca doesn't talk like a teenager (her dialogue is obviously written by someone who's older and didn't know how to bring it down to a teenage level) but their performances are good. Kathryn Hahn is also sound in the small amount of screen time she gets. She's an underrated actress and she continues to deliver in the small parts she gets.I'll get into the stuff that didn't work for me. The found footage movie has been done many times over and while I didn't find this one to be especially bad, it certainly didn't add anything new. It didn't have to be found footage and while it being that way was part of the plot, it just felt like a way to keep the movie's budget down as opposed to being an important stylistic choice.As much as I thought the central premise was cool, a lot of the plot relies on coincidence and contrivance. Somehow whenever someone comes to the house, the grandparents are never there. Whenever the grandparents do something crazy, the excuse is they're old (rarely is there a further explanation and when there is, its dropped and barely addressed at all later). Their mom can't see them during their Skype conversations because there's batter on the camera. Paula gives the kids so few details about their grandparents' temperament or their appearance. I understand every movie has that to some degree but it stood out to me here.The film itself wasn't very scary but I did get some laughs (intentional laughs) and toward the end the tension did ramp up. This is another divisive movie, looking at other reviews you either really enjoy it or you hate it with a passion. It's closer to a 6.5/10 for me but since it is technically a horror movie and I wasn't very scared I'll go with a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought there was real promise to this movie, but it went flying out the window when the boy started rapping. He was too "hip", and his sister was too concerned about, well, everything. If there was supposed to be an idea like the grandparents want to cook and eat the kids, I could see where it was going. I thought it was a retelling of Hansel and Gretel. I thought the grandmother's sudden popping up and "discovering" the camera was supposed to show something supernatural, but there was no logical reason for her actions. It had a good premise, yet it went flying out the window with the kid's "acting". The movie lost me after it became obvious that the kids finally knew what was going on.

Should have gone with my gut in hindsight, but I didn't and that is 90 minutes of my life I will never get back.Without adding spoilers, there are certain aspects in the plot that make you ask, "why?" and "really?". I have seen another review that said, "What is wrong with people? This film is currently rated 7.0?". Thankfully that score has since dropped to 6.2 - once it drops to 5 or under I think it would be a fair representation.Will I be in a hurry to watch another M. Night Shyamalan movie? Unlikely. Will I trip over myself to suffer another terrible 'found footage" style of movie? Even more unlikely. In fact, I don't think a good one exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it a 2 because there were times when the movie did actually creep/gross me out. Other than that where do I begin... Firstly I am not sure if I can release any spoilers because you know what happened, and how it is going to end, within the first ten minutes of the movie. The children are blindly caught in a situation, caused by their own loving mother, where they go on a visit with people that the mother hates enough to not even speak to for 10 or 15 years, maybe longer. The mother is totally OK with sending her underage children off, cross country, without ever speaking to the care givers, because she cant stand them, never checks up on her children's safety, never makes sure they even arrive in the right place, and then defends the people, that she cant stand, when the children speak up about it. To top it off she then wonders how this could have ever happened to her like it is some big surprise and we are supposed to feel bad for her. Meanwhile the kids are obnoxious, and relentlessly annoying the entire movie, they try to come across as highly intelligent but then do things that make you want to run head first into a brick wall, multiple times, so that maybe you can slap them in the head during one of your comatose dreams. I was actually rooting for the bad guys during this film, they deserve a pat on the back, no sane person would ever last as long as they did. There were times where I was slightly creeped out, like I said, but it was few and far between. What they couldn't accomplish with the creep out they tried to make up for with toilet humor which is always a winning combination. Then they tried to save the big surprise ending to the last minute, even though you saw it coming a mile away. It was actually insulting, but that is the long and the short of it. I could say more but it wouldn't be anything good, just don't waste your money like I did.</fullReview>

Also, this director is not good at writing women characters. I know many people say that, and it is a cliché but hear me out. The teen girl and old woman in this movie were horrid. The girl was constantly insulting her brother's intelligence, when he was clearly much smarter than her- not that that is much of a feat. She also had no feeling of self-preservation at all and no sense of responsibility for her younger brother. She was a terrible older sister. The old woman, who is the villain, is not scary at all but annoying and contemptible. Her character was a stale retread of the "scary old lady" archetype. A teen girl could easily defeat her in a physical fight, as well. It was just silly nonsense to think she was a threat. Her husband yes was more threatening but he never engaged me as an audience member. The only character who mattered was the boy, who was a good character waiting for a decent movie, but the movie did nothing with that. It was a big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Worst Films That I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night. It is the latest film from N. Night Shyamalan, who was previously responsible for the excellent The Sixth Sense and also Signs, which was another great film. The plot of The Visit concerns a young brother and sister, Becca and Tyler. Their mother decides to go on a cruise with her new boyfriend, so she sends the kids to stay with their grandparents, who they have never met and whom she has not seen for years. Soon after that, though, they notice strange things happening...I thought that this film was very strange and extremely boring. Literally, nothing happens at all during the entire film, there is virtually no horror or tension and I found myself looking at the clock every few minutes, wishing for the film to end. The young female lead uses strange words and language that I just didn't understand, so I found it hard to follow the film and the young boy who played her brother kept doing stupid rap songs, which soon became very irritating. The acting was okay, especially from the grandparents, which is the only reason why I am giving this two stars. It is still an awful film, though, so how the hell this receives a rating of 6.2 on IMDb is totally beyond my comprehension. The Visit is proof that the once great Shyamalan has lost his way and should consider another profession, because he no longer seems capable of making a decent film. Mr Shyamalan, if you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself. I have seen better DTV films than this and how the hell it ever got a cinema release, I will never know. A total abomination on every level and the critics who praise this must have seen a totally different film. I give it two stars, but even that seems too generous. Feel free to disregard this review if you choose, but don't say that I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar Thriller from M. Night Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The films of M. Night Shyamalan are characterized by gimmicks. In his finest effort in "The Sixth Sense" (1999), the conceit of the film was that of a man in limbo between the world of the dead and the living that ultimately comes as a surprise to the audience. But the film was compelling because of the relationship of the psychiatrist and the young boy.By contrast, "The Visit" unfolds a set of characters, relationships, and action that fails to grip the audience because we don't really care about the two children who visit their strange "grandparents." One of the major problems was the film's style which relied on hand-held cameras used to create the children filming their visit. The best scenes are those in which the kids' camera is shut off and the audience is not thinking about a filming process.The entire cast of relatively unknown actors performed admirably with the pedestrian material. The most intriguing characters are the two grandparents, who are evidently normal during the day, but beset with demons after sundown. The children try in vain to figure out the problems with their grandparents through the endless video shoots and interviews.When the gimmick of the film is finally revealed, the film picks up steam. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: And yet, the ending is disappointing because we never learn the full story of the grandparents and their two impersonators. The film was muddied in its style with a hint of Hitchcock (what mystery lies in the basement?) combined with over-the-top comedy (the boy's attempts at performing rap) to disgusting horror (the grandfather's incontinence).Overall, the film's unpleasant subject matter and lack of sensitivity result in one of the lesser effort of a talented writer-director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable Abomination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I would like to know is what kind of unbelievably strong Hallucinogens and Dissociative Drugs were taken to give this so-called movie a positive review. This is another in a long line of documentary style films that makes the viewer wish for the apocalypse to end their suffering. When I go to a movie I want to watch a movie and not a terribly produced attempt at a home movie. My families home movies from 50 years ago are more watchable than this cart load of horse hockey. Perhaps the only way to remove the horrible memory of this abomination is with a full frontal lobotomy. I would warn the future viewer to flee at the mere mention of this complete and utter failure. Show some compassion to your families,load them up in the camper, drive to the most desolate spot on earth, and destroy all forms of communication so they will never be subjected to "The Visit"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth visiting .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews built this movie up to be something really scary .Well for me anyways the end result was a complete failure.Some of it was creepy and two tiny parts of the film caught me off guard but that's not really saying much .The grandparents were the most interesting especially the actress that played the grandmother she really committed to the role it was obvious.However the grandfather was okay but ultimately missed the target in the scare factor .The kids were so so I didn't mind the daughter but she also came across as pretentious , melodramatic and bland for the most part .The brother though ? Oh my f-ing god what an obnoxious little brat he was ...throughout the entire movie .I admit I chuckled at one or two things he said but he has got to be one of the most obnoxious characters to grace the screen in years .It's either him making some lame remark to his pathetically irritating raps to his misogynistic attitude towards and about women to finally essentially calling his sister ugly .The twist was interesting but I'm sure it's been used before in better movies then this one.The end was anti climatic rushed and made absolutely no sense whatsoever .The mom was also just ...there really she didn't really add anything to the film except one I will admit part where a true mothers reaction comes to play.The best parts are in the previews and even that they wound up screwing up in some ways or another .So the point of this review is to simply say rent before you buy I was gonna buy this and I'm very grateful I wound up renting it instead.It is definitely not worth the money one visit was more then enough for me .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because something is made by someone who did something great sometime ago, doesn't mean it's great by default. The previews made this movie look like it might be entertaining. It wasn't. Don't try and describe it as artsy or visionary. It was just stupid. It wasn't worth the dollar I spent at Red Box. If after reading this you still choose to watch it, then please at least slap yourself when done, with the thought in your head, that guy was right.I'm not a Shyamalan hater. I just don't think that making a stupid movie so annoying it borders on torture means that you're a genius. It just means your a dipstick that realizes you can swindle other idiots into thinking you're special, and with good promotion and advertising you sucker people like me out of our hard earned money and even more valuable time. Shame on anyone who had anything to do with making this movie. I hope you get herpes.</fullReview>

OK they came from a mental hospital, how did they get out? who contacted them about the kids coming to stay? why did they murder them? why did she only become mad after 09:30? why weren't the police already looking for them? why did no-one recognise them? why did it take 70 minutes of tedious drivel to show what we already knew was happening? It is obvious that a few reviews are from paid personnel but how anyone could enjoy this is beyond my comprehension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit is a 2015 found footage horror/comedy film written,produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.The film stars Olivia DeJonge,Ed Oxenbould,Deanna Dunagan,Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. This movies is about two little kids named Becca and Tyler that head deep into Pennsylvania farm country to meet their maternal grandparents for the first time.They do this so that they can give her mother some time alone with her new boyfriend Miguel so that she can be happy.Everything seems to go well up until the two kids notice their grandparents increasingly strange behaviors day by day and they get more and more concerned as to why these things are happening and what is the meaning behind it all. The Visit is a return to form for writer/director M. Night Shyamalan as he has done some not-so-good movies recently.In this one though,he decides to do something different and with a small budget he tackles on found footage movies. This movie is funny,surprisingly,and interesting to a point.The acting is really good in it especially by the two kid actors,Ed Oxenbould who brings the comedy in the movie and makes the experience better,Olivia DeJonge who is the one filming this all and the movie does give a good enough reason as to why she is doing so.Olivia did bring some of the more heartfelt scenes to life and she did it perfectly. One of the main problems with this movie is that it mixes comedy and horror way to much that at a point you can't even tell if they're joking or being serious anymore cause it sort of plays out as cheesy.The two older actors do a great job but their characters aren't at always at their best.Sometimes they just came out as annoying and/or dumb. The ending is pretty good and brutal and it does have a little nice twist to it.Ultimately though it does feel like its dragging on for a bit too long but anyways this is a good and a welcome return to form for Shyamalan and I hope he does more movies like this and less big budget ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impossible to review this film without talking about M. Night's film history. Everyone by now knows the story. He made one absolutely amazing film, two great follow ups and a bunch of missteps after that. Depending on how you view this film, it's either a return to form or another piece of crap from a once bright talent. It has all the makings of a good movie and a lot of people seem to enjoy the film. It has a compelling story, tension, creepy characters, a straight forward plot and all the things people loved about M Night films. On the other hand, it has plenty of all the things people hate about later M. Night films. Basically, this movie is a full length feature of the scene in the Happening, where the three main characters meet the old lady. Take Mark Wahlberg's and Zoey Deschanel's characters and turn them into children. Take the crazy old lady and give her a crazy husband and make a film out of that situation in the happening. Two odd characters that do and say odd things, stuck with two crazy people. Add in a found footage style movie and that's the Visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Right M. Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has become the latest craze in the film industry to hate on director M. Night Shyamalan, but for what reason? Could it be because of his consistent poor reception; the butcher of 'The Last Airbender;' or his signature twist endings? Does he deserve it?M. Night's new film, 'The Visit,' answers these questions within the first 30 minutes of screen time. Having young actors/actresses star as the main roles so their delivery can be considered "justifiable," shaky cam to assert the filming illiteracy of children making a home movie and elderly performing mentally ill actions as a means of comedy or horror (couldn't tell the difference).It's obvious that M. Night has become so conditioned at this point that he has to limit his mistakes as a director by enforcing a simple formality to make a more "believable" and "compelling" story, which the film still doesn't equate to.M. Night is not back.</fullReview>

Usually I love Shyamalans movies even the ones that have received bad reviews (Lady in the Water).Which audience was this movie intended for? It's too immature for adults and the style would not appeal to children at all, and it's definitely not for teens.The characters and not well thought out and are not very likable, there is no connection between the audience and the characters.The plot and writing are terrible, the plot is unbelievable. People have mentioned a twist at the end, but I don't consider the ending a twist because it is along the lines of what the viewer is expecting there isn't really anything unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy boring, easily hyped up movies with no real plot, then this is your movie. I tried to sit through this movie and luckily unlike many, I did not spend any money on this crap as there was a showing of it online for free. My friends who saw this movie all said that it was "creepy", I guess seeing grandmas rear end in every scene, is enough to creep anyone out. This movie was boring as heck and made absolutely no logical sense whatsoever. I mean, what parent in their right mind, who hasn't seen their own parents in like 15 years, would send their children over their grandparents house, whom they never met, to stay with them for the weekend? Here is the shocker, they were never their grandparents in the first place, just two old crazy people, who like poopy, bloody diapers and crawling like the girl from " The ring". It was stupid and predictable, with a few "Oh my gosh" moments. Since the movie contained cheesy rap lyrics, here are mine:This movie sucked so much I almost fell asleep on it This movie had no real plot, except granny showing her tail all up in the spot...lol.Okay maybe the kid was slightly better than me, but it was still stupid.

		<fullReview>The movie reminds me a lot of paranormal activity. The way is filmed and all the rest. Something happen always after a certain time, exactly like paranormal activity. Now, during the movie the kids say that they don't have signal in the house, however they use Skype which requires an internet connection. You can clearly see a blue cable coming out from the laptop.These cables are used to hook up a desktop/laptop to a router. Now if you do have a router you can just use your mobile over the router. The movie is very flat, from the trailers I was expecting more that's the reason I decided to go to the cinema to watch this movie. Some parts of the movie just made me laugh, I don't know if that was the intent of the director or if just happens. The end of the movie has a twist that I didn't predict that is the reason I decided to give a better rate. Without the twist the movie would have been more flat, and definitely worth only 1 star. All in all I would say the movie is not worth the ticket price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did we watch the same movie? The same garbage M. Night has been producing for years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has fallen quite a ways since his hey days of Signs and The Sixth Sense. Audience members prepare for his token 'twist' and they just keep getting more outlandish. This year's The Visit pares down the story and film back to the basics, and still we can't help but think his film is still just inadequate and inferior.Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and younger Tyler's (Ed Oxenbould) mom is in need of some serious R&amp;R. So they take it upon themselves to take their grandparents up on an offer to stay with them for a week so mom can have some quality time with her new boyfriend, especially after the sudden and painful divorce. Never having met the grandparents, since their mother is estranged from her parents, they embark on an adventure to Pennsylvania farm country. At first Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) are welcoming and loving, all seems well, but then they start noticing odd tendencies about the elder couple and start to think this isn't what they had planned.People keep claiming that The Visit is the redemption film for M. Night Shyamalan after such travesties as The Happening or The Last Airbender. Having never seen the latter, I wasn't all that disappointed in the former. The problem with his films is they try so hard to be grand, rather than actually being an extraordinary concept. It shows in his ever decreasing popularity, and The Visit is no exception.Once again we have an M. Night Shyamalan film with a twist, which, if you perceive that as a spoiler then you are bonkers because every one of his films have a twist. The acting is poor, resting on the shoulders of two child actors who are not quite up to the task. Their personas and the family dynamic with the mother (Kathryn Hahn) is not one we typically see in film, but it is there, and M. Night's ability to bring it to life is lesser than his predecessors. The only good actress in the film was Deanna Dunagan as the batty Nana, but that is not enough to save the film overall.In all honesty, I wanted to stop watching after five minutes. The painful exposition, the trendy use of faux documentary cam footage in a horror film, and the bland characters ? it was obvious this was not going to be good, let alone great. But, I persisted, and unfortunately that time invested didn't pay off. With no scares and very little story to build constant tension to give the illusion of fear, we were dreadfully disappointed once again.Please check out our website for FULL reviews of all the recent horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit can be quite an enjoyable film if you don't expect it to be anything new, scary or nutritious. For me this worked neither as a horror nor as a thriller.The Acting of the protagonists is superb, the camera work is great and what the director and the whole crew pulled out of what they had to work with is just showing, that you don't need much but good handicraft to make a film with technically quality.The content though... oh boy, how do i put this? The content of the film is not what you expect and it instantly disappointed me when the twist came. Playing with the viewers expectations is always a good thing but it has to be done right. At least i want to see something interesting on the screen until the twist comes. I didn't.There were other semi-off-Hollywood films that had a similar concept but are much more entertaining and thrilling than this one.My recommendation : Watch it and make up your own opinion.But be warned. You will sigh and moan and yell and laugh. But you probably won't be scared and maybe disappointed, partially because you expected something scary, partially because this is not the regular Hollywood concept film. Which doesn't safe this one in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I apologise for the predictable caption, but it was too tempting. Also, if we do view this movie in light of Shyamalan's, Sixth Sense, then it seems almost casual by comparison. But in its own right this film is both fun and really quite scary!The film does a great job of misleading us, making us think that we're in for something altogether more light hearted than it actually is, and for that reason the horror moments are all the more effective. Yet it also doesn't push us too far, providing comic relief just when things get a bit too disturbing. However, despite its well placed scares and cleverly formulated creepiness, its just a bit too much like a ghost train ride to make it worth more than a mention . The scares it uses are for scares sake alone and the director uses his ingredients well but the movie lacks any real meat. Best watched without first viewing the trailer I believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the twist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, when watching M. Night Shyamalan films, I've come to expect the worst, but he always manages to surprise me with his mind numbingly stupid twists. They're always good for a laugh or two.'The Visit' misses the mark on every level. You have two children going to visit their grandparents - and due to no visual confirmation between their mother and her parents, whom she hasn't spoken with for 15 years, you can pretty much guess where things are heading 10 minutes into the film. At least I hope you can, so nothing like this happens to you down the road. This plot hole is not only completely ridiculous, but a complete killer. At least for me, since I continued watching, expecting an actual twist. You know, I was expecting M. Night Shyamalan shenanigans. He seems like an intelligent guy, the problem is, he thinks the rest of us are drooling idiots.Okay, so the ''twist'' didn't live up to expectations - what about the rest of the film? That really IS the entire film. Two highly annoying, somewhat intelligent kids, putting everything together - everything but the stupid plot hole. Oh, and one annoying mother, who sends her children away to stay with people she hasn't seen or spoken with for over 15 years with no visual confirmation, no phone contact, no photos, nada. We also learn that one of her parents was somewhat abusive, which just makes the story even less believable. Oh, and before I go - Kathryn Hahn is terrible. Random Ramblings of a Madman: M. Night Shyamalan is back? Thanks for the warning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan is such a hack now days, this movie was straight terrible. It drug out an immediately predictable story with long pointless sequences like a white kid rapping and dumb decisions by the protagonists like the sister going into to the basement while leaving her brother alone with crazies. And the payoff was about as good as a Chinese fortune cookie.The movie itself is not scary, the "twist" didn't even feel like a twist because it's quite apparent within the first 10 minutes of the movie and the constant foreshadowing - most of the movie is foreshadowing something the audience already sees coming - with cheap jump scares and ridiculously slow scenes that have no tension. The pacing of the movie is abysmal, it did a better job as horse tranquilizer than something one might call entertainment. I didn't go into the movie expecting much based off Shyamalan's recent stuff, but I was highly disappointed.</fullReview>

The bad lighting and the constant shaking of the camera, typical of camcorder footage, become really annoying from the beginning of the movie. Making a feature film this way seems to me a good way to spend as little as possible and appear innovative at the same time.

		<fullReview>This is an M. Night Shyamalan movie. I am of the opinion that he's basically a one-trick pony. I was really hoping for something different in this move, but it was not to be.Basically if you've already seen any other movie of this genre you're not going to see anything new. This has been done many many times before, especially by Mr. Shyamalan. And it cries out "oh my gosh I've already seen this movie a thousand times". I'm not a big fan of movies where the camera is a protagonist, but when done well I find it very pleasant. This movie is an example of it not having been done well. If the camera is a character, then there are numerous character flaws throughout. It's disappointing because when done right it's really good, but when it's not done right it's absolutely dreadful.The acting is so-so. I have a particular peeve about white boys trying to do hip-hop. It's cliché and very very annoying, again, unless done right. And this movie doesn't do it right. Putting that aside, most of the acting is so-so. Oddly enough, I thought some of the best scenes were done by Kathryn Hahn who has a relatively minor role in the movie. The "main" characters don't really do much to draw you in to the story. They're basically one-dimensional.I really wasn't entertained and I probably won't remember this movie after a few days. The only reason that I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because I reserve 1's for movies that I'll at least remember how terrible it was. This movie rates as bad but not so bad that I'd remember how bad it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others, I was skeptical of M. Night Shyamalan. The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village are some of my favorite movies, but recent films like The Lady in the Water (which wasn't terrible but was far less enjoyable) and Airbender (which was terrible), left me afraid of how this film would turn out.Fortunately, I HIGHLY enjoyed this film. From what I understand, M. Night set out to make a horror/comedy and truly succeeded. The trailer will give information about the content of this film so I won't try to explain it, but I will mention that this is the first film that has ever motivated me to create an IMDb account just to review it.The scary parts are creepy and suspenseful, particularly when involving the grandma. The funny parts are funny because they show a ridiculous 13 year old kid being a ridiculous 13 year old kid, something we can all relate to in one way or another. I never found myself bored with this film (which, unfortunately, happens often unless a film is particularly gripping). This was due to it's great pacing and relatively short run time.As far as the plot goes, it was straightforward and digestible. There is a twist, as should be expected in an M. Night film, and it left a few things unexplained, but as someone who loves asking questions and dislikes leaving a movie feeling unresolved, there wasn't enough left out to make it frustrating.Finally, I know a lot of people will probably take issue with the camera work, as it is "yet another" found footage/documentary style films. I will just say that there is a lot of care into making sure things aren't super shaky the whole film. The cameras are often placed on a flat surface, making many of the shots completely stable, and even the ones that are clearly hand-held are not nearly as chaotic and confusing as many other films I've seen in this genre.This movie is absolutely worth the watch, especially for those who enjoy creepy movies. I enjoyed it so much, I will definitely recommend it to my friends, and I will now be excited for M. Night Shayamalan's next movie.</fullReview>

So I thought I needed a movie that would give me reassurance of 2015. I thought this look decent and thought why not. Immediately I was already disengaged from the movie. The movie takes place where a brother and sister are visiting their grandparents. The mother sends them their and is divorced from her husband. The thing that immediately disengaged me was the boy rapping. It felt awkward and out of place for the movie.The acting was done excellency, they hard work was driving the movie onward. The movie tries to much with the flip flop with jokes and jump scares. It tries to clam or tone done the intensity of the jump scare with jokes. The mistake is that its turning the intensity with the dumb jokes even if its not intending to. The tone is very inconsistent with the tone, we couldn't get the tone whether its serious or funny.the camera angles were terribly. The director M. Night does a terrible job with the movie. . M.

		<fullReview>There might be a good movie in there somewhere, the basic idea isn't bad... but it has such a thick coating of dumb all over it that I wasn't ever able to enjoy it for more than a few moments before something annoying came along. First off... it's supposed to be POV filmed by a couple of kids... yet often looks like full on Hollywood production. No cheapy cameras and the nature of the editing just wreck that premise. So why bother? Second, the kids are just annoying as hell... the boy wrapper and his sister that talks like an NYU film student... why couldn't they be normal kids instead of these mutants that I felt no familiarity with or sympathy for? Third, the whole setup is insulting to old people and folks with mental illness... 'oooh! Old people are creepy and weird.... oooh! Crazy people are homicidal!' I'm not why this bothered me so much here but it did... it just seemed lazy. Fourth, the shmaltzy 'message' at the end of the movie. Shymalan has always had this shallow moralizing to some extent in his films... and it's always fallen flat when I've noticed it... felt tacked on. I'd give the guy a fair chance if the movie was decent... but it's far from good and continues his streak of making strangely awful movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep your parents locked up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying, I am a big fan of M.Night Shyamalan. Films like the Village, Signs, Devil, Unbreakable were clever and mystifying entertainment. That being said, I can only say how disappointed I was in The Visit. First of all, it did not seem to carry the Shymalan signature other than the quaint Pennsylvania countryside. The indigenous stone houses with their 18th century interiors are always a joy to see, but no amount of hearth-side chit chat can make up for the sheer silliness of this film. The plot is simple. The two children of a single mother go to visit the grandparents they have never met . Familial falling out and dysfunction have kept them apart until they find each other on the internet and the the precocious offspring are off to PA via Amtrak. The son is a pre teen rapper who is just self conscious enough to make him annoying. The daughter is a young teen, actually very lovely, with little self image who video blogs everything while using big words to describe her situations. They arrive to find two very odd grandparents . I won't give the plot away although you probably can guess it without much retelling. Needless to say,things are not what they seem to be and there is some moments of audience jumping and screaming with a fair amount of eye covering. But it really is all in good fun which is one reason why I did not like the film. A rapping 13 year old white kid is not funny to me, although the audience in the theatre I attended found it immensely so. The girl , I forgave her forced superciliousness, because I am a sucker for aquiline profiles, but she could also get a little tedious with her excuses and her stuffy attitude. Nana and Poppy were horses of a different color so to speak and they did their best to ham up the weirdness. The Mom with her Hispanic boyfriend was a wooden character, whose purpose remained vague. She did a lot of big teeth grinning and acting class pausing, if you know what I mean. Anyhow, the tension does mount during the middle of the film and you think it is going in a good direction, but then ,after all, it falls flat on its face with sheer slapstick and bathos at the end. I am convinced that either M.Night Shymalan or another writer has been experiencing the care of their elderly grandparents and the horror of that prompted them to make this film. Certainly , I can relate .The Poppy with his dirty diapers, the Nana with her nighttime naked romps evokes that sense of disturbance and surrealism that comes when you observe the decline so evident in a person as they grow old. I am sure the film maker , having seen this first hand, felt the scenarios would make a good horror story. And so it would have,if it had left out the teenagers and their adolescent perspectives. The Visit is not a film you should pay to see. Watch it when it comes to Netflix or some other movie site. I am still anticipating another great movie from M.Night Shymalan, this just wasn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just... I hate this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The little white boy raps, and the "grandparents" are actually escaped mental patients who murdered the real grandparents. There. F**k this movie. It's The Visit.A single mother finds that things in her family's life go very wrong after her two young children visit their grandparents.I'd heard just about every bad thing that you can hear about a movie. Including Your Movie Sucks referring to the movie as "worse than cancer", and so armed with that and my general expectation that an M. Night Shyamalan movie isn't going to be very good, I had a feeling that I knew what I was getting myself into. However, when at the 6 minute mark I actually heard this little kid actor start rapping, I knew I was in deep s**t.Now, this movie has been labeled as Fresh at 61% by Rotten Tomatoes, placing itself next to Chronicle, which somehow still has 85%, as proof that RT is useless and garbage. I have a feeling that the positive reviews for this movie are coming from it's ending having a pretty gross moment where an old man rubs his s**t in a child's face, but this moment is so unearned and foreshadowed that it loses all of it's impact. The kid is set up at the beginning as being a huge germophobe who then stumbles across a pile of used adult diapers in a shed. The math is there, and it's bullshit. That's not to say that the movie is shot incompetently, they've obviously given M. Night a fair bit of money to make this movie, which he bizarrely put into shooting it, despite it being a found-footage movie, all "filmed" by a 15 year old girl.The Visit is so absolutely f**king obnoxious that it honestly makes me angry just sitting here and writing about it. It's listed as a horror-comedy, but none of the jokes are funny and all the horror elements are f**king ridiculous. Coupled with the fact that every word out of both children's mouth nearly made we turn the movie off, it's a really hard watch, bordering on an endurance test.You have to deal with the 13 year old rapper, who uses slang I have never heard in my whole f**king life, like telling his mother he is "on the text" with two girls, and rapping about hoes to his grandmother, and on the other hand you have his 15 year old sister who fancies herself the second coming of Documentarian Christ, and has dialogue that feels like it was written by a grown man, rather than said by a teenager. I'm not saying that teenagers aren't bright, they really are, but when I have to hear a 15 year old girl talk about her grandparent's "proclivities" it starts to feel a little disingenuous.The movie even falls flat in it's premise, I understand that the mother of our two 'heroes' hasn't seen her parents in a while, but the idea that she would ship her children off to stay with adults who are essentially strangers without at least seeing them safely into the arms of these people just doesn't make sense to me. You could argue that "Without that, there's no movie" but that's just the problem. There should be no f**king movie.All in all, this is not some second coming of M. Night Shyamalan, it's an obnoxious, grating, waste of time that I do not recommend in the slightest. Being well shot, and not looking like it was made by the worst kind of film student does not make a movie good or watchable, and this is the proof of that. Don't waste your time or your money.www.barleydoeshorror.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch black comedy with self-reflexive sub-text</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the mammoth success of The Sixth Sense (1999), there's been a push to promote every subsequent M. Night Shyamalan movie as a horror film. From Unbreakable (2000) to The Happening (2008) every new movie was sold as a dark and twisty shocker; whether it was in fact a poetic romance with pointed political commentary (The Village, 2004) or an eccentric bedtime story disguising a self- reflexive observation on the writing process (Lady in the Water, 2006) the marketing always made the film appear vaguely supernatural. Evidentally, these were films by the director of The Sixth Sense and were to be promoted accordingly. Now his most recent film, The Visit, is the latest in a long line of Shyamalan movies to suffer a similar fate.The Visit - sold up front as "a new thriller from M. Night Shyamalan" - is nonetheless drawing heat from certain factions of the online community who just wanted another straight horror movie, dagnabbit! You'd think after two decades of subverting genre expectations, whether through presenting a superhero origin story as if a gritty 70s style procedural, or approaching an alien invasion movie as a claustrophobic Bergman-esque parable on faith, the audience would know the terrain, but again, all people really want from this guy is The Sixth Sense Pt. II or GTFO!What The Visit could actually be described as is a comedy, albeit a comedy with elements of psychological thriller, survival drama and an extended metaphor for familial dysfunction. Imagine Todd Solondz, David Lynch and the Farrelly brothers getting together to collaborate on a film that plays with the tropes of the found- footage sub-genre, but in a way that is frequently transgressive, if not actually perverse. Throughout, Shyamalan uses his set-up to mine moments of genuine hilarity, from the broad strokes of character comedy (the young Tyler and his terrible rapping becomes the film's go-to comic relief), to the subtle self-aware digs at the genre itself (Becca's film-school pretensions lead her to deconstruct the film, almost as it's in motion), to even moments of grotesque absurdity (including scatological elements that are closer to the works of John Waters than the filmmaker once dubbed, erroneously, "the next Spielberg").If The Visit is a horror movie, then it is to the found-footage sub- genre what Blazing Saddles (1974) was to the Hollywood western. It's not a spoof, but something else; a film that recognises the conventions and characteristics of the genre, teases them, has a laugh at their expense, but also uses them to tell a story that behind the laughter carries some serious emotions and ideas. Shyamalan's main theme of emotionally damaged characters having to overcome a particular situation to regain a sense of self is once again made the focal point of the film's third act dilemma, but there are more interesting ideas relating to the subject of filmmaking, in which the writer-director once again uses elements of meta-fiction to explore his own relationship to his art.In the film itself, the two children are using the week with their grandparents to create a documentary that they hope will heal the wounds of a long-held disagreement between the mother and her parents. Here Shyamalan splits his own filmmaking identity between the perspectives of the two children. Beccas is the sensitive, romantic one, who just wants to make beautiful cinema, while Tyler is the annoying brat that just wants to goof around and get a response out of people. When it becomes clear that the film we're seeing on-screen is essentially the film Tyler and Becca are making, this introduces notions of identity, fabrication, the subjectivity of the image, reflection, the passivity of the viewer and the conception of character as "actors" playing a role. It's all very clever, but unfortunately, as with the meta-fiction elements of the earlier Lady in the Water, it becomes something that most audiences couldn't care less about unless they're actively watching an "art- movie" and not some Hollywood genre film.Like several (but not all) Shyamalan films, The Visit features a twist, but rather than using it to pull the rug out from under the audience during the last few minutes of the film, the twist occurs 30 minutes before the end and is used to generate tension and suspense. In this instance, it could be described as an example of Hitchcock's "bomb under the table" theory, in which the audience is placed in a more privileged position than the characters, where our comprehension of events in relation to the ignorance of the protagonists fuels an edge of the seat confrontation.The film has several successful jump scares, but these are essentially self-aware and again playing to the conventions of the genre, and more surprisingly several scenes of genuine emotion; however, for the most part, the film is just funny and often incredibly strange. Again, I go back to that idea of the film being pitched somewhere between Todd Solondz (shocking black humour, misfit characters, an air of detachment) and David Lynch (suburban surrealism, bizarre imagery that seems dreamlike but rooted in reality), but with the familiar Shyamalan ingredients. The film is incredibly well acted and directed, beautifully photographed by award winning documentary cinematographer Maryse Alberti (who helps Shyamaln turn it what could be described as a found-footage fairy tale) and greatly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another great treat from M. Night...a thinking persons writer,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, M Night knocked this one out of the park! This film is nearly perfect in it's originality of genre. In my opinion, great scary movies require that their writers / directors have superb filming and story telling skills, as well as a just a hint of comedic edge, so to as to give a roller coaster type of emotion to the viewer. A perfect example - The Shining - King and Kubrick frightened the hell out of us all with the superb characters and Nicholson's chase scene, bringing it to a brief chuckle with the "Here's Johnny" line. Ad libbed by Jack N. Hitchcock was a genius of this genre, his method of suspense made the audience feel scared and nervous most of the time while watching his films - and then a sigh of relief and perhaps a laugh. Sadly today's thrillers/horror films are nothing more than cliché of slasher / wacky psycho stories which are no more than a smattering of bad plots, how much strobe like jerk movements a character can invoke, mediocre effects and then -blood scenes. Keep up the thought provoking genre you have re-created Night. Your fans love it. The Naysayers should be watching Friday the 13th/sequels No. 2 through 9. M. Night is a thinking man's storyteller.

		<fullReview>The teenager Becca (Olivia DeJonge), who wants to be a filmmaker, and her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), who wants to be a rapper, live with their single mother (Kathryn Hahn) that left home many years ago and has estranged parents. One day, their grandparents invite them to spend a week in their farm and they accept the invitation to let their mother travel alone with her boyfriend. Becca decides to make a documentary of their visit and Tyler and she are welcomed by their grandparents. Soon they note the weird behavior of Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) and they believe the reason is their old age. Nana accidentally damages the camera of Becca's notebook and they contact their mother only using the audio. When she fixes the device, they discover a dark and disturbing secret about their grandparents."The Visit" is a horror film with a good story. Unfortunately, the awful direction and screenplay, camera work and cinematography associated to the annoying wannabe rapper character Tyler makes this film unbearable. There is only one good moment when Mon tells the secret about the grandparents to Becca and Tyler. The rest, M. Night Shyamalan is absolutely overrated as usual in another garbage this time in the found footage style. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): "A Visita" ("The Visit")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, M. Night Shyamalan is not back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read the other user reviews I was excited about this movie. I thought M. Night Shyamalan had redeemed himself after his previous failures. Granted a lot of the past failures were due to lack of creative control. However, that is one of the reasons I decided to watch this film because it would be the first pure M. Night Shyamalan movie in years. So I was going in open minded and ready for anything. One of my favourite movies from this director is The Village and it was with that excitement that I went into this movie. Boy was I disappointed!! To me it felt like the movie dragged on forever and nothing substantially happened until the last 20mins or so. There was no build up like his previous films and the climax was weak and lacked the wow factor. I hope others can relate to this and that I am not the only one that was let down by this potentially great film.</fullReview>

I wish movie theaters had a refund policy...We'd have asked for our money back. The climactic moments shown in the trailer are carefully edited to create an illusion that this film has a lot to offer---Sadly, the film fails miserably. The actors do a decent job of carrying the weak plot - I do give them credit for that - but this film simply fails. There were only 4 people in the theater viewing "The Visit" when we saw it, if that says much - Again, I so wish we could have received refunds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth a Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is not recommended. In brief: Not only is the camera-work shaky, so is the film itself.GRADE: CVisiting my grandparents every Sunday afternoon with my parents and brothers in tow was a family tradition. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't that high on my "to do" list. Neither was M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller, The Visit. Sadly, my initial reaction was very accurate.The director / screenwriter tells his story of two siblings, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge), a fledgling auteur filmmaker and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) a precocious rapper wannabe, who go to meet and greet their grandparents for a memorable weekend while their mother (Kathryn Kahn) is off on a cruise with her boyfriend. Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are more strange than estranged and their baby-sitting techniques are spotty than spot-on. The words and actions of the elders don't gel as night approaches and the children aren't nestled comfortably in their beds. The Visit takes this intriguing premise and slowly adds its element of suspense, danger and humor with some success. But the film disappoints. This children-in-peril tale lacks originality and its creepiness arrives in short spurts. Scares are at a minimum.Shyamalan uses ironic humor well, blaming the grandparents' odd behavior on senility issues as he establishes his characters and hints at possible ominous clues as the film goes along its merry way. However, his execution of his source material undercuts the tension and horror elements by relying too heavily on the overdone found video footage approach (dating back to 1999's The Blair Witch Project) with its overt in-your-face camera-work and skewed angles so prevalent in today's horror film genres. While this may help to dramatically cut down of production costs and give a more realistic edge to the spooky happenings, the overall effect becomes a predictable cliché of its times. Fortunately, his script keeps the action moving and the cast, especially Ms. Dunagan, has a rousing good time with the eerie goings-on. There's an interesting story here, but the artsy direction and its gimmicky hand-held camera-work obscures most of the action and ruins any suspense. The twist, Shyamalan's usual hook in storytelling, doesn't make logical sense in afterthought and never builds to a satisfying end. While the film is better than most of the director's cinematic results in his past decade of filmmaking, it is below par nevertheless. Simply stated, don't visit The Visit.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an epic failure... this movie is crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was M. Night Shyamalan thinking when he made this sad excuse for a film? If there was an award for misrepresented films it should be given to M. Night Shyamalan, as every movie he puts out tends to be promoted as something that it isn't. Remember "The Village"? It was a film promoted as some huge horror film that was actually a love story, yes that movie for what it actually was turned out to be fair; this movie "The Visit" turned out to be a crock. 94 minutes of a movie and 84 minutes of it was a complete waste of the eyes to see, it's like The Blair Witch meets...... well that was it.An epic failure on this movie, it's just a money grabber as you sit in your seat and try not to fall asleep until the last few minutes of the movie when the action starts and well... the end. I knew from the beginning when I saw the advertising for The Visit that it wasn't going to be what the marketing said, but I did hope that the movie would've been worth watching. If you've heard this movie is great by anyone then it's obvious after you wasted your money to watch it that you shouldn't listen to the person who said it ever again. So many of our readers have asked about this movie to the point I broke down and watched it, now I have their answer. This movie is a very long wait of watching two kids run around with cameras until the story concludes, very cheaply done. As for the acting, anyone with some words in front of them could've done it, omg I want my 94 minutes back. I used to always say that the worst movies ever made was "The Expendables" until now.</fullReview>

And thus spake Shyamalan.The genre is so worn out and M. has had such a series of flops that I suppose he figured why not try to go where so many have now gone before. There are some creepy moments yes, but the viewer is expected to suspend their dis-belief that any of this is 'real' including the endlessly clever personas of the 'kids'.</fullReview>

There were some jumps in the movie, but only when things popped up. The movie was also quite slow to get started.

So gross, poor Tyler...The plot twist is so predictable too, from the moment Becca (the girl) said they don't know how their grandparents faces look like, I can know the grandparents they meet are not their real grandparents, especially if you're recently watching "When a Stranger Calls" type movie that tells you about "the real dangerous person is living with you in the same house all the time since the beginning".But this is not a bad movie, this is good movie, just not really entertaining.</fullReview>

This David Blum just keeps raking in the bucks, because the budgets are always below five million dollars, and the kids will keep forking out their sixteen bucks for garbage, because they see the name M. Night on it, or Paranormal Experience Seventy Five, and as long as they can make forty million on it, they've made a thirty five million dollar profit on it, which is what it's all about anyway. Why hire great actors, great composers, etc.., when you can hire anyone who the kids can relate to, because after all, it's found footage. M.

		<fullReview>OK, this film is nothing special, it is not bad nor is it excellent. The story is interesting, though with obvious plot holes, the major one being, why didn't the mom show them a picture of the grandparents? they contact you after 15 years and you don't even call them? also, does the mom find super normal all of the things they did? ''they're just old people'', yeah because old people walk around naked at night, scratching walls and walking like a spider, when my grandparents were alive, the only thing they did at night was sleep. But, it is scary, the last part mainly, but, what I always think of when watching found footage style films is that, in such moments of tension and fear, why would you even bother taking the camera and film? anyway, the acting was good, don't get why people say the kid was annoying, he was a normal 13 year old kid, kinda funny at times actually. Also, the credits were off place, the movie itself wasn't a comedy horror like ''you're next'' for example, where the tone of the film is humorous, this one just had some funny dialogues, so that rap at the end didn't fit at all, also, would you actually be rapping about such a traumatic situation? anyway.</fullReview>

So you don't have any photos of them... Kids decide they want to meet grandma and grandpa because mom is poor and always stressed - go off to the country - see a cow - meet your long lost grandparents... Grandparents unfortunately were killed before the train got to the station - and these crazy people who meet them instead... Somehow the crazy people are together - boyfriend girlfriend? Not sure - they never explained how or at least my shallow mind did not absorb how... Whatever - they are together... Reason I gave this a 1 is because something is dreadfully wrong - and unlike in my Jason Borne review I cannot figure out what it is... Then again - it is not my job - nobody paid me millions to come up with this garbage - I was just unfortunate enough to have to pay $10 to witness it...

In technical aspects, Shyamalan's choice to lead the story through simple cameras isn't original but works in his favor plus the good writing. The premise is also simple, giving its time for the plot unfolds naturally and the acting was solid, specially from the kids. That's a pretty decent film right here despite some long takes that may be tedious for some 'darker' viewers like myself. The Visit has fun moments and tension moments. If you allow me give a piece of advice, be more open-minded and don't hold yourself too much on the word Horror. Just go ahead and give this film a try. 8 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best written Shyamalan in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate found footage horror movies. There all god awful from beginning to end at least until you get to a movie like this, and it gives you back the hope in the horror genre that you may have lost. This film does that on all levels from the very start of the film and until the end. The idea here is that this young girl named Becca(Olivia DeJonge) is doing a little documentary and is a film student as well. As a result she brings her camera over and tries to get her grandmother apologizing to her mother so that way they can be close again. She goes over with her younger brother named Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) and they try and have a nice time at there grandparents home. As the movie goes on it builds up a level of mystery and intrigue only seen in films like 10 Cloverfield Lane and Midnight Special. And yes M. Night has made a good enough movie to compete with those types of films.The narrative is very smart and very dynamic as well, and it has a twist that actually makes a whole lot of sense and then you realize that M. Night is a lot smarter of a film maker than we could have ever expected him to be. The film that falter in not only being a found footage film, but also there are certain directing shots that don't have the flow that M. Night was going for and at certain points actually do hamper the enjoyment of the film overall. The acting here is also very good as well as the kids feel like there just kids and they do things that only kids would do. This is undoubtedly one of the better films that M. Night has put out and deserves a decent amount of praise for what he manages to do here as well</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my favorite but not the worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I liked the plot for the most part. One thing I can't usually buy is the maturity of the children. Most movies screw this up. I don't believe a 13 year-old when they talk as if they're in college. The female child lead roll seemed unbelievably smart and that's not exactly bad because it is possible but when you add in the mother's character and her inability to call her parents to ask how her kids are behaving, just rubs me the wrong way. And the boy is incredibly annoying to be honest. So much so that it made me hate when his character talked.The filming was the 'found footage' style which I didn't know but it was a lot better than most films of that style so that's a plus.The story wasn't bad and the twist I did like. It however didn't entirely explain some of the behaviors of the grandparents which really annoyed me. I also again hated how the mom didn't even know. I think M. Night has done better but he's done worse. The Happening for example was garbage. This film is worth a rent and one time watch but that's all I would give it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You have to laugh to keep the deep darkies in a cave." It's a line in the movie, but it's also a summary of the movie's approach, which expertly blends comedy, weirdness, and darkness into a lovely elixir.For over the first third, The Visit is a comedy about a couple of typically pretentious teenagers visiting their grandparents for the first time. The girl is a wannabe filmmaker, and the movie is made up of her documentary footage. While the found-footage gimmick is well worn by now, it's very well done here.I think the comic beginning is why some people say this movie starts slow; it starts slow if you want a horror movie. If you settle in for a comedy, it's wonderful.The Visit comes to a slow, calculated boil, moving from comedy to weirder comedy to weirdness and thrills with some comedy elements, and it's wondrous to see how beautifully M. Night Shyamalan melds the films disparate elements into a seamless whole. Along the way, there are pauses for moments of introspection and sadness, and the movie hits every point beautifully.As usual, Shyamalan has a twist. I figured out the main twist early on (it's fairly obvious, really), but that was fine, I still enjoyed the way it played out.I'm rather puzzled that, even though this movie has been declared a comeback of sorts for Shyamalan, it's just gotten okay reviews. For me it deserves far higher praise. The storytelling is economical, the acting is excellent, and the movie does a good job of peppering in the expository dialogue needed to explain what just happened in quick dashes that allow the film to end without the Psycho-style explanatory scene. (Although once you start going over it in your head you'll realize there are some big plot holes in here.) But then, I don't really agree that this is Shyamalan's comeback, because I haven't agreed with the popular notion that he started great and lost it. The only movie of his I've really hated was The Village, and overall I've found his films ranged from great (Sixth Sense, Signs) to reasonably watchable (The Happening, The Last Airbender) I'm even the rare viewer who liked The Lady in the Lake; perhaps I appreciate Shyamalan's sense of humor more than others. After watching The Visit, I've decided to check out the one of his movies I haven't seen, After Earth. Because for me, what the critics think about M. has proved virtually meaningless.Anyway, This is one of his best movies, along with Sixth Sense and Signs. Why can't people see that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm at a loss for words...The plot is original, but somewhat bad. It has plot holes but good performances. The script is original and fun, but as many other movies, it gives children a grown-up vocabulary/lines which makes it inauthentic. Regarding the plot holes, if you have paid attention to what the visitors coming to the house say, they are literally contradicting the plot twist in the manuscript. For true horror seekers this is not the one, the general feel of the movie is fun and happening at day time. But a handful of jump-scares, the plot twist and the little brother's rapping make it worth to watch though if you're on the fence..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better as a director than as a screenwriter, Shyamalan switches back to the horror genre following the critical and commercial failure of After Earth.Unfortunately, this small budget self-produced horror film is as bad as his other recent efforts, if not even worse. Once more it reveal all the strengths and weaknesses of his way of making cinema.Undoubtedly, there are some good ideas here and there, but overall they are not enough to make up for a middling plot, sloppy writing and not-so-great acting.The continued use of "found footage" style shooting and the recurring comedy aspects end up to become annoying.The story already was not so much original or clever, but as the ending is approaching and following the usual "Shyamalan's twist", it becomes even more idiotic, formulaic and silly.Unbelievably, it was a commercial success and contributed to revive the career of such a tedious and pretentious director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan shares the fright once again. Fan or not, you will be drawn to THE VISIT. A single mom (Kathryn Hahn) thinks it a good idea to send her kids Becka (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbough), to their grandparents for a week long visit. These kids in some ways seem like typical teens and of course you immediately know that they are a pain in the butt. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and old Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) live on an isolated Pennsylvania farm, that leaves the siblings little to do, but work on a video documentary of their visit. Nana and Pop Pop are a bit peculiar; damn right strange. These kids aren't dumb and it is not hard to figure out that their grandparents are engaged in some pretty dark deeds. This visit will be creepy, chilling and a down right disturbing nightmare. Remember Granny's rules: Have a great time. Eat all you want. Don't leave your room after dark!</fullReview>

Not seeing her parents for many years, but out of no where sending your kids to see them. Another interesting aspect of the movie was it was part documentary as well. I personally love documentary horror movies, so that was something I appreciated. For those who don't, do not worry. Only certain parts are filmed by one of the characters camera. Skipping to the ending, I was surprisingly shocked to find out they weren't the real grandparents. I was guessing maybe the grandma was just possessed and the grandfather was covering it up like most people would have guessed, but the director put a twist on it which I'm sure many will appreciate. Worth renting for sure. Not many super scary parts, but definitely a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat while keeping you worried on the next jump scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing. Best film I've watched in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright so straight off the bat, I wouldn't have watched if I knew it was Shyamalan's film, I've been ducking his work as with Damian Lindelof's for a while now. Ever since The Village, to be honest. Anyway, that's just foreshadowing, if you're anti-Shyamalan, or feel aggrieved or focused on his decline, park it. Trust me. This is a good film. Not a Shyamalan film, just a damned good film. Anything you'd associate with Shyamalan, the predictable, the cheesy, anything you think you know of his films, just doesn't exist here. This is new, and I'm unwilling to say anything too complimentary of Shyamalan in case this is a false dawn or the credit falls elsewhere. If he declines again I don't care, but for this film, it's an absolute success and while he hasn't won me back, he's left me willing to give his movies a chance again, which is pretty massive, in fairness to him.How to review this....hmm....It's really not like other horror films. It's shot as a point-of-view camera film, but it's very appropriate, because the central actress is trying to document the visit to her grandparent's home in the story. It's particularly well done in the sense that yes, she's a young lead actress, but she's also high-functioning and subtle, so she comes across really well as a little budding film enthusiast, she handles her role well.I think all I want to say is: it's engaging, it's character driven, the story and the pacing are really immersive, and the tone goes in places that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. I typically find myself doing something alongside my film viewing, I'll go onto my laptop or do something while I listen. Not this film, it kept me engaged throughout, which is 100% to its credit, few films do that for me.If you watch it, I genuinely feel you'll like it, if you're a fan of horror, then give it a chance, for me it's on-par with The Conjuring. I can't say too much more, but that I have a rule. It's the 30 minute rule, and if a film doesn't convince me it's going somewhere? Then off it goes and I find something else to watch. If you do the same with this film, I'm certain you'll stay right to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting old is scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent psychological horror with body horror flourishes that focuses on the more disturbing effects of aging, as seen through the eyes of two teenagers who visit their estranged grandparents in rural Pennsylvania. As has often been the case with director and writer M. Night Shyamalan's other work, there is a lot of contrivance to the set-up. The situation is believable enough to go with, largely due to an excellent cast's ability to pave over the things that might otherwise make you go "Hmmm...".This is not, strictly speaking, another "found footage" film because the footage was never purportedly lost, but the conceit is that all the footage we're viewing is shot by the older of the two teens, played by Olivia De Jonge, assisted by her younger brother, played by Ed Oxenbould. I thought I never wanted to see another movie supposedly filmed-on-a-hand-held-by-a-character. In this case, the conceit is effectively utilized as an integral element of the story rather than a gimmick, and sometimes as a slightly wry meta- commentary on the film-making process. Inevitably, there are scenes that made me wonder whether anyone in their right mind really would keep filming through the action, but this isn't as big an issue here as it often is with this conceit.What works really well and makes this worth watching is the subtle weaving together and ultimately the unraveling of rationalizations people employ to explain things that don't seem kosher, even as events get stranger and stranger. The film makes a good showing of how and why people can make some of the seemingly dumb choices they make, and in that sense offers something of a meta-commentary on a common trope horror movies are often faulted for. If the whole thing is a little too contrived to be truly disturbing and profound, and the conclusion a little too neatly wrapped up, it is nevertheless a unique and engaging watch.</fullReview>

All I can say is that the CIA could waterboard me, electrocute me, beat the living sh*t out of me, Chinese water torture me, and then flense and eviscerate me and they'd never break me. However, they could save a lot of time and effort by simply showing this movie to anyone they want to torture. The f'king rapping by the lisping stupid kid is enough to make anyone want to rip their ears off. Showing that old lady naked is enough to make strongest of iron stomachs wretch, and the whole sh*t diapers theme was absolutely disgusting and unnecessary.M.Night Shamawhatever, you sir should be ashamed of yourself.

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan. Truly I enjoy his movies. I feel excited when his movies come to theater halls. With a lot of expectation I sat down on my couch to view this film at around 12A.M. in the midnight so that I can actually get the true feel of what is called as a Horror Film. I saw it with all my patience without missing any of the scenes - be it a 'jump cut' or a shock created by abnormal sound or a faint try to emphasize a nightmarish impact on the viewer's / target audience's intense mind by a group of shaken and shitty shots. Sorry sir, I do admire your skill the whole speaks about, just fail to figure out what is the character of the 'bug' that prompted you to make such a film that only disappoints a human psyche when one tries to categorize this film of yours as a horror movie! Sir, please don't take up such projects in future that in return might not only degrade your fame, but also makes your dedicated fans feel disgraceful. We care for you sir, and will continue to do it all through but it's high time you make a change and make true horror films that makes whole world raise it's hair forever when it comes to M.

		<shortDescription>Another lame found-footage film full of plot holes and inconsistencies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brother and sister Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and Becca (Olivia DeJonge) are sent off to stay with their grandparents whilst their mother (portrayed by Kathryn Hahn) spends time with her new boyfriend. Becca is an aspiring filmmaker and decides to turn their visit to their grandparents into a documentary (as a way to learn more about them whilst simultaneously allowing her mother to learn more about her parents that she's been estranged from for many years). However, both Becca and Tyler start to notice that their grandparents are exhibiting strange behaviour and start to become increasingly concerned by the strange behaviour that their grandparents are exhibiting.I generally despise found-footage films and the reason I chose to watch The Visit was because I thought it was going to be more of a supernatural horror film rather than a found-footage film (the title suggests that there is going to be a supernatural theme involved). I watched it anyway hoping that it would at least be a halfway decent offering, but The Visit struggles even to be a mediocre film.In the early stages of the film I found it a little perplexing that a mother would send her children off to her parents house seemingly without speaking to them first. I mean even if you were in regular contact with your parents and were on good terms with them you would think that you would still check that it was alright to send your kids to them for a few days - a quick courtesy call would have been normal practice. This makes the later plot twist harder to digest; if she'd have spoken to her parents first (before sending her kids) then she'd have realised that the people staying in her parents house weren't actually her parents and thus the whole scenario would have been avoidable. I'm all for suspension of disbelief when watching films, but to me it seemed ludicrous that a parent would just send her kids off to her parent's house (whom she hasn't spoken to for some time) without checking first that they were still living there or even that they were still alive. To me, this is just the worst kind of negligent parenting.Things get worse when the kids report their concerns to their mother, but then the mother ends up dismissing everything that the kids are saying - the mother doesn't even think to speak to her parents and also doesn't seem concerned that the camera on her son's laptop is damaged (which is miraculously fixed and is working fine later in the film). None of this makes any sense and whilst it all makes the twist a little more surprising it's one that you feel you have no chance of working out because it makes little logical sense. This whole build up just points to some of the worst parenting imaginable as far as I was concerned.Going back to the camera on the laptop the film makes another leap of faith by expecting us to believe that someone could see 2 people clearly through a camera on a laptop from a distance of about 40 feet through a window which is partially obscured through net curtains. At this point the mother says 'They're not your grandparents!!!' - quite how she could ascertain this with so much confidence from that far away whilst looking through a lens on a laptop is anyone's guess.Once the twist is revealed then the film does shift up a gear (there are some creepy moments), but much of what Shayamalan has brought to us here isn't particularly original and a lot of it seems to have been borrowed from other found-footage films. One thing I also didn't like was the two kids in the film (they're bratty annoying and generally unlikeable which unfortunately is the way that most protagonists are portrayed in found-footage films). I also hate the way that a lot of found-footage films contain lots of scenes where the protagonists have inane and boring discussions (which more often than not don't seem to serve much purpose).Despite the bold claims the film isn't even particularly scary either (it's filled with cheap 'boo' moments, but other than that it's just an old women walking around, crawling around and at one point she seems to be dry-humping a wall which to me are not what I would call scary scenes).Oh yes and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse Shayamalan then treats us to a final rap song from younger brother Tyler who seems to be rapping about what you would assume was a traumatic and terrifying experience (yet the way it is delivered would suggest that he was unfazed by the experience even though he was clearly terrified at the time).This was a very odd way to end the film, but then again it's clear that logic and cohesion within the narrative were seemingly not important to Shyamalan at any stage during proceedings.</fullReview>

From there the plot only gets weirder as the grandparents they visit are eccentric, almost demonic entities that progressively terrorize the kids. The Visit is something unlike M. Night Shyamalan has ever wrote or directed before with a quick pace, jump scares and lighter tone. It's however a really nice comeback for Shyamalan who strayed off from his thriller/horror roots and was making lackluster bigger budget films. There's a particular unsettling nature about the film with the grandparents acting the way they do considering their old age. It's an interesting concept that could have been pulled off a bit better with maybe a more serious tone and a better ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan's best movie since 'Unbreakable', this above-average thriller is interesting and unique but ultimately lacks both scares and even laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Visit' is M. Night Shyamalan's best movie since 'Unbreakable', easily standing head-and-shoulders above the more recent cinematic garbage he's been making. That's not to say that it's great though, in fact it is pretty far from it. However, it is an above average thriller that unfortunately lacks both scares and even laughs. Basically, two kids go to meet their estranged grandparents for the first time but not all is as it appears; when the grandparents start to act very strangely, the children begin to uncover a fairly creepy mystery. One of the film's major issues is that it doesn't feel entirely consistent, with it's attention constantly being pulled between horror and comedy. As such, neither element really worked for me. The film was interesting, though, and there were a few tense - if strange - scenes.First, I'll start out with the positives. The movie does a good job justifying and maintaining it's 'found footage' style. It actually works in this case and I didn't find it annoying, unrealistic or obnoxious. I was surprised at how well it was handled and, while I was always aware of the style, I was never taken out of the story due to it. I thought that it was clever to make the lead girl be consciously making a documentary - with two cameras operated by either sibling, as it allowed the picture to actually feel like a film that she made herself (aside from a few jarring and out of place opening titles.) It also explained why she wanted to film everything, and Shyamalan managed to frame some interesting shots under the guise of her directing knowledge. Every shot felt as though it was filmed by one of the two leads, and the lighting looked organic too. I never felt as though she should just put the camera down, aside from a couple of later shots that panned away unnecessarily just to provide some jump-scares.Another positive thing about the movie is it's cast. Every member is convincing and puts all of their effort in; they feel natural, like real people. The two child actors were especially impressive, keeping up with the more experienced adults and turning in great performances of their own. They make for likable protagonists, even though the brother character is sometimes (intentionally, I think) annoying. The writing is also reasonably good, with the dialogue creating rounded characters with palpable histories and personality traits. The whole film is pretty unique as well, by which I mean it is absolutely crazy: it's incredibly weird. The events in the film seem to come out of nowhere and there isn't much consistency. There's also not a lot of explanation, though this may actually help; you get a clear idea of the important events, even though the motivations and back-story remain quite muddy. I liked how weird it was, as Shyamalan decided to make the film he wanted to make without any studio interference. It's fairly simple by his standards, and that allows the bizarre nature of it to entertain rather than confuse.The problems mainly start to arise with the conflict in tone. I appreciate that it isn't a run-of-the-mill studio flick, and also that it isn't confined by the genre. I do feel, however, that it may have benefited from narrowing it's scope a little in terms of tonality. It should perhaps have focused upon being a great horror or great comedy, instead of trying to be both. Ultimately, it ends up a little underwhelming in either category, and I didn't really find it funny or scary. The strange aspects of the film are impeded by this, too, as most of what happens is so odd that you aren't sure whether to be frightened or just to laugh: instead, you end up doing neither and simply try to work out what you just saw. Some of the stuff is just out of place, as some overtly comedic elements pierce through the more suspenseful segments. The film never tells you to laugh, and actually plays itself pretty straight, which simply serves to enhance the confusing tone. I feel as though the eerie atmosphere would have worked much better if it wasn't perforated by off-the-wall and strange humour. Although it wasn't scary or amusing, it was interesting and there were several tense scenes that worked well.There are a few other issues as well, such as some contrivances and a more clichéd final act. There are some times where the 'found-footage' elements become more generic, though thankfully those are few and far between. The brother character, while well acted, can be very annoying - especially when he raps. I guess it is a nice character trait, but it is honestly quite cringe-inducing and feels like an forced attempt at comedy. That character also uses a few instances of modern slang and strangely uses the names of female pop-stars instead of curse words, elements which feel like overt and shoe-horned attempts at being modern or relevant. On top of this, a couple of characters make some questionable decisions and there are some inconsistencies with motivations. Some scenes also don't necessarily make sense when viewed as part of a whole, especially after the climactic revelations. Overall, 'The Visit' is a solid thriller that doesn't try to be anything it isn't; it's intriguing and unique, with it's 'found- footage' style handled very well. While not particularly scary and not at all funny (to me, at least), it held my attention and is M. Night Shyamalan's best film since 'Unbroken': 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not going to talk about the grandparents because there is a twist and the less you know, the better because this twist is absolutely jaw-dropping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit (a review by Jye Preston)Back in the day, M Night Shymalan was a genius. He made the horror film The Sixth Sense which I thoroughly enjoyed, he then made another horror film Signs which I thought had good performances, but it was really cheesy and corny at times. Then came The Village and The Happening which really shook my faith in this filmmaker and upon watching these films, I was so angry that I renounced my faith in Shymalan and vowed never to watch another of his films ever again. I didn't go see this film because I was so blinded by rage and hate and also I believed that he will never make anything decent ever again, until now.The Visit is a 2015 found footage horror film directed by M Night Shymalan and produced by Jason Blum, the CEO of Blumhouse Productions, a film company that make low budget horror films that manage to make millions of money. Blumhouse and Universal Pictures distributed this film. The Visit stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. The Visit is about 2 teenage sibling named Becca and Tyler played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould respectively being sent by their mother played by Kathryn Hahn to stay with their grandparents called Nana and Pop Pop played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie respectively for a weekly vacation after the mother had a falling out with her parents.When Becca and Tyler arrive at their grandparents house for the week, they start noticing that their grandparents are acting very bizarre and strange and over time they are horrified by their grandparents increasingly scary behaviour and they soon realise that what seems to be a peaceful week stay will very quickly turn into a disconcerting, horrifying nightmare.This film has a lot of things going for it, the entirely of the film is filmed using a hand-held camera in a very similar fashion to Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity and The Gallows. The main protagonists Becca and Tyler are very likable, Becca is a 15 year old teenage girl who is the more straight faced and serious of the two. She wants to become a filmmaker and that is the sole reason why she's filming the events that occur in the film because she is making a documentary to show to her mother. Tyler is a 13 year old boy and he is without a doubt the show stealer of this film. He is immature, funny, cute and a very likable character, he wants to be a rapper and throughout the film he is rapping periodically in the film in a manner like Eminem and his lyrics are hilarious. He's also scared of germs and he has a funny of habit of using singer names when he cusses. I'm not going to talk about the grandparents because there is a twist and the less you know, the better because this twist is absolutely jaw-dropping. To conclude, The Visit is a fantastic horror film with comedic elements thrown in to a successful result. It is well shot, edited, directed, produced and I can sincerely say that this is the best film that Shymalan has ever made since The Sixth Sense and this has finally gained redemption from critics and fans alike of his films, despite him having a bad track record of bad films in the most recent years. This is the kind of film that you need to watch only once and it stays with you for life. It is a masterpiece and this will go down in history as a instant classic and will staple the hope that there are horror films that if given enough effort, can turn out to be good. I cannot praise this film enough, I give The Visit a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all expected that dazzling twist from M.Night and he delivered it. We all knew that a twist was because of The Sixth Sense twist. This movie was scary and exhilarating. It wasn't the typical horror movie, were the big breasted girl runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door (Scream Reference.) The "Grandparents" really being two elder's escaped from a mental hospital was AMAZING. I recommend this horror movie to people 11 and up, because of the thrilling and scary events that happen. Find the time to watch this heart-stopping horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you watch this....don't watch! To turn back the 90 minutes I have lost of my life!!! I gave this movie a whirl because it was written and directed by Shymalan. Loved The Sixth Sense. But this movie sucked big time. what a waste of $$$$$. The two main characters were good actor/actress. The storyline was felt it was thought up in a few minutes in the bath tub! I am glad I did not go the theater to see this pish posh. There was one funny line in the whole movie. I have recently seen some very low B budget movies which were BETTER than this movie. To class this movie in Comedy horror genre. nah. Not happening. Although a big budget and the prestigious film studio UNIVERSAL! I am even more disappointed in this production! I am been harshly honest here because I am a HUGE horror buff and this movie is a kick in the nuts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>twist too easy to guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm terrible at guessing the twist in movies, but this one I got right on because it was so obvious. When the grandparents start saying and doing all this crazy stuff, well the conclusion is they are crazy.The plot is 2 kids go to stay a week with grandparents they have never met. First, what mother puts her kids on a train to visit people they don't know. That pushes believability. Any ways the kids constantly say the weird things going on are because they are old. Well when the grandmother creeps around like a possessed person and laughs at nothing and asks the girl to get in the oven, that should have been a clue, something is way off.Plus at the end, when the mom tells the kids those aren't their grandparents, how could it possible take so long to get the police there and she is with them and supposedly lived far away. Surely that county of PA had someone that could have gotten out there earlier.FINAL VERDICT: the twist wasn't shocking,easy to guess. I'd only recommend it if you don't mind a dull shocker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you probably know from M. Night Shyaalan's past movies, they usually include some sort of big twist at the end or near the end. "The Visit" is no exception. However, this time around the twist doesn't have a lot of sock to it. It isn't a stupid or misguided twist... it's just very familiar to people like me who have gone through a lot of horror tales (written or filmed) with twists at the end.Actually, that familiar twist wasn't the biggest problem I had with the movie. The big problem I had with the movie is that it is WAY too much stretched out. There is a big amount of unnecessary filler here. If the filler had been removed, we might have had a passable (if somewhat familiar) short subject. But as it is, viewers will probably get eventually impatient with the movie.The movie is well acted and looks very nice for what was a small budget. And there is a mildly creepy feeling generated at times. So there is merit here. But as a whole, the movie doesn't work. Unless you are desperate, I wouldn't recommend you drop by "The Visit".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when they thought M Night Shyamalan had lost his touch he come back swinging with a movie that struck fear into a hardened horror veteran and had him screaming for his mama and packing death in his proverbial nappy. "The Visit" has Shyamalan reaching for his old techniques and improving on them ten fold with a nail biting, diarrhoea inducing terror fest of epic proportions. I've never understood the unwarranted hate bandwagon people have wholeheartedly jumped on in regards to Shymalan; yes he had a couple of face-palmingly bad films, but in comparison to the intensely incredible ones he's made they should fade to the back of your mind. "The Visit" takes us back to his great films with a feeling of giddy nostalgia. Take my advice and watch this movie with the light on and your maternal figure rocking you in her arms and singing sweet lullabies in your ear. Now excuse me while I go vomit and restart my heart with a car battery to prolong my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly entertaining, but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan continues to chase his glory days of The Sixth Sense. None of his films since have been as tight and edgy (or even made any sense -- I'm looking at you, "Signs"!), and "The Visit" continues that slow spiral.The premise of the film is sound and the actors are all pretty good. I especially enjoyed the kids; I thought they did a great job with what they were handed in the script. But the pace was too slow and filled the time with too little of substance. Sure, there were some spooky parts, but "spooky" is the best that could be said for them. Too often, they were thrown in as a disjointed jumble and didn't effectively build on each other, giving the viewer's blood pressure time to recede to pre-spook levels. The inevitable M. Night plot twist was too little, too late; my 15 year old and I predicted it after the first 45 minutes of the film. The levels of frenetic tension and urgent sense of doom that should have carried the last third of the film never materialized.Overall, I'd say this is a formulaic piece with too many gimmicks (like the "Blair Witch"-esque found footage) and too little editing. Alfred Hitchcock could have taken this film and had the audience wetting themselves with half the time and a third of the trite gimmicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and funny at the same time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not what I expected. Suspenseful while being humorous at the same time. The entire movie is filmed documentary, hand-held camera style. The two kids are going to see grandparents that have been estranged from their mom for 15 years. The daughter decides to use this opportunity to film "the visit" as a sort-of documentary of the mom's life, where she grew up, interviewing her parents (the grandparents) and maybe figure out how to bring about a reconciliation in the process. The movie is unexpected in how bizarre it is, but also a bit of a character study in how it delves into the deep seeded feeling the kids have been suppressing since their mom and dad got divorced. All the creepiness keeps you hooked on trying to figure out what the heck is going on with this eccentric couple. This movie is not perfect by any means and as thrillers often do, it has it's skeptical parts, but it pretty much answers every question raised and has a decent ending. It was a bit difficult to rate because this movie is not going to be for everyone and although my 22-year-old son and I both got a kick out of this movie, it's not something I'd watch again and I'd only recommend it to certain people. So it gets 7 stars In My Humble Opinion 6/2016</fullReview>

The script is not extra explanatory and the audience is engaged to the last minute. If you are looking for a good one time watch that will keep you interested in what happens next, try this out.I had marked this a 6 when i had seen it, but on hindsight and after watching crap like The Witch, i have upgraded The visit to a solid 7!

		<shortDescription>Say whatever you want about M. Night Shyamalan... but THE VISIT is a great horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, probably not the best picture of M. Night Shyamalan but it is a great film. People has to consider that they are watching a Horror film despite who is directing it.The visit contains all the elements essentials in a low budget horror film: two scary characters also mysterious &amp; unpredictable, a house in the middle of nowhere, spooky moments, blood, suspense, a grotesque humour Raimi's like and a nice twist.The movie introduces a new concept of fear, imagine how many kids would be traumatised after watching it. Imagine how many kids will refuse to go to their grandparents during the week end. I find the formula of this picture simple, genius and highly effective. The behaviour of these two old characters is never too extreme or paranormal,the fact that they were extremely realistic and never banal or over the top allows the audience (or simply me) to find spooky even just a smile from Nana.I like how throughout the movie you get to learn more about the main characters and start liking them (kind of, those two kids and their mom are at pretty annoying and not appealing at all). All that drama about the past of Tyler &amp; Becca and their relationship with their father is well constructed, it helps unfold the characters, but it is just not interesting... It would have been nicer to find out more about the past of Nana and Pop Pop. It is a great Horror, that like every other horrors should be watched alone at night to fully enjoyed. Some scenes scared the s**** out of me, and that was a great joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rustic escapade elevated by fine atmosphere and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mockumentary or found footage is mostly tailored for realism, but they can also be seen as sloppy as the implementation of shaky cam is now widespread. "The Visit" fortunately brings a good visual and cinematography, it also has the luxury of identifiable situation as the premise and great acting performance to establish the eerie setup.This is a story about two young children who are visiting their grandparents who they have never seen before, which screams like a bad idea in general. They soon find that the seemingly polite and likable grandparents have creepy secrets. The movie employs better use of cinematic shots within the boundary of found footage, and it cleverly uses the young girl's film hobby as excuse for this.Both the old and young cast do a remarkable job on making friendly and approachable characters, even though they have hidden quirks. Becca and Tyler will most likely grow on audience with their antics. It's also not hard to root for them since they apparently have baggage to carry. A few of the interview moments are far better than expected from ordinary horror has to offer.The sense of dread comes from having to deal with the older couple who are constantly exhibiting strange behaviors. It makes for a couple of either bizarre or uncomfortable moments. This air of mystery is what keeps the tension going, and this is the example of the unknown is more effective than outright scare as at latter half it loses some of its effectiveness.For a found footage genre, "The Visit" is definitely a step above the rest with its smart visual, good acting and strangely gripping moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for "Signs" I don't really like Shyamalan's work and I truly believe that "6th Sense" is one of the most overrated movies of all time, but his take on Found Footage actually surprised me in a good way.THE GOOD PARTS: Believable characters - The self-loathing teenage girl who wants to film a documentary about her grandparents to make her single mother feel better about an unknown family incident when she was just a teenage girl. All along feeling responsible for her father leaving the family. The obnoxious and overly confident wanna-be- rapper younger brother who's actually a frightened wuss. And foremost the wonderful Kathryn Hahn. Nuff said. Eerie atmosphere - The old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere (more or less), the absolutely terrifying grandmother and the creepy old grandfather, the nightly outbreaks...all good ingredients. The plot twist - this is a Shyamalan movie, after all.THE BAD PARTS: The abysmal rapping - totally unnecessary and somewhat irritating. The football analogy at the end - over the top, unbelievable and also unnecessary.Other than that, this was a fun movie to watch. Creeps you out a bit, if you're into that slow paced atmospheric style of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is a known director. He obviously is best known for 6th Sense. That's a good and clever movie. I seriously can't believe that movie is almost 17-years old. We can see how much Haley Joel Osment has aged in recent pics. He is also the director of another Thriller a 2002 movie that doesn't seem talked about so much, but it isn't a bad movie, Signs.You don't hear much of the director Shyamalan anymore, and even when you do it seems like nobody really thinks of him as an ideal film director anymore with recent films including this. We have After Earth, I haven't seen After Earth but that movie has had horrible reviews, and while we might remember Jaden Smith from Karate Kid, and not think of him as a bad actor in that film, Jaden Smith's reviews have gone down because of After Earth. Will Smith who is a popular actor, considers it the worst thing he's done in his career.I wanted to rent this movie. I mean remembering the popular Sixth Sense, I wanted to see how this new thriller which came out over a decade later would be. I've been seeing some bad reviews for it along with good reviews, which almost every film will have both. I wanted to see if I'd end up enjoying it.While this movie might have been well thought out of to make a scary movie, it wasn't an ideal film. Here are reasons. It has a couple of scary scenes, and it has a clever idea of kids staying at their grandparents and seeing their grandparents acting creepy. But, here are the problems with the movie. It can be entertaining to see movies shot from a camcorder perspective where the characters make videos. That's the way Earth To Echo was shot. It makes the movie seem a little more real. However, this movie was shot from that perspective and almost didn't have any background music throughout the film, making it look like you were watching reality T.V. or a YouTube video. But, also making the film more boring.Almost the whole movie took place in rural Pennsylvania. While that might have cut costs, basically the whole film is seeing videos a brother and sister make, Becca and Tyler, and noticing their grandparents acting crazy. It still was a bit entertaining, and there's a twist, but even with the twist, the movie is hard to understand, and it is like what happened?Basically, this whole movie is what you expect from the trailer and what you see from the reviews. In one sentence, it's kids staying at their grandparents house, and while their grandparents seem pretty normal most of the time, they start acting creepy other moments. It's even hard to understand why?I leave this movie with a 4/10</fullReview>

This film doesn't rely on a the stereotypical crutch that horror does today. there is no shock value, they aren't trying to make your jaw drop from someones organs being ripped out or demon possession, elderly people are scary enough if they want to be. I also hate movies that are filmed from the perspective of a home video, but this was done right! It had its mise en scene and didn't make me want to hurl from shaky cameras. The acting was very good, nothing over the top or amateur, it was very believable. I'm not a huge horror fan, but I'm definitely going to buy this one. M.

		<fullReview>Well, that's time in my life I'll never get back! The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it is. It can't decide if it is a black comedy or a horror. It is not funny enough for the first and not good enough for the second. Due to the plot, this should create an unnerving, claustrophobic atmosphere. However, this falls very flat. In addition to this, the characters are far too two-dimensional: as a viewer I really didn't care what happened to them. The mother is unbelievable, as are her actions which make up the main plot- would you just send your children to stay with your parents you had been estranged from for fifteen years? The grandparents and the children are stereotypical and superficial, the plot is predictable and eye-rollingly bad. The mise-en-scene is poor. The film lacks at every level. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers herein. Pre-review rant: It has become annoyingly fashionable to rip on M. Night Shyamalan in the last decade. That's truly what the scrutiny comes down to: It's cool to hate. In my lifetime I can't think of a single artist in any medium - that produces solid work on a consistent basis - who is subjected to more nitpicking and fussiness than Shyamalan. Do you know why the twist ending of The Sixth Sense was so great? Because you never saw it coming. You didn't even know there was going to BE a twist. You thought you were watching a by-the-numbers ghost story, until eureka! Plot twist. But by the time most viewers got around to seeing The Village or Signs, they had become so jaded that they couldn't even enjoy the picture. They sit in the cinema with their arms folded, waiting for a twist ending that they've already decided they're going to hate, instead of letting the movie unfold and play itself out. I'll admit Shyamalan has had a few duds (The Happening and The Last Airbender come to mind), but give the man a chance, won't you?Where does this cynicism even come from?As for The Visit, this represents another solid outing for Shyamalan. Much has been made of the movie's "found footage" style, and how the sub-genre has already been exhausted by other filmmakers. Again, if you let this movie do its thing, you'll see that the effect is used as a *critique* of the style, that Shyamalan is sending it up as something of a parody. At the same time, the style works to illuminate his characters better than I believe a traditional structure could accomplish. And it's the characters - and the actors playing them - that truly drive this movie. Olivia Dejonge is convincing as a troubled teenager, and avoids succumbing to the hackneyed brooding/goth archetype that's so prevalent in this genre. Peter McRobbie is also serviceable in his role as the grandfather, alternating between aloofness and menace.But it's the other two leads (Ed Oxenbould and Deanna Dunagan) that give The Visit its lifeblood. Oxenbould is instantly charming and charismatic, forsaking the endangered hopelessness that his type of character is prone to. Not to give too much away, but he displays a myriad of talents in this movie. Dunagan is the true star of the show however. You can tell she had a lot of fun making this movie, the way she throws herself around the set and commits to every terrifying tick that's been written into her character. The Visit is worth watching for her performance alone. Forewarning: if you're not a fan of Shyamalan's visual style, you won't like this movie. The Visit is laced with his trademark quirks, his skewed camera angles, his long stationary shots, his penchant for putting children in the line of danger, his scenes of non-sequitur, eclectic dialogue. At times, the movie can seem over-plotted (a warranted complaint of his previous movies). If you're worried about Shyamalan himself making another forced cameo, breathe easy, as he never steps out from behind the camera. And if you're dreading another plot twist, well, c'mon. It's M. Night Shyamalan. But don't go into it - or avoid it - just on account of the twist. Enjoy the show. Let its weirdness grab hold. The Visit is unnerving, creepy, and clever. It has personality, which modern horror films are sadly lacking. It has nuance, which is likewise a rare commodity. It has a sense of humor, which is necessary to offset its more unsettling moments. In all, it's entertaining. And isn't that enough for any movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you have enough brain cells to afford yourself the luxury of watching another M Night Charlatan flick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pair of old people escape a lunatic asylum, kill a couple living in a house and impersonate these people (badly) in order to meet their 290-IQ grandkids. Sounds stupid? Beyond; in fact, it defies common sense every step of the way. M Night Charlatan does it again, comes up with yet another dumb plot-twist which is ? despite its utter lack of logic - foreseeable from fairly early on. Who the hell sends their underage kids to travel all across America ? alone ? to meet people she hasn't seen in decades? How is it that she shows so little interest in her parents when her kids skype her? I could go on an on. In M Night Charlatan's world logic is a rare commodity and a personal enemy of the infamous dilettante. He nearly always treats his viewers like mongrels, so if you're feeling particularly mongrelic you can watch this movie without fear of losing (many) brain cells.What can you say about directors who actually write smart-Alecy, adult dialogue for kids? They're the worst kind, the pits: it's a huge red flag, an indication whether a director is a hack or a master, a down-to-Earth thinker or a pompous charlatan. No great director gave Einsteinic dialog to children ? ever; only amateurs and buffoons do. These kinds of fictional children that are intellectually far superior to all adults is neither cute nor funny even in a mindless cartoon, let alone a horror movie. The really depressing part is that you know nothing can do those annoying kids harm because they're the ones filming this dumb mess. If anyone ever wanted to advocate violence against children, all he needs to do is portray them the way Mr Charlatan does.You might want to completely skip the first 20 minutes ? unless you need to find reasons to hate the kids enough to want them to be not just destroyed but even crushed into tiny bits by the deranged pensioners. M Night Charlatan is such a self-important nerd, he had to give the kids IQs of around 600, and all the verbal dexterity of an Oxford English Lit top-of-the-class graduate high on uppers. Yes, the kids are beyond despicable and far too un-kidsy to have an iota of credibility as credible representatives of the kiddy race. Worse yet, Mr Charlatan sucks up to the current crop of brainwashed, de-cultured young buffoons by making the boy an aspiring rapper - as if any mega-intelligent young boy would have any use for the infantile world of rap. Once a charlatan, always a charlatan; it's not as if we're not used to M Night Charlatan's movies being so very full of the brown stuff. He even allows this supremely irritating attention-seeking brat (played by a truly detestable infant) to rap on several occasions. Needless to say, the remote control is your best friend should you decide to stick it out with this tedious crap, and the fast-forward and skip buttons your greatest allies. Unless of course you find it cute whenever a kid raps, in which case you undoubtedly belong to the category of film-goers who consider drivel of this kind a cinematic classic. Rap goes hand-in-hand with tardation, you see.Believe it or not, Mr Charlatan even thought that these ultra-wisecracking kids are capable of carrying the comedy in this wee idiotic flick. Even if these kid actors were talented comedians (and what 12 year-olds aren't, right?) what chance would they stand fighting against an abysmally unfunny charlatan script. The characterization is so vapid and far removed from any kind of cosmic reality that even after they repeatedly witness scary, eerie behaviour these kids crack really bad jokes instead of getting panicky. (The boy even makes jokes as he's KILLING the fake grandpa!) It's the kind of bad jokes you find engulfed by a delirious, hysterical laughing track in any awful corporate sitcom. I tell ya, these kids are sci-fi characters; they're so far-removed from real children that they make Gollum seem like a chartered accountant by comparison. The kids actually manage to OVERPOWER the dynamic loony duo ? even killing them both in the process, in what must be the least convincing horror "grand" finale ever filmed. They're supposed to be incredibly smart, and yet it takes them an ENTIRE WEEK to realize that it's best to get the hell out of there. It's a mess alright.You also gotta love Mr Charlatan's "ageism" (a politically-correct word that I detest, but which is wholly applicable here). For every bizarre thing the loony old couple do, the kids' mother gives the same rationalization: "old people are like that, they do strange and stupid things". One would think watching this idiotic flick that old people were the oddest and most unpredictable creatures on the planet. What planet did Mr Charlatan crawl out of when his spaceship was dumped on Earth? Perhaps on his home planet senior citizens are indeed the most exciting and weird demographic, but the little fella has been on our planet long enough to have learned that this is not the case in the Solar System. For every movie, even the great ones, there are always a few loonies yelling how bad it is, how it's "the worst movie of all time". (You know the type: they watch one "worst movie of all time" every week.) In this case, however, every single one of those reviewers is right in their criticism. It may not be the worst of all time, but it's certainly one of the worst flicks of the decade. One woman expressed disgust and surprise that M Naught Charlatan still gets to make movies. She's right: Ed Wood only made 4 or 5 and then had to quit. Why should Mr Charlatan get preferential treatment? Is he better than Ed?</fullReview>

I know, like an entitled and spoiled teenager dealing with senior citizens, which this movie tries to start off as, I was a little put out. And then there was the, oh no, not another movie using 'the perspective of a hand-held video camera' plot. Aside from some weird behavior from the gramps, I spent the whole movie waiting for something interesting or scary to happen. The scary part of the movie, was that I watched the whole thing and then logged in to comment on it. Boo! Too bad they did not use more of Kathryn Hahn, the only bright spot in this truly tedious non-horror, non-humor, non-interesting bore of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror-Comedy that Fails to be Funny or Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit follows two children who go to visit their grandparents for a week after not seeing them for their entire lives, and their grandparents turn out to be...different.The plot is okay. Sure, maybe it's kind of unique (simply because it's about old people instead of little girls), but in terms of presentation it's very much the opposite. Everything about the movie is very poorly written until the very end, when it releases an incredible twist ending that almost redeems the rest of the movie and makes it make sense. However there's no real build up. Sure, there's foreshadowing, but I never sat there and thought "I wonder if there's more to this..." I think that I'd enjoy it more if I watched it again, knowing the ending now, but the thing is that I don't want to, mostly because everything else is kind of terrible. The characters are incredibly flat. They have a handful of defining traits, but they never really go that deep. Sure, the movie tries to force back story and stuff on us, but that doesn't tell us that much about the characters. It tells us how they feel about one particular topic, and it doesn't reflect in their lives or affect how they act. Speaking of acting, these guys are all pretty incompetent. I guess they aren't horrible, but they're still pretty bad. There were a handful of scenes, specifically the rap scenes, that really bothered me. The kid who raps is horrible, and it's not even funny. I had to cover my eyes and try not to listen when these scenes came on, they just made me cringe so much, and not in a good way. Apparently this movie is a horror-comedy, but it's never scary really. Towards the end maybe there's a bit of suspense, but otherwise there wasn't really anything scary. All the parts that could have been considered 'horror' were all spoiled in the trailer, so it turned out just to be predictable. The comedy aspect was worse. There was not a single part of this movie that was funny. I could tell that M. Night 'tried', but the 'effort' he put in just wasn't even remotely funny. Lot's of scenes that were supposed to be scary clearly existed for the sake of the trailer, which made them even less scary and more forced for the sake of 'scaring' people in the trailer.Overall The Visit was just unpleasant. The characters were terrible, the acting was mediocre, the horror wasn't horrifying, and the comedy wasn't comedic. The ending was great, and I think that it'd be better if I watched it again, but with everything else stacked against it I don't think that I would want to. Ever. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless your a die hard fan of M. Night Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy yet hacky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't bring myself to like this movie, no matter how hard I tried. The children were thoroughly unlikeable and the scares were cliché. The blend of horror and comedy which works so well in other films seems jarring as it stumbles around the found footage genre. Conceptually this film would have made a decent TV episode of The Twilight Zone but it feels a little padded out even at the relatively short run time of 90 minutes. There is real tension built in this film but it's discarded with absurdly cheap jump scares. Essentially the comedy in this film feels a bit like a bad dad joke. Worth a punt if you're stuck for a movie but try to watch it with a few friends and maybe involve alcohol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is nothing but spoilers, you have been warned: Its an old farm house with not a single sign of computer technology found anywhere inside, yet it's equipped with high-speed internet.Two human bodies are decomposing in the basement for at least a week, but they don't smell.The woman, Stacy, that comes to the door asking after the grandparents, alludes that she knew them from counseling sessions at the local mental hospital. Why would she willingly walk into the back yard with two people she clearly finds suspicious? The mother is angry enough at her parents to not speak to them for 15 years, yet she's perfectly willing to send her children to them for a week.Just how long had Nana and Pop-pop been impersonating the real people? That was a really big pile of crap-filled diapers in the shed.The two people that came to the door made reference to big events happening at the mental hospital, presumably relating to escaped patients. Following these big events, no official inquiry is made when two obviously important volunteers don't show up as scheduled? An old man, unprovoked, physically attacks someone on the street and everyone just chalks it up to old-people paranoia? And the victim doesn't call the police? Two patients escape from the local mental hospital and are able to roam around town with impunity?Locked into a bedroom, the girl uses her camera to break the lock, smashing it three times, yet the camera keeps right on rolling. Just moments before then, it never occurred to her to use the camera on Nana's head.The usual complaints about these first-person movies when the camera operator continues to film when no person in their right mind would be worried about such a thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed. What I liked? Most of the Nana scenes, especially the ones where her alter ego emerges. And I liked the boy's exuberant nature and his witty comments.What I didn't like? The hand-held camera! I can't stand movies where the camera jumps around. Also, the movie in general was too "surface". It wasn't deep enough or focused enough to pull me in. I never lost sight of the fact that I was watching a movie.I watched the alternate ending on the bonus reel, which I preferred over the official ending. That said, I wasn't bowled over by either ending. I prefer rich, rewarding endings that last a bit longer, sort of like a really good fireworks finale.The Sixth Sense was my favorite movie of all time, and I totally enjoyed M. Night's The Village, Signs, and Unbreakable. As for The Visit ... meh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and not scary enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited for this film, since reviews vary so widely. I am also a big fan of horror movies. I also liked the director's first films, and wanted to see if he has succeeded again. Unfortunately, he has not.This is not particularly good. The shame is that it could have been so much better. I do not think the way it's made is a good choice either, with this documentary style. It does not work particularly well. It is not scary enough, and the story is more strange than exciting. In the end of the film, the horror effects are good, but by then it's too late. Do not expect anew Sixth Sense. One of his lesser good film this one. The actors were quite decent, and there is nothing wrong with the casting. I understand why the reviews vary so much. This is a film you either like or hate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i saw this title and realized this was a horror movie directed by Shyamalan and the pretty good IMDb rating i thought to myself "this may well be Shyamalan's comeback!" and rushed to see it. Well, it's not. First seconds into the movie and i see on screen "written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan", the "written" part disturbed me, i instantly was struck with the feeling this was going to be a horrible movie, but hey, let's give it a chance, he proved to be a great horror director in the past. Some minutes into the movie i see that the movie is not actually directed by Shyamalan, but instead it's a found footage film. So, you can imagine the disaster that follows. Terrible characters, very poorly written, mediocre acting to say the best, almost no soundtrack. I will not waste more time on this review and you should not waste your time watching this movie. Bottom line, the man is a horrible writer and good director, but you won't find his director skills in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is unrelated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like the site pictureisunrelated.com, this movie is for you. It's the quintessential WTF movie. All the characters are more or less deranged and their actions make no sense at all.I won't linger on the myriad of plot holes and narrative threads left hanging, since other reviewers have said it all. The only comment I wish to add is about the creepy dissonance between the soundtrack and the actions depicted in the movie, for instance upbeat melodic opera playing in background during a bloody murder scene.I guess it's a "homage" to Hitchcock, even though I've never seen one of his movies from start to finish. Pure psychological horror with hinted gore and practically no CGI at all, in the MNS best tradition.The underlying message I seemed to grasp is that the truly scary entities on this planet are not monsters, aliens or supernatural creatures, but human beings themselves.I'd never watch this movie again but I can see how some people might like it for its weird quality.</fullReview>

Worse, this is a complete waste of time and money. I was reluctant to write anything about it at all because simply doing this acknowledges its existence, which is way more than it deserves. But I noticed that some users gave extremely high ratings - which leads me to conclude that there are 3 possible reasons for this: first is the possibility that we were not watching the same movie. Second, maybe they have some ulterior motive, or third,...well I'm sure you can imagine what my third assumption would be...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent story marred by its jiggly-cam found-footage approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Visit" features excellent performances, particularly by the four central characters. The story is not entirely original, but neither is it tediously familiar or shop-worn and M. Night Shyamalan gives it a few fresh twists. The jiggly-cam found-footage approach detracts far more than it adds. Many scenes seem more poorly lit than genuinely spooky. The discussion of film terms takes the audience out of the film and passing the camcorder between brother and sister and occasionally mounting one or more cameras on tripods muddles the dramatic perspective. And we get a lot of missed shots and chatter about setting up shots that doesn't advance the plot. The reveal is so heavily foreshadowed that it seems anticlimactic when it arrives. There is very little conflict or sibling rivalry between the brother and sister, which limits opportunities for growth and development of theme. At ninety-four minutes, it seems a bit slow at times and not fully developed. MNS could have kept the documentary and Skype angles, but eliminated the found footage and jiggly-cam shots and probably trimmed the film to about eighty minutes. He could have then added about twenty minutes after the reveal and really ratcheted up the suspense, terror and creepiness. Considering the prior sins of the villains, what they do to the children is fairly tame. The family crisis that precipitated the mother's departure turns out to be fairly innocuous. The reconciliation suggested by the old family movies seems unearned. I was disappointed that MNS did not have a cameo. It's a far cry from MNS's best efforts, but a significant improvement over some of his disappointments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two young kids go to spend a weekend with their grandparents at the big house in the middle of nowhere. They've never seen or talked to them before due to a falling out their mother had with them ages ago. As soon as they arrive there the grandparents (especially the grandmother) start acting very strange. Things slowly escalate until their last night there when things get completely out of control.It starts off slow and a little dull which is not a good thing. You start to wonder why the kids don't get out of there the instant their grandparents start acting strange. There's a few good jump scares though. However all of this is forgiven during the last half hour which gets violent and more than a little scary. Also good acting helps a lot by a cast or relative unknowns. It also has a twist that I didn't see coming. So just be patient with the slow beginning because the payoff at the end is worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved Ed Oxenbould rap spits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might not like this. Nah, you might not. For one, it is a found footage film-so also is Paranormal Activity: the ghost dimension and Project Almanac: films which came out last year. It is another entry that helps in bolstering the saturation of the found footage format. Furthermore, "The Visit" is about wannabee film maker Becca and her junior brother Tyler and the week they spent at Ma and Pa's house. So, for over an hour we get to see how they boringly take the camera up and down in a farm house-from the underbelly of a barnyard to the basement. And unfortunately, is jam-packed with brother-sister squabbles and arguments.But director M Night Shayalaman seems to have found strength in his directorial abilities using this small scale production film as a trigger. Truthfully, it is quite hard to classify this as horror because it gets past all that goo, bloodshed, and logical explanation of supernatural reasons for present circumstances. Though it has traces and appearances of the above elements here and there intertwined with criminal predisposition. It is eerie, but not downright scary or unwatchable due to horrific detailing. It has no major jump scares, but is boastfully unsettling.The lengths at which M Night Shyalaman goes to make sure that the hand held cameras are in the right places is not conspicuous as first. Not until you see a character: the aspiring film maker Becca interviewing another character, before the camera pans back to her and then you ask yourself, "what of the second camera?". Then, you realise that it has been there all along. Films like this is what we try to envision in our minds how the director goes about calling the shots: "Action" and "Cuts". Looking at it from another perspective, M Night Shyalaman is the secondary director, while the character Becca takes up the primary responsibility because of the specifics involved to make it look real and seem as if a bunch of kids are toying around with a newly acquired camcorder.There is this particular scene where something like pap falls on Becca's laptop and coats her laptop's webcam. She tries several times to remove it, but it doesn't or that particular scene where Tyler complains of an unseen stain in his hand, which he tries to remove incessantly without success. These scenes come before the screaming-around third act, but what fascinates is how they interestingly imply what is to come. And then in the next scene, things move back to normal. Sort of!Deanna Dunagan and Peter Macrobbie play Nana and Pop pop with so much innocence and naturalness that it is hard to fancy them as the villains (not sure if that is the right word). But when their scheming begins, you begin to pray that those moments are in split seconds rather than the allotted 15 minutes where they torture the kids. Prior to this, the build up is slow, sharp and doesn't say it directly to your face: "this is what is going to be". An example is when Nana interrupts the hide and seek game of the kids in a devilish weird way-underneath the foundation of a building. That scene stood out! Or is it that time where Nana asks Becca to go and clean pot-bellied oven capable of swallowing her and then it comes to our mind that she might probably close it before going for Tyler. Surprisingly, she doesn't. At the beginning of the final act, she asks Becca for the same favour and closes it. But at that point where we might say "I knew this would happen" in our minds, Nana opens it again. Brilliant!But "The Visit" falls for the courageousness trick: forgetting that there is a thin line between bravery and stupidity. I wondered why those kids wasted time in taking to their heels after being told by mum that "Those are not your grandparents". More so, it is silly because they had already gotten to the door before evil pop pop closes it due to a second hesitation. Silly! Clichéd also! However, it's not as if the film takes an A+ grade in being novel because it culls little elements from the Paranormal Activity franchise, but in scenarios that convincingly confirms why it should rather than on- the-nose incorporation."The Visit" pretends it is going to be dark, but it isn't. There are still related-to-plot character on screen presentations you are going to enjoy and not squeal at. Ed Oxenbould rap inspirations for example. In spite of his misogynist end to rap rhymes that ends with "Ho" and "Bitches", there is something about this kid that tells you he is going to have a successful rap career in the vein of Eminem assuming for once he is the owner of those rhymes. The swag, expression and passion he displays while spitting verses is worth sitting back and enjoying. I'd pay for that-anytime, anyday. Even in the end, before the end credits when it becomes all tears and hugs, he goes out with a bang insisting he raps before the film finally ends. Then of course, we know he isn't joking when he says "Shit doesn't taste like chicken". I replayed that scene twice before writing this review. I am probably going to watch it again after writing this review. Ed Oxenbould stands out as Tyler with his rap scenes.It might be too early to say that the dark days of M Night Shayalaman's career are gone after stinkers like (The Last Air bender) and (After Earth), but this is a return to form for the director giving us a film that coerces us to constantly predicts outcomes which never happens. For most of it anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan goes back to the very basics in this pretty good little horror flick. It is found footage, and bears the same flaws as all of those movies (at a certain point, you know, just put down the damn camera), but, for the most part, it works. Two teenagers (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) visit their mother's long-estranged parents for a week long visit. The grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are very strange people, especially at night, when Grandma (ftr, I refuse to ever use designations like "Nana" and "Pop Pop" in any context, even if that's what the kids in the movie call them) is prone to denuding, crawling around on all fours, and wielding knives. Grandpa just throws his dirty diapers in the shed and occasionally puts a shotgun in his mouth. "I'm just cleaning it!" he shouts nervously as DeJonge catches him. Kathryn Hahn also co-stars as the mother, who talks with her kids on Skype throughout the film. The two kids are decent actors (though I could really do without Oxenbould's rapping) and the two older actors are delightfully unhinged. The tension builds nicely and there are a couple of good scares. The humor mostly works, though the dramatic arcs of the children don't come off perfectly. Worth a look if you're a horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't the best movie that left me trembling, but it was pretty good. At least in the top 10 "horror" movies of 2015. (Emphasis on those quotation marks!) I watch horror movies a lot and usually I can tell when a twist is coming. But the twist at the end got me for once. I don't know, maybe I was tired or something. One thing that really annoys me though, is that it seems production companies do not understand genres. There was absolutely nothing horror about this movie. A little weird and creepy, but no horror. It would fit under thriller or mystery and suspense. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER BEGINS HERE: Seriously, I was hoping the grandmother would be possessed or something. That's what I kept thinking was gonna happen. But nope, she's just really sick and a psycho murderer with her husband. I laughed a lot more in this movie rather than being scared. Like when the grandfather attacked a guy across the street, who was looking at his phone, because he thought the kid was looking at him. That was great! And when he put the shitty diaper on the main boy's head, I about died. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ENDS HERE.Overall, I'll keep it in a neutral place in the middle. It was a good movie with some creepy and funny aspects. But if you want a horror movie, this isn't the one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit (2015) *** (out of 4) To give their mother a needed break, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) agree to go stay the week with their grandparents (Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie). Their mother hasn't seen her parents in fifteen years so Becca plans on documenting the visit so that she can bring both sides together but it doesn't take long for the kids to realize something isn't right with their grandparents.THE VISIT is M. Night Shyamalan's "comeback" and for the most part it's an entertaining movie, although it certainly falls short of THE SIXTH SENSE or SIGNS. But, with that said, it's also much better than just about anything else that he's done. It's rather funny when you consider how popular the director got and how badly he came crashing down after a couple flops yet people were able to walk into THE VISIT and know what to expect. The entire movie is going to be depending on the twist.Naturally, I'm not going to ruin what that twist is but I'm going to say that it did throw me and it was something very good. The entire movie is pretty much just a build-up for you finding out what the twist is. I think the film's story is certainly its strength as it takes a simple set-up (going to stay with grandparents), which to many kids is a scary thing. I liked how the kids not understanding old people worked into the story and I thought this really paid off. The film contains some creepy moments throughout and the mystery is strong enough to keep you glued to the picture.The performances are another plus with all four leads doing a very good job and especially Dunagan and McRobbie in the role of the grandparents. The film does contain some flaws including how annoying the two teens are at times. I "think" this was done just to show realistic teenagers but it still didn't make it easy sitting with them at times. And don't get me started on the rap, which I'm sure was meant as some comic relief.THE VISIT isn't a masterpiece but it's a good little mystery that works and hopefully gets the director back into another strong period.</fullReview>

I know by now that you will always have the eternal unsatisfied. People that think they can do everything better then everybody. They are just losers to me, much blablabla about nothing really. So I gave The Visit a shot and of course I liked it. It might not be a scary horror movie nor a slasher with a lot of blood but it for sure kept me entertained until the end. A nice thriller to watch on a rainy evening. The story was good even though I figured it out in the middle of the movie but that doesn't matter it was still good. Normally I don't really like most of the kids acting but to me the best actor in The Visit was the youngest one. I thought Ed Oxenbould was very believable in his role. So don't listen to the haters because complaining is all they have in their sorry little life. Good entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good elements, but overall not enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was an interesting experience. It had elements that I really enjoyed and reminded me of a better time for Shyamalan. But overall this movie was a discombobulated mess that didn't come out, at all, like the film M. Night probably wanted.Let's start with good. The twist is done really well. I might even argue that it's the best in any Shyamalan film to date. The reason for this isn't necessarily because the actual twist is good either, it's more so because the film tricks you. The twist, in fact, isn't really that hard to predict, but the way it's done is fantastic. The film does this by setting up several other possible twists that are all very well done. Some of these possible twists are really silly and might not seem to make any sense. However, Shyamalan's awful track record actually works to his advantage in this film. This is because while some of the possible twists are stupid and impossible, Shyamalan has done things in film in the past that are stupid and impossible. This ironically makes these false twist, all the more plausible.Another positive factor in this movie is the character quirks. What I mean by this is the kids both have small quirks in their personalities that come into play later in the film. I really loved this element in Signs, another Shyamalan film, and I'm glad they incorporated it in this one. The quirk, as it did in Signs, also comes into play at the end, and supplies honestly one the greatest gross out moments in movie history, in my opinion.But now let's talk about the bad. The writing, for starters, isn't organic. It just sounds too "moviesque" it's just not how real people talk. Granted it's not necessarily awful, I do like how the girl is pretentious, because it makes perfect sense for a teenage girl, film maker to act in such a way. But at the same time while it makes sense, it's still really annoying.This movie isn't funny, plain and simple. Besides one hilarious line during a "Yahtzee" scene, this movie failed to make me laugh at all. The rapping sequences made me cringe, a trope that dates this movie to an insane extent.Speaking of the rapping scenes, the boy is so annoying in this movie. His character is stupid as hell, which only shows to Shyamalan's complete lack of understanding to kids (As seen in After Earth, Avatar, etc). But at the same time, they try to make him "deep" by giving him some stupid back story about a football game. There's a scene in particular at the end in which he has a burst of outrageous anger, it's hilariously bad. It isn't hinted at whatsoever throughout the movie and it just comes out of nowhere. But the worst factor of this movie, for me, is also the most important aspect of any horror movie, the scares. This movie isn't scary at all, it's almost insulting. Ninety percent of the scares are horribly telegraphed jump scares that couldn't scare any sensible person. Some of them even let you know, it almost seems on purpose, of when they're about to happen. For example, there's a scene where the grandma is running about the house. She runs in frame, then out of frame a few seconds later. Then the same thing happens again. Then again, all at the same time interval. Then suddenly, they try to scare the audience with a jump scare at the same time interval! It would be truly remarkable for any human being to be frightened by this scene, or the movie in general for that matter.In conclusion, not worth the watch. This movie just overall wanted enjoyable and really made me hate the found footage genre even more, which I didn't think was possible. M. Night Shyamalan should probably just stop making movies altogether by now and I can't understand how this guy keeps getting work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit is a welcome return to Shyamalan, even though it's boring at times and kills the creep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit (2015)Cast: Ed Oxdenbould, Peter McRobbie, DeAnna Dunnagan, and Olivia DeJongeDirector: M. Night ShyamalanProduced: Blumhouse ProductionsRated: PG-13Oh my! M. Night Shyamalan is finally back after making few movies while being drunk. JEEZE, that grandma is scary. The Visit, is the director of Critically Acclaimed "Sixth Sense", which was really the only blockbuster hit. After giving out a back to back sci-if duds, Shyamalan has finally returned back to his thriller territory with this movie. This movie is a normal thriller, but it's done right.Becca(Olivia DeJonge) and younger brother Tyler(Ed Oxdenbould), leave to see the grandparents they have never seen. They head deep into Pensylvania, greeted by their Nana and PopPop and as a series of events follow, they wonder if they'll ever leave. First off, all the characters are very well developed. This movie is very lightweight, and all the performances are very well done. Ed Oxdenbould is funny and lightens up the mood at times, but he also has these few irritating humorless moments that really kills the spook. This movie also has a fair share of eerie and creepiness.This being M. Night Shyamalan's first low-budget movie, it's executed very well. All the performances are stout and the dialogue is fitting even though you do feel that humor isn't needed at some point. In the movie, there are some scenes when you will get irritated by the humor. You get the feeling that the humor killed the scariness, and that essentially it is a poor dialogue driven thriller- comedy. The creepiness and humor goes on and off at wrong places at the wrong time. Also, the movie is very repetitive at times and the screenplay slows. The screenplay slows down in the beginning and bores you. Many scenes are repetitive, but that's OK, because it's make sense. Towards the end, the best part of this movie is that you really care for the characters. You worry and carry a connection with them throughout the movie. The characters develop this special bond with family and each other that you really care for.This movie has definitely accomplished characterization Truthfully, this is also more of a survival movie too, and is very gripping. Overall, this movie is a nicely done thriller comedy. Do not use your brains. There are some negatives, but you can overlook them. Grab your popcorn and catch it before it runs out. Very well done, Shyamalan, continue this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really what you may expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is interesting but there is no comparison with other movies from the production (sixth sense, paranormal etc). When you see a movie that suppose to compile live scenes of an incident but you constantly find things that make your confuse how live this is, then you get confuse and your attention is trapped to detect how well these "live" scenes have recorded. Once the director fails to put you in the "true story" plot even you know that this is a movie, it fails to convince you that this is a good movie. Blank points in the plot are adding confusion to the viewer making it hard to enjoy a horror movie. On the other hand, the movie keeps pretty good creepy standards and has some scary moments. The actors made a fair effort for their roles and the direction gave good ambiance to the total work. Nothing more to add for mediocre movie. I wouldn't recommend this as a must seen but rather as a Sunday evening loss of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan getting back on track with a lower budget film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Would you mind getting inside the oven to clean it?"I've always been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work despite his recent strikes, so The Visit was one of my most anticipated films for this year. I had stayed away from the trailers because I wanted to experience it as fresh as possible. Shyamalan has directed some of my favorite movies (The Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable) and I even defended The Happening because I found it to be rather hilarious and it worked for me. The Visit has a similar approach in that it balances out the horror aspects of the film with the comedy (some may argue that in The Happening he never intended it to be a comedy but I disagree) although I wouldn't say it works as well. There are many funny scenes and a few jump scares that work, but overall the film doesn't seem to do much more than entertain. This is Shyamalan's lowest budget studio feature film and I think this is the kind of films he needs to be directing (staying away from big Hollywood productions like After Earth or The Last Airbender). Shyamalan has always worked best when he is contained and his films center on a few characters enclosed in a small space. In that way The Visit is a return to form for this talented director, who I've never questioned in the past. His decision to make this a found footage film also does wonders for the film, and I usually don't tend to be a fan of such a style. Everything is executed really well in The Visit and I was so enticed in the story that I was never really trying to discover what the twist would be at the end so when the revelation came I was pleasantly surprised. It probably wouldn't be too hard to figure out the twist if you were trying to search for it from the first minute, but if like me you simply let yourself enjoy the narrative then you will be pleased with the result. My problem with the film actually has to do with the final execution of the climax once the twist has been revealed. I wasn't a fan of the ending and that ultimately brought my score down a bit, but I still had a fun time with the movie.There is a perfectly believable reason why the film is shot in found footage style. Becca (Olivia DeJonge) wants to document her visit to her grandparents house and she gets her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) to help in the process. She is a film fanatic and knows her way around the camera despite her young age. The reason she wants to document the visit is because her mother hasn't been in contact with them since she ran away from home as a teen. Becca believes she can heal the wounds between her mother (Kathryn Hahn) and her parents if she documents their story. The film takes its time to introduce each character before the grandkids head to meet their grandfathers for the first time. Tyler is very charismatic and loves to rap, while Becca is more of a quiet and studious girl. Their mother has been dealing with depression after her husband abandoned her, but is currently dating someone. After her parents reached out to her via email they ask if she could send the kids to spend a week with them so they can meet. Becca and Tyler both convince their mom to send them to their place, but once they arrive they discover that their grandparents seem to be hiding a secret of their own. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) seems to act in a very strange way once night falls and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) seems to have some issues of his own as he secretly comes in and out of the shed near the home. Of course this awakens the kids' curiosity and strange things ensue. Much of why I felt this film worked for me had to do with the cast. Ed Oxenbould, who I really wasn't a fan of in Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, gets to shine in this film. He carries the film for me and delivers much of the needed charm. The comedy is what works best in the film since there are really few scares, although I must admit that I did jump up from my seat a couple of times. Oxenbould was responsible for most of the funny scenes and I don't think this film could work for anyone if they find his character annoying. DeJonge as the older sister also delivers and is believable in her role although she doesn't seem to stay out. Deanna Dunagan is the creepiest of the grandparents and she delivers in some rather scary and tense moments. Even though I wasn't blown away by Peter McRobbie's performance he is responsible for the funniest scene in the movie which involved him being caught on tape with a shotgun to his mouth and after he immediately realizes it he claims to be cleaning out the gun. These moments of humor are what work best in the film and Oxenbould really delivers in that department with his sharp and witty commentaries. This might not be one of Shyamalan's best films, but it definitely is an improvement over his recent films. I was really enjoying this film up to the final five minutes where the comedy is pushed aside to build the climactic ending. Other than that I really enjoyed this film and I will continue to look forward to what Shyamalan will be doing next. He seems to be getting back on track and doing what he does best. Here he gets to tackle some of our fears involving old age and health and plays with them in a very inventive way. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it may not be the best movie that has ever been filmed, The Visit was quite enjoyable. I am usually not a fan of found footage movies, but I thought this one was actually watchable.I have seen many criticizing comments for this movie. And some make good points. However, personally, I found The Visit quite suspenseful while watching and looking for clues as to what is actually going on. Many movies nowadays tend to bore me with their unoriginal plots. This one was original at least and I think it deserves credit for it. Also I found the acting very good. Child actors are imho a dangerous element in movies, because they have a hard time acting realistically. These two however surprised me. They did a very good job. As did the other actors (especially Deanna Dunagan). The acting also deserves credit.(excuse any errors, I am not a native speaker)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit was intense. Not only did it permanently scar me for life, but it made me laugh too. The Visit was about a brother and sister who go to stay with their grandparents for a week, whom they never met. First mistake right there. As the week progresses, the siblings start to realize that their grandparents are a bit crazy, psychotic, lets not forget, creepy. The siblings were supposed to stay another night, but they realized that getting their mom to pick them up might be a better idea. So, when on Skype with the mom, she asks if the grandparents are there and being the kids they are, put their laptop up to the window to show that they were right outside. Now, me, thinking finally a scary movie with people who actually have brains, did not realize that a plot twist was actually going to show up, but it did. The kids were not staying with their actual grandparents, just two insane asylum escapees that decided to pretend to be their grandparents. No, I wasn't ready for that. I think that it was a good movie, but it wasn't as good as it was all hyped up to be, but I still see the grandmother crawling around in my sleep. Am I traumatized? maybe.</fullReview>

Well, I won't be suckered again.Terribly unbelievable dialogue and direction makes what would make a great episode of the Twilight Zone into an hour and a half of wasted energy. M.

None are high profile save Shyamalan. It's kind of funny to think that even after the last few movies of his bombed, what got me interested is that the first few seconds of the film already tells you it is a Shyamalan film.

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan, in-the-know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is perhaps not another director of the last 20 years that breeds viewer expectations like M. Night Shyamalan. That is not to say that there is an expectation of excellence, just some pre- conceived notion movie watchers bring into the theater with them. I can only imagine what the general public made of the previews for his latest picture, The Visit. Found footage is a new venture for Shyamalan, but audiences have had their patience tested to the breaking point with each dry heave of a Paranormal Activity sequel (Don't worry, your likely to see a preview for the latest PA installment should you see The Visit.) What I was immediately curious about was how "In the Know" would Shyamalan be with this style? The ambiguity of what the pre-views revealed has the makings of a real horror, a comedy, and a spoof. So, what is it? I walked out of that movie less than a day ago and I still don't know; but that did not stop me from enjoying every moment of it. Becca and Tyler are a brother and sister duo that could only exist on paper. They bicker like they're in the pages of a Seinfeld re- run. Their vocabulary is years past what could be reasonably be expected of them. While this should clash with the "realistic" nature of found footage filming, it acts as a wink to the audience of what the movie is not. Becca is an ambitious 15-year-old with a knowledge of filmmaking that would likely surpass Shyamalan's while filming The Sixth Sense. She is presented with an opportunity to put her skills to use and learn about her family when her estranged grandparents make an offer to set aside the differences they have with their newly divorced daughter, and get to know their grandchildren. Becca will bring her ridiculous amount of production gear to the grandparents' house for a week-long visit. The documentary she films is, of course, our film. Her seemingly innocent and average Nana and Pop-Pop begin to unravel almost immediately. All the cliché events of this style of movie creep in one by one. What's in the shed? What was that thing that flashed across the screen? Why can't we come out of our rooms after 9:30? Every suspicious event gets some reassuring answer. You kids have watched too many movies. These occurrences go beyond suspicious into absurd. It is during these moments you find yourself thinking, "Have I ever laughed while being this legitimately scared? Is this funnier than it is scary? What's the difference?" That it achieves success in both of these qualities shows that Shyamalan is past "The Know" and in fact knows better than most. I can't say that you should leave all of your pre-conceived notions of the director at the door. In fact this is very much a Shyamalan flick. That you get to the end of this movie, with all of the disappointments of the last decade, with an exhale of relief that the man has still got it, is quite satisfying indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Visit' is a horror film that was directed by M. Night Shyamalan and premiered to the general public on the September 11th, 2015. The movie is 94 minutes long and stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn Hahn. Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are readying themselves for a week long stay with their estranged grandparents John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan) who they have never met before. They are doing this trip while their mother (Kathryn Hahn) goes on a cruise with her newly found boyfriend. Throughout the week, they notice various things that seem to be wrong with their grandparents. At first they assume the 9PM curfew is just because they are staying with old people. However, they quickly realize that there is something strange happening to Doris. During the first few days of the week they hear scratching and other various loud noises that start to ring alarm bells for Rebecca and Tyler. Later on in the week they try to investigate these weird things by leaving the room and filming the rest of the house after curfew. Through the filming and investigation they quickly realized that both grandparents were beyond mentally unstable. After a week of things like grandma telling them to get into the oven to clean it and a near suicide attempt by grandpa when he was "cleaning" his gun; they figured out that something was seriously wrong. At the end of the week the weird and scary occurrences got worse. In the closing scenes when they are skyping with mom she sees the grandparents and comes to the frightening conclusion that the people they have been staying with are not their grandparents. Who could of seen that coming!? Overall the movie was mediocre at best. M. Night Shyamalan in his career has produced some really good and inventive horror films. Unfortunately you always felt that this film was going to be a bit lackluster. This is proof that possessing a great idea and decent storyline still requires the proper execution. The film had you waiting and lead you up to what seemed like a huge shocking end but it was far from that. Once the viewer finds out that they are not the real grandparents, you expect the movie to take a dark turn and really take off. However once you find out, the movie seems to loose momentum and stutter across the finish line. Aside from that, the characters played their roles well and the remote setting of the film was wonderful. The remote setting really added to the creepiness of the grandparents and the town they lived in. Also, considering how young or old most of the actors/actresses were they did a really good job. Additionally the music played it's part and certainly added an eeriness to the film. Minor details like the clothing were done very well also, this added some good realistic elements to the movie even though they were simple details. All in all the movie was decent, but lacked critical elements towards the end to make it a really thrilling horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously Interesting, A visit to the "6th Sense", "The Visit" Critic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! That was crazy. I have been used to seeing interesting and unique ideas, especially twisted ending parts from Night Shyamalan since I have watched the "6th Sense". However, the Visit almost made me feel like I was watching the 6th Sense's some parts again.The Genre of the "6th Sense" was pure Thriller. I must admit that all terrific, horrific, thrilling genres have been seemed like copies of each other, as they couldn't have gone beyond the stereotype "Horror Films" on my eyes. Even the 6th sense was not a horror in an exact way, it made me startle with its sudden horrific scenes. The cold and creepy depiction of the thrillers, take Shyamalan one step forward all the time. And in "The Visit", I felt nearly creeped out as much as the 6th Sense. The movie is ridiculous yes, if you don't go deep to Shyamalan's narrative world while watching it, you will probably watch it as a child's play. But for the reason I mentioned before, (that contextual reading of Shyamalan films) you will love this ridiculousness as film goes by and comes to the climax while reaching the final.I gave the "6th Sense" example of Shyamalan because, my feeling was almost the same in the "6th sense". For instance, the "6th Sense" goes on a straight line, in a narration of a boy and his relationship with his psychiatrist. The boy sees dead people and his mother is worried about him. And she tries to heal his psychology with an expert psychologue (We think). The movie keeps us thrilled and wondered about the kids situation, with hoping to see that he's accepted by his mother with the proof of his sanity and relief of the exposing his sights are for real.Then suddenly, we leave the classic narration on the climax and say: Oh My GOD! And bingo. My all time favorite's analogical version appeared, on the screen just after I saw the similar climax in The Visit and flashed the "6th Sense" on my eyes.The camera angles were good. In my opinion, the pastiche of the amateur camera shootings was better and more effective than other paranormal movies or documentary type pastiched movies. The teenager enthusiasm of shooting his/her first documentary movie, depicted perfectly by Shyamalan as brother and sister use the camera both within a try of imitating the professionals and, by the way, forgetting that they are shooting a documentary occasionally and making the camera a part of their chaffing and playings. This idea of the amateur camera shooting was one of the best I have ever seen including the most realistic and natural one "The Blair Witch Project." Shyamalan loves to show kids or teens enthusiasm of shooting a film or their camera setting in order to catch real time thrilling proofs, with their researcher and curious identities. He used this phenomenon again such as we watched Haley Joel Osmond's discovery of the videotape, showing a young girl's dying process chronologically. Usually, the creepy video footages discovered by children phenomenon we see in Shyamalan's works, is just like a sign of him, maybe because of his childhood memories including his curious shootings while imagining to be a director.The insignificant Genre made me confused a little bit. The emotional instability of the characters can make you nervy. The Visit contains the childish humor and all of a sudden it becomes as a serial killer story with all apart from the previous scene's absurdness. And one second later It may turn into a family drama. For this reason of Pastiche of various genres and eclectism complexity, I have begun my sentences with mentioning its ridiculous charm and interesting context. If you like Shyamalan's significant marks of eclectism, ( I believe that because of he's Indian, he has the spirit of the great complex and intriguing Bollywood movie directors) I recommend to you to watch "The Visit."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad as you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2002, Newsweek Magazine declared M. Night Shyamalan to be the next Steven Spielberg. The director had "The Sixth Sense" (1999) and "Unbreakable" (2000) under his belt and had just released "Signs" (2002), all of which still make up the best work in his filmography. However, being in the present allows for a hearty chuckle at such a statement, given the fact that Shyamalan has done nothing but produce absolute garbage for the last decade. His most recent crimes include "The Last Airbender" (2010) and "After Earth" (2013), two films that would have immediately ended any other director's career. But somehow Shyamalan managed to stay in the business, utilizing what must be some sort of unholy endurance that rendered him invincible to the soul- crushing failures of his past, and so I found myself with a ticket for "The Visit", a found-footage horror flick that I was sure would make my stomach churn. But, against all odds and possible predictions, my stomach went unharmed. In fact, I actually had a pretty good time. "The Visit" proved to be the best film from Shyamalan in years as it put the director's creativity in a position to be appreciated. The film follows Becca (played by Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (played by Ed Oxenbould), two siblings whose mother (played by Kathryn Hahn) has had a decade- long feud with her parents. The two children decide to visit their grandparents, whom they have never met, to catch up on the lost years and try to get to the bottom of the feud. But after spending a night in the house, Becca and Tyler realize that all is not well with their grandparents and that they might be in deeper than they had anticipated. The first thing that "The Visit" does right is that it doesn't abuse the power of the found-footage medium. Some films, like the entire "Paranormal Activity" franchise, come up with any excuse they can to get a video camera into their protagonist's hands just for the sake of a few jump scares. "The Visit" takes a more intelligent approach. Becca, an aspiring filmmaker, decides to make a documentary out of their visit in order to achieve some sort of closure for their mother. She films the daily lives of Nana (played by Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (played by Peter McRobbie) and interviews the both of them on multiple occasions. So instead of just throwing ten cameras all over the interior of some suburban home, the film provides some intrinsic motivation for Becca and Tyler to constantly walk around with cameras. This allows for another of the film's strengths to come through: its humor. Before seeing the film, the only laughter I could have predicted would be that stemming from the egregious lack of quality that coincides with nearly all of Shyamalan's films, but to my delight, "The Visit" was actually just hilarious.The dynamic between Becca and Tyler is like that of many siblings, full of constant banter and bickering. Becca regularly spouts film jargon that Tyler promptly mocks, and Tyler has a knack for freestyle rap that Becca doesn't always appreciate. This chemistry between brother and sister helped lighten the mood of the whole film, a necessity considering the ridiculousness of the plot. Because the film didn't take itself incredibly seriously, I was able to relax and enjoy the nuances of Shyamalan's work. But that's not to say that "The Visit" isn't frightening, because it is. Nana and Pop Pop come off as senile at first, but the playful forgetfulness that comes with age soon reveals itself to be something much darker. The first night in the house finds Becca going to the kitchen for a late night snack, but before she can get down the stairs, she's interrupted by the sight of her grandmother projectile vomiting onto the floor as she mindlessly wanders the house. As you can imagine, the grandparents' bizarre behavior only escalates from there, and is the real reason "The Visit" remains interesting throughout its entirety. It combines the awkward obliviousness of senility with certain demonic implications that equates to some really well executed scenes. However, in the end, those demonic implications prove to be the film's biggest weakness. As the story progresses, certain conversations and events begin to build an impression of what might be behind Nana and Pop Pop's peculiar behavior, bringing classics like "The Exorcist" (1973) to mind. However, the film never delivers on that front. It never fully explores what was behind the grandparent's madness, which is a shame because the most enjoyable part of the film is the anticipation of the great evil that is surely orchestrating it all. That being said, "The Visit" is surely not Shyamalan's definitive return to quality filmmaking, but it is a good horror movie and is well above the standard he's set for himself over the last decade. Either "The Visit" is a fluke or Shyamalan's on the rise again. Only time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was rated way too high and I felt compelled to give an honest review of the film.The kids were very annoying. They would regularly yell "Poppo" or whatever. Their dialogue was way too pretentious and mature for their age.The whole found footage thing was not necessary. Most of the shots were composed professionally.I didn't understand the comedic aspect of the film at all. The kid was a misogynist rapper and the girl was supposed to be a nerd. There was also a couple bare butts from the Grandma. Only 20% of the movie was horror. It delivered only a few good scares. I kept waiting for it to pick up and be spooky. I had hope during the under the deck chase scene. But was totally let down throughout the rest of the movie. The idea of horror was old people acting bizarre. It was random and not creative.Much of the movie was too dark. Especially the ending scene, where the found footage made us miss most of the action. Overall, a strange, confusing movie. It's worth a watch, but be prepared to be disappointed. I was really looking forward to it based on the trailers. But it ended up being a let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I think people need to face facts that Sixth sense was just a benchmark of a film, it is very unlikely that M.Nights works will ever top that film and I think it unjust to constantly compare everything he has done since to that film! Right...this film, although misguided from the trailers as to concept of the film, I found myself genuinely enjoying it! I wouldn't particularly label this film as a horror, if anything I would say more thriller but nether the less was still an entertaining romp. I feel the reviews on here regarding the two grandchildren being ridiculous characters and and terrible actors is really unfair also, I think they both did a really good job with the scripts they were given. I wouldn't say this film was genre defining or awe inspiring , but that doesn't mean its not a perfectly good popcorn movie. I remember the Happening getting the same negativity at the time of its release and tbh, I enjoyed that too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creepy film definitely worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is the movie that has made me finally get an IMDb account and start reviewing film. I have seen so many 1/10 reviews and statements on here suggesting this film is trash and I find that Ridiculous. While this is no Sixth Sense it is still a step back in the right direction for a very interesting director. I found the story line very intriguing once it got going and was actually very creeped out by some of the eerie scenes. I admit the first 5-10 minutes I thought the child stars were a little annoying, especially the rapping teenage boy lol just no! But as we got into the tale I grew to like the two characters more and started to feel a sense of dread for the predicament they are in. The acting is quality throughout and the two older actors who play the grandparents are legitimately quite scary. I had to stick up for this film as some of the reviews are so extreme. I enjoyed this movie so much more than a lot of others out right now. Also the found footage aspect of this film is good, I normally hate the shaky, blurry found footage movies. I don't care if the camera work being poor is more realistic I like to see what's going on at all times. So if you like M Night's movies aren't stuck up and just want to enjoy a creepy film with a nice twist at the end. I say give it a go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i have always liked shyamalan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i heard the new shyamalan movie was going to be a horror comedy, i was a little down since I have really liked his approaches to the horror and specially his close analysis to family interaction, and sociology in general, for example I do not believe that "the village" was about the creatures at all, it was a deep exploration of the American red fear, and in general all his movies have been amazing for me for that simple reason, he doesn't try to deliberately scare people with the popular way of making you jump in your sit, but tries to make you understand, using horror as an excuse, the way humans think, and what scares us the most of all, in this movie, the excuse is simple, gain the strength to overcome the fears of the past, and using them to overcome an even more difficult situation in present, emotional as it might be, and scary as it might be, a director that can fuse all these elements, in such a scary way, will never be a bad one, and i do consider him a very good indie director...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who said this wasn't a horror film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely do film reviews, but when one does deserve an opinion, whether is overcritisiced or overrated, I always feel I have to give my point of view.The Visit was a film I didn't expect to be one of a kind, or really captivating. Mostly because of Blumhouse Productions' fondness of sick-and-tiring mockumentary and Shyamalan's filming and writing wreckage these years. Both making a horror film could've mean a disaster together. Imagine a very low budget Blumhouse mockumentary with Shyamalan's obsession with lame scripting on those last movies he did.I was very wrong.The Visit has the grittyness of Sinister and Paranormal Activity, but M. Night Shyamalan's famous -and sometime infamous- twists. It's a welcome beginning of I expect a new formula in terms on writing and producing at least. Blumhouse + Shyamalan = explosive horror combo!!!! You even forget it's a mockumentary! That's an achievement! I wonder how much does M Night Shyamalan to do with the whole process, but he seems to take the wheel on this one, and he can still give us goosebumps (heavy ones), he knows how to do it and boy he delivers.God damn it scared me the whole ride! Mostly because Deanna Dunagan 's grandma character. Oh, man... you have to see her to believe me.A good horror movie is not about how gory it is, it's about how scary it can get, and this one is damn scary no matter how comedic it may seem from time to time. Stephen Kings' IT -the miniseries- was comedic too. Comedy sometimes is cynicism. Every little or big horror film has to bring some forced comedy, because makes the horror a lot better, as a counterpart. I didn't hear any complaints about zombie B-movies we all love which have a lot of twisted humor. Sorry to say the fun gags here were not so funny and sometimes were out of place. OK, for the detractors of this film I give you that as a concession, but no less. This movie stills being a horror standout in its own terms. Found myself talking about Stephen King? This one has a less sadic resemblance to his work, but still remind me of him in some passages, mostly on claustrophobic sense of horror (found some tribute to The Shining), and sociopath characters too. This movie also does a mostly well-done tribute to some Japanese classic and its Hollywood threshed horror. Pay no mind on flaws, The Visit is all things put together with good results. Fierce drama, scary horror, spoofed comedy, good acting overall.And I thought this one was not funny at all despite unnecessary comedy and unfunny gags. It really did scare me, and scared me the whole ride.I liked this movie very much. Could be better? There is always room for improvement. I am very optimistic about that.Enjoyable, but after all, the few words I can give you as a conclusion: scary, entertaining and very enjoyable M Night Shyamalan 's film. OH God, love to say this. He is absolutely back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of M. Night's, have been since I was a kid because his "scary" movies have a level of interesting plot that is missing from most. Saying that, this is his second-worst film. Now, considering that of all his films, I only hated The Happening, that doesn't discount this film entirely. In honesty, I loved all his other films. What this film was missing for me was the depth of character I've come to expect from M. Night's films. I didn't feel like I "knew" the two main characters-- the kids. Yes, their insecurities and finer bits of their personalities were touched on, but not truly fleshed out. The twist at the end did shock me. I feel that to fully appreciate the nuances and foreshadowing that Shyamalan does so well in his work that I'll have to watch the movie again. Like I said, it's his second worst movie, but he's only actually made one bad movie in my opinion, so it's not bad, it's just not WOW like his others have been for me. Excited to see him stepping back up into film making! We missed him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary One Scene, Hilarious the Next (6.8/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it is past midnight and I have just arrived home after watching The Visit. For some reason my friends and I decided to watch the latest session of the night, lovely. Anyway this movie is made my the man himself, M. Night Shyamalan, who has made some great films in his career, like The Sixth Sense, as well as the movies we would rather have removed from our memory, like Avatar: The Last Airbender.The movie starts off with our two main characters, played stunningly by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, as they travel to their grandparents for the week even though they have never met them before and their mum hasn't spoken to them in fifteen years. This is where the movie, we aren't even five minutes into the movie by the way, confuses me a little because why would you send your children to a house with your parents whom you ended bad terms with and haven't spoken to them again, anyway without this dumb choice the movie could never have been created. As they go further into the week they realise that their grandparents are not normal, and that their grandma runs around the house after nine thirty like a crazy psycho.Ed I believe is the backbone to this film. One scene is scary as the grandma seems to be possessed as she runs around the house and attempts to break in to the children room, but then the next scene sees Ed making fun of it on video for her sister to record, this is what is great about this film, one scene you want to wet yourself and the next scene you are making fun of the previous scene, and Ed is the main reason for this. Another scene where this is relevant is when Olivia is trapped in a room with the possessed grandma and Ed is stuck in the kitchen with the possessed grandpa. One scene is the girl trying to leave the room as the psycho grandma runs underneath the bed and around the whole room, and the next scene you have the grandpa throwing his own fees at Ed, like this is the greatest transition in the entire film, excellent.*SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT* The great twist this movie shows is on the last day the mother realises that the kids have been staying with two psychos and not her actual parents, the psychos killed the grandparents and had them trapped inside the basement the entire time. This twist sent my heart right down to my stomach and I knew from that moment that the last twenty minutes of the film would be intense af. The ending isn't that great as they are able to escape to the cops out the front and their mum waiting for them, they couldn't have come two minutes earlier to help them out in there? And how aren't these kids traumatised after this experience, I mean two scenes later the kid is rapping and joking about the situation, which is entirely what the movie sets out to do, scare you a little bit and then make fun of you for being scared.Overall the movie was good with the scene organisation, the grandparents were played great and Ed was the real reason this movie succeeds, without him this movie would be worse then After Earth. Some aspects of the movie could have been done more cleanly, like blue duct tape was used on the cameras to cover up the canon logos, please put more effort in oh my god. This movie made me scream for a solid four seconds in which the whole theater proceeded to stare at me for a bit, but at the same time made me laugh more than some of the comedies that came out this year.That being said I give this movie a 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Back To Form?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor/Vague SpoilersAfter a long string of "failures", both in the eyes of critics and audiences, M. Night Shyamalan is back with found footage horror comedy "The Visit". Found footage has usually turned me off wanting to watch a film but this time it was bearable even though it had me questioning whether a little girl can create better film angles than a child Hitchcock probably could've, I just dismissed it. Essentially, the film is about two siblings, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler Jamison (Ed Oxenbould), visiting their grandparents who they have never met before due to their mother, played by Kathryn Hahn, being estranged from her parents and her daughter, Becca, is creating a documentary about this first encounter.Going into this movie I had heard people loving, hating it, and everything in between so I went and saw it to decide for myself. After it finished I would say that I would be somewhere in the middle leaning slightly more towards liking it. The comedy aspect in this film is something I wasn't expecting at all. Oxenbould, probably most famous in Australia for his role in Puberty Blues, was the star and it was due to him bringing the comedic aspect of this movie. Knowing he was an Australian made it even more impressive because he never let up on his American accent. I can see him going far in the industry in the future especially when comparing him to other child stars today. Olivia, also Australian, put in a great performance as well, she brings the drama side of this movie, especially, in one scene where it was her moment and she made it very real, adding depth to her character as well as the overall story in the small world they were in. Both kids carry this film and if they weren't as great as they were then this movie definitely would've suffered because of it. The two grandparents, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie), were fine in their roles. Dunagan definitely tried her best to be strange/creepy/scary even before the clock ticked past 9:30. Sometimes it came off as forced and there were a few moments where I almost cringed at how obvious they were. Now to speak on the twist that Shyamalan is so famous for putting in his films, I saw it coming from one of the first sentences said in the movie and became more and more obvious and subsequent events happened. Even though I did see it coming I still was able to enjoy some of the other elements in the film. It wasn't a traditional horror film in that there weren't many scenes that actually scared me. Of course there were a few jump scares, which is to be expected with horror films nowadays. Some of them you could see coming but they were still annoying because it just seemed like it was a cheap way to get scares which of course they got from people in the cinema. Not that I was looking for a Halloween type of horror but the scene that I had heard most people talking about from the trailer was the "clean the oven" scene and this almost failed and almost took me out of the movie. Some of the scenes that were well done was when the children would hear sounds outside of their room. This was great as it made us, the audience, has to imagine what the grandmother could possibly be doing and that is the best kind of scare, in my opinion. As soon as the kids opened the door and we saw what was occurring it took away from that feeling and made it almost comical.

There was also a scene under the house which was very, very creepy that caught me totally by surprise. In the end, I wouldn't say this is Shyamalan back to his "Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable", &amp; "Signs" form but it was a nice place to slot in the middle to show the audience that he still has something to show that he has talent as a director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Take On The Found Footage Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched countless found footage films, way more than any one person should, so I have been worn out on the genre for a while (but for some reason I keep watching them). I was intrigued to see what Shyamalan could do with the genre, I have liked the majority of his movies (even the ones people hated on such as The Happening and Lady In The Water).So the thing that stood out to me right away was how obnoxious the brother character was, some of his lines are cringe-worthy and honestly I feel like he completely ruined a few scenes that could have been really good. The sister is fair enough, beside the brother she seems like the most interesting character ever though. The problem with having kid actors in these types of movies is that in horror films you really want the characters to seem like they are actually in danger, with this though their performances weren't convincing and really brought down the overall creepiness of the film. The acting isn't all bad though, both the grandparents were portrayed well and really carried the movie.The story overall is pretty good, but there are some things that really hold it down. A lot of scenes that are suppose to be really serious, emotional, and creepy kind of just came off cheesy. There are definitely some scenes that work well though, there were a few times where the film had me jumping and leaning forward on the edge of my seat. The story mostly hinges on you wanting to find out what is going on, and once you do figure things out it is satisfying enough, not anything overly special but it works."The Visit" isn't a great film, but it is slightly above average. You never feel bored while watching it and there are some genuinely scary scenes. However a few cheesy characters and some laughable moments really stopped this from being Shyamalan's golden comeback, still a decent effort from him though.6/10</fullReview>

Nope, no twist, just a pathetic story line that someone on crack or meth must have come up with. The beginning sucked, the middle sucked, and the end sucked even worse than the beginning...

		<shortDescription>It's everything different than what you thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie starts off introducing the characters as most do but it gives a very good insight into the life of the characters. The characters aren't dull, it really lets you know who they are so you can get that feel of what they really are going through. The movie is definitely a psychological thriller/horror. It has lots of mental issues people can have at an older age included but the way they introduce them and play them out brings it out as if though you are experiencing it yourself with them. There's lots of little hints here and there through the dialog that can foreshadow events, so if you're one those people who pickup on the small details you'll love it. By the end of the movie your head will have gone from "alright this movie was so cliché; into, holy crap what the heck I did not expect that!" If you want a movie that will give you a good scare and have a very thought-out story to it, this one is for you. Also, the scary parts in the early-mid area aren't long but they're definitely good. Later through the movie though they begin to extend into a full out scare-fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a bow, Mr. Shyamalan !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is a director whose career as a director has taken a nosedive with his past few films. Managing to wow us with The Sixth Sense, he quickly rose to stardom. Following that, his next 3 films, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village all seemed well for accomplished director until, The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth rolled around, bombing and turning M. Night's career upside down to the point where society didn't want another M. Night Shyamalan film see the light of day.Then a trailer for The Visit surfaced on TV screens and online. After seeing a preview I had to go see it, so me and a couple of friends went to the movies last weekend and , boy I was in for a thrill! The plot consists of a single mom who sends her two kids with their grandparents for the weekend. Simple right? Not until Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) notice that their grandparents Nana and Pop Pop (played brilliantly by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are a little strange...Props to the director for a different concept while actually being very enjoyable. On that note being a horror movie it has tension, no gore and it has a comedic tone, mostly delivered charismatically by Tyler being the comic relief. You may find yourself horrified in one scene and laughing in the next. Its very well paced, the actors did a great job, and oh just wait for the twist! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't write reviews for titles that have 200 plus reviews already under their belt but I'll make an exception with this one.I miss Shyamalan.I loved "sixth sense" "Unbreakable" and "Signs." I loved that there was a writer/director who came onto the scene and was suddenly unbelievable. I was ready to sit and watch everything he did, I was ready to sit and wait eagerly for the next release. To me he was like a hero.But it all vanished. The village was okay, but not really great in comparison the what went before. Lady in the water, The happening, Devil? For me it just disappeared with disappointment.This though...This is close to what I was wanting.This is great.We're back to really well thought out scenes. We're back to the slow suspense. I'd almost forgot how well Shyamalan worked at directing children, he's great at it and it always stands out.Please do more like this!!</fullReview>

The acting is solid on all parts, though the mom's performance does feel forced at times. In general, I really appreciated the slow build...definitely could have done without the cheap jump scares, though. Even though both my husband and I called the twist before we were halfway in, watching it unfold was still extremely unsettling. I think the kids were especially talented, even if some of their actions were indeed annoying. I walked away from the theater feeling, well, oogy is what I call it. The movie just stuck with me. I am an avid horror fan and I would call this much more of a psychological thriller. Overall, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching A Pair Of Douche-bag Kids For 1hr 30mins Is Not My Idea Of Fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting more from this film, but it's another let-down by writer-director M.K. Shyamalan.Though this guy has made some good films in the past like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, his latest left me in a state of utter disgust. The film is about a single-mom Paula(Kathryn Hahn) sending off her kids Rebecca(Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) to her grandparents home while she goes on vacation. The kids want to record the trip for their mom, so the film is mostly recorded footage from their digicam. The kids chosen for this film do nothing to enhance the film - just your run-of-the-mill little brother and big sister. However the actors that play the grandparents are a bit better, and they produce all the scares in the movie. There is one scene in the film which Shyamalan has stolen from a Brothers Grim fairytale - I wont tell you which one. The setting for the film is some backwoods town in America, where people lead a less hectic lifestyle. The children are very eager to get along with their grandparents in the start of the film, but soon start to be suspicious about their strange behaviour. They are told not leave their bedroom after 9:30 p.m. and to never go near the basement because it contains toxic mold. This film has some pretty disturbing scenes, some of them can be considered perverse and not suitable for family viewing. The film lacks a good background music effects and special-effects are practically non-existent for this film. The overall script for the film is weak and should have been developed more by Shyamalan before he rashly decided that it was time for it to be made into a film.Verdict: a very passable film and I would never care to sit through this one again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Visit" is a damn creepy modern fairy tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quite liked M. Night Shyamalan's "The Visit" (2015); I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It is by no means a perfect movie. But it has all of the elements of Shyamalan's work that I love: it's beautifully shot; it has a fresh, creative story; it's suspenseful; it's atmospheric, and it has well drawn, likable protagonists.I am an unashamed Shyamalan fan. I love all his horror-thriller movies, even the one or two in which I can guess Shyamalan's trademark "twist" in advance. Yes, I even like "The Village" (2004). And I liked "The Happening" (2006) a hell of lot too.This movie indeed has said twist. I thought I guessed what it was in the opening minutes. I was wrong, and when the real twist was revealed, it was pretty damn effective. For a moment, I was as dumbfounded as the characters on screen. This was despite the fact that all the clues had been right there in front of me, and seem obvious in retrospect.And it is scary in places. A scene beneath the house comes first to mind. So does the "oven" bit that we see in the trailer. The cast is uniformly good. The standout was a fantastic performance by Deanna Dunagan as "Nana."A couple of things nudged this movie just slightly left of the "great" category, into the "good but not great" category. For one, I think this could have been a short film, and didn't need more than 40 minutes or an hour to tell its story. The pacing seems to suffer a little because of that. For the first hour, we keep revisiting the same arc in tension: a grandparent behaves strangely, a grandchild queries them, and then the behavior subsides.Character choices are also implausible. These are bright, savvy kids, who are either oblivious to or cavalier about obvious signs of danger. I think any person in real life would be too frightened to remain in the house where "The Visit" takes place. Later, certain things change a little too conveniently after the twist is revealed.The rapid change in tone after the story's conclusion was a little heavy-handed. I thought the story's final minutes were sweet, but maybe a little too much.Still, I'd recommend this. If you can overlook the movie's faults here and there, you'll enjoy a damn creepy modern fairytale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, restrained, and mature in its approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That... was so not what I expected. First off, to address the "handheld-camera" gimmick. The film could've definitely been done without it, but the good thing is that you'd be forgiven for forgetting it's trying to be in the vein of "found footage". So much of the film is composed of establishing shots, and the film isn't really "shaky camera" much at all. And much of that reason is because of how shockingly restrained the film is. It really knows how to build and build with just pure atmosphere. It could've totally chosen to go that route, but it didn't. What's even more shocking is there there's an underlying thematic arc here that has nothing to do with horror. It's rather quite surprising, and points need to be given for its ambition. Certainly not at all what I expected from the trailer, it's a quiet, character-centric, creepy little film that also manages to be quite emotional and gets extra points for having two child actors who at no point were annoying. The two lead characters here are really well-established, and their acting, specifically from the female actress, is quite impressive. Definitely recommend this, what a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I went out and saw this film. After all, I haven't seen any of Shyamalan's other films. Not because I don't want to, I do. But I have been spoiled with several of his twist endings that I was very hesitant to rush to watch any of them. As for The Visit, I wasn't spoiled of anything. Even if I was, I think the film still would have been somewhat entertaining. It's rather simple in its premise. A few kids who have never met their grandparents decide to spend a week out in a reclusive house with them in order to get to know them and to find out more about why their mom abandoned the parents in the first place.The shaky/found footage style of film actually works to this films benefit, much like Chronicle. The kids are out to make a documentary film based on their experience, so that solves that problem. But the filming never becomes distracting or takes away from the actual story. The kids also give surprising formidable performances along with the oh so creepy grandparents. Which is why this film works. Without the performances, the film would just be another low budget horror cash grab. But I think to a certain extent, you care about these characters enough to invest yourself for an hour and a half. Where I think the film fails is that its really not all that scary. It uses the jump scares maybe a tad too much and its just a lot more disturbing than anything. I don't think I ever legitimately feared for the characters. I also found the whole rap gag with the younger brother to be rather silly. I don't think the balance of the comedy-horror worked to its benefit. The film isn't bad, its much better than I expected. There's some entertainment to be had, but not a ton. I just think the film relied on the gross out disturbing elements to try and freak people out rather than doing it more naturally.+Performances+Better than it has a right to be+Creepy at times-Disturbing elements were distracting-Wasn't that scary6.0/10</fullReview>

The kids are off to the grandparents and the mother is off with her new boyfriend. Now this could be an actually harmonic time for everybody, but I got bad news: The writer and director is M. Night Shyamalan. If you know him, you know you will be seeing thriller and horror for the rest of the movie. And the fact that the kids are trying to make a connection between their mother and their grandparents again is the least dramatic thing waiting for you.I know the writer and director has gotten lots of criticism for his recent works, but I always liked him and especially enjoyed his film "Signs". I have not seen the films that received the worst reviews, so I cannot say he is back to greatness for me here, just that this was a really good movie. The actress who plays the mother does not have too many scenes, but she is good when she is on screen. The two actors who play the grandparents are absolutely awesome and the two kids actors do a fine job as well. It certainly shows that they have quite some experience despite their young ages. The first hour of this movie was merely good, but the last half hour was simply great with all the horror, all the chilling aspects and finally the explanation what exactly was going on. I am not saying the first hour was bad, but it just wasn't as good as the last chapter, which also had a touch of "Funny Games" to it. Still it had some pretty good moments (like the Hansel/Gretel reference with the oven) and was filled with suspense too. Also I would like to say it's good they did not push this towards the 110-minute mark, but kept it very essential instead. Nice focus here.This is one of the best 2015 films I have seen so far and a definite contender for best horror movie of the year. The camera plot also adds a lot. I like this kind of movies. Also really love "The Blair Witch Project". Thumbs up for Mr. M. Night Shyamalan. He very much delivered with this one here and I am optimistic about his future. No doubt he still has it. This film is the evidence. Excellent watch and I highly recommend it. Also a great choice for Halloween right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good movie from this producer is the Sixth Sense. After that any movie by M. Night Shyamalan - I just watch to see what a train wreck it is. This movie is probably the worst one as of yet. The preview of the movie looks exciting - like it was sorta Hansel &amp; Gretal type of a movie. IT IS NOT!! It is a BORING nonsense from beginning to the end. How is it that he is still able to produce junk like this? I fell asleep during the movie - that's how exciting this movie is!!!!! Throughout the whole movie, it just talk about how weird the grandparents are. Halfway through the movie, I figured out what was wrong. All in all, not even worth a DVD look. Look elsewhere for a good, suspense movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wildlike is Better than The Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drama, fantasy, comedy - whatever the story genre, good ones have one thing in common. Truth. The story needs to tell the audience of something they know, something they have forgotten or something they can now imagine. Case in point, two films I've recently watched illustrate success and failure clearly. Both involve children being sent away by less than careful parents. I intend to post this review at the site of both films, because the contrast is clear. Wildlike &amp; The Visit both are stories about children being sent away to visit with relatives, mistakenly, by troubled parents. Both are stories about horror, but, where one tells us about evil, the other tells us bad puns. In Wildlike we see a young girl sent away by a defective mother who can't handle taking care of herself or her child. In this movie we walk in this child's shoes and understand the choices she makes. The evil she faces is banal, quiet and could go unnoticed. We see the past and current trauma this child has endured in the acting and writing. The truth is this is everyday evil, the kind that we won't change without understanding it. In the Visit we see a sister and brother sent away by a mother distracted by her own issues. Children know when their parent's are not competent. It affects them and causes doubt and tension. Instead of reflecting that, these siblings are snarky, self involved, smart alecks who are not cautious, vigilant or concerned. The danger these kids face is overt and direct early on, but they seem not to take it serious. Neither can the audience. The truth in a similar film of M. Night Shyamalan's, the Sixth Sense, was not the horror the child faced, that only made the film compelling. The truth was about the adults learning to respect the child's view of reality. there is no such kernel in The Visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Found footage drama about gifted kids with AI cams that follow them around grabbing every amazing perspective on their riveting personalities. These kids are ready for top-shelf Reality TV, so artfully guileless they purport to weave a video project. Despite their traumas they, or someone procuring the rights to their microSDs, manages to capture every terrifying dimension of the unspeakable horrors of the ultimate evil beyond the valley of the crypt of unspeakable coolness. And thus spake Shyamalan.Hey, M. Night, you have such a tragically cool name that when I heard you got your mojo back I was so chomping to go see your latest. And the kids are alright.... But not believable and imperfectly perfect (that is to say, it should be the other way around).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the director-M. Night Whateverman was using two young actors to deflect criticism of the movie-as most people would be reluctant to put the film down knowing that might negatively impact on the careers of the two younger main characters in this movie. This movie blows basically: but not because of the actors-its just that the script is not very good. The director is to blame. M. Night has made a few pretty good films that many people didn't like very much which is unfortunate. I read somewhere that the director had managed to get himself into a six million dollar hole and his film projects were an attempt to rectify that situation. Making films like this probably won't be helping him very much although he might have given a boost to two young actors with this current "offering."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was absolutely nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters the reason this is the best found footage film is because it only gives the illusion of being found footage whilst being filmed professionally. Which is a relief because I'm so tired of these directors making a movie that looks like it was filmed by someone with Parkinson's disease and then calling it "original". The Blair witch project was original; after that it's just a bunch of lazy copycats.Now I am a fan of M. knight and I like his films even the ones people didn't like but this was just...not his style and not his style in a bad way. It just seemed like he was taking the chance to jump on a new trend as opposed to being original and thought provoking like he usually is; a modern Hitchcock if you will. And for most of the movie I was wondering why the trailer was made to look like the grandparents were going to be some sort of creatures when in actuality most of their symptoms were in fact dementia.The only thing I can say is the twist is worth the watch but like most found footage movies there's lame attempts at humor(like every stranger saying "I used to be an actor" just because she has a camera) mixed with actual humor. The cast is great and the direction too but just not his style at all. Now the twist is not that great but there is one. All and all I can say I'm glad I had a gift card and didn't actually pay to see this. This was just okay nothing special and certainly not for an M. Knight film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far the most obnoxious piece of garbage I have seen this year. I went into this movie blind, so therefore had no expectations of it being good or bad. By the end, I genuinely wanted to be blind because to experience visual nothingness is better than sitting through M. Night Shyamalan's new flick "The Visit" ever again. Let's address the elephant in the room first, the director. We all know its common place in the world of cinema to not expect much from Shyamalan after his long line of flops since the sixth sense. But, even if this movie was written and directed by someone else I would still come to this exact same conclusion. HOWEVER, after torturing myself, I took to the internet to then read a few reviews of what others thought of the movie and to my surprise it's been getting quite a lot of praise. Now, this praise is all false. Nope, believe me everything you have read so far from others giving this movie genuine "Praise" has all been bull. Let me break it down. So far, every review I have read has stated that this is the comeback of Shyamalan but a comeback from what? Avatar? After Earth? Signs? The Village? All of which are horrible films and are not so hard to beat in terms of quality. So all of these reviews are just stating that is movie is only slightly better than his last line of flops and we are to praise it just for that alone and not on the movie itself. Hooray guys, he made a movie that just a little bit more watchable than his other ones isn't that great? No. No. No. No. Come on! The Visit is a "found footage" horror also labeled as a comedy which is about two kids being sent to their grandparents (whom they have never met) by their mother as she goes on a cruise ship holiday. The whole experience is shown as a documentary filmed by one of the siblings. Now, film school time, the method of found footage has been abused ever since the success of "the Blair witch project". These films are very cheap to make and can make a load of cash if advertised right so therefore Hollywood will re-use this gimmick forever as it is and always will be a cash cow. This type of cinema is also the most basic ways of shooting a movie and removes a lot of other variables other film makers would take into account like crane shots etc. So by giving M. Night Shyamalan the most basic way to shoot a movie, he therefore can't screw up a lot of things but just because there are less things to screw with doesn't make this movie any better than any of his other movies. I can make a film about a guy walking from point A to point B and the only thing I can really screw up is by not filming the man and filming something completely different like the floor or the sky and stopping the film before he even gets to point B. Just because I had less to screw up doesn't make my movie any good. Everything about this movie was terrible, even the famous Shyamalan twist could be guessed correctly within the first twenty minutes. The characters are mind blazingly bland, unfunny and pretentious. The kids as far as child actors go are pretty good, but that's as far as "child actors" go, everyone else was terrible. Nothing was convincing and every joke was embarrassingly uncomfortable and juvenile making movies like "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" look like a Monty Python classic. Just?.please?.do yourself a favor and never visit "The Visit".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disturbing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this "different" type of horror show.The kids at the beginning were so unceasingly annoying I had to think of a counter-attack. So, I said, "Snotty kids," to myself whenever they turned me on at 1st.It was interesting to see the old lady at night. The old man was usually pretty nice.The only other interesting thing was disturbing, as well, seeing the real grandparents in the chest, dead. There was the lady before that hanging, too.I didn't, of course, "like" some of the "Hollywood" and "other" messages in this, so when the end came and they united with the police and mother, I was happy.So, naturally, the overtone messages weren't put there for me to like, but I didn't have as much a struggle with this as I have in the past. The messages were a bit worse, but I was in a better fighting mood.I grew to like the actors. For instance, the kids were very hopeful about life. I did notice the girl started off looking more Swedish and then looked more German and seemed very attractive in this way. I figured she looked serious usually because she was concentrating on her Swedish part, or whatever it could be.</fullReview>

Although the boy's part I believe was not well cast.At best this is a poorly shot mix of Blair Witch and Paranormal, but both of those films were actually scary and fun to watch.The craziest part is that the first weekend gross was over $25 million.

		<fullReview>I saw the movie at the Fantasy Film Festival in Germany - and I was surprised! Shyamalan is really back! The return to his filmmaking roots was the best he could do.The story is very original and plays with the fear of getting old. Like most of Shyamalan's movies, this one has also an intimate family drama. So it's not only about horror. That's all Shyamalan. And there is also a big twist (don't worry i'm not going to reveal it) ...The acting is great, especially Dunagang and McRobbie. The kid's acting is OK! But I must say that the girl plays better than the boy.On top of that "The Visit" is also a kind of (dark) comedy! That's something completely new, I mean have you seen this before? It's not like the horror comedy "Severance" (Christopher Smith). It's really different! But find it out on your own! I just can recommend the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really??????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot is a muddled mess. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. Kids were anything but interesting, quite boring and flat actually. I have never heard kids talk the way these on screen kids were speaking. In truth, they really were not all that believable as characters. This is in keeping with bad writing, unnatural dialog that simply does not flow. This makes the characters stiff. Both my partner and myself found ourselves asking each other over and over again: "what kid actually talks like this???" Acting was way too over the top. There was very little on screen chemistry and the characters seemed to be falling all over one another. I got the impression most of them were missing their marks, cues or even forgetting their lines. A heck of a lot of pauses that just didn't fit the plot. The ending was rushed as if they had no idea how to create closure on such a horrible film. Scary it ain't. Funny it ain't. Deep it ain't. Worth seeing....it ain't. Personally the best part for me was watching the screen credits roll past. What a relief! Am I the only one who felt this was a stinker? No. Several other movie patrons, got up and left before the ending....and it was cheap ticket night! That's how bad this film is! No one is running in droves to see this film. The theater was like a barren cave with a very deep, deep echo. This within a week of release. Time for Shyamalan to drop the M. replace it with Good as in: Good Night Shyamalan, your reign is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids visiting grandparents they had never met before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking for BluRay movies I had never seen and came across this one on the shelf at my public library. I was curious. Only after I got it home did I realize who the writer-director is.In many respects I have admiration for M. Night Shyamalan and what he is doing, sort of a Woody Allen from Pennsylvania. He comes up with bright ideas and makes his movies. His early work is best, "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" are really fine movies. I especially like "Unbreakable".But to me the rest of his movies are all substandard. They all have interesting concepts, and for the most part well-made, but with very poor scripts. To me Shyamalan is a mediocre hack at script writing and that is what brings this movie down.The core story is this. Single mom had left home 20 years earlier and maintained no contact with her parents. Now she is going on a trip and sending the two kids, a 13-yr-old boy and a 17-yr-old girl, to spend a week with the grandparents. The girl is an aspiring filmmaker so much of the footage we see is supposedly what she shot.To me much of the dialog and story development just didn't ring true, even within a fictional horror movie. When it was over I thought "That was pretty dumb."SPOILERS: The first problem, would a mom send her two kids to meet stranger grandparents with no idea what they look like, not even a photo? So when the "grandparents" begin to act very strangely and refuse to talk about why their daughter had left, it sort of makes sense. But the boy discovering a pile of crapped-in disposable diapers in the barn? Not even in garbage bags? So the conceit of the story is the fake grandparents have escaped from the mental hospital the real grandparents used to work at, killed them, and who knows what they had planned for the two kids. Were they going to lock them in the oven and turn it on? Overall a very poor movie.</fullReview>

It lacks EVERYTHING it would need to be barely interesting, and I have to wonder how anyone could find it in their heart to give it two stars...or any.The only reason I gave it one was because there's no "0" available.

		<fullReview>Review: I'm not usually a big fan of movies in this genre but I thought that I would give this movie a chance, once I saw M. Night Shyamalan's name attached to it. Big Mistake! The first disappointing aspect about this film is that the director used the, played out method, of filming it through a camcorder. It also takes ages to get going and when the two young kids, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), finally work out that there "so-called" grandparents are nuts, the showdown is rushed and not that great. I know that the kids mother, Kathryn Hahn, wasn't talking to her mum, which is why she just sent her kids to there address but I still can't believe that she wouldn't interact with her parents to make sure that her young kids were OK. With that aside, I found the storyline pretty weak and I personally lost interest very early in the movie, due to the annoying narrating from the girl and the terrible rapping from the boy, which seemed pointless. Basically, this isn't the movie to put M. Night Shyamalan back on the map but I'm sure that people, who are fans of this genre, would have enjoyed it. Disappointing!Round-Up: Indian born, M. Night Shyamalan, 45, has built a reputation, which will always make his movies a box office smash but that does not mean that they are any good. His first two movies, Praying With Anger and Wide Awake, wasn't that great but when Sixth Sense was released in 1999, his career really did take off. He then had a string of hits with Unbreakable, Signs, the Village, Lady In The Water and the Happening but his latest movies, the Last Airbender, After Earth and this one, haven't been that great. He's obviously a director who takes his time to release his projects because he has only directed 12 movies in his career but he will always be remembered for his earlier projects which have made him a director who all the big stars want to work with. This movie just seemed like many others in this genre but it still made a hefty profit at the box office, mainly because of his established name.Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $99millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/thrillers starring Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagun, Peter McRobbie, Katryn Hahn and Celia Keenan-Bolger. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It absolutely makes my head ache to think ANYBODY thought this movie was decent, much less good. "The Visit" is M. Night Shyamalan's latest attempt at striking gold once more. He did it in "The Sixth Sense," but every one of his attempts after that have been laughable at best. This one is no exception.Two kids decide to visit their grandparents for the first time in their lives. Seems their mother ran away from home when she was 19 and has not spoken to either of her parents since then. So, what would be a good idea? I know: let's send my children to visit their grandparents-- whom they've NEVER seen--without as much as a picture of them to go by so they'll know they are not being picked up at the train station by psychos.If you cannot figure out what is going on as soon as they get to "grandma's house," then you must be brain dead. "Scary, good jumps, and thrills"--my ass. This is about as ridiculous as it gets--worse than "The Village".Rated PG-13 for old people nudity, language, and (minimal) violence, this is the sole reason I NEVER visit relatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyalamon should retire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was so not worth it. A mom and her two kids, dumped by dad, are barely existing. Mom keeps picking up losers, who keep dumping her. Her fifteen year old daughter wants to be a documentary filmmaker, while her younger son wants to be another eminem. So, to give mom time to enjoy herself with the latest man, the kids offer to go visit grammy and grampy for a week. They get there, and all kinds of odd things happen, culminating in a last-minute rescue. The end.The only thing worth watching in this whole mess were the kids. The boy was pricelessly cute and charming, and very effective as the smarta** that all little brothers become. The girl was serious (maybe a bit too serious) and dedicated. Both kids bore emotional scars from dad's abandonment of them, which colored how they related with their world.While with grammy and grampy, strange things occur overnight. Grammy is found naked, scratching the walls and doors. Or, she runs from room to room, all hunched over with arms clasped behind her back. Or, she lurks outside the kids' bedroom door with a butcher knife in hand. During the day, she's slightly less odd. She crawls around underneath the porch, terrifying the kids who had gone under there to play hide and seek. She sits in a rocking chair, facing a wall and laughing at...nothing.Grampy, on the other hand, is a little more...stable? He hides his crap-filled diapers in a shed. What he's saving them for is anyone's guess. At one point, the girl catches him as he puts the barrel of a shotgun in his mouth. Needless to say, the grandparents have issues. As the week progresses, the kids become more and more panicked and beg their mom to come get them. The 'visit' culminates with grammy trying to kill the girl and getting stabbed with a piece of mirror for her trouble, and grampy terrorizing the boy and rubbing his poo-filled diaper all over the boy's face, because the kid is a germophobe. That scene was relentlessly cruel and unnecessary, as well as repulsive. The girl finally escapes the locked bedroom of dead grammy, only to be attacked by grampy. The boy finally takes charge and batters grampy's head in with the refrigerator door.The movie was a mess. The shocking 'twist' was that they weren't actually the real grammy and grampy. They were nuts who escaped from the nuthouse that the real grammy and grampy had volunteered at. It was as dull, lifeless, and trite as his previous movies, but most especially The Village. Nothing new was explored, and the 'frights' were nonexistent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys, I was ready to hate this movie and by ALL means, it is nothing extraordinary, BUT, it was not half bad. Yes, you read that right. I still have a sour taste in my mouth from Shyamalan sh**ting on my childhood with "The Last Airbender" and the hour and forty minutes wasted watching "After Earth", but that is all a rant by request for another time. "The Visit" was comedic at times and mostly due to the out there antics of the grandparents. It was creepy and un-settling but again, not half bad. The classic Shyamalan twist is present in this movie and, in my opinion, not so predictable but to any non- casual movie-goer, you may be able to catch it before it happens. So the bottom-line: You want a creepy horror movie with a dash of comedy? You have your movie within "The Visit". Will you leave floored and wanting more? No. Will you leave in utter disgust, fighting the box office attendant for a refund? Possibly but not probable. If you are desperate for a time killing movie or a quick date night film, I would give you the go ahead but if you can wait; It will be on Netflix within the next couple months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the tension between the young and old. Very good acting drew me in to the story and set me on the edge of my seat for the next scene.Just enough crazy stuff going on to keep you wondering... pondering the situation.Really like how the main characters, (kids) are able to shine...Fun... wondrous and hugely entertaining isn't that what movies are about!!I think most people over the age of 30 will truly enjoy and follow the story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this truly terrifying 'm knight Shamaylan' thriller, it leaves me on the edge of your seat. I really enjoyed this movie, one of the best m knight Shamaylan films in years, probably his best since unbreakable in my opinion. It was a very enjoyable film with jump scares and some creepy Sequences were involved. I thought the twist that it ended on was brilliant, and definitely did not see it coming. I am a huge movie fan, and like a big variety of films in general, but have never really been a big horror fan, so I wasn't expecting much from it when I started watching it, but no, it was a real treat and very unexpected. I think m knight Shamaylan has his own great style in his films, and I can honestly say this is one of his greatest works over the years. Definitely worth a watch! I think that the actors/actress who played the old couple of grandma and grandpa were perfect, so weird, and mysterious that it left you shaking in your pants whenever you see them on screen in the corner of your eye. It's the sort of movie that would leave you worried about whenever you mother leaves the house and she leaves you with your grandparents to look after you....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two siblings visit their grandparents and soon discover that something is wrong with them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slow-burning, found footage movie that has an interesting plot. I think this style is popular because it gives you a more authentic feel when watching, and helps build up the tension by not revealing too much. In fact, since this style of movie-making is so popular with horror, even a video clip of people driving makes me think of horror movies nowadays. So, wise choice of cinematography Shyamalan. The acting was great, and there are some genuine scares. The Visit feels like Paranormal Activity with old people. It keeps you guessing till the end, and like many of his movies, there is a twist. Now I am waiting for another Shyamalan horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see here the desperate Shyamalan Attempt to get back to his old glory days. But in the last ten years he's not able to reach a decent success. Losing truth with big league actors and production house, so ended up doing movies with teens in his previous 3. So this one as well about two young siblings who goes to meet their grandparents from the rural. After the smooth first day the grandparents' unusual behaviour begin to scare the kids. In an attempt to find the truth, what follows is a twist in the tale.PG13 rated 'found footage' horror-thriller. But the story might be either real or fiction that never explains, because the boy in the movie wanted to do a project. Not that scary except in a couple of scenes. A better story, but the movie was okay type. The entire film revolves around four characters, but the two kids led from the front with their excellent act. It faired well at the box office, but honestly, I was slightly disappointed with everything from it.Shyamalan is better than this, but he had a few chances to prove it that did not work out well as everyone expected. It's only a matter of time to give an unexpected hit and turnover in his career, that's what I'm looking for, but looks like not any time soon. I think this film was better than his recent ones that delivers within its limit, so I consider it is a one time watch film and nothing else.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two young siblings go to visit their grandparents (to whom their mother has not spoken in many years) at a remote house in the country, which is quickly snowed-in, isolating them, and sealing them in. The film has a good atmosphere, I'm a sucker for a story about a group of people trapped by a snowstorm, and the movie has a few good scares to it. As the older of the two, Olivia DeJonge was quite good, and the final twist was good, but completely implausible, and the film goes on two scenes too long. It also can't decide if it wants to be a thriller or comedy, and it touches on supernatural themes at times too, which don't really work with the rest of the plot.The film plays out partly as a found footage movie, but it worked that into the plot well, as we learn Olivia DeJonge's character is an aspiring filmmaker. Sadly though, we also learn her kid brother is an aspiring rapper, in the most frightening moments in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, not as good as the trailer would made you think it will be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Problems with this movie: 1. You expect a lot of horror scenes, but you don't get it: the oven thing it's the best example for this. 2. The kid reacts very badly to germs in the room because he didn't find napkins, but at the end of the movie he gets that diaper in the face and he doesn't scream, he doesn't have any reaction. Besides that, he even start kicking that old man shortly after that. 3. When they open the door a woman is hanged in there, there is no reaction from them to this. 4. They kill two people, but they act so normal after that, the kid is rapping and stuff like nothing happened. Come on, a grown up man would be f***ed up after this, but these are two kids. 5. In the kitchen, that old man is far from the kid, he doesn't try anything, to run or something... OK, let's say he is terrified and that's why. 6. You have two people that look like they want to kill you... and you go in the basement to search for grandparents instead of trying to find something to use as a weapon or run far away from there.The trailer looks so promising, but the movie is so much less than this promise, sadly. This could have been a lot better than it is, so much potential lost. It's not really that bad, it has some scary scenes, but the movie can't make you feel tension too much time, only for a few seconds... and the last 15 minutes are pretty good, except the problems related to this mentioned before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure if this does contain spoilers but to be on the safe side, I ticked the box anyway.What's good about this movie. M Night Shyamalan has delivered definitely his scariest movie to date. It's super creepy and has some good scares and sticking to his true style has a good twist. The casting of the Grandparents is spot on. There are subtle clues towards the twist throughout the movie, none of which I picked up on but at the end i can't believe I didn't.What's bad about it. The children. I absolutely hated them. The boy who is around 10 is a rapper and severely annoying. The girl who is 15 speaks like she is a university professor and her character is highly unrealistic. Sorry but 15 year old's do not speak like that. For the first hour of the movie, I wasn't sure I was enjoying it but the last 30 minutes greatly made up for that.I would totally recommend this movie if you can ignore those horrific children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a horror movie, really good, big surprise from M Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, we loved the the Sixth Sense, and we were slowly disappointed a little more with each M Night movie after, until utter oblivion with Lady in the Water, ugh. This was extra disappointing since my husband had worked on a number of his films. For a horror film, I thought The Visit was very good. There were moments when I was skeptical (yes, the found footage thing scared me a bit at first, so overdone and just not scary anymore) but I think it was not overused in this movie. It was part of it, but not all. There were a lot of opportunities to overdo things, and M Night stepped back and used subtlety instead. So much better, so much creepier. Creepy is good. Absolutely LOVED the performance by the actress that plays the old lady, that will be with me for awhile. Old man was pretty good also, one scene in particular will also stay with me for the rest of my life. Signs of a good horror flick. I have had a relative with dementia and this movie really tapped into that fear.Great is hard to come by for horror flicks, so I would not go that far, but this is a good horror movie scare. Right up there with Sinister - first one.</fullReview>

Have to say...I hate those shaky camera movies. Make me nauseas. However...the camera work was stable and I really enjoyed the movie. I caught onto the end...and my wife agreed and it turned out we were right. Neat twist. I, however...will not reveal any spoilers. There are definitely creepy moments in this film that will keep you on the end of your seats as will some humor here and there. I saw someone give this movie a 2 for a rating and said something like M. Night...whatever his last name is...a continued slide downhill. Whatever hater. For what it's worth, I found it to be a great film. Saw only 1 member of the film I recognized...the mom. She played on the series Crossing Jordan and in the film This is where I leave you. Also a great film. I urge you to watch that as well. ANYWAY. I enjoyed this film. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could of been much scarier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say this first. I am a huge M. Night fan. I love his views, his thoughts conveyed to film and his eerie camera work. I didn't enjoy The Last Air Bender or Lady in the Water and I feel this film may be closer to the ones I didn't enjoy. Rather than the ones I did enjoy. Although he kept it genuine, with his homage to Pennsylvania and his inclusion of water. I feel he may have traveled outside of his normality to ease the minds of the haters. It has been a while since his last film and I think that there is a reason for that. The film could of been much scarier. Since the plot twist was excellent and may be one of his best. Rivaling The Sixth Sense. I feel that comedy can have a place in thrillers and horror movies, but too much ruins the film in my opinion. This film had a little too much for my taste and the live action filming was OK. I really enjoyed the acting of all involved. The young actors should have a promising career. Even though in this film, they seemed a bit too smart for their age and therefor you knew you were watching actors. Overall. I was bit disappointed, especially waiting a while for his next film. I know that he did Wayward Pines which I found enjoyable, but his latest film could of been a bit more intriguing and less comedic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's reinvention of his style is simply superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan had first become known to me as the master of combining Horror with Psycho-Thriller and Suspense. Like many other viewers, I had completely knocked down by the twist towards the ending of The Sixth Sense, and was later extremely impressed with his ability to create an ending twist almost as exquisite in The Unbreakable. The Visit's style resembles these excellent features only remotely, but is altogether terrifying, eerie and unpleasant in a surprisingly innovating manner, proving how great M. Night is when he sticks to his specialty.While being a devout Horror fan for many years now, I really dislike "found footage" mockumentaries. I find them to be tiresome, boring, annoying and lacking the fear inducing elements for which the Horror genre calls. Not since The Blair Witch had I been so marvelously impressed and taken aback by a film from this sub-genre, and The Visit is simply better (and for me that's really saying something).Seeing as how a synopsis is available to all, there's no need to bother describing the plot, so let me skip forward and say that the plot twist is not more than "nice". Unlike M. Night's previous hits, the plot twist in The Visit is as predictable as can be, at least in my opinion as a somewhat experienced Horror viewer. The hints obvious, making the conclusion quite hard to miss. However, contrary to what might be thought, this only serves to show how great this film really is. In The Sixth Sense and The Unbreakable, the plot twist was the greatest feature of the film, connecting all the dots of previous scenes and making a regular story absolutely spectacular. In The Visit, the plot twist is mediocre at best, which only emphasizes how amazing the film is regardless.The script, like the twist, is average, and the soundtrack and cinematography offer nothing new to anyone who's seen a "found footage" mockumentary before. However, The Visit offers some of the finest most professional acting I've seen in a long while. Deanna Dunagan is simply bursting with talent playing the role of Nana, delivering an impeccable performance in each and every one of her scenes! Whether it calls for her to be motherly and loving or sick and disturbing, Dunagan is a true artist, a master (mistress?) in the field. Peter McRobbie demonstrates similar expertise in the role of Pop Pop, is no match to Dunagan's screen presence, charisma and sheer talent. I would very much like to see him in other Horror features, so I can give him a more objective review, since in The Visit it's impossible to avoid comparing him to Dunagan, a comparison that has no way of turning up in his favour. Olivia DeJonge (Becca) is gorgeous, and Ed Oxenbould (Tyler) is cute... That's all I find myself able to say after seeing them next to Dunagan and McRobbie.Without giving any spoilers, certain scenes in the film called for the actors to play the roles of insane mental patients. Having had some experience with this particular population, I must say I have NEVER seen the role played so accurately, authentically and realistically. Absolutely no Hollywood over-dramatization in Dunagan's acting, and only a small bit in McRobbie's. I wouldn't be surprised if M. Night had them visit an asylum to observe and get acquainted with the inhabitants, or watch recorded sessions and interviews, or both.All in all, The Visit is absolutely terrifying which is just what us Horror fans want in a film. I counted maybe two cheap jump-scares (that were a lot less cheaper than in most films), and virtually no use of Hollywood cheats. All I can say is I applaud the entire cast and supporting crew, and mainly Shyamalan, for proving to us all he doesn't need a perfect plot twist to make an almost perfect Horror film. This is a must see, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Return to Greatness, but a Step in the Right Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The user reviews here are pretty extreme on this movie. It seems to be one of those movies that doesn't generate a lot of middle grade rankings, instead being a movie that people love or hate. I guess I'm going to be somewhat of an exception, then. I don't think this movie has anywhere near enough originality to qualify as a classic that would deserve a 9 or 10. On the other hand, anyone giving this movie 1 or 2 stars needs to pull the stick out of their end and lighten up.Once upon a time I worshiped the ground that the director walked upon. After all, THE SIXTH SENSE is maybe the best horror film of the 90s. He followed up with a movie I consider to be one of the best "superhero" films ever in UNBREAKABLE, then a sci-fi masterpiece with SIGNS. Plenty will disagree with me, sure, but armies of critics can't be wrong. Then, things went off the rail. He started trying far too hard to inject allegory into his stories and to pigeon-hole his work into a forced twist ending and it seemed each movie got worse than the last. So, when I heard the horror sites trumpeting this movie as a return to his earlier greatness, needless the say I was skeptical.There are a weaknesses here that keep this movie from really a masterpiece. Anyone familiar with the state of indie horror in the last decade has seen a glut of found footage movies. It's a cheap way to pull off a movie with minimal budget and, as a result, has become so overdone as to be a turnoff. Shy chooses this style for the movie, though it's fake found footage. Clearly, we are not intended to think we are seeing the work of a home digital camera. The movie has Hollywood gloss and looks every bit like your standard production. Best of all, it's missing the annoying hand-held shakiness. The intent of found footage is still there, though, most importantly meant to give us the perspective of two children seeing these events unfold, which is vital to the intensity of the movie and I felt added an important dimension.As with any movie that focuses on children, there are going to be conflicting views of the actors. Children can be cute and empathetic, but can easily cross the line into precocious and annoying, especially true teenagers. The attitudes and dialog of teens can off grating in the wrong hands. There are plenty of cranky reviewers on here that want to point that direction with these two actors. While I recognize that taste is individual and some see things differently than I do, I never found these two to cross the line for me, personally. Yes, the girl is a little too intelligent to be realistic and her dialog feels more like that of a college kid trying to come off as educated, but I think it was this particular character's way of dealing with the situations in her life. The two had great chemistry together and felt organic, as if they were actually a brother and sister.Shyamalan's greatest talent is on display here, though. I always felt he was weakest and crafting a story that flowed from beginning to end and, eventually, destroyed his plots by forcing them towards increasingly unlikely endings. What he was best at, though, was creating a sense of suspense and tension in his films. Point blank, the man knows how to scare an audience. This movie is no exception. I've heard far too many bash this for "jump scares". Guess what people, I am a student of the horror films. I've seen just about every classic horror you can think of from the silent era to this year and a majority of the history of horror is based on the jump scare. It's like saying that a horror movie relies too much on blood. It's part of the fabric of the genre. There are moments in this one that really gave me a shiver. It's very rare that a horror movie elicits any real reaction in me anymore, but I sat on the edge of my seat a few times in anticipation of what horror was awaiting outside the door, or lingering on the edge of the camera's frame.Yes, we get the twist ending that we know Shyamalan will come to and it's nowhere near the shock of THE SIXTH SENSE, but let's face it, but he may never approach that level again. Few directors ever have. It's a satisfying ending in its' own right, though.Look, if you are going to be super serious and cynical and decide going in that this movie is going to suck, then you are going to walk away with that impression. Go back to your film forums so you can bash it without even really giving it a chance. If you want to sit back and enjoy a good horror movie that remembers how to put a chill into the audience, then this is well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Found Footage and Vomit and Poop?Oh My!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How's This for Originality and Creativity. Found Footage, Vomit, and Poop, and just to Leave No Tired Trope Undone, Jump Scares. Needing a Very Low- Budget, Fearing Failure Once Again. The Director Sinks to the FF Genre Because it is Cheap. Really, Really Cheap.What is a Workhorse for the New and Untested Filmmakers of the World, the Oscar Winner is Now Playing Among the Kids and the Poo-Poo Crowd. While His Experience Behind the Camera can be Seen Now and Then as Some of the Shots are Slick, it Only Distracts from the Format Drawing Attention that Says..."This is not really found footage." So What's the Point.It's a Mess of a Movie. A Little Creepy if Only Because Old People can be Creepy, and Only Scary When Things Jump Into the Screen with a Loud Noise. It's a Mishandled Mess of a Movie. There are Scenes and Shots that Could Never have Originated from the Source that it Implies, Distracting, Once Again a Belief in the Conceit of the Thing.The Acting is OK and not Embarrassing or Cringe Inducing, but there are Things Throughout that are. The Twist is so Thrown Away as to be Hardly Much of a Twist and the PG-13 of it All makes the Ending Violence Contrived, Hidden by Things in the Foreground, For Example.Overall, Not the Worst Movie the Director has done, but He has Made a Lot of Bad Ones so That Isn't High Praise. Recommended for Horror Completists Only and Those that Love Their Found Footage (the numbers are dropping exponentially and you would think the Director would know that). Others will Most Likely Find This Average at Best and Another in a Long Downward Spiral for a Director that Once Seemed to Have Something.</fullReview>

I'm thankful for film makers who dive deeply into the human psyche. The transcending message of the film- don't let grievance, spite and anger diminish torment and haunt your life- is greatly needed and coming up with a clever horror film as the means of making that statement is just wonderful to me. No one can say Shymalan shies away from introducing aspects of aging that most would rather ignore. I recommend it to discerning viewers.

But oh how wrong I was.The 'found-footage' style could have been OK in this instance, if it wasn't for ol Night using every cliché in that genre. Some moments of this film are simply eye roll worthy, just because of how often we see the same thing happen in other movies.The plot moves along rather unevenly, and by the end it is simply a relief that the film is over.I will however give it the 'creep' factor, with a few bits that were genuinely unnerving. But again, the majority of the jump-scare-esque horror that comes with the found-footage style is rather predictable.The twist (as there always is one in his films) is pretty average and I even thought, because it was so average, that there was going to be another twist to rectify the actual one. But alas there wasn't... which may have been the real one all along...Watchable for the most part, but nothing special at all.</fullReview>

The writers were slightly at fault but the director destroyed the entire piece based on the premise of monetary gain. Never again will I watch one of his films. He burned his works with this disaster. Kubrick is laughing right now and everyone who saw this who has a positive review is literally bought off. There is no way that any film student would ever appreciate this. In truth, most first year students could pull this off to begin with anyway. This is a disgrace to the directors works and clearly a desperate attempt at collecting revenue for bling sighted work. This isn't even worthy of a review but I write what I know the gnosis only feel in such regards. The director should be ashamed to put his name on this revelation of idiocy. This is likely his resignation from directing which is sad because he once attributed great work to the halls of illusionists.</fullReview>

The movie tries very desperately to be funny, and stretches jokes out as long as possible. It also has some really horrible gross-out humor. It's also not very scary. Most of the scares are just cheap jump scares, or scares taken out of another movie. Now there are good parts to this movie too. It does do a good job setting atmosphere and tone. And they are a couple moments that are actually creepy. The acting by the main characters are actually pretty good. This is another Shyamalan movie with a twist ending. The Twist ending is decent but nothing extraordinary. This isn't the worst movie ever, and from M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a good movie in over a decade, I'd say this is the first step in a welcome return for M. Night Shyamalan. I wouldn't recommend seeing it, but I'd say M.

It has bad acting by all involved (except maybe for the girl), uninvolving writing, lazy and directing by a director who i can safely say was once my favorite - that was SO long time ago. This is a found footage type of the movie, but sadly it's not a horror, nor it's a comedy, nor drama. It tries to mix these 3 genres, and it has some glimpses, but fells short very soon.Overall, skip this movie, this is sadly not a return to greatness of once iconic director, this is lazy movie by all accounts, with no purpose, it has nothing to say and nothing good or interesting to show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd seen ads for this film, the one showing a needlepoint house w/ "Grandma's Rules" for a nice stay. Noticing this was Shymalan's, I thought "Hope it's better than his last four." Searching for a theater playing "The Gift," I mistook "The Visit" for that title. I realized, "That's Shymalan's new film, wonder how it's doing?" I looked up reviews, expecting bad ones. To my surprise, better than I expected for a movie with a now-common device ("Found Footage") the plot of which was "Two kids visit Grandparents, weird things happen." Doesn't sound special, does it? But those reviews were intriguing, so I decided to give it a chance. Glad I did; taut and darkly comic at times. I was impressed. Two bright siblings are sent to Grand-Parents they've never met, due to a fracture between their Mom and her folks, of which she's reluctant to speak of. (This facet plays out through the film, keeping the parties apart when things go awry but isn't left unresolved.) Mom's looking forward to "Me-time" aboard a cruise after some time has passed following her divorce. She's happy to send the kids by train to her kin, who've reached out at just the right time.The sister (and eldest) is a budding documentary maker and a bit sad. The "peaceful resolution/negotiator" type. Her aspiration allows for a "found footage" feel. But this isn't that kind of movie; to label it as such is misleading. Her younger brother is outspoken/adventurous, enjoys "rapping" for an audience when the mood strikes. He has a particular phobia that keeps his exuberance in check.These two lambs are sent off to the rural, wintry setting of their Grand-Parents farm. The elders seem edgy when the pairs meet; as young and old strive to put best feet forward, everyone warms to each other fairly quickly, w/ few hiccups. "Pop-Pop" and "Nana" don't seem put off by the ever-present camera, consenting to interviews to humor their grandchild. Pop-Pop works around the house outdoors, Nana bakes and tends to cleaning. All seems Norman Rockwell. Despite hints of oddness (being cautioned to avoid the basement, not to venture out their bedroom after dark) the children are eager to please their quirky Grand-parents. No alarms raised, yet.They push the envelope and sneak a peek outside their door after bedtime. From this point on, the audience is taken for a ride into sinister territory that ratchets up the tension, preying upon the children's growing concern things aren't kosher. "What do we know, they're just old, right?" is their constant refrain. Whether being chased under the house or asked to climb inside an oven to clean it, the kids are placed in situations that bring up questions in the our minds: why are Pop-Pop and Nana behaving this way, how far will things go, where's this leading, what's the explanation? There are clues to why Pop-Pop and Nana act as they do. Perhaps sharp-minded viewers guessed the outcome. I didn't; too busy enjoying things to play Detective. When the worm turned in typical Shymalan fashion, I was quite astonished.At that point, things get really chilly. In one memorable scene the boy's phobia is taken to it's extreme limit; the audience I watched this w/ squealed and laughed. That's some trick, to repel and amuse equally. No film's w/o flaws. I find it hard to believe those kids would continue staying in that house considering what they started experiencing. But I'm nit-picking; what film could be completely true-to-life, and be entertaining? The cast's well chosen. There's familiar faces among the grown-ups, all suited to their roles. The kids are revelations; believable as siblings, and when the camera touches upon their relationship they really shine. That's when the film hits its stride; not during expected (and unexpected) frights/eerie scenes, but when showing the kids at their most vulnerable. They're raw, innocent, and afraid to speak up. Unable to fully process the situation because of Mom and Dad's split. Their world's out of tilt already; what's a little more oddness? We feel even for the old couple w/ their health issues and peccadilloes, until their true natures are revealed. Another tough trick to pull off: making audiences feel sympathy for, and perhaps identify with a little, characters who might be "the bad guys."I was pleased watching this; can't wait for the opportunity to watch it again. Interesting story-telling (spruce up something common, give it a kick) and clever film-making (very little of that "Boo, something jumps at the camera" foolishness.)I'm hoping the director creates more like "The Visit" in the future, no matter what the story or genre is. Compared to his previous works (in particular his most recent ones) this has to be considered a success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie! M. Night Shyamalan is back!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolute brilliant movie, very well written and executed. every scene you see is in there for a good reason. at the end, it all fits perfectly together.I didn't even know it was possible to make a Horror / Comedy hybrid which works, usually you get something like the Gremlins (which is very fun), but this one was actually scary too, a job well done if you consider the lead actors are two children...Normally I hate Handycam movies, but this one didn't bother me at all (very steady hands and good camera quality).Personally, I didn't love 'Lady In The Water', 'After Earth' and 'The Last Airbender' (I thought the Happening was OK), but with 'The Visit' M. Night Shyamalan finally returns to his roots with an excellent movie! If you like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreabable', 'Signs' and 'The Village' you will certainly like this one too! A nice and UNEXPECTED ending! a very original movie! would recommend it to everyone! I'm sorry to say, but anyone who rates this below 7 knows nothing about film or just made it a mission to boycott mister M. Night.I gave it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an Enjoyable Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, The Visit is grim fairytale about two very annoying kids who are spending the week with their nana and pop pops (gran and granddad to anyone else) for the very first time. They haven't met before despite both kids being in their teens. This, due to something their own mother done as a teenager before leaving home never to reconcile any differences. But nana and pop pops have gotten in touch and think having the kids over would be an olive branch, of sorts. But when they get there, it's obvious something's not quite right with nana and pop pops. What unfolds is rambling game of hide and seek with added scares, but filmed by the kids who are making a documentary of their visit. But nana running around naked scratching doors and pop pops keeping an outhouse full of nappies he's soiled because he's incontinent doesn't trigger enough alarm bells to get out after the first night. And so it continues, with added rapping from the grandson, which just left me bemused along with a rambling narrative that wants to be scary and funny, but is neither. Whilst the usual Shyamalan twist isn't hard to spot and does nothing to make such a poor film any more interesting than it struggles to be. It's this director's worst film to date, which is quite an accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, terrible delivery!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So when I saw the Trailer for this movie I was intrigued by it, it looked like it might actually have the potential of being an interesting movie. I liked that the scare of the movie looked like it was going to be how crazy elderly people can be, almost a "Dangers of Alzheimers" if you will. I also knew this could back fire and be really stupid, but I thought it'd either be really well done or so bad it was good. I did however happen to miss it was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (who as of late doesn't do "it's so bad it's good", more like "it's so bad it's boring!") I didn't figure this out until the opening credits to which I said, "Oh no, what have I done?" Now considering someone had generously paid my way for this flick I decided to give it a chance.It was Terrible, The kids are carrying every scene and the attempt at humor is what you would expect from a kid with a camera, cute but quickly gets old, (also a kid rapping can be cute ONCE only ONCE not ten times!) The atmosphere at times was admittedly creepy but..... everything else is just Dull, a good chunk of the movie is just filler, and why, yes the old folks are crazy and unpredictable... some of their actions don't quite add up. There were scenes with build up and no real payoff.In brief there were scenes that worked and scenes that didn't, and the scenes that didn't outweighed the scenes that did making this movie not work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Trailer Movie...But It's Not Terrible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been excited to watch this film ever since i seen the trailer because i thought it looked really creepy but disappointingly the trailer pretty much showed all of the creepy scenes, so all of the scares were expected, apart from one...I very much jumped out of my skin. The grandma was extremely creepy throughout, unfortunately she is one of the only good things about this film. The other good thing was the twist, i actually didn't see that coming and i thought the film was heading in a completely different direction. Now the bad points - The Acting! it was terrible! The children were extremely annoying (last i checked that's not how children speak). Certain things just weren't realistic, scenes had wasted potential and others were pretty pointless and The rapping! oh god...the rapping! I did laugh more than i would have wanted to but for me the film wasn't a complete failure because grandma most definitely gave me the creeps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can M. Night Shamalamadingdong return to he's old roots?...almost.The story is about a harried single mother leaves her two young children with her grandparents for the weekend. But when they get back, things seem different - and so very wrong.What happened to M. Night Shyamalan? That's the biggest question that everyone on the world wide web tried to answer, but we never got a clear answer. I mean seriously, how can you start off so high with success like: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, then suddenly out of nowhere fall straight flat on your face with non- stop sh*t like: After Earth, Lady in the Water, Last Airbender and The Happening. And it went on from there as every time M. Night release a new film it always turns out bad and pretty much everyone as just given up on the fact that he can make a good movie again. Shyamalan is now an easy target for criticism and if Shyamalan did make a good movie everyone will just hate it anywhere just because... it's Shyamalan. Now we've got he's new film called "The Visit" and I can safely say that this movie wasn't terrible at all, but I can't sit here acting like it's the greatest thing ever made just because Shyamalan finally made a movie that wasn't the worse thing on the planet like he's other ones. At least it was better than After Earth. First the positives: Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge (the two kid actors) did a great job nailing American accents, because both of them are Australian. But their acting in the movie was alright, I mean they did the best their could with the material that was given to them and they did good.I'm happy that M. Night finally went back to the low budget type of movies, because he seriously can't do big budge movies since there's many possibilities for him to f**k up. When you got a small budget, small crew and a small movie, it's hard to make huge mistakes. And yes there are mistakes in this movie but it wasn't as bad or just embarrassing as M. nights previous films. The movie did have some creepy moments that worked and wasn't terrible like I thought it was going to be. I'm actually surprised that Shyamalan made a movie like this that wasn't the Last Airbender or After Earth. The Visit had elements of being a great horror film, but sadly that's when the problems I have for the movie came in. For the problems: This entire movie is marketed as a horror comedy, so basically all the scenes in the film that was suppose to be funny just came off embarrassing. The movie would have been funny if the film was meant to be taken seriously like M. Night last films, which was funny. I think the comedy would have been right there, I mean Shyamalan wants us to be scared and also laugh since this is a "horror comedy", and too be honest the horror elements in this movie worked more than the comedy itself. I think you've got to be a true genius to blend the perfect humor and horror together to make it work. The writing was a bit meh, some of the jokes that the two kids said got stale after awhile and if you want a "it's so bad that it's good" type of movie I would honestly look somewhere as this doesn't land on any of those categories.Overall The Visit was surprisingly not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's not a great movie but at least it's better than he's other films that we had from him recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been an eagle, instead settled for a pigeon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have soared the great blue skies, instead its scratching at the ground nipping for mouldy crumbs on the concrete floor. First off this movie is, or in the most part, a kind of "found footage" cum "handheld" style of movie where we see the movie from the third person perspective of the kids in first person (them behind the hand-cam). This kind of style of movie is very polarising. It can be executed very well (blair witch project, first paranormal activity etc) and be on Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones (really bad). This, sadly, falls in the latter. The pacing of the story is just... confusing. At some places it starts picking up and make you wet for more but then in most places it just slows down to such a snails pace you just want to click the X button and move on. People watch horror because they want to be drawn in so robustly into a storyline such that they can be scared or have their emotions whirled up like spaghetti on a fork. Think Insidious, think SAW. The storyline dragged you in so deep that you really got the scare you want from a horror film. And most of all the pace of the storyline kept you ENGAGED throughout the whole movie. This movie is 1 hr and 30 mins long... you can see where I'm going with this. Slow erratic pacing and 1hr and 30 mins do NOT go along without a disaster following. If you cannot pace a movie, its not going to be good pre 2 hrs. The main issue was the CORE climax/ plot twist of the movie... was actually quite good. When it was revealed i actually had a "omg wtf" moment... which really wasn't where you want the omg moment to occur 20 mins towards the end of the film when the other 1 hr 10mins were lacklustre at best. They could have spent the first half setting up the movie and then the second half setting up. rolling the plot twist which would have been great pacing, instead of 1 hr 10 mins plot set up and 20 min plot twist... The acting of the kids was as good as kid acting will get in these types of horror flicks, however they were never allowed to really "shine" in their horror acting due to the majority of the "horror" occurring, again, in the last 20 mins. And they could have REALLY pushed the boat on what the old granny could do... but they didn't. They just made her in a cliché which was really sad. You'll know what i mean when you see the movie. Long story short, it is literally ANOTHER M night shamalalala film. And i don't mean in the good way. Avoid in cinema, its worth a time waste on DVD, nothing more. After signs and the 6th sense hes been pumping the same slow pacing OMFG ADRENALINE MEGA PLOT TWIST LAST 10 MINUTES movies again and again. In conclusion this movie is like that roller coaster that you've been told is the fastest in the world and it lasts 5 mins. For the first 4 mins it literally goes slowly than a bicycle only to suddenly, for the last minute, speed up to the fastest speed just because it wants you to get off faster so that others can get on. Great! but you give me the speed i wanted for the past 4 minutes now?! when you're going to finish? That's like a birthday cake with only the candles... and not the cake... And i'm almost sure that his PR are single handedly writing good reviews to bump up the rating on IMDb... which is kinda sad. don't let them fool you. but there is some truth. he is back to his best... at being disappointingly mediocre. I'm still waiting for a movie to match 6th sense. I feel i wont ever see one from him in my lifetime.</fullReview>

The shakes of the camera made me sick, the kids are stupid and obnoxious, one more rap from the boy and I would of turned it off. If you are a true horror movie person do not watch this movie, people that reviewed this high were probably drinking. Very slow and boring movie that should have not had the ratings it has. I don't have much more to say about this movie other then it should of been labeled warning should not watch unless you can handle modern family camera shaking film.

		<fullReview>M Night Unpronoucable name ? Is he still making films ? Is he allowed to still make films ? He is ? , just not with other peoples money ? Makes sense since he's been producing one flop-buster after another so I'm guessing THE VISIT is a result of not being able to raise enough finance rather than any artistic reason . At least camcorder / lost footage movies don't cost much The downside is that this sub-genre is very self limiting . In other words when you've seen one you've effectively seen them all . They start off slow and mundane and slowly wratch up the chills and scares . This one doesn't get off to a good start with a couple of young teens called Becca and Tyler sent off to visit their maternal grandparents . I don't want to sound like a xenophobic Eurocentric but these two teens don't strike me as your typical American teens . They both come out with words that will have you reaching for a dictionary and Tyler occasionally uses British idioms like "Bloke" . Maybe M , Night whathisface originally wrote this in a British setting and forgot to rewrite it for the Stateside setting or maybe it was ghost written by the late Christopher Hitchens ? Regardless you'll be hard pressed to find a more unlikable kid than Tyler To give some credit to the writer/director he does manage the hit the horror high notes and suspense the further the story progresses and did find myself slightly surprised as to how well done some of these elements were done . I shouldn't really be surprised because with SIGNS the director did show he could give an audience sleepless nights with simple scare tactics . The downside still remains in that the same director was being touted as "The New Spielberg" with THE SIXTH SENSE less than 20 years ago so making a fairly average film considered to be better than much of his recent output is the epitome of a backhanded compliment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming unstuck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two kids go to spend a week with grandparents they're meeting for the first time; their mother had run off from home as a teen and never came back. So we expect to enter an ordinary life with quiet rituals of family. It might be an opportunity along the way to mend ties, heal broken parts. The kids are turning this into a movie, hoping to capture forgiveness to show back home to the mother. It's innocuous enough at first, a nana who bakes cookies, a grandpa who chops wood. But things get weird. The familiar landscape of a livingroom becomes haunted every night at 9.30. The grandma is seen doing things she shouldn't, being where we wouldn't expect. Something is wrong in this house. M Night does this part as good as any recent horror.But what initially appears to be another horror about haunting apparitions around a house, is eventually revealed to be reflection about another kind of apparition and haunting. A few nudges have been placed that point that way, like talk about what's behind the frame.See, a family was shattered twice. A daughter who ran off one day and this is mirrored in the man she married who did the same and abandoned her and the kids. The kids pretend that everything is fine in their life but we come to understand it's not. Deep down there's hurt. The film is about family life coming unstuck in pieces, about figures that should have been kind shown to be mysteriously afflicted. In these pieces the girl manages to face herself in the mirror, the boy becomes "unfrozen" to tackle the man.So I don't know if M Night is back, I'm not waiting with bated breath anyway. But this is worth a look, not exactly deep but more well thought than at first glance. Spontaneous, inexplicable appearances turn reality upside down, unfreezing it to reveal hurt. Everything perturbed because a camera is there to see. For young viewers learning how to read narratives, the next step is Raoul Ruiz in Comedy of Innocence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great combination of horror and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not so common that the genre of horror and comedy are mixed in a movie without it being a cheesy spoof film. M. Night Shyamalan blends these two together in a way that has not been done before. He also uses a technique done by many other recent horror films by using a "self-filmed" perspective, but does it well enough that it does not blend in with the other movies in its category. This mixed with normal shots create a great balance and does not overwhelm the audience or make them nauseous from too much camera shaking. The film tells a story about two kids who are going to visit their mother's parents for the first time in their lives. Their mother left home early as a teenager and lost contact with her parents for many years. The daughter, Becca, is an aspiring film maker and wants to capture the experience in a documentary about meeting her mother's parents and finding out why they do not speak anymore. Her camera is used in many shots to show her own perspective on what happens. The son, Tyler, is the main source of comedy in the film. He is often working on his freestyle raps and trying to cut back on his cursing by replacing bad words with names female pop stars like "Katy Perry!" The grandparents look like typical old grandparents and even act as if they are suffering from Alzheimer's. Almost from the time they are introduced they seem a little off. This is implied knowing it is a horror movie so it is suspicious when the grandpa is always in his barn and grandma asks Becca to get in the oven to clean it. The film is filled with the typical horror movie cliché's especially at night when the grandpa says the kids aren't allowed out of their room after 9 PM. Many scary incidents occur before the final section of the film where the famous M. Night Shyamalan twist occurs. This unexpected turn of events caps off what is a very well done film from one of the most famous horror directors.Lighting in this film was key to make sure the audience knew something horrifying was about to happen. Scenes with brighter lighting were paired with calmer points in the film. Most of the scary moments occurred in low light situations like a cloudy day, under the house, or at night time. I personally did not think I was going to enjoy this film when I was forced to see it with my friends, but I left the theater shouting about my favorite scenes. The mix of horror and comedy really did it for me and I don't think the movie would have been nearly as good without the humor. I would give this film an 8.5 out of 10 mainly because it was like no other horror film I have ever seen before and was able to make me jump in fear and burst into laughter seconds later. This movie is highly recommended if you are looking for a different perspective on horror and want to have more than one emotion toyed with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit is 2015's greatest horror movie, even with its numerous flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2015 has been a stale year for good horror. Sinister 2, The Women In Black 2, Poltergeist Remake and Unfriended all missed the mark with critics and audiences (notice how 3/4 are either a sequel or a remake). Unfriended offered the most out of the batch, with higher critical praise and an original concept, at least it has that. A few weeks ago, The Visit opened in theaters worldwide, and I recently had the chance to view it over the weekend. I came into the movie with poor expectations, since it was doing so-so with critics and audiences, and the film's director, M. Night Shyamalan has had a rough couple of films recently. Also, the premise was a bit wonky, seriously, these kids are put in life-threatening circumstances by visiting their grandparents...seriously! Despite those noticeable buffers, I was still pumped to see the movie, hoping for a good horror movie to pass the time. After I sat 2 hours in a movie theater full of wimp audience members (you know the people around you are annoying when you start getting scared of them screaming vs. the actual movie) I walked out impressed.Now, before I begin, you need to know the rest of this review features spoilers. If you don't mind them, keep reading.The Visit, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense, Signs) is a surprisingly satisfying movie. The movie follows two kids, Rebecca, an aspiring filmmaker and Tyler, a kid who wishes he could rap. They have recently been invited to visit their grandparents for the first time in their lives since their mother has parent problems. Once they arrive, a week of horror begins and what you thought couldn't possibly be scary starts to jump at you.First point, The Visit is found-footage, but it's not your average FF movie. Rebecca wants to make a short documentary on her visit, and so the cameras are set-up in a way that reflects what they should actually be viewing. I believe the cinematography in this film hits all the right notes and is by far superior to recent FF movies such as The Gallows and Unfriended.The film's atmosphere was one of it's great strengths. Since this movie is told in a documentary-style, music and sound is limited to what would actually happen in real life. For those who loved James Newton Howard's score on Signs and Unbreakable, don't start detesting the film, because, without music, the movie was 10x more realistic.Now, the cast's acting was exceptional, especially the grandmother (Deanna Dunagan). All actors/actresses fit in with the movie, and never had a sour spot in their performances.That brings me to The Visit's characters. My one pet-peeve of the horror genre is that they never develop a strong protagonist, and I fully believe without a 3-dimensional character, a movie falls apart. The Visit proved exceptionally well at this point, as both the kids were well-developed, or at least enough so that you cared what happened to them. I loved how their mother, played by Kathryn Hahn, was the opposite of the clichéd mother in movies.Breaking away from Clichés was also one of The Visit's strengths. The found-footage, jump scares and plot pitfalls were all either drastically changed or absent in the movie. Even the grandparents used clichés to intensify their horror, since when does your grandmother crawl on the walls?And by far the greatest thing about The Visit was its twist. Yes, this is an M. Night Shyamalan film, so yes, there was a twist. Unlike his recent films, though, this one was perfectly executed and extremely effective. I won't spoil such a great twist, but it really does shift the entire movie drastically, so much so I'd compare the twist to The Sixth Sense, which is notorious for its final twist.So enough with the positives, what were the flaws? First off, I do believe that some elements of the movie weren't needed. This includes Tyler's rapping, the grandpa's period dilemma (although the third act utilized that well) and the overuse of shaky-cam. That kinda sums up all the flaws, though, sorry to bum you out, I know you really came here just to hear me rant about why this movie is bad (but it really isn't).I highly recommend you check this movie out in theaters. My final score for The Visit is a solid 81/100. If you love strange horror movies and have been waiting for M. Night to make a comeback, go ahead and catch a showing, because it's worth it.Thanks for reading, Joel Freecheck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was laughing and screaming...sometimes at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two big budget action movies that bombed with critics and didn't make too much of a profit, M. Night Shyamalan took the money he made from directing Will Smith's After Earth in order to make the Visit. Produced on the cheap, the film is his best film in a while. I am a huge fan, I have even liked some of his more hated movies like The Happening and The Village. However The Visit works much better and has a lot of charm to it.Despite what the previews may have made it seem, this is not a straight horror film. In fact I wouldn't call this a horror film at all, this is a thriller-comedy. And it works on both levels. As a comedy, I laughed quite a lot during this. It may not be the most "gut-busting" humor ever written, but a lot of it did make me chuckle, and there were a descent amount of big laughs. As a thriller, it also is some great stuff. It has a build up that lures you into a false sense of security, thinking that the grandparents are just a little weird, but every day they get just a little more strange. There are a few good jump scares, in fact one made me scream in a way I haven't since at least The Conjuring a couple years ago. But what the movie does best is build up an uncomfortable atmosphere. And this not only makes it more thrilling, but makes some of the funny moments a little more nerve racking. More than once watching the movie was I laughing but also breathing heavily from fear. Besides the thrills and laughs, the film also has a good story and characters. I liked watching these two kids (don't take that out of context.) They were funny, they were likable, they were entertaining. And both of them were portrayed very well by the two young actors. The grandparents also were fun, when they weren't creepy. The found footage is used well here, allowing for a more claustrophobic atmosphere that would not have been done as well if it were shot traditionally. It also is beautiful to look at sometimes, allowing for some great shots of the sky and scenery. The twist ending made me actually jump and was one of those times where I was both laughing and shaking at the same time. And finally, the ending was actually pretty sweet. There are a few times that the music comes out of nowhere, which I guess was the point, but it felt a little jarring, especially at the end when it's supposed to be this really big moment and it just starts blaring. The video and audio quality are also way too nice for two teenagers filming with standard cameras you could buy at a store, so it does take some suspension of disbelief. And also there was this part that felt tacked on. Early on, Rebecca says that Tyler has a fear of germs, but then it isn't brought up again until an hour later. And between that time he's climbing under the house and lifting water out of an old well. Which was a little odd for a kid with such a fear.However I had a blast with The Visit. While I like the Happening, and actually don't mind movies like The Last Airbender and Lady in the Water, this is what I love him doing. It has a nice blend of comedy and thrills. It creates a likable cast. The acting is good. And it uses the found footage gimmick well while still being nice to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Enjoyable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who doesn't watch horror movies because they are all cliché and not scary and, as someone who hated the "Blair Witch" style of filming, when my friend suggested watched The Visit, I gave it a massive eye roll.10 minutes in I was moaning. 20 minutes in, it got good.From there it proceeded to keep me entertained until the very end.Firstly, the reason this is so refreshing to me, is because it's creepy with a scary edge, and you can get jumpy from this film because the humour allows you to lower your guard. It's the right amount of everything, weird, creepy, funny, scary.Ed Oxenbould is comedy gold! The reviewers saying this film isn't funny must be Americans. That is the only logical reason for this opinion. I'm no expert, but I can't see why this film is being so harshly reviewed. All in all, I think it was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it, unlike The Babadook which is a total yawnfest.</fullReview>

My friend watch this movie and she told me that its a good movie, and without her knowing who is m.night is.. So give it a shot.. I did not read any spoilers because hate spoilers, but when the twist ending comes out was just shout "WHAT"??. Then it becomes more interesting.. Then it reminds me everything what happens in the whole movie. This movie makes me stupid and i laugh. There's a jump scare, there's a funny scene , and most of all, its original.. I gave it 8 i enjoy it. I review six sense its a perfect 10, i enjoy unbreakable more. So i hope shyamalan would do more original movie..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never mind the bad reviews this movie got. Those people were posting to facebook through the entire movie. If you like scary movies that are smart, you'll like this. I don't want to give it away, but when the kids get to the grandparents things get progressively worse and darker by the day. This is the kind of movie that sends chills down your spine and is a real psychological thriller. Suffice it to say it has great creepy scenes, and great twists I never saw coming. That is so wonderful I can't explain it as I feel like most of what I watch today is nothing more than elements of movies I've seen before chopped up and recycled into a new crap movie. There is none of that here. I loved it, I'd watch it again, I'd recommend it to anyone who loves psychological thrillers. Also consider "Evil Things" which was good, but not as good as this was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The constructed subtext of the film strongly suggests a created vision of the conceited, contemptuous and detached, while it's base premise is a re-tooled unimaginative peek-a-boo facade of ignorance lacking movement; offering nothing to the genre nor art for that matter.Is it possible that it is really nothing more than an intended insult by the Director himself, offering the somnambulist masses their own deserved just deserts? I think so. It is clearly an insult to the dumbed down population of vanilla eating challenged, obese, blind and diminished viewers. There is one scene (a subject extrapolated from an earlier one)in particular in which this became not only apparent but blatant, but only of course to those able to see.

Movies should present a view as if you are there and watching but since when does your sight jump around as if your eyeballs were throw in a blender. It's just a lazy approach by filmmakers who can't offer any kind of decent choreographed scenes. Just shake the camera around dude and people will think it's a cool hectic scene ?? Unbelievable.

The cross between the comedy and horror aspects were difficult to differentiate. With the form of the film hard to follow I couldn't figure out whether or not I would have like to see more horror or more comedy. The acting was fun to watch and the dialogue was engaging. The film wasn't a horrible comeback for M. Night, but I feel it could have been better as a pure horror film or a pure comedy without being a found footage film with a comedic/horror mixture. It wasn't horrible and it did entertain, I would suggest renting this film if you're bored at home with nothing to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit - A Review by Nathan Fischer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan wowed audiences with The Sixth Sense by catching everyone off guard. It was a finely tuned horror thriller with one of the most memorable twists to date. Since then he has made some exceptional films, and more recently, not so exceptional. I'm happy to report that he is back to his true form with The Visit. The Visit is a found footage style film about a mother who sends her two children, Becca and Tyler (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) to see their grandparents whom they've never met before. There is bad blood between the mom (Kathryn Hahn) and her parents and she hasn't seen them for 15 years. But after her children convince her to let them go, she sends them off. Becca, a 15-year-old aspiring filmmaker decides to document the whole trip with her 13-year-old brother's help.. After arriving to the house, the kids soon discover that there is something wrong with Nana and Pop Pop. The movie takes place over a week and the scenes change with large red titles telling the audience what day it is. I liked this. It came across as eerie and helped build the dread. The kid's leading the movie are perfectly casted. Becca and Tyler play siblings so naturally that I'd assume they were related in real life. The banter between the two is funny and accurate to their age. While they both do a terrific job, Ed Oxenbould as Tyler steals the show. The way he handles comedy and horror is timed perfectly. Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn do an equally solid job as Nana and Pop Pop. You can tell in the trailers that they seem creepy, but that's just scratching the surface. These are some scary old people.I found it a little surprising that M. Night decided to make this movie in the found footage style. He has always had a great eye for directing and I sometimes feel like this style film restricts a director's creativity. But I'm starting to change my mind. This style is just another method of story telling, and it's an effective one, especially for horror. This is a passion project that M. Night wrote, directed, produced and edited. And you can see that he had a good time making it. This is undoubtedly a scary movie with some truly terrifying moments, but its never stops being playful. I smiled as much as I was scared. So is there a twist? Is there this giant reveal? You're going to have to see for yourself, but it's a visit you'll be happy you took.</fullReview>

The Visit is the worst damn thing that exists in filmography. I've seen better works from some low budget independent American horror crappies. The film is in what lately appears a standard modern "Katy Perry!!!" pseudo-documentary form, where something ordinary starts as a normal thing, but suddenly takes an unexpected twist. OK, the twist happens five minutes till the end. The movie is so bad, no worse comes to my mind. I'm literally ashamed to say I've paid to see this "Shakira!"I'm regressing now after I've seen this "Artwork"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly creative Night Shyamalan as we know him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been plenty of talk about The Visit being Night's come back film. I wouldn't go too deep into the whole "career nosedive" of his as many "critics" put it but would touch up on a small insight. I loved The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village and Unbreakable but I did not like After Earth, The Happening and Lady in the Water. So how many other directors are there who made only fantastic films in their career? William Freidkin, Milos Forman, Oliver Stone and even the great Sidney Lumet made some bad films continuously in their career. How many hurled hate mongering at them? Not many, and rightly so, because they are still great and their good films are still good films. So is/are Shyamalan &amp; his good films.You probably know The Visit's plot already - it is told through an interesting storytelling device of raw footages of a young documentary filmmaker (highly resonating with today's age which makes film making anyone's game especially for children). Night combines horror &amp; comedy so skilfully and deftly that it was possible for the audiences to laugh and scream at one minute and then scream at the next. There are some disturbing turns in the story and some hilarious moments too - both co-exist perfectly throughout. When you think about it in the end, the humour had a good place in the story. The funny scenes involving the children were all based on an assumption us, the audience and some characters were on. Both children - Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould - were excellent. Highly talented and funny. Night also achieved all this with remarkable simplicity. There are no complex layers or non-linear timeline - it was a simple story with a simple twist that runs through a 7 day period. I heard the entire theatre laugh out and enjoy thoroughly when the credits were rolling. You'll see why.Shyamalan is a fine director, this shouldn't surprise many who liked his earlier work. If you're not one of those getting onto silly bandwagons of hatred or fanboyship without a strong rationale, this film will entertain you for sure. IMO, The Visit is probably not as good as Sixth Sense but just as enjoyable as ANY good horror films in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I took my teenage son to see this movie at his request. I suppose some would question my parental judgment given the nudity and bad language but I suppose my son has heard the word "Shakira" before. Thankfully, however, he has never seen his Nana's backside. I fully expected to be bored and to be counting the minutes until it was over (like most movies my son drags me to) but that was not the case this time. I was either laughing out loud or jumping out of my skin throughout the entire movie. The bad raps by the "ethnically confused" 13 year old kid had my son and I rolling. We liked the plot twist and we especially liked the way the grandfather helped the boy overcome his germaphobia! I am not sure this will go down in history as a critically acclaimed great American movie classic or that it will win any major awards but I have to say I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was both the strangest and most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. Great job M. Night Shyamalan!</fullReview>

I read the reviews and saw that many people were giving this thumbs up (at the time, it was 7.5) and figured this would be worth going to the cinema to watch. How wrong I was. 75 minutes into the movie (it's 94 minutes in total) and nothing worth mentioning happens. The "twist in the story happens at the 76 minute mark but by then I was too numbed to think it was surprising (I actually had an inkling of the twist in the first 15 minutes). I don't think it's the actors, it's the script that is lame and can't be saved by anything other than a complete rewrite. This is far from the worst movie I have ever watched but it's certainly not worthy of being released in mainstream cinemas and asking people to buy tickets to watch. If you want to watch this, wait for it to come out on weekly DVD rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past couple of weeks, I've been hearing from critics that The Visit (my latest review) is the utter comeback film for Mr. M. Night Shyamalan. Interesting. If that's the case, then why is he bent on ripping off The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity via the first hour in. Listen Night, I know you've been taking a ribbing for not living up to the stature that is The Sixth Sense. But this hand-held, found footage thing seems so tired now, it might need a veritable doze. Time to "visit" something else dude.Filmed in rural Pennsylvania (that's the Shyamalan way you know), featuring a surprise twist that I didn't see coming (I'm probably the only Dodo bird critic that didn't pick up on that one), and being rather generous for its PG-13 rating (I feel this thing should have garnered a hard R), The Visit does what many Shyamalan films do. It builds to a slow creep while you wait for the gotcha cessation. The story begins with the Jamison family. Paula Jamison (the perky Kathryn Hahn) is a single mother of two. Her husband left her to move to California and she hasn't seen her parents in about 15 years. On a whim, she decides to go on vacation with her new boyfriend while her kids (Olivia DeJonge as Rebecca Jamison and Ed Oxenbould as Tyler Jamison) take a trip to their grandparents farmhouse in the bleak, Keystone State. Here's the rub: Said grandparents contacted Paula through the Internet so Rebecca and Tyler are meeting them for the very first time. Chaos then ensues when John Jamison (Peter McRobbie) and Doris Jamison (played by Deanna Dunagan who gives the film's best performance) begin to act weird and creep out their fragile, young kin. Suicidal tendencies, scaling walls, collective feces, and dead bodies in the basement are what's on tap for you the viewer. Oh and with the tagline for The Visit being "Don't ever leave your room after 9:30 p.m.", I thought it could be up there with "I see dead people". In the case of this flick, the stars weren't quite aligned.In retrospect, there's a few chills to be had, a few jolts, and the performances by the old timers are pretty impressive (the kid actors on the other hand, are quite annoying). But in the end, it's just a movie about two adolescents trapped in a house with a couple of crazy, deranged denizens (where else are the whippersnappers supposed to go, it's in the middle of nowhere). Sadly, these two unhinged grandparents aren't aliens or ghosts. They're just whacked out of their minds. As for Shyamalan, well he seems to excel with certain shots when he's not letting the young actors film documentary style. Big mistake. He should have just cropped the whole hand-held facet, dropped the incorporated comedy (which is good yet becomes embarrassing when a rap act takes over the closing credits), and just let it ride. Oh well. The Visit isn't awful but it's no where near as epic (or eerie) as his first three films. My rating: A nontoxic 2 and a half stars.Of note: With The Visit, you can easily tell what's jittery fodder and what amounts to some capable direction from M. Night. My suggestion would have been to separate the two. Maybe have the found footage crap subjugate through a different lens or have its rec insignia placed in the right hand corner. It's an oversight at best and probably wouldn't bring greatness to fruition. Anyway, look for some gross moments here (a seventy-year-old woman runs naked and there are various scenes of poop in a diaper, yikes!) and a couple of Dutch angles right before a disturbing game of Yahtzee. Oof!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simple,short and entertaining.I am big fan of horror movies and I am always looking for some good horror movie to come out in theaters but most of the time they disappoint you with a boring storyline and some old school horror scenes.I saw the budget of this movie which is 5 millions and based on that I was not expecting much from this movie but this movie proved me wrong its very simple,short and I can say a well directed entertaining movie.good suspense is a forte of M.Night Shyamalan and he proved that many times(the sixth sense and signs are good examples of that) as like other movies of Shyamalan there is good storyline and direction which will urge you to wait for the climax or suspense of the movie.due to the tight budget of this movie which was deliberately done by them or for some other reason I don't know but while watching this movie you will consider it as a plus point.there are some really good horror sequences in movie which will definitely going to scare you and there are some comedy scene which will make you laugh after some scary scenes there is a good balance of horror with comedy but more then comedy I will consider it a horror movie. All the actors in this movie done there part with perfection specially both Olivia Dejonge and Ed Oxenbould (both child actors) are good in there part. In the end I will say that if you enjoy horror movies then go for this movie which is by far the best horror movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this simple and short. I loved the Village, which people seemed to compare the movie to, but it's nothing like that.That said, the movie is very good. The direction manages to craft a mixture of humor, horror, and heartfelt all into one, making it kind of its own genre.The twist--which M Knight is always known for--was fairly obviously; however, knowing it before hand does not ruin the movie. I say go into the movie expecting it to be fun, and you'll enjoy yourself. The scares are not so much atmosphere as they are jump scares. The whole feel of the movie kind of reminds me of horror movies I'd watch in middle school with my friends. It's just good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying suspense movie with quirky comic relief at all the right moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I badly wanted The Visit to be a good movie.After a couple of instant classics (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) and some decent suspense outings (Signs and The Village), Shyamalan began one of the most bizarre downward spirals in directing history, dedicating the last decade of his career to churning out cinematic train wrecks like Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (LitW was so spectacularly bad that it made my recent list of the ten worst films ever made, a decision that I stand by). When word came out that The Visit would be a return to form, I hoped against hope that this one would save him. Even so, I went in with my doubts; Shyamalan's been known for misleading advertising in the past?would this be a similar case?As it turns out, no.It's with equal parts relief and pleasure that I can announce The Visit delivers on all fronts, providing suspense with quirky comic relief at all the right moments.This film-within-a-film opens with a wholly believable explanation as to why we are watching found footage: our teenage protagonist Rebecca is an aspiring filmmaker setting out to make a documentary about her broken family. Becca's mother Paula (Kathryn Hahn) became involved with an older man at 19, and Paula's parents did not approve of the relationship. Paula eventually left home under unpleasant circumstances, and she hasn't spoken to her parents in fifteen years...but she won't reveal to Becca why. Deciding that finally meeting her grandparents is the only way to discover the truth, Becca sets out to right past wrongs via her documentary. She and her younger brother Tyler travel to the old folks' isolated home, and it doesn't take long for things to get disconcerting...From the first moment the grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are on screen, we immediately know something is "off" about them. This couple is weirdly detached and robotic?at first it seems like the quirks of old age, but as the film rolls on it's increasingly apparent that something far more sinister is taking place. "Pop-pop" is convinced that people following him and that "a white thing with yellow eyes is waiting for us." "Nana" laughs hysterically at nothing and crawls around on all fours at night. To say anything more about them would only spoil the surprises, and in classic Shyamalan fashion The Visit delivers a satisfying final-act twist.Entertaining as the creepy elderly antics are to watch, The Visit is carried just as much by the performances of Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as siblings Becca and Tyler. These two engage right off the bat and are characterized to a degree that is rare for a Paranormal- Activity-style thriller. DeJonge is convincing as a sophisticated, slightly pretentious young filmmaker concerned with the ethics of film (she avoids exploitation and staged shots), and Oxenbould steals many a scene as aspiring rapper "T-Diamond Stylus" (an element that somehow avoids being annoying).Shyamalan even provides some great emotional resonance, and as we learn more and more about the family's past, we only want the young protagonists to survive the ordeal even more.One thoroughly impressive aspect about The Visit is how the tone switches so effortlessly between tension and comedy. When I saw this in theaters, the audience was engaged by every scene; one moment the crowd was laughing at an improvised rap about pineapple upside-down cake, and the next we were staring down a dark hallway and waiting with baited breath for a crazed grandma to come lunging at the camera. During the oven scene, the theater got quieter than I've heard in a long time.In a genre oversaturated with found-footage films, The Visit will likely go down as one of the few that uses the medium to its advantage. There is no end to the creative angles, and at times it's easy to forget that this is a found-footage film at all.In short, the apocalypse may well be upon us?M. Night Shyamalan made another great movie! I certainly hope this is a sign of things to come from him, because it's been too long since I've enjoyed a Shyamalan movie for the reasons that he intended. Hell, it may even be worth seeing twice, if only to see your friends' reactions.</fullReview>

That's a good thing because the movie was clearly trying to focus on being just as funny as it wanted to be creepy. But most of the time the children felt too artificial and fake outside of those few moments. The sister is an over the top aspiring filmmaker and the brother is a mildly amusing aspiring rapper. Their quirks work some of the time but most of the time they felt too fake for its own good. Which didn't help things considering the movie is roughly 80% of those two characters talking directing into the camera.Which leads into my next point, why did this need to be found footage? Because everything that can go wrong with found footage, basically went wrong here. Shaky camera at times when the movie should be building suspense or tension in the scene. Instead all we are seeing is the camera rolling around as the operator is fleeing from the scene. Or if someone is being attacked or running, we can't see a damn thing. Or at other times, characters are fiddling with a camera during an illogical situation. I appreciate trying to mask the found footage process by explaining the daughter is trying to make a documentary, but it's unnecessary none the less.While The Visit may have scenes of characters acting completely strange or odd, there isn't a sound atmosphere to maintain an actual sense of unease. Things may get weird, but never do they feel suspenseful and that has to be the main problem. Something odd happens and then we jump to the following day knowing things are going to get progressively worse. It's not that the movie is predictable (it isn't) but we as an audience sort of know how the structure will play out.If you get a chance and want to see a horror movie with a strong atmosphere, check out Austria's official entry to the 2016 Academy Awards, Goodnight Mommy instead of this (It also opened today, but in a limited number of theaters). So is this the return for Mr. Shyamalan? Hell no, but he's slowly returning to form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror, without the horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror, without the horrorPlease note: this is my first review and English is not my native language.So, I was really looking forward to this movie. I am currently working in a movie theatre, so I am always up to date to the latest trailers and movies. This one in particular seems really intriguing. The trailer was great and I really wanted to see all of it.There I was, Premi?re night of The Visit. I started great! The setting, the characters and the whole feeling were really good. The whole "amateur made video" kind of view was not really original, but the reason for doing so was oke. A brother and sister, who had never seen their grandparents before, were to visit them in a old and remote house. I was expecting a lot of "jump scares" and other scary scenes, because that is where the movie seems to be going. But this movie is labeled a "thriller", and not a "horror", so the waiting took while. All the aspects were perfect for a horror movie. The setting and story could have been a great horror. Unfortunately, there were no scary parts or other frightening scenes. Instead, there were a lot of unsatisfying scene endings. The story was oke and well told. Some scene were meant to have a lot depth, but failed to come through The second half of the movie was better. More interesting things happened, but not as good as it could have been. I was looking forward to the plot twisting , crazy and sinister scenes, but they fail to happen.In the end it was kind of surprising, although this could have been more. Don't expect a great horror, because this is not one. It is tense and exciting, but fails to make you feel scared in some way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shymalan has redeemed himself; best horror experience in the theater of my life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the commercials for this movie whilst watching Sharknado 3 (2015, that's a review for another day), and I immediately thought, "I am SO seeing that! I don't even care if it's a Shymalan film." As you know, M. Night Shymalan has released a lot of junk in the past few years (The Happening, Lady in the Water, The Last Airbender, After Earth, nothing superior since The Sixth Sense), but this film, surprisingly, is highly redeeming! It isn't the best film of the year, or of all time, but I remember when I saw it in the theater, I was at the edge of my seat.The twist ending, which I will not reveal if you haven't seen the movie yet, is something I, even as an experienced moviegoer, didn't see coming. There are clues that foreshadow the ending, like usual, but they at first don't seem important or worthy of remembering. Also, the action at the end was insane for a PG-13 rated movie. In my opinion, the best parts were the nighttime scenes in which we see what the grandparents are up to at night. They do the most bizarre, scariest, and most disgusting things, including, but not limited to, Exorcist-style vomiting while walking, scratching a door butt-naked, etc.Seeing this film in the theater was also the first time in forever I got scared during a horror movie. Normally, I seldom, almost never, get scared during a horror movie, since I love them so much. However, there is a jump-scare at one point, which, seeing on a big screen, did make me jump. But I laughed about it afterward.Overall, The Visit is not a perfect film, but seeing it on the big screen and being able to leave the theater saying it was great, is awesome. Even if not viewing it on the big screen, it's a movie you should check out if you're into horror and Twilight Zone-style twist endings. Also, if you have lost all faith in M. Night Shymalan, please, I beg of you all, watch this movie; you will regain faith in him. I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad as these reviews suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the trailer is pretty nice. So i wanted to see the movie. It was not the best horror of the year, but it was pretty entertaining. I would say it is more like a soft horror movie, not a lot of blood and very scary scenes, but it has a few jumps here and there. The actors are definitely interesting and make a whole movie come together. I loved, loved, loved the ending. Very unpredictable. It is worth sitting through the movie, even is if some scenes are slow. The reason why I am giving this movie a 9 is because I absolutely hate the hand hold camera/documentary bullshit. That was the worst part. So except for the paranormal activity camera style, I enjoyed everything else. Worth seeing with the fam on a lazy Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like Shyamalan has found his story telling voice again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you begin your career with a movie like The Sixth Sense, so much is expected of you. When your films start to decline, and then not do well at all, it's easy for people to lose faith in your talents. I'll admit, after The Village, I thought Shyamalan may have run out of things I would enjoy watching. I am happy that The Visit has restored my opinion of his movies. Hopefully he can keep it up!Shyamalan did an excellent job of keeping the tension going throughout the movie. Weird things start happening the first night, and at first it's easy for the grandparents to just say it's old age. But after a few days, both of the kids really start to question it. The sister can still justify things, but the brother starts to get really creeped out. When I saw the previews I thought this was going to be a found footage film, and those are one of my least favorite type of movies. So I was happy to find out it wasn't. The sister is making a documentary, so there are times when we are seeing the scene through the camera lens, but it really works for this film. Besides the "amateur" camera work, the camera angles in the film really help with capturing the tension.Often I figure out the twist in a book or movie, well before the ending, but not in this case. Because of that, it made this movie even more enjoyable to me. I figured it out about a minute before the brother and sister did, so Shyamalan did a marvelous job in the script writing. Oh, and the one scene at the end (you'll know which one), really, really grossed me out. But that just added another element to this movie to make it even more enjoyable.If you liked Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs or The Village, I think you'll enjoy The Visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The M. Night Shyamalan we knew and loved is back, baby! "The Visit" is a wickedly-entertaining and occasionally spine-tingling dose of pure, unadulterated horror-comedy-fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's have a little history lesson, shall we?Back in 1999, the world was rocked by the release of an excellent horror film that harkened back to the sort-of classic haunted-house chillers that thrilled audiences since the dawn of film. I am of course referring to the wonderful "The Sixth Sense"... a film that even to this day holds itself high as a prime example of fantastic storytelling thanks to a wonderful and unpredictable script, and some very solid visual direction courtesy of then-unknown filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan.Shyamalan rode the wave of "The Sixth Sense" with two more similarly excellent films... "Unbreakable"- a dramatic and slow-burning take on the idea behind superhero-mythos. And "Signs"- a personal and thrilling horror film about isolation and the loss of faith, set against the backdrop of an alien invasion storyline.Shyamalan could do no wrong. He was called the next Spielberg... even the next Hitchcock.Then... well, "The Village" happened. It was a misstep... most seem to agree. But we shrugged it off, telling ourselves "Hey, every great artist makes at least ONE bad film... his next one will be better!"Then "Lady in the Water." "The Happening." "The Last Airbender." "After Earth." Jeez dude... are we even sure this is the same guy who brought us "I see dead people"?No longer were audiences eagerly awaiting the next Shyamalan epic. Because after three great films, his fall from grace seemed to grow exponentially with each new release. But I didn't give up. I know that the mind who gave us those three masterpieces had to have at least one more good film in him. I had to keep my faith in him, even if his track-record begged me to differ.And thankfully, that faith paid off with "The Visit"... a wickedly entertaining horror-comedy done in the popular "found-footage" style that for the first time in over a decade, reminds us just why we fell in love with Shyamalan to begin with.We follow two young children- sister Rebecca and brother Tyler- as they prepare to visit their grandparents for the first time. Because of the rift that had formed between her mother and her grandparents, teen- aged Rebecca decides to film their visit as a personal documentary project. However, despite a pleasant beginning to their week-long stay, things start to seem... strange. And it becomes clearer with each passing day that "Nana" and "Pop-Pop" might not just be the eccentric elderly folk their grandchildren initially suspected them of being... no, they may be darker, more dangerous presences that could bring them face to face with a dark fate...It's hard to discuss this film without going into dreaded spoiler- territory due to the simplicity of the proceedings, so I want to remain as vague as possible. But the strength in the film really revolves around the excellent cast of relative-unknowns and the wonderful execution of a simple concept that lends itself well to both great laughs and terrifying thrills.And this definitely is through-and-through a horror-comedy, with Shyamalan's trademarks of "quirky characters and humor" and "tense, isolated fear" playing perfectly within the confines of the film. I particularly admired a wonderful scene where the children play hide- and-seek together, only to be ambushed by their grandmother in a sequence that delivers both some genuinely startling gasps of shock before paying off an awkwardly amusing punchline that leaves the audience uneasy.There's also a lot to be said for the film's more emotional moments, mainly pertaining to the "talking heads" interviews Rebecca records with the characters for her documentary. It gives the film an organic way to really explore the depths of the emotional pathos everyone is feeling without having to rely on contrived dialog exchanges. And it's an example of the film's "found footage" style working to the story's advantage, while many other such "found footage" films arguably work against the story.I really can't help but hope now that between this film and the pretty-darned-good "Wayward Pines" (which M. Night produces) that Shyamalan is starting to re-claim his throne in the world of modern filmmaking. And it finally makes me excited again to watch for his new films and projects.I give "The Visit" a good 8 out of 10. It's got a lot of laughs. Some great spine-tingling moments. And is a welcome return to form for a director after a rough-patch. Here's to hoping for more great bits of fun like this from Shyamalan in the future!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all keep watching what M Night Shyamalan keeps putting out there in the hopes that one day he'll return to the craftsmanship of The sixth sense and Unbreakable. I loved this movie. It was a back to basics simple concept but excellently executed. It will genuinely have you shouting at the screen telling those kids to get the hell out of that house. WHY WOULD YOU GO IN AN OVEN !!.... I was sceptical as to how the found footage camera-work was going to be presented as the shaky hand held nature of these films can be nauseating but the choice to use a an obvious 'steadycam' technique actually made the film a lot more watchable and let the viewer concentrate on the story. It contains one of the best old school jump scares in recent memory and has great performances from the two young leads. YAHTZEE...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many i was quite tired of this guys movies. The last one i liked was The Village. Mainly because it was beautifully shot and excellently acted. It seems like every couple of years i give one of his films a go and walk away thinking "aw come on, you know you can do better". Not being a filmmaker myself, i realise its easy to criticise everything you see (a point a lot of reviewers on here seem to miss). But i always had hope that eventually M.Night would once again deliver.Its not perfect (what film is, except a very small few), but this film weirded me out so much more than i was expecting, and i was impressed that he could still do that. I don't write reviews, mainly because i think that they are rarely a good indicator of a film these days. Here on IMDb you can find the full spectrum of people slating and praising movies like they are experts, and i don't wish to add to that.I will say though, that those of us who had given up on M.Night Shyamalan, can breathe a sigh of relief. Watch this simple, low budget story and you will remember why he became a well known name.</fullReview>

I knew it wouldn't be what I wanted when the kid started rapping. I was like "oh god, I bet this will be the "joke" in the movie, RIGHT?" and rest of the movie was generic brother and sister being mildly suspicious while the mental "grandparents" tried to not act crazy for a week, THEN kill them. Like what? that's your plan? and twist was their insane and not really their grandparents. WOW WHAT A TWIST! Also the only scares were cheap jump scares and the all things that make (most) shaky cam movies bad or unrealistic so if you want to watch an over hyped mess of horror movie watch this.

		<fullReview>I can understand the mix of love &amp; hate for this film. There are some really jarring and disappointing things about it, which may prevent enjoyment of the film as a whole. My primary issue with the film is that is is yet another found footage film. Worse, it lazily doesn't even try to answer the problem with that genre - the "why are they still filming this?" issue. It's particularly noticeable in the scenes where Becca is in jeopardy - yet still filming herself in the mirror rather than looking for danger. Is she supposed to be THAT self-obsessed?If you're able to get past that, and a number of other parts of the story where the characters behave completely illogically (JUST RUN AWAAAYY!!!) for plot purposes then you might be able to enjoy the film. For the most part I liked it for the creepy atmosphere and the way is slowly ramps up the tension. Also, it's one of the few movies I've seen to take the real issue of dementia and just push it a little further to take it into the realms of horror. Of course it doesn't match the classic "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" which this film could have done to take a few lessons from.On the whole, I'd say I enjoyed it more than I didn't enjoy it. Yes, the child actors sound like 30 year olds but they are likable for the most part. Agreed the rapping is cringeworthy but I think it's supposed to be (at least I hope so). MNS has said he intended the film to be more of a comedy than a horror, so if you are a horror fan you should expect him to back away from true horror and more toward "tension" in the final act. But it IS pretty tense, and I have to give all concerned credit for that.As for the pointless "We've all learned something from this, and everything is fine" conclusion (no PTSD here!) you could honestly skip this section of the film altogether and not feel cheated.</fullReview>

I'm in the theater now, cheap matinée day for older releases. I just realized its a cam corder movie. DoI walk-out? I was tempted. But the child actors kept it interesting so I toughed it out to the end. The twist in the story wasn't much of a surprise and I pretty much figured it out when the doctor showed up at the house.

		<fullReview>I don't think, for one, that there are any spoilers in this but I have to say there are in case you figure certain things out, I guess. I really have little to say except I wish I had seen the cost of the film first would have realized there couldn't be much to it, and indeed there wasn't. Even less. Once you knew what was happening (after an hour into it) there was nothing else to say but beware the awfulness that follows. It is a shameful waste of film, cast and crew and Universal should not have allowed it to be distributed. Horrible horrible movie. IMDb says I have to have ten lines to submit this - The movie is not worth two lines, sigh, but it is about two youngsters sent to their grandparents for a week while their Mom frolics with her boyfriend. They began to notice changes in the oldsters and tell Mom but she advises calm. The audience is made aware that on two visits by outsiders from town, the grandparents are "not at home" - we're not shown where they are but the assumption is that they are out for a walk or something. Once the major plot twist occurs all hell breaks loose (loosely speaking) and the Mom after a skype call becomes agitated and advises the children to be careful. Still an awful movie. Wouldn't even make a good short story over ten pages. It didn't make sense (why the grandparents were weird) and well I'm stopping now because I'm getting a headache thinking about it. Nothing good about it except the young boy (Ed Oxenbould)and his performance. I have seen many many movies in my lifetime and have found some good in almost all of them. Not this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit is a genuine surprise. It marks a return to form for director M.Night Shyamalan after his last (moderate) big budget movies.His new feature looks like his first films, thanks to a minimalist touch and a perfect command of the story, camera and characters.In some moments the location reminds the one seen in The Village, with the woods surrounding the main setting. The story starts slowly but it is immediately engaging, and drags the viewer in a claustrophobic setting of an isolated grandparents farm.And, like in previous Shyamalan classics, the climax is both surprising and shocking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people has dubbed "The Visit" as the grand return of M. Night Shyamalan - it's hard to even review a title of his without dipping into his less than fortunate release history of the past recent years - but the truth is, The Visit is not his return, nor it is his finest hour. It is, however, a surprisingly entertaining mix of creepy, funny, and insightful. And it's not for everyone. But if you're smart enough to keep your eyes opened, you will get the joke.The story here is Becca and Tyler's - aged 12 and 8, respectively - who are on their way to meet their grandparents, whom they've never met due to a big fight her mother had with her parents before the kids were born. The cookie-cutter grandparents - named here as Nana and Pop-Pop - are just as you'd expect - typical American, warm and a bit quirky. Oh yes, the big thing is that Becca is making a documentary of the whole trip, something she hopes will be, as she calls it, an elixir to mend the broken relationship between her mother and her parents.Almost right off the bat, things get real weird. Tyler - a typical 8-year-old womanizer with the self esteem of Kanye West (and rapping skills not far off him) may provide the comical relief in the movie and be the source of all good jokes, but he's also the first one who smells a rat. Becca, on the other hand, a mature, educated and patient little lady, is more prone to write off all weirdness happening to their grandparents as sad acts of getting old. Her mother shares her theory during one of the Skype sessions.But the weird things get more and more frequent and more and more undeniable. As soon as the kids find an explanation for one thing, two other pop up, and by the end of the trip, the kids are ready to go home, which is, as you would probably guess, where everything gets from bad to worse.Shyamalan is smart about things. He mixes all kinds of clichés and inspirations from all kinds of places - there's a nod to Psycho, to Halloween, Paranormal Activity, and Becca's found-footage-first-person-view-filming style is an obvious reference to the Blair Witch Project. The grandparents' names are also a nod to classic-American family, and as we go along, you become more aware of those references, but they do not feel forced nor overused. Maybe because they really aren't - Shyamalan uses them with great restriction, and smartly shifts the mood from scary to funny to nostalgic to creepy again. It's all organic and natural, mature and fluid. The trick is - no expectations. If you live with the notion "The Visit" is just another "The Village" or "Sixth Sense" yes - you will be greatly disappointed. And you really shouldn't be: "The Visit" is a tasty piece of cinema, by all means not a return of the director, but a more distinct and mature direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that dances in wonderful tension and provides a satisfying conclusion. (No spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit: 2015Firstly, my score reflects a personal enjoyment, and shouldn't be confused with a professional critique where I knit pick everything to establish some kind of snobbish superiority toward films.Now, personally, I'm an M. Night Shyamalan fan when it comes to his style of story telling. So whenever I walk into an M. Night Shyamalan flick, I always just tell myself to shelve the expectations... And enjoy the mind @#$% for what it is."The Village" would be a wonderful example of that.When I first started to watch this film, I almost wrote it off for a Fallout 4 session, especially when nothing seemed to happen for the first 30 minutes... but I'm really glad I didn't.The story revolves around two children who are meeting their grandparents for the first time. The mother, hasn't spoken to the grandparents in over 15 years, and refuses to confess why.Regardless of the mother's differences with her parents, the children insist on meeting them, but not without the idle protests of their protective mother... She of course ends up getting bought off with a Carnival Cruise by her boyfriend though, and ultimately allows the trip to happen being she still has love for her parents, and even concedes "they are good people" prior to letting the children go... So it doesn't exactly strike you as a set up for a horror film.The kids meet their grandparents and there is a bit of comedy that revolves around the generation gap, but everything seems pretty normal, at first...As the children continue their stay, they notice their grandparents are behaving rather strangely at times, the grandfather is distant often and the grandmother seems emotionally conflicted at times.Nothing unusual... Just old people with strong personalities right?Yes... Unusual behavior from gandma after 9pm, grandpa giving the creepy eyeball while he mutters to himself about diner dates, bloody rags in the shed... A mystery of some sort begins to reveal itself, but you're not quite sure what to think as it all presses forward.We only know that grandma and grandpa may have some issues of their own... Which heh, is pretty normal right? I know my own mom can get a little freaky with her own neurotic behavior at times, surely, but I never hold it against her... I just write it off as eccentric mom and let it go.And so do the kids in this film. They just shrug their shoulders and let it go.One off event, followed by another, and eventually the children start to truly suspect that their grandparents are fighting a few demons of their own indeed.As the visit continues, seemingly irregular behavior increases and the children start to become more concerned with the passing of every day. At first it was only concern for their new found grandpa and grandma... But by mid week, the children indeed begin to worry for their own safety.One event leads to another, until a shocking truth is revealed... And the tension up to the expected twist is quite satisfying. Without revealing anything, I can't say any more about the plot than I have.I will say it was a conclusion that was well worth the wait though.9 out of 10.Regarding any personal reflections on the film in its aftermath...As a parent, I was completely horrified by 15-20 minutes to close, but the true adventure was the mystery "up to that point." If you want a good thrill with an exceptionally well written script, this is certainly your film.Regarding the performances and style?I have to say that the children did a great job making me absolutely love their characters by the end. Grandma &amp; grandpa were outstanding as well.Everything was beautifully thrown together in the style of amateur footage, but really, this is the kind of film that you can really get into because its "all about the characters and the mystery, not the camera angles or video effects." The camera angles won't matter for this one, the story on the other hand absolutely shines. Although... there "is" a very well cut scene under the house that even makes you wonder what kind of film this will become (Mainly being at that point, you don't know if this is going to go super natural or stay non- fiction.)People who enjoy good story telling will love this. Adrenalin junkies and Special FX consumers won't be as impressed.At the end of the day, it would seem that M. Night Shyamalan's gift for story telling doesn't really need a budget, just a great setting and wonderfully portrayed characters.Highly recommended.Nathaniel Jones, Music Designer Protilius Productions</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie - it could happen to you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any of us can experience what the kids had to go through in "The Visit". Watch it and you'll see. A movie with some very tense, scary and crazy scenes. The bad side was: I got bored in some scenes because of the exaggerated monotony. The scenario of the movie is simple: a big house in the woods. At night, strange things happens as you can see in the trailer, and the kids starts to try finding out what's going on. In general, I think the soundtrack was weak, but nothing wrong with it, because it still fits the scenes. Also, the movie contains at least 3 jump scares. Anyway, this is a movie for those who enjoy suspense and horror. You'll be very surprised with the ending... Totally worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit is a very well put together movie. However, some of the scenes felt a bit rushed, such as the Grandma playing "hide and seek" with the kids in the beginning parts of the film. Though after a while you get used to the suspense. Plus, this movie is not scary as it is creepy and disturbing. There are like 1 or 2 jumpscares in this movie,just to prepare you. Anyways, In my opinion, the movie could have been better and longer mostly due to the fact that this is, after all, an M. Night Shamylan movie, you would mostky expect the big twist to ocure pretty early and believe me it kind of does. But it didn't affect the way I felt about the film at all, it actually shocked me. Would I go see this movie again? Yes. Would I own it in my own home? Probably not. Would I recommend this movie to others? Definitely, it is a great movie. Just a reminder, the brother DOES rap quite a few times in this, some may think it's dumb, I will admit, I did at first, but as the movie goes on, you will have a laugh about it. Please go see The Visit and enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like supernatural horror.... :-(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the trailer and the hype about the movie, I was looking forward to a good old horror movie--not the slasher type, but the supernatural type. I was disappointed. It was a thriller. It did have some scares, and one time I actually jumped--a little. And I didn't figure "it" out until I was supposed to, which was satisfying--I hate figuring out a plot twist too early. But, it was not a supernatural-type horror movie.The movie started off very slowly. I actually found much of the first half quite funny, but I don't know if it was supposed to be. The kids' dialogue was not believable, the premise was not believable (what parent sends her two kids off on a train to grandparents she's been estranged from for years and her kids have never met???) and the kids' acceptance for the crazy actions of the "grandparents" was far from believable. Wait a minute. I gave this movie a 6 at first. After writing this, I downgraded it to a 5. And that's probably too high. But I've seen worse!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nail in the coffin for Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than any other director in history, I've given M. Night Shyamalan more chances to redeem himself. I want to like his films, I really do. I want to see him knock one out of the park like he did with The Sixth Sense. But after giving The Visit my full attention and coming into it with an open mind, I think it's time to call it quits on Shyamalan. There were moments in The Visit that were teetering on creepy, there were moments that were teetering on funny, but to call this film a horror comedy would be giving it far too much credit in either of those genres. Making the young leads so precocious and irritating (the 13 year old boy raps 3 times in the film) does no favours to an already weak narrative. Nor does the needless found-footage style of filmmaking, which seems forced and extremely poorly executed. In terms of storytelling, there were countless continuity errors, scenes that had no relevance, jump scares to make up for genuine horror, and two of the least likable leads in Shyamalan's entire filmography. All in all, I'd avoid this one at all costs. Just watch one of the two decent films he's made instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've rarely been moved to publicly review a movie here before but the sheer fact that this movie is being touted as a comeback or reinvigoration for M Night simply made me feel that I had to say something. This is the kind of movie that makes you wish you could ask for the 90 minutes or so of your life back. I went into this with hope, hope that it would be worthwhile, my hopes were dashed. Maybe it's just me, but there seemed to be a severe lack of suspense, even though I believe that was supposed to be the hook for this movie.I enjoyed Shaknado 3 more than thisAnd I didn't really enjoy that, but at least it did what was supposed to, The Visit didn't do anything that it was supposed to.Edit to add: I would love for someone to explain to me why this is such a love it/hate it movie, there seems to be little middle ground for this. As well as explain that, I would also like to have a clear explanation of what makes this a good movie, so far all I've seen in the reviews here are sychophantic ramblings which I can only assume are paid for positive reviews</fullReview>

So the trailer was looking spooky enough I decided to give it a go?. The movie was kinda slow, the kids joking around, I wouldn't joke around about my grandma holding a knife at my door?. The twist "THESE ARE NOT YOUR GRANDPARENTS" kinda shook me, but from there on the movie went down hill, sadly. The jump scares were lame, the loony old folks were boring, and the found footage is so tiring! My face stayed numb for the whole last 20 minutes or so. The ending was pathetic, choice of score and all, the credits with the kid rapping about poop?really?! Is that your style Night? My husband fell asleep during. I actually woke him up o tell him he didn't miss anything, that I was SO disappointed, falling for another Night flop. Damn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haters going to hate. The movie was pretty good but it wasn't great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a good film and I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it. There were some genuinely creepy scenes and circumstances in the film. I think some of the more super negative reviews on here are from people who are still angry at the director for his previous films. And that is very understandable. The man his released some films that were criminally bad. But this is not one of them.The movie falls in the genre of found footage even though it's not really so much "found" as it is footage. The daughter of a single mother wants to understand the bitter feelings between her grandparents and her mom. Mom's going on a cruise and the estranged grandparents have offered to look after the kids. Mom agrees because they are after all their grandchildren who should have an opportunity to meet their grandparents. This is not an improbable and crappy scenario from which to build a story. Haters are going to hate.This is a horror film. A for real horror film! It doesn't rely on stupid jump scares and loud bangs. There isn't even any background music! It's all very disturbing imagery without being gory and alarming behavior by the antagonists. It's a good movie! I never thought I would say that again about something made by M.N.S. Having said all that it's not perfect. I have watched hundreds possibly thousands of horror films. And the worst part of any great horror film is there ending. It's obviously the hardest thing in the entire world of filmmaking to stick the ending of a horror film. And like 1 million horror films before it The Visit stumbles right at the end. Despite that though it doesn't ruin the entire film and it's at least palatable and non-offending to your intelligence. M. Night has not earned my trust back and it will take at least two more movies before I ever spend a dollar of my own money to see one of his films in the theater but this was a damn good start!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review, for a while now I've been wanting to start writing reviews and an anger for this is I guess the trigger. This is one hell of a piece of shite movie, i'm not even gonna do it the honors and call it a movie. But first of all my rage comes from relative positive reviews of this thing. Most of them are like it's not bad, Shyamalan is back or something like that, and that it actually has humor in it. People said that this actually has humor in it. Mind blown. Now to get my point of view I think Shyamalan's best movie is The Happening. I don't care for him as a director, I don't care for his movies, and yes I think the money that goes to him should be given to a newcomer or some great European director to see what will they do in America. I'd like to see that. I'm not gonna talk about this thing, it's really not worth it, I'd rather watch the dumbest American college movie than this. It's insulting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step in the right direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that i loved some of Mr. Shyamalan's early work, like The sixth sense and Unbreakable, hell i even enjoyed Signs. But then came his downfall, one miss after another, and prior to this movie i had no hope for him.The only reason i went to see this is because there really weren't any other movies to watch at the time. I walked in with zero expectations, and i must say i walked out quite pleasantly surprised.The plot is simple, but told very effectively. The "found footage" style of storytelling rarely "works" for a movie, but here it really helps you get more immersed. The camera is fairly steady, and shaky only when it really needs to be. The actors did a great job, especially the kids. Too often these days children in movies can be summed up by one word - annoying. Not this brother and sister. They connect with the audience, you laugh when they laugh and you are scared when they are. The grandparents are also good, really giving off that spooky, unsettling vibe. I must admit i was a bit skeptical when i saw that this is in fact a mix of horror and comedy. But Mr. Shyamalan pulls it off brilliantly. The movie will have you laughing while feeling chill crawling up your spine. Quite a unique feeling.The actor who portrays the brother is clearly very gifted for comedy, considering that most of the laughs come from him.Despite of this being a "simple" movie (although it tries dealing with more serious issues, but without consistency), i would highly recommend it. It feels very fresh, and i wont say Mr. Shyamalan is back on track, but i have to admit that this is a solid step in the right direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since The Village I have always walked into a Shayamalan movie with the lowest of expectations. That was reinforced by Lady in the Water and cemented as my mindset with The Happening. These movies, along with a lack of children or any interest in the stories, made it easy for me to skip The Last Airbender and After Earth.So I was intrigued when I heard that Shayamalan took his fat check from the Will Smith story written turd to self finance a smaller movie to regain artistic control over his films. After seeing the first trailer I felt something I hadn't felt since halfway through The Village, excitement for a Shayamalan movie. I avoided seeing any more footage or trailers to keep myself in the dark about any possible spoilers or the trademark Shayamalan twist. However, I still kept my expectations low because we've all been fooled by a good trailer (I'm looking at you, A-Team.)The Visit exceeded these expectations. I'm not a huge fan of found footage films, mind you, but this one is the exception. The Visit tells the story of two teenagers who visit their grandparents for the very first time. The reason we're told that it has taken this long for these family members to finally meet is because the children's mother, played very well by Kathryn Hahn, ran away from home and hasn't spoken to them since.The older child, Becca, documents this visit with the hopes of reuniting her mother and grandparents, hence the found footage format. Along with Becca is her younger brother, Tyler, a kid who spends a good amount of the film rapping. As time goes by, the kids begin to notice strange behavior from their grandparents, particularly their grandmother after dark. They soon find out their grandparents are far from what they expected.My biggest problem with found footage movies has always been the shaky camera. I get it. Someone holding a camera who is running would shake the crap out of it. But when you mainly use that as your source of suspense, a shaky angle where our protagonist is running and screaming, it's a problem for me. This film unfortunately contains that trope but uses it to a lesser extent. The real thrills come from this movie in moments, flashes. A kind of did I just see what I think I did moment. The movie had it's share of jump scares, of course, but once again not overplaying it.The acting in this movie was fairly good in general, exceptional for a Shayamalan film. The only character I had a problem with was Tyler but his acting was well. He's a teenage boy with confidence, teenage boys with confidence are annoying, and he annoyed me, so kudos to the performance. Both Peter McRobbie and Deanna Dunagan do a great job of creeping you out as the grandparents but the star of this is Olivia DeJonge as Becca. It is through her perspective we mostly see this story and it's her performance that really stuck with me after I left the movie.Now on to the story, how it plays out, and most importantly, the twist.SPOILERS BELOW!!!So as the week of this visit goes on and the kids finally fear for their safety and call their mother to pick them up right away. After showing the elderly couple to their mother via Skype, the mom reveals those are NOT their grandparents. Turns out these people murdered the real grandparents and are assuming their identities. After this revelation the old people really start to lost their sanity and try to kill the children. The children survive, of course, and are reunited with their mother.As far as the twist goes, I liked it, it served the story well, but you could see it coming from a mile away. The entire time through the movie I thought that could be the twist and it was only confirmed with every scene where the mother could have identified her parents but she didn't. The other twist that I thought could have been possible was that this was all an elaborate prank on the children. And I gotta say, it would have been a GREAT movie albeit with a morbid ending if it were both. If the mom had driven up alone at the end instead of with the police and said, "got ya! they ARE your grandparents!" and these kids just murdered them? Awesome! It didn't happen but I wish it had.All in all, I rather enjoyed this movie. The suspense was good, the story was told well, but the twist was just too obvious. The movie had more good moments than bad. Yes, it was gross but that dirty diaper to the face scene was awesome. Some of the jokes didn't really land for me but comedy is the most subjective thing ever next to beauty so I can't fault the movie too much for that.I think that this was a step in the right direction for Shayamalan's career. Hopefully, this will lead him to having control once again of a studio feature. I think that this is a good movie for anyone looking for a decent scare or two for any occasion. A date, hanging with a buddy, or going to the theater with the family.6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shalaman reVisits good film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shalaman goes back to his roots of filmaking, and delivers us his best film since Signs. For the past decade Shalaman has delivered some of the worst films the industry has ever seen. He has given us films like after earth, the happening, lady in the water, and worst of all "the last airbender", which was the worst movie I have ever seen. These movies were all a disaster and quite frankly scare me. In 2015, Shalaman delivers us an actual horror movie, that scares me for all the right reasons. The Visit is a horror/comedy that delivers the right amount of scares and laughs to make this a very good film. The acting in this film is phenomenal. The two kids do a great job, especially the boy. The boy in this film gives us the comedy aspect to the film, constantly delivering laughs. The grandparents do a great job of scaring the crap out of you, and even the mom (Kathryn Hahn) was great, despite not seeing her often in the movie. The cinematography was good, and gave the movie a surreal feel. And like all Shalaman flicks, there is a twist at the end, but this is a twist the old mind of Shalaman would have come up with, not the recent mind of Shalaman.In conclusion, If your a horror fan looking for a gory/junmp scare flick with awful acting then this is not for you. But if your looking for a well made movie that will scare you, then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing that came to mind after the film was that it was solid. So it was pretty good, not amazing, but good. It had some classic horror elements to it while being a modern psychological horror film. The chosen filming style is difficult to do well, but in this case I think Shyamalan did a good job. When I evaluate the style I mostly ask myself if the scene is believable. Like for example if a zombie horde attacks your group, do you 1) focus on filming 2) put the camera down and focus on fighting for your life. Choosing the first option needs to lead to appropriate reaction by the rest of the group, if the film wants to remain believable. Like my reaction would probably be to smash the camera and the guy's face in.Overall I think it was well done and had all the right ingredients. It also did have some originality, but was missing that some special piece to make if perfect. Still best Shyamalan film since the Village.Also my wife was clinging to me and squeezing my arm in fear during half the movie, which made focusing slightly more difficult at times :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visit was a mixture of scary and humor. However, I think it leaned more towards a humorous scary movie. From the beginning of the movie, as the viewer I could tell it was going to be funny. The children videoed everything making the film even more interesting. Once the children got to their " grandparents" house the old people were acting weird and everything they didn't wasn't scary it was hilarious. I also like the plot twist at the end because it not only added more humor but I could see that the producers were trying to make it have a scary affect. This is by far a great movie and i would watch this over and over again because it was very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I am giving it a 10 because the other users have not and I want the rating to go up. Why? Because after a long wait Shyamalan has finally delivered. The visit is scary and funny like when someones jumps in on you for a scare and you start laughing after they have scared the the bejesus out of you. I have never been a big fan of the amateur handy-cam movie making genre but this one is different because it does not have unrealistic CGI or strange shadows, instead the scare is more real and the credit goes to the actors. The plot may seem basic because of the simplicity in style the movie is shot, but as you get closer to the climax you start connecting dots and see the complexity, not in the plot but in the story telling for which Shyamalan is greatly known. The star of the movie is this young talent Ed Oxenbould, an Australian actor who did a great job at handling American accent on top of it Rapping through the movie. Ed was funny and mature as an actor which a lot of older actors fail to do sometimes and what Shyamalam has always had an eye for in young actors like Haley Joel or Abigail Breslin. So kudos! All in all, not a perfect 10, more like a 7.8. If you liked Signs ( won't compare this to the sixth sense) go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found The Visit to be very well played by all four main characters, very funny(!) and scary as sh*t sometimes. Usually scary and funny together is a recipe for disaster if you ask me, but in The Visit - it works very well. The found footage-thing is used in a realistic way and there is almost no scene where you think "there is now way the shot would be like that if this really was found footage" - as you often think when it comes to these kind of movies.I was on the edge of my seat for a very long time. When me and my friend paused the movie to go to the bathroom, neither of us could believe our eyes when we saw that we were only 31 minutes in.Besides being scary and funny, The Visit also has a nice drama element that actually makes you care about the characters which is something very rare in horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it reminded me very much of 'honeymoon', which is a very good thing cause i loved it too. the whole vibe of it stayed with me for a while.the anticipation was really high and although i saw a lot of horror movies, and there wasn't something totally new happening in this for let's say the first two thirds, it was not foreseeable. not at all. the twist at the end was fantastic and absolutely creepy - i wasn't expecting it at all and am appreciating it very much!even after the twist was exposed the last third was exciting till the last minute. i suppose the fact that most of the movie is centered on the kids and it didn't annoy me at all, shows how interesting and talented persons they are. what i realized just now - the movie is seamless in it's evolvement. there also was a resemblance to 'we are what we are' there, for me. but it didn't took that turn, although i was suspecting it midway through.so, for those people who like horror movies like 'insidious' for example, which are having a lot of loud sound effects - i would recommend setting the tone, so the creepiness underneath can breathe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit set in today is The Blair Witch Project structured with Wal-Mart stupidity. The movie finally opened after ten extra minutes of horror previews and my first thought please don't be another The Blair Witch Project. Really The Visit is much worse? At some point during the movie the mother of the two main characters, the children, refers to herself as a Wal-Mart employee. She puts her kids on an Amtrak train by themselves to go stay with her supposedly two elderly parents whom she has not seen in 20 years. It's like unloading and stocking the wrong Wal-Mart truck then someone realizes six days later the truck didn't even go to that store. Someone send IMS out to count every item on the shelf. Seriously! Pay attention to the girl's video introductions with each grandparent after they get off the Amtrak. It doesn't sound right.Learned stocking stands out. We see the kids hide the camera, but where do the elderly people have cameras hid? What stands out even more is the double play on both big and small business. What looks like a mom and pop cookie shop turns in our minds to the evil empire as the children's mother turns out to be a Wal-Mart employee and mom and pop have really taken over. The old man said they had to get out of here and that the man across the street was looking at him then the old man attacks the younger, smaller man; the same thing big business does. In the end we see how a couple young teenagers overcome both big and small business through the use of internet, cameras, and video editing.Product placement and marketing hides in this movie. Nearly every verse the boy raps refers to a product or service-"ho" or should I say Katy Perry. Depends, herbal essence, baking aisle, bakery, electronics, damaged goods discount, bakery, cigarettes, water, seasonal (costume party), soft lines (scarf, yellow sweater, jackets), sporting goods (gun), furniture (rocking chair), oven cleaner? Does anyone notice that the oven is built like an easy bake oven in the toy department? Who cleans an oven with a sponge? Who uses oven cleaner on electronics? Sex! The old man has no sex drive. This may be why he dislikes the boy because the boy is the only person in the movie who has a real sex drive. The old woman obviously has some mental, sexual issues. After checking out the girl while she is cleaning the oven the old woman suddenly wants to star in the girl's documentary. The old woman claws at a door naked in the middle of the night outside the children's bedroom and bangs a door open and closed like she wants some pussy. Not to mention she checks out the girl a second time while the girl cleaning the oven. Then there is the end like yeah freaking right. How many times can the Les hook the bed? Reference to World War II include the train ride to the concentration camp, the oven, and all the fighting because of a family fight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this simple. I watched the film last night and loved it, why? Because it did what it promised to and expecting more than that is your fault if you didn't like the film. It is a well crafted Comedy Horror with some genuine humor and genuine chills. All I can say is that you'll have a blast, if you know what you're walking into. I read some of the the reviews of people who disliked it and I was clueless as to what movie they have actually seen because what I saw was amazing. The movie is crafted with heart and subtlety. This movie deserves your buck, don't make that movie that you'll watch later on HBO and regret for missing it in the cinema. If you feel like watching it, just go watch it! Don't let another persons opinion on the film bar you from it. Who knows if you'll like it?!Finally I would like to say, Well done M Night! And Welcome Back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think it's one of Shyamalan's weakest movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE VISIT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A found footage horror/comedy flick, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It's his third film, in a row, to follow kids as the main protagonists (following the poorly received 'THE LAST AIRBENDER' and 'AFTER EARTH'). The story revolves around two kids meeting their grandparents for the first time, and filming a documentary on it, when things go horribly wrong. The movie stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. It was made on a budget of just $5 million; and it's been a decent critical, and financial, hit so far. I think it's one of Shyamalan's weakest movies.Becca (DeJonge) and Tyler (Oxenbould) are being sent, by their single mother (Hahn), to meet their grandparents (Dunagan and McRobbie) for the first time. Their mom had a falling out with her parents, fifteen-years earlier, and Becca wants to learn why. So she decides to make a documentary, on their experiences, during the 'visit'. It becomes obvious, very quickly, that something is seriously wrong, and terrifying, about their grandparents.The movie has a few good scares, and a somewhat surprising twist, but neither of these things are nearly as impressive as Shyamalan's earlier work. The film is also not nearly as emotional, as his earlier films, even though it tries to be (in places). It's funny, but not nearly as humorous as Shyamalan obviously thinks it is, and the two lead kid actors aren't very good. With the exception of 'THE SIXTH SENSE', Shyamalan doesn't seem to get very good performances, from any of the young actors in his movies; whether it's because of his directing, or their acting abilities, is not entirely clear. I wasn't nearly as impressed with this film, as a lot of the critics, and I don't think it's as good as even his last two movies (that's just my opinion though).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/5_iFqdaycDM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting this movie to be great after reading some reviews but some people don't always get it. I wonder if some people just go to random films not knowing what they are about and then slate them because it wasn't their cup of tea! The shaky home camera style is a bit annoying at times but see past that and see what is a very well put together horror film. This film is quite humorous and entertaining in a dark way and has a great twist that i didn't see coming like in Sixth Sense. Well cast and well written, good pace throughout, didn't feel slow or rushed and despite the shaky cam technique a good looking movie as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh Shyamalan... why do you keep mis-marketing your movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you would have probably guessed from the trailer, this is a found footage(-ish) movie. And let me tell you right of the bat... this is one of the best found footage movies i have ever seen!!Really, i created an account on IMDb, just to write my opinion about this movie to you. And you know why: because shyamalan completely mis-marketed his movie, again! Of his past movies, the village is the best example of one of his mis-marketings. People who went to see it were expecting a horror/thriller and people were excited for it! But what they eventually got was a romance movie, and that is where the hatred started. Okay, his movies from lady in the water through after earth were horrendous, but i thought the village actually was a decent romance movie; beautifully shot, great set design, great actors and so on. Whether you liked it or not, the mis-marketing of the village was the main reason for all the hate it got, and i'm afraid that this is exactly what is going to happen with his new movie 'the visit'. In the trailer, the visit is marketed as yet again another found footage movie, with all the cliché's and what not. When i went to see the visit, i was expecting exactly that and had really low expectations. Instead, what i got was a interesting, tense movie with lots of humour and a smart moral centre. Shyamalan is fully aware of what he is doing as he subletly ridicules movies within the same genre.The story starts off as brother (tyler) and sister (becca) are going on a trip to visit their grandparents. Because of the bad relationship the mother of the two kids has with the grandparents, becca and tyler have never met them. Before they go on their trip, becca decides to make a documentary about their visit to their grandparents and film the whole trip. that's where the camera footage comes in. Right from the start i was intrigued by the characters. Both of the kids have interesting personalities and have great chemistry together. The grandparents are great too, during the movie you are constantly questioning their behaviour. Are they just experiencing some elderly/mental illness, or is there something else going on? The movie can get pretty creepy, and the grandparents play a good part in that. It is one of the aspects that makes the movie so great, it keeps you interested as you want to find out what is going on. Apart from the tensity and the characters, the best part of the movie is it's humour. The kids are hilarious and are constantly making fun of the weird behaviour that their grandparents are showing. Even some of the 'scary' scenes aren't meant to be that scary, as the movie constantly has some subtle comedic vibe over it, and it's clear that shyamalan is doing it on purpose. Me and the rest of the theatre were laughing our asses off, even during some of the 'scary' parts. Although the movie is pretty funny, it doesn't get too ridiculous. The behaviour of te kids stays believable and natural during the movie, which is why the movie holds op as a comedy as well as a horror. During the movie, you're constantly expect something to happen, but instead the opposite happens. Shymalan is kind of teasing with your expectations you got from watching other movies in the same genre. The movie is free of most of the horror movie cliché's that you've come to hate. For example: no f*#$ing jumpscares, or at least barely.To top it all off, the movie has a surprisingly heartfelt moral centre. There are some back stories about the past and what the family has gone through, which lead to pretty emotional moments with a message that a lot of people can learn a thing or two about. All in all; i loved this movie! I was pleasantly surprised with the direction it took. It got me scared, excited, emotional and laughing out loud. There aren't many movies that can accomplish that! And guys, don't get fooled by the trailer and don't get fooled by bad reviews from people who were expecting a scary horror movie but instead got something completely different (just like in the village). Go see for yourself and then form your own opinion about it. Shyamalan has completely redeemed himself in my books, he still has it in him!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Glad I kept following Night Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of us I turned into an instant fan after The sixth sense. Over time I started to feel like many of us did. I know that no artist will produce gems a 100% of the time. Nor should he or she. As an artist you need to keep reinventing yourself. And I liked and sometimes relay liked the next few movies. I could even appreciate The Lady in the Water to a certain extent believe it or not. Still, I had to rationalize me following M.Night Shamyalan more and more. But I'm glad I hung in there. This was a complete surprise! I found myself praying that it would have a strong finish halfway through. And it didn't disappoint me in the least. Actually, it was the cherry on the cake.But apart from that moment in the middle,where I briefly started to reflect on how I felt about the movie, I was engaged deeply the rest of the time. A few shock moment, even a few real goosebumps. Loved it.One of the most coherent, solid movies by him in a long time. I guess it's true: urgency is the mother of all invention, but limitation (budget $5,000,000) is the mother of all inventiveness and creativity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sundowning..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE VISIT is topnotch terror, as far as I'm concerned, and M. Night Shyamalan is at the top of his form- which is saying a lot. Ed Oxenbould is a Find- and a Keeper. Although his character is a lisping Crapper (a Caucasian rapper), the kid's so f---ing funny that it works; and the rest of the cast of fresh faces are also a Plus. "People are scared of old people for no reason," we're told at one point. This is one of the (many) points that filmmaker David Cronenberg used to make from time to time (back when HE had something to say): that the process of AGING was truly terrifying to most people (and understandably so, as it most clearly underscores the Inevitability of Death). "I have the Deep Darkies," confides an Elder, and it's THIS line, which drives home the notion of "Sundowning," that's at the Dark Soul of THE VISIT. "Sundowning" is a very real condition, and has often led to suicide. There's a palpable sense of Place in THE VISIT which adds to the overall feeling of DREAD. The music is another Plus (and Tyler's final "rap" is f---ing hilarious).</fullReview>

There isn't any creepy creatures or somehow like a cult involved like what movies are nowadays. My sister and I though we're shouting like we're being chased while watching 'cause it's a hundred percent thriller. I loved the movie cause 1- Ed from the movie: Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day was here! 2- he's a natural comedian 3- sorry but I just love comedy- thriller/horror movies. It was very unpredictable, it has a good plot twist, perfect casting and setting. You guys should try watching it and I swear, you'll see what I'm talking about!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Visit' provides quite a disturbing storyline. For a movie like this, slotted down the "Horror" genre, a disturbing concept may be intended. The story was interesting, the actors played an average performance, and the theme did match perfectly with the storyline. One major disappointment was the deployment of found footage formatting, this was a horrible attempt to bring back originality. No. Nope. Nada. I didn't like it at all, in fact, I hated it so much that I got a headache during the second half of the film. In my opinion, using found footage formatting should only partly be done in a movie, the rest, leave it to the editors. Other than that, the movie was not that bad, but, using found footage was not to my liking. Some people may argue with this, however, what's a movie review without a dash of criticism.</fullReview>

In fact it might not be a film that is remembered when discussing horror movies that came out in September of 2015. That said, it was enjoyable enough to go see. There was a decent amount of scares when watching in the theatre, and we enjoyed ourselves while watching it. The character Tyler, played by Ed Oxenbould, was the standout character for me. He was incredibly fun to watch and added a lot of heart to the movie, really the only heart it had.

Lady in the Water wasn't for me and the Happening was a complete joke (really Marky Mark? I remember you promoting the film as the "scariest movie you've ever seen"). I skipped over Avatar: The Last Airbender and After Earth for obvious reasons. After assuming and then ultimately knowing the last two would tank, it was no surprise to me that "The Visit" would be the directors lowest studio budget film. When the trailers first released, I found myself itching to see it. Luckily last night I was able to do so. Viewers expecting to see a pure horror or pure comedy will be disappointed, its truly a film that falls in-between the two. Without giving anything away, know that while its not his strongest film, it truly makes up for a couple of his last bombs. I laughed, I cringed, I jumped and I ultimately enjoyed this film. I will give this movie a 7/10 and add it to my list of M. Night's "good" movies.</fullReview>

She films it all in an attempt to understand the estrangement, and he joins in - but things get weird. And fast.Oooh, so much quality to this. It's a 1st person POV story, but with two 1st persons, and the best shaky cam you'll ever see. Full of jokes about movie making, with gorgeous dialogue, acting and editing, but also a real sense of dread. And no jump scares, just a creeping confusion of menace. Muchos pleasure.Not a pure horror, because everything is explained rationally in the end. My fangs got drawn in at the reveal, which I think came a little early anyway - my one serious complaint. Also, the 1st person POV was strained in the climax, not quite believable. Plus it's Shyamalan, so horror fans are driven in to the shadows as hope reigns supreme.The music is judged perfectly for mood. Not familiar with the pieces, so worth looking into.Overall - every minute fascinating to watch as an experienced story teller draws in his audience. Not the greatest, but very clever and definitely worth watching again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I really liked this movie. I can certainly understand why the reviews are, mostly, a mix of "love it / hate it". This won't be for everyone.One thing that we look for in a Night film is that creepy factor and I personally got it in spades a bunch of times.Are there things I would change? OK sure. The final scene that Night added with the two kids - move that to the very end of the credits, if you must have it at all. And I agree with some other posters regarding where the "real ending" should have been - with the kids in the police car. The scene after that with the mother just wasn't needed and was just unnecessary. Less is more.What I would also like is if Night could have added a few clues that, if we were really paying attention, might have gotten us to figure out the reveal before the reveal. The kind of clues that most people PROBABLY would see on a second viewing but not as much the first time through. Now that he's made it, there will be all sorts of people saying that he could have done this or that, etc - well ... I'd LIKE to see an alt ending with a horror bent. From my black point of view, that would be better.Should the kids have been "more creep'd out" sooner? Hmmm ... well maybe, but their grandparents ARE old ... and old people have problems and aren't we all taught how darn UNDERSTANDING we all need to be all the time now? When the big reveal happened ... OMG ... I was floored. Awesome! Anyway, this movie won't be for everyone and I'm not keen on the constant use of the hand-held cam but it mostly worked here. The movie probably only really deserves an 8/10 for me but I'm giving it a 9 to help balance all the, IMO, overwhelmingly nasty 1/2 star reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off, it was an alright movie. Unfortunately though, you can only make old people so scary, which is a serious obstacle that "The Visit" has to overcome. They didn't execute it well and the grandmother just simply was not scary. Personally I feel like to make up for the non-scary grandmother they threw in this random plot twist that they "weren't the real grandparents", which is where I get my comment title "It was trying too hard". I would have understood if the grandparents went completely psycho due to disorders or another reason, but for them to throw that in there was basically the story writer shouting "The rest of this movie was bad and I'm backed up against a wall, so let me change the entire story in hopes to get good reviews from the audience". This entire movie was honestly just super weird and not scary and I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

The atmosphere is nonexistent and the movie even fails the cheapest of scares, jump-scares, which typically i wouldn't condone but this movie was in desperate need of even them. But as a comedy this is pure brilliance.

		<shortDescription>Breathing a Little Life into the Dead Found Footage Genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most intense final 20 minutes I've seen in some time. Shyamalan is the only director (outside of maybe Wes Anderson) whose movies I always look forward to, even though I'm usually a little or a lot disappointed. Maybe that's part of the appeal, as I keep coming back in hopes of him living up to his full potential, *this time*. The found footage genre is beat to death, but I think it has life to be flushed out by a creative mind, just like anything. It could've been much better, but was downright excruciatingly scary when it was supposed to be. I just hate you have to watch nearly three quarters of the movie for things to get warmed up. But, that's one of the hangups of this genre, and one I wish M. Night would've avoided.All in all, M. Night is still one of my favorite directors, if not only for the sheer character of his movies (some) and I look forward to his next masterpiece, whenever that might be. I definitely have faith in Shyamalan, something I'll never lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visiting Hours Have Been Over for Years, M. Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm guess this was supposed to be a horror-comedy. It's easy (and truthful) to say it failed miserably on both counts, but I will give it this: I did laugh out loud at all the unintentional moments, like all of M. Night films.Speaking of the egomaniac director, he is as consistently bad at making films as Adam Sandler is at making us cringe over and over again. Here, he actually takes a tiny bit of a decent idea and drowns it horribly in the unoriginal and failing found footage idiocy. Not that the movie would be okay without the thoughtless "technique," but I would've at least thought it might have been a tad bit scary and original.The movie is so horribly unfunny when it thinks it's hilarious, boring when it thinks it's horrifying and actually rips off Paranormal Activity but, unbelievably makes it even less interesting. And sadly, like most unintentionally hilarious M. Night movies, the super slow scenes meant for tension still never pay off. Further, it also rips off my favorite (for laughing at, that is) of all M. Night's films: The Happening. The Grandmother mopes around like the characters in his Plants Kill comedy. I couldn't help but laugh once again at what M. Night finds scary.Well, maybe I'll take back all I said above. If you do like unintentionally hilarious ("Yahtzee!") movies like I do, you might like this. I laughed so hard in many scenes, but the climax alone, was worth the buildup. I'm guessing it was meant to be frightening, but it ended up giving me a belly ache from laughing so hard. (And I'm not just talking about the rapping moron. Though, that helped.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-fashioned Horror/Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't love The Sixth Sense the way everyone else did, because it was based on the supernatural, which people like me know doesn't exist. I did enjoy The Village, which I thought was clever although somewhat outlandish in its premise. Compared to those movies (I haven't seen Shyamalan's others) this movie is sort of old-fashioned, but that's what makes it good. It's just basic suspense/horror film-making, with a good cast and characters that are just off-beat enough to be interesting while being believable. It's also funny, although I would not call it a comedy. Movies like this illustrate that you don't need special effects or stars to make a good movie. In fact some movies are better off without them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie, just not for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a movie fan but The Visit trailer really got me engaged on it. After seeing it just a few hours ago, I can confirm the movie is actually very slow paced when compared to its trailer. As a movie, I'd say it has a very polarizing pace, it's either slow, or very thrilling to watch in some few, very short scenes. This by itself, makes it unable to please everyone.As a horror movie, is one of the best I've seen. No cheap gore, no cheap screaming, no cheap blood. Regarding the last decade it's almost a original one. I must also say that this movie made me afraid of entering my own home. Yeah. Like when I was a 8 year old kid. I'm 31 now.I found the plot and acting very believable, specially Deanna Dunagan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Twist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard a lot about the twist of the film and was very well done and was unexpected. With M night shyamalan getting a lot of stick about his other films rightly so it was good to see a film from him that was really entertaining. With he plot of the two children going to see there grandparents then weird things starting to happen it is not that creative but the execution of it was well done. I am not a fan of found footage but I can appreciate how it was carried out like this. I thought the performances of the main characters in the children were okay I did not care for the boy rapping didn't make any sense to have that in the film. The two grandparents performances were very good, could be difficult to act very strange the whole film. When you have watched a lot of jump scare horror films that are not very entertaining and then watch The Visit you will be happy you did as it has the occasional one but is more down to building up suspense of the relationship between the opposite sets of characters. Would recommend this film to anyone as I thoroughly enjoyed it and loved the dynamic of the film. I could say that one of the best horror's of the year with exception of It Follows as I enjoyed that a little bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Technical perspective, the found footage style worked well with the film and the filmmakers were fierily consistent in maintaining the style throughout. It added an extra layer of experience for the viewers of the children, and combined with a good use of environment (tight confining crawl spaces, sprawling fog shrouded farm land), enhancing the horror and humour elements, the technical were pretty solid.The Characters worked well, each actor pulling of a stellar performance, particularly Deanna Dunagan as Doris; you can tell she was having a blast playing her role. The older girl was the least enjoyable, coming across as perhaps a bit to pretentious, but that could be purposeful, possibly a mild self-parody at some filmmakers in general.Narrative wise this was perhaps one of M. Night. Shyamalan's tighter stories; there was the absence of the inexplicable plot holes that existed in some of his other films (Signs for example) or a weak climax (The Village for another example); the plot progression flowed well enough, and though it took a bit of a slow start in the beginning, it did use that slow start to establish the two protagonists well.The manipulation of tension was one of the stronger parts of the film. A sense of "will it or wont it" sinisterism that purveys some of the scenes, like the one where the protagonists are playing under the porch when they are suddenly beset upon by their rather creepily scuttling grandma only to have her pop out after them from under the porch after them and proclaim in an amused manner that she was just playing. It turned the moment of tension and jump scare into a moment of playful eccentricity, making it more a "what the Fay Dunaway was that?!" type of scene, but in a good way. This sentiment is carried out throughout the film, and keeps the sense of slightly skewed tension well.while the film does have its flaws here and there, it's an enjoyable watch with some good tension, great acting, and decent cinematography. One of Shyamalan's better films as of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-Burning, Seat-Squirming, Genuinely Scary, and Unimaginably Witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.1/5 stars"The Visit" provides horror fans with a satisfying blend of thrills and laughs while signaling a welcome return to form for Writer- Director M. Night Shyamalan. It's the terrifying story of a brother and sister who are sent to their estranged grandparents' remote Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong trip. Once the children discover that the elderly couple is involved in something deeply disturbing, they see their chances of getting back home are growing smaller every day.After several perplexing misfires right after the spellbinding cinematic experience that "The Sixth Sense" was, Shyamalan has scaled back, gone for a lower budget and a lighter tone, and emerged with his most captivating movie in over a decade and a half. Paying homage to dark fairy tales and isolated-cabin horror, it's been a while since we've had Shyamalan that's as sharp as this. Essentially a horror-comedy at its core ? "The Visit" has it all; from rap battles to a fair helping of freaky stuff to WTF-type moments to jump-scare scenes to tension that will truly unnerve you. The buildup to the nerve-wracking suspense until the jaw-dropping denouement proves that Shyamalan still has more than a few tricks up his sleeve.With "The Visit", M. Night has crafted a horror movie full of high- quality jolts, spooks, unpredictability, and some really good laughs. It's a film you just can't miss ? one of the best horror movies of the year. Moreover, it isn't something you would expect going into the film ? it's not always you see a comeback as spectacular as this. Consider this finely honed and funny creep-fest a rip-roaring comeback for M. Night Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll See What You Want To See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan peaked very early in his career. This is a claim some might dispute, as he is still technically a young director and may yet produce some great works. I remember listening to him giving an interview, either on television or in the behind-the-scenes of another movie, where he says that he makes the kind of movies that he wants to see. I disagree with him.M. Night Shyamalan makes the kind of movies he wants to make. Anyone who does anything creative realizes that the process is 100% separate from the final product. Books go through thousands of revisions before the final form is put to print, paintings go through hundreds of sketches, paint mixtures, brush changes, etc. before the final canvas is displayed. For an artist, the creation means so much more than the final product. It is a prideful moment to hold a completed work in your hand, but you can't help but be nostalgic for the journey that brought you there. As a child, M. Night Shyamalan wanted to be a documentarian. He makes no secret of this and often speaks of his early days behind a hand- held camera, directing his friends and family in homemade movies and small documentaries about the minutia of everyday life. This nostalgia for his childhood filmmaking is very evident in this movie. The two main characters are precocious 15 and 13 year olds both of whom have a knack for frames that are juuuust off. You'll notice that it's one of Shyamalan's 'signatures.' He loves the quality lent to film by an amateur's hand, and tries to capture that magic here. For the most part, it works. If you look at this movie as an homage to amateur documenting, or a nostalgic look back at the naiveté of anyone who has fallen in love with being on the controlling end of a video camera, the first 45 minutes are very sweet. As a horror director, Shyamalan has earned a reputation as the 'twist' director. Unfortunately, that is where this film falls flat. Instead of creating a new twist, he borrows from his other twists. Namely, 'they were dead the whole time,' 'those people aren't who you think they are,' and 'don't go in the basement.' The latter being a 'classic,' read 'cliche,' horror movie go-to. As a comedy (because, yes, this is classified as a horror-comedy) it also falls flat. The audience was silent at the parts that were meant to be funny, often cringing at the obvious use of 'look at this! Isn't that quirky and awkward! How humorous!' and laughed at parts that really shouldn't have been so humorous. There is a pivotal scene at the end where the aforementioned thirteen year old bashes in the head of an old man with a refrigerator door. I believe it was supposed to be played serious, it did come at a dramatic climax of the story, but the entire theater was roaring with unsuppressed laughter. The Visit seems like the kind of movie that was more fun to make than it was to watch. Those who go into it expecting to see a Shyamalan horror flick will see just that. Those who go in expecting a dark comedy will find it. Those who go in expecting it to be good will probably get what they want. Those who go in expecting it to flop will not be disappointed. Is this M. Night Shyamalan's comeback movie? Probably not, but he obviously had a damn good time making it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither Frightening Nor Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humans do incredibly asinine things in horror movies. First, there are the unreasonable psychos. Think of Norman Bates in "Psycho," Michael Myers in "Halloween," Jason Voorhees in "Friday the 13th," Victor Crowley in "Hatchet," Jigsaw in "Saw," Pinhead in "Hellraiser," the Creeper in "Jeepers Creepers," Hannibal Lecter in "Silence of the Lambs," and Leatherface in "The Texas Chainsaw." These psychos cover a broad gamut, and they're all warped beyond imagination. Some spectators refuse to watch horror movies because the psychos are too unrealistic. Second, there are the poor, unfortunate victims who stumble into the web of terror that these psychos have spun to trap them. A strong, memorable horror chiller requires a unique villain, a chain of spine-chilling predicaments, and compelling victims. Indeed, the unsavory psychos with their degenerate deeds often overshadow their hopelessly sympathetic victims. Nevertheless, the victims must rise to the challenge. Most horror movie aficionados crave a genuinely creepy psycho villain, and a good horror movie franchise can thrive ad infinitum on such a character either human or inhuman as the aforementioned examples attest. Of course, it all boils down which one you tolerate the least. Bland psychos and stupid victims can undermine a horror movie, and "Sixth Sense" director M. Night Shyamalan's proves this point with "The Visit," an execrable exercise in suspense. The children in this 'found footage' horror chiller are tangled up in a web of depravity and deception that might be scary if it weren't for their own colossal ignorance as well as that of their half-witted mom. Mind you, you cannot blame the victims strictly for making a bad horror movie. The writers and the director can be just as culpable. M. Night Shyamalan has created some of the most suspenseful, unforgettable, scary sagas with "The Sixth Sense" (1999), "Unbreakable" (2000), and "Signs" (2002), before his creativity unraveled with "The Village" (2004), "The Happening" (2008), "The Last Airbender" (2010), and "After Earth" (2013). Many abhorred "Lady in the Water" (2006), but I thought it was a clever and captivating fantasy comedy. As dreadful as "After Earth" was, the Will Smith debacle surpassed the wholly underwhelming "Visit.""The Visit" unfolds from the perspective of two children, 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge of "The Sisterhood of the Night") and her 12-year old brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould of "Paper Planes"), who spend a week with their maternal grandparents in the sticks so their divorced, irresponsible, single mom, Loretta (Kathryn Hahn of "We're The Millers"), can take a Caribbean cruise with her boyfriend. Becca aspires to be a filmmaker and sets her sights on lensing a documentary about their experience at grandma's house. In part, Becca is producing this documentary to help her mom recover from her estranged relationship with her parents. Essentially, mom hasn't uttered a word to her folks in fifteen years. She eloped with her substitute teacher boyfriend when she was nineteen without her parents' approval. Ironically, Loretta's parents were right; the guy was a loser, but the marriage yielded Becca and Tyler. Although M. Night Shyamalan has appropriated the surefire formula of the 'found footage' film, "The Visit" isn't a movie where the footage turns up after the pandemonium. Becca and her younger brother rely on cameras throughout their visit to capture their mommy's parents. What they encounter in the middle of remote Pennsylvania is far from anything they could have imagined. First, their grandfather Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie of "Lincoln") establishes ground rules. The siblings must be in bed no later than 9:30 p.m. Second, they cannot venture into the padlocked basement. Nana (Deanna Dunagan of "Mariachi Gringo") behaves normally during the day and spends most of her time in the kitchen baking. After the sun sets, however, she cavorts about the premises, often naked, periodically puking on the floors when she isn't scratching at the walls like a cat sharpening its claws. Pop Pop confides in the kids that Nana is afflicted with dementia. Pop Pop is no role model himself. He chops wood endlessly and cleans a rifle. Tyler stalks Pop Pop and spots him going to a woodshed. Curious Tyler decides to inspect the woodshed, and he gets the surprise of his life. When Tyler isn't making up rap lyrics, he approaches everything with caution because he suffers from germophobia. You can imagine his horror when he discovers Pop Pop is plagued by incontinence, wears adult diapers, and stockpiles these soiled undies in the woodshed. Smack in the middle of what is supposed to be a scary movie we are treated to a pile of poop and prompted to cackle at Tyler's terror. Indeed, this constitutes bowel humor, and it is funny because Tyler screams the S-word. Later, Shyamalan replays this moment at the expense of our tyke-sized hero. Consequently, Pop Pop and Nana pose little threat to either child. Eventually, Nana asks unsuspecting Becca to crawl into their huge oven to clean it. Presumably, Becca has neither heard about nor read Grimm's classic fairy tale about Hansel and Gretel. Not only are our victims stupid but also they are culturally illiterate. If once were not enough, Nana persuades Becca to climb into the oven again while Tyler watches them! Anybody who has seen any M. Night Shyamalan movies should know by now about his affection for pulling unexpected twists in the tradition of American short story writer O'Henry. The twist in "The Visit" is so egregiously awful that you will want to get up and storm out of the theater. Initially, when I saw this claptrap, I got up and left because it was so incredibly idiotic. Of course, since I wanted to write a movie review, I went back to watch every minute of "The Visit."Like the Mark Wahlberg thriller "The Happening," "The Visit" flounders for lack of anything either frightening or fascinating. The homicidal grandparents aren't sufficiently unnerving, and Shyamalan fails to generate an atmosphere laden with terror. Contrived above all else, "The Visit" qualifies as homegrown hokum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Was Previously An Inescapable Nightmare Has Now Become An Underdog Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is, the film we've all been waiting for; the moment of truth, if you will. M. Night Shyamalan's recent endeavours have left me in complete and utter confusion. What happened to the man who made Signs, Unbreakable, and The Sixth Sense? Does that man still exist? Or has all traces of him been extinguished? Well, having seen THE VISIT, I can confidently say that M. Night Shyamalan is plotting a career comeback. This is, very much, an intimate, stripped-down, director-driven project. It's not a great movie, but it's miles ahead of his last few. I would put this on par with Signs, and just below Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense. This film is being marketed as a horror, and, while it's certainly creepy, there's a lot of great humor as well. The acting perfectly fits the kind of tone Shyamalan was going for, most notably with the grandmother played by Deanna Dunagan. The very natural and believable brother-sister relationship between the two lead actors is not only a testament to the co-leads themselves but also to Shyamalan for bringing those performances out of them. When you compare this to the stilted and wooden performances in his last few films, you can't help but give credit where credit is due. With his reputation on the line, M. Night had to go out and use a style with just as little reputation: found-footage. If I wasn't cautious already, this definitely sealed the deal. But I must say, M. Night does an admirable job. Even with a filming style as stale as this, Shyamalan makes it feel refreshing and new. And while you can expect the famous Shyamalan twist at the end of the movie, the most shocking twist, for me anyway, is that it's a good movie. I hope what this movie does is put an end to all the Shyamalan hate. Sure, he's made stinkers here and there, and should not be excused for them. But his decision of skewing away from blockbusters and coming back to smaller-budget horror and suspense films, the very thing that made him who he is today, is telling. What was previously an inescapable nightmare has now become an underdog tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The major problem with the visit except that it sucks is that it's not scary or funny it tries to do a mix of Paranormal Activity but without ghosts but with laughs and it fails completely. The sister was actually good but the brother was annoying especially every time that he tried to rap (cough end credits cough) the grandparents were kinda creepy at times but that won't help the bad acting, bad screenplay and bad directing. M. Night made one of the greatest films of all time decades ago called The Sixth Sense and now he does crap films like The Visit and The Happening just like Joel Schumacher went from Lost Boys to Batman &amp; Robin. If you like horror films i suggest you to stay away as far as you can from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best from M. Night Shyamalan, but surprisingly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past several years, M. Night Shyalaman has faced a bit of a downfall in his career. With his string of significantly abysmal films such as 'The Happening', 'The Last Airbender', and 'After Earth'; it was wonder whether we would this director would ever rise back to stardom he earned from his hit supernatural thriller 'The Sixth Sense' and his two films following it. This found footage thriller 'The Visit', doesn't quite bring his career back on track, but it sets a good start. This film follows the story of a young teen Becca, a girl who finds joy in documenting her life via video camera, with of being a documentarian (played by Olivia DeJonge), and her younger brother Tyler (played by Ed Oxenbould) who has a fascination in rapping. These two children are taken to their grandparents (played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) to spend a nice week with them. Their grandfathers have grown a severely strained relationship with the children's mother (played by Kathryn Hahn) who walked out on them as a teenager. Over the week, the children witness some bizarre and uncanny behavior by their grandparents, which leads to them discovering a disturbing secret about them.Found footage has been held as one of the most tiring genres over the years, with a number of mediocre films. Then with a found footage thriller at the hands over M. Night Shyalaman, many would expect to see a major disaster of a movie (I know I did). Surprisingly, this film manages to succeed past my expectations. This movie is a found- footage horror flick with a mix of comedic elements that, while doesn't try to be particularly scary or nightmarish, manages to sum up some decent storytelling and a creepy atmosphere; and not in a laughable way like in 'The Happening'. The characters are very likable the second the film introduces, the two children are very charming and funny upon arrival, with Ed Oxenbould's character taking the spotlight with a cute little rap performance in few scenes here and there. Then there is Olivia DeJonge who is just an average teenage girl who dreams of making documentary films, as most of the film takes place via her video camera. The film has its funny moments as well as its creepy moments, which began when their seemly nice grandparents start exhibiting some unusual behavior, and these scenes are pretty creepy. So the film is not a straight-up horror, but more a comedy- horror. There are few jump scares along with this. However, the film is not scary in way that will leave a strong impact, and there is little denying that it is slow paced at times. Then there are also some dramatic moments, most of which are dictated by the concept of the grandparents and their strained relationship with the children's mother. This plays a big role in the story and with its touchy message about family, does convey an emotional tone at times. Overall, it works well with the story, even if it can get a little distracting to the plot. The Visit is not as scary as I was hoping it to be. There are a few ideas here that work, and then some that don't work too well. I believe M. Night Shyalaman could have done a little better, maybe with a better script; but all in all, this film doesn't fail too miserably. While this exactly be a comeback for Shyalaman, but it shows he has the potential of redeeming his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My teenage daughter and I settle in to watch this movie and within the first minute or so we're thinking "oh god noooo this looks like it's going to be really rubbish, not even B movie standards"....but how wrong were we?The movie continues and we instantly despise the mother and her two kids, especially the boy, I really hoped he would die a slow and painful death.I insist that we finish the movie though, and my kid rolls her eyes at me.Later...not even half an hour in and we have our first jump scare moment, I swear I was peeking through my fingers and I never do that...but then the movie takes an odd twist and I am loving it, really loving it and so's my kid.This movie is brilliant in that it has scary moments, disturbing moments and a few jump scare moments too but the humor is what really took this movie to a whole new level for me. This isn't a typical cheesy comedy/horror, it doesn't try to be but it doesn't take itself too seriously either. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in ages and both myself and my daughter laughed until we had tears rolling down our cheeks.I take back what I said about the boy, that kid made this movie funny..both him and the Grandma had me falling about laughing and I couldn't breathe because I was laughing so much.I rate this a 10 because this is the first movie of 2015 that I really and truly enjoyed. I watch a lot of movies but this movie is on my recommend list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He's old, they get confused. Don't freak out." Becca (DeJonge) and Tyler (Oxenbould) are finally going to visit their grandparents. Becca is documenting the trip to try and help her mother and them repair the broken relationship. As soon as the kids show up they get an uneasy feeling. The grandparents are acting very strange but the kids chalk it up to old age, but things aren't always as they seem. This is a hard movie to review. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, but the problem is is that I'm not sure what it wanted to be. It passes itself off as a horror movie, but me and my kids laughed almost the whole way through. Some of the time it was intentionally funny, other times not so much so. The best thing I can say about this is that the "found footage" style used actually works well in this one and isn't just a gimmick like in most movies like this. Shyamalan has come a long way since the Sixth Sense and this movie doesn't really do anything to restore his luster. My kids loved it, but because they laughed so much, I'm not sure that was the goal of this movie. Overall, tried so hard to be scary but came off as a very funny comedy. I give this a B-, as a comedy.</fullReview>

IMDb asks me to write more things but I think I have nothing left to write so I'm just gonna say that this movie is great, you must see it and maybe you won't feel scared, or just a little, but not the entire movie.

		<shortDescription>PLOT TWIST: Shyamalan made a good movie again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As hard as it seems to you, it's all true, every last bit of what you are reading it's true. I bet you weren't as shocked since seeing the 6th Sense. Now let's leave Shyamalan's career a bit apart and dig into the movie a little bit. The Visit deals with the story of two kids,brother and sister, who are sent by their mother to their grandparents. They are played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, who are doing an extremely good job. They are sent there with a purpose, which I'm not going to spoil it for you now. After their arrival strange things start to happen and everything turns upside down. These things are seen through the eyes of the kids, because they are making a documentary about their grandparents. And yes, it's a found footage movie, it seemed as an odd choice for me at first, but it turns out that it suits very well the movie. Also being found footage, gives the movie a bigger dose of credibility. The camera angles used by Shyamalan are well chosen, contributing a lot to the building of tension. The kids reactions during these moments and in their aftermath are pure gold. The grandparents who are played by Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie are also contributing with a lot to these moments. Their acting is full of creepiness and also ambiguity. The final of the movie can't really live up to the rest of the movie, but it's neither as bad as the endings of other Shyamalan movies. Overall the movie is worth watching, because you either laugh yourself to death or either you're scared to death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has had many critics over the years and quite rightly so because since making The Sixth Sense he has made some shockingly bad films. The Visit is not up there with the worst films he has made but as with a Shyamalan film it has many faults. This is the story of a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents in the country , who they have never met before while their mum goes on vacation and they turn out to be just a little bit odd. The biggest problem i have with this is surprisingly not the story but it's the kids , or one in particular . The boy. I can't remember seeing a screen kid more annoying and i was willing bad things to happen to him. There are some spooky moments but not nearly enough and the director's attempt to add humour to the film , failed miserably . Evil Dead it ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I managed to actually get a bit excited when I saw the trailer for this movie a few months ago, it looked pretty creepy, had a dark atmosphere to it, and lead me to naively believe that this just might be a return to form for M. Night. Sadly I couldn't have been further from the mark.The plot twist reveals a decent premise of a movie that could have been pretty interesting--two kids who have never met their grandparents find out that they've actually been staying with two escaped mental patients. That's an idea that could have lead to a lot of psychological tension had it been handled a bit better. And there were a few moments in the movie where I could see that idea trying to get out...the shotgun scene, oven cleaning scene, and grandma finding the camera could have been really great. Instead we get stuck with annoying and poorly written characters, horror tropes galore, and one more beat down on the dead horse that is found footage films. I also keep reading that the movie is actually supposed to be a horror/comedy. I didn't get that at all. There were plenty of moments when I laughed, but they weren't being intentionally funny, which is never a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scary things here are the old people - dementia can be pretty frightening. The story about kids going to stay with their estranged grand parents could have been pretty frightening. The isolated farm in PA is atmospheric.Unfortunately there are some faults that stop this from being a good horror movie. The camera work actually detracts from the scares. I know it was deliberate to show a film project but in the end, the hand held thing and unfocused and badly framed shots dilute the thrills and scares.The story has some plot holes that leave one irritated. The kids could have run and overpowered the old folks but they didn't. Why the boy was just standing in the kitchen and not running is strange. The twist if you can call it that is obvious from pretty early on and there is nothing much to top it after that.The actors are quite good. Deanna Dunagan makes an effective older scream queen. The kids are alright too. There are some funny moments - although the boy's rapping wasn't funny.Keep hoping M Night will produce something approaching '6th Sense' standard but this one is another miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No more M.Night for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really hoping this movie will change the rapid quality decline in Night's movies. It didn't. Looks like M.Night needs to do certain amount of movies in order to get out from bad contract or something. You can put the best pieces in trailer. Actually they did that and left you with extremely boring and predictive movie. Every movie he makes, is a little bit further from Sixt sense. That movie is from another league, which is obviously something he will never achieve again. Don't go to cinema, you will be angry for losing your money over a ticket. I would like M.Night to have some goods movies again, but I will definitely wait for some reviews. I feel like I have been cheated one too manny times now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad film, per se, but that annoying white kid ruined it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me start off by saying that I have never given up on M.Night. I liked Lady in the Water, I loved The Village and I appreciated what he tried to do with The Happening. After Earth and the Last Airbender were travesties, but every director is allowed a few duds. I just think that his good work far outweighs his bad. That being said, I didn't care much for this film. The acting was passable, and the story was decent, but I literally called the twist out 30 minutes into the film as a joke, and when it came to fruition, my partner was like, "How did you know?!?". It's M.Night, you can see where his stories are going from a mile away now (if you are a fan of his, that is).There were a few elements of the film that worked; the creepy (and surprisingly agile) granny, the intelligent and precocious granddaughter, the questionable and well realized grandfather; those all worked well. But that damned rapping idiot kid ("ethnically confused", as they called him in the film) was so.damned.annoying with his need to constantly remind everyone that he is a product of the generation that is confused due to technology, and have no taste in good music. Perhaps it's due to the fact that I absolutely despise rap "music", but every time he opened his mouth to say something ghetto, I died a little inside. It was like the kid was trying so hard to be cool, and I'm sorry, but there is just nothing cool about the things he liked. He was a huge sour note in an otherwise decent film. I would have been angry had I paid to see it in a theater, so I am glad I saw it the way I did. Overall, not as bad as M.Night's recent offerings, but not the return to form that many are suggesting.A note to M. Night; If you choose to have teenagers in your movies, make sure that they do not annoy the audience. It really can make or break your film when people who have so much screen time contribute so little to the overall quality of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been in my list to watch since I first saw the trailer come out. My boyfriend and I went last weekend to see it. It did not quite live up to my expectations for what it was making itself to look.I will say the grandparents being not grandparents was a great twist, but it was predictable. It was more of a 'jump out and music scare you' type of movie. All in all, it was to be expected, had its moments. I still enjoyed the film. I give a 6/10. The purpose of trying to make the film a quote UN-quote documentary type film, from the perspective of the aspiring film maker daughter, is a cool view. I appreciate films that try to show a different edge than your typical film. The 'grandparents' were definitely creepy, thank god! The only thing I would have done different would have been to acknowledge the more obvious moments of the covering up the web cam camera. It pretty much told you immediately what the movie was. I guess I just like to find out at the end, keep my mind spinning.</fullReview>

However, I'm glad I did as it was actually a good movie! Although I don't like found footage movies, I found "The Visit" quite refreshing as it wasn't filled with all of the,shaky camera shots like other found footage movies, it has quite a few scenes where I jumped in terror, the build up to the real "mystery" was great and most of all, it was hilarious! Along with found footage, I hate comedy horrors, but this movie had the right amount of comedy thanks to the young man who plays the brother in this movie. I look forward to seeing him in more movies! I rated it a 9 because it not only exceeded my expectations in watching something that was scary but the twist was awesome! I'd definitely recommend you see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit is not the best in Shyamalan's resume but it could well be the end of his losing streak.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a spate of hits and misses, with mostly misses over the last decade, director M. Night Shyamalan seems to have broken free from the disastrous spell he was under. Although his latest offering - The Visit ? doesn't reinvent the horror genre, it is still a well-executed film with a Shyamalan first ? effectively creepy when it has to be, yet outrageously hilarious when you least expect it. The concept, however, isn't new and at first glance the found footage theme might throw some viewers off. Having personally hated The Blair Witch Project (the mother of all found footage horror films), I wasn't too thrilled going in for this but as it turns out, The Visit is best viewed as a mockumentary. This is the first notable aspect of the film, and owing to its satirical nature, draws you in with wacky humor from kids playing the lead. Visiting their grandparents for the first time, Becca and Tyler make a documentary getting to know them. Their grandparents, who they call Nana and Pop-pop, are regular old folks, but only during the day. After sundown things get pretty bizarre and downright creepy until Shyamalan's signature 'twist ending' reveals all. It's not the most original reveal and the resultant tonal shift is a bit of a letdown. But up to this point, the narrative is well balanced between wit, mystery, and a foreboding atmosphere that something is not quite right. Despite setbacks with his previous films, Shyamalan proves that he's still a visionary filmmaker with this respectable attempt at making a comeback. Pacing is deliberate with the narrative making good use of its 94 minute run time and doesn't feel stretched. Each day with the grandparents are title cards marked by a day of the week. While this looks like amateur film making for a kid, the technique has an ulterior motive, and this becomes apparent when we know how many days the kids have with their grandparents. Similarly, there are other bits and pieces of his genius at work, most notably, his incisive way of working with child actors. Playing the younger brother Tyler, Ed Oxenbould is an instant crowd pleaser while almost single-handedly delivering most of the humor. At times this also works as a smoke-screen between spring-loaded suspense and a few jump scares in the beginning. Although this might seem borrowed from the Paranormal Activity films, deft camera work more than makes up for some of the cheap scares. And while there are few scenes that tread dangerously close to bad taste, WTF moments juxtaposed between suspense driven tension and witty commentary keeps the story grounded. For an independent film on a shoestring budget, The Visit doesn't boast any fancy visual effects either. But you do get a good story that is deceptively simple and almost expertly told, in addition to good delivery from the actors, skin crawling sound design and crafty camera-work. For Shyamalan, this is a welcome return to form and hopefully, the end of his losing streak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I did enjoy the movie and thought the actors did an outstanding job portraying their characters and hiding their native accents, I cannot get over the fact that in the end, she calls the local police department and it's not occupied. Okay... Then why doesn't she call 911, or the PA State Police. Huge flaw. No matter how remote that "town" is in PA the State Police could have gotten there way before she arrived there with them at the end of the night. It is a slap in the face to law officials and I am in no way one or even a fan most days to local ones around here. But PA State Police are a different story. So for us to go through the entire film and put aside the belief that a woman in today's world, would just send her children off to people without making sure the people picking them up at the station were actual her parents is far fetched enough. But then to have her make one call to local yokels and then give up and get in the car. Nope. Not going to buy it. The movie scared me at times and that's what I wanted it to do, but I was disappointed in the ending. We guessed the twist way before it was revealed and was forced to play stupid in order to believe the events at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan Needs To Make Up His Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) take the initiative to visit their grandparents, despite their mother (Kathryn Hahn) being estranged from them for years, they look forward to getting to know them. When the children arrive, things between them and their Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) are everything they hoped it would be. However, as their visit progresses, their grandparents begin to show some very unsettling behavior. At first they brush it off and blame old age, but the behavior begins to grow more and more disturbing.In the newest film by M. Night Shyamalan, he returns to the horror genre ever since the not- so-favorable The Happening in 2008. This time he is taking the step of combining comedy with horror. The trailer portrayed the film as being a horror film, but featuring tidbits of comedy. It was an interesting approach and definitely caught my attention, but I was still going to go in with low expectations (despite enjoying certain disliked Shyamalan films). As the film began it did have some great promise to it by easing us into the world of the characters and going with as little knowledge of the grandparents as they did. It starts off light-hearted enough with quirky grandparents/grandchildren moments that bring laughs. When the events turn and things become dark, this also manages to keep your attention, while at first not thinking quite too much at first. Some of the creepier moments emit laughter that is purely out of unease (particularly the great hide and seek scene, which I was hoping the setting there would have come into play later). Then, as things escalate you begin to feel more nervous about this couple. It all leads to a very thrilling final act that leave you on edge as to what is just going to happen. However, this is where the good things I have to say about the plot comes to an end. I knew going in that this wasn't going to be a straight up horror film. and that it featuring a good amount of comedy. I am all for horror comedies or dark humor in horror films, but the comedy here just felt so out of place and confused the plot and flow of the story. I appreciated most of the comedic aspects, but there was a line that I thought should have been drawn where the comedy ends and the actual horror begins. Instead, it becomes an unbalanced mess that almost makes it seem as if Shyamalan had no idea what exactly he wanted the film to be. I would go so far as to say that the comedy ruined the horror elements. If this would have been more of a horror film with just small dashes of comedy, it would have been much more affective. The last two scenes I also want to add brought down the film a lot. If those would have been axed the ending would have better. The plot also drowns in too much family mellow drama that made me want to barf. The film would also have benefited much more if it only had traces of the documentary style footage but was mostly a regular format production and would have faired better with a good and creepy score.As far as the cast goes, they all do a fine job. Although I personally didn't care for either of the children at all due to both of them being really annoying and often times stupid, the two young actors do a fine job with the roles when it comes to expressing the fears and other emotions that they are supposed to feel. Kathryn Hahn, while hardly present, provides a quirky mother performance that she easily sells, but also does a good job of the more emotional moments. She does come off a realistic mom more often than not. As for the grandparents, it is Deanna Dunagan that provides the best performance of the whole cast. She can play the sweet and innocent Nana one moments and instantly change character into the terrifying old woman who creeps around at night and displays uneasy vacant expressions. Peter McRobbie does well with the role of Pop Pop, but he isn't given as much to do as Dunagan, which is rather unfortunate because I feel he had the ability to do more. The Visit is a film that will divide people. I do not think it was horrible by any means, but I do feel that M. Night Shyamalan should have decided what he really wanted the film to be. And to me it would have worked better as a horror movie with just traces of horror. Instead it just becomes an awkward mess that left me unsure of just what I was supposed to feel. And despite the dislikability of the two children, they, and the rest of the cast, especially our two senior actors, do a standout job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This visit isn't really worth paying for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to M. Night Shyamalan in 2005? That year seems to be the dividing line between his good movies and his? not-so-good movies. Shyamalan burst onto the international scene in 1999 with his masterpiece "The Sixth Sense". It's been all downhill from there. Even though "Unbreakable" (2000), "Signs" (2002) and "The Village" (2004) were critical and commercial successes, none of them reached the level of praise and recognition he had achieved with "The Sixth Sense". Shyamalan's post-2005 directorial efforts included the less profitable and much less appreciated "Lady in the Water" (2006), "The Happening" (2008), "The Last Airbender" (2010) and "After Earth" (2013). That brings us to the horror comedy "The Visit" (PG-13, 1:34), Shyamalan's next attempt to halt his long losing streak.Rebecca and Tyler Jamison (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) are New York teenagers who have never met their maternal grandparents. Their single mother, Paula (Kathryn Hahn), left her childhood home at 19. She hasn't seen her parents since and won't say why. This makes the kids curious, especially Becca. Besides, Becca and Tyler need more family connections, since their father ran off with another woman. Paula arranges for her kids to spend a week getting to know their grandparents. She puts the two teens on a train to her small hometown in Pennsylvania and sets off on a cruise with her new boyfriend. The kids are happy to give their mom a chance to get away and Becca is hoping that this visit with Nana and Pop-pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) will lead to reconciliation between them and Paula? ?which is why Becca records the visit on video. She wants to make a documentary out of this whole story. Becca uses her video camera for interviews and other important moments, while her brother helps out by capturing additional footage using the video function on an old SLR camera. The video clips they capture aren't quite what they expected. Nana and Pop-pop seem nice enough, but their behavior is rather strange. The kids write off all this to the fact that their grandparents are just old. The kids learn that Pop-pop is incontinent and Nana suffers from sundowning, a type of dementia which causes symptoms to increase in the evening and at night. ("Sundowning" was the film's original title.) Still, old or not, the grandparents' behaviors seem more creepy than quirky ? and might even be dangerous.This is not your typical M. Night Shyamalan supernatural thriller, but it does borrow elements from the genre ? and Shyamalan's own earlier work. Much like a haunted house movie, there are plenty of disturbing sights and sounds to go around ? and they get more disturbing as the movie progresses. Although Shyamalan doesn't put a twist in ALL of his movies, there is one in this film ? and it's a doozy. Odd old people, seen through the eyes of two teenagers making a movie plays as a combination of comedic and creepy through most of this film, but when the twist is revealed and its repercussions play out on screen, the comedy falls away while the creepiness increases and it's joined by a healthy dose of horror. It's also at this point that seemingly incidental details and dialog earlier in the film no longer require a sixth sense to understand.With this movie, Shyamalan halts the downward trend in the quality of his films, but doesn't quite reverse it. It was disappointing to see him resort to the found footage format. It seems like a cheap ploy to draw in audience members who are too young to remember when his better movies first came out. Although this film minimizes the camera shake and terrible angles that we usually see in the found footage format, he sacrifices authenticity when he allows video shot by two different types of cameras to look exactly the same ? and have a level of quality that couldn't come from those kinds of consumer cameras. (If you're going to make a found footage film look almost like a regular film anyway, why use the technique?) Worst of all, this style of filmmaking diminishes what is actually a pretty good story."The Visit" would've been better off playing it straight. The "comedy" in this horror comedy isn't really funny. Laughing at the declining mental and physical capabilities of an elderly man and woman when the plot is basically a serious one feels wrong. The quirks that the script gives to the teens don't make them funny either and seem random. In fact, the kids are more annoying than anything else. Their intelligence and preciousness are too extreme to be taken seriously and their relationship as older sister and younger brother doesn't ring true. This attempted return to form for Shyamalan is best visited on video ? if at all. "C+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see an advanced screening of The Visit after hearing good things from early reviews. I can honestly say, it's the most fun I've had in a movie theater in a long time.The movie begins with a simple premise. Mom (played wonderfully by Katheryn Hahn, who got to flex both her comedic and dramatic muscles in this role) is sending her two children off to meet their grandparents on their remote farm. The children have never met them because their mom had a falling out long ago with her parents. Both children are eager to go as it will allow their mother a much needed vacation and give them the opportunity to connect with these people after their father has left the family. The girl, Becca, is determined to find out why her grandparents and mother stopped talking and decides to shoot a documentary film of their week.Early into the film, it becomes apparent that this movie is not taking itself too seriously. Dialog along the lines of "make sure to only film really important things" is followed by the brother sticking out his tongue into the camera. The idea that we are about to see old people acting strangely and eventually....crazy, lends itself to humor and the film wisely plays on this fact. The scariest moments are often followed by shots of the characters reacting in the exact same way that we are, wondering what the hell did we just see. After a creepy "hide and seek" encounter with the grandmother, Becca looks at the camera with an expression that says "that was weird...but I guess she's just old." As the grandparents behavior escalates, we experience the same shock as the siblings, and have little trouble relating to their fears.And fears there are. Despite the humor throughout this movie, there are genuine scary moments. Most of these come during periods where we do not know what to expect. When the children hear sounds outside the door and open it or when they decide to put a camera in the living room overnight, you know the result is going to be something quite disturbing but you are not sure what. The "twist" near the end of the movie is not shocking but the way it was presented was very well done and effectively shifted the priorities of the characters and increased the stakes.I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of all four leads in this movie, most notably Ed Oxenbould playing Tyler. The character of Tyler really carries the humor throughout this movie and had the audience laughing from his first scenes to the end credits roll. Deanna Dunagan, playing the main villain of the two, was very creepy and really committed to this character. As the movie did not rely on special effects, supernatural horror or gore, the actors themselves had to carry the storyline and did well with this.The movie is less successful when it swayed from it's horror and comedy elements and attempted to look into how the children have dealt with being abandoned by their father. While I understand where M. Night was going here and it worked very well in "Signs", these scenes seem out of place in the context of the film and the second last scene, at the end of the documentary, suddenly feels like something out of lifetime movie.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to those looking for a horror thrill ride that will have you simultaneously laughing, screaming and covering your eyes. Our theater had lots of audience reactions and this is a testament to the directors ability to play with the audiences emotions and deliver something, while not highly original, enjoyable on multiple levels.</fullReview>

It borders on the side of the paranormal but it's not about that, although at some points you're almost sure that's the case. The actors performed amazingly, especially the young boy! Really liked the comedic elements within the film that broke the tension now and then! The plot twist is right there and the hand-held cameras are of course one of the elements that make the difference, following the years-long trend started since the Blair Witch project I guess!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 9/10, simply because I really enjoyed watching it and was never bored for a second.I would have probably given it an 8/10 normally, but the low ratings by other users bugged me immensely, so there is an extra point feeling "The Visit" being treated unfairly. And yes, this is a typical example of linking the director's name to certain expectations/viewing experiences while this movie should be watched open-minded as a creative work standing for itself. Calling it "worst movie ever made"? -- C'mon! Even if this isn't a big budget production or anything like that at all, it's still well made and works on several levels.Why? - humour: if it weren't for the humour, the film could've been like any other horror flick; I really enjoyed that it didn't take itself too seriously and the mix of funny and scary moments; I also enjoyed the two quirky/nerdy kids as lead characters - suspense: this movie is not the re-invention of horror, granted; but there were scary moments enough without being gory; and of course the suspense is kept up until the end by the feeling of "something weird" going on; I actually liked the plot twist (it made sense) and didn't guess it until it came out.- acting: especially the two young actors played their roles superbly, I felt, carrying the whole film as brother and sister; I liked the girl's performance as much as the boy's, both of whom we will likely see and hear more in the future.Setting, music and camera handling can be mentioned in addition as devices making this a success.Great movie for a slow Sunday evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The VisitThe scariest thing in the world to anyone over the age of sixty is the thought of having to use their telephone.Thankfully, the seniors in this thriller have grandchildren to assist with voicemail.Aspirant director Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and her brother (Ed Oxenbould) urge their single mom (Kathryn Hahn) to let them stay with their estranged grandparents (Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie) while she goes on vacation.Over the course of their weeklong visit, the siblings experience several strange incidents involving Nana and Pop Pop's behavior. As their visit concludes, their grandparents' erratic conduct reaches its crescendo and their true nature is revealed.While this found-footage fairy tale is a return to form for former wunderkind writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, its frightful formula, however, does grow increasingly less so as the timeworn twist-ending unravels.Either way, this movie isn't as scary as listening to old people talk about other ethnicities.

		<fullReview>Found footage is usually a good excuse for shoddy camera-work and in the Visit that's all to apparent. The movie is a slow starter and this being an M. Night Shyamalan movie you hope and wait (and wait) for the twist to kick you and to return the goodies. When it does I couldn't help but feel disappointed. The acting is rather fair. Deanna Dunagan is actually quite good. There is a scene at the end that in spite of the reasonable effort put into it should have been left on the cutting room floor. You'll know it when you see it.It's been called a return to form for M. Night Shyamalan by some. But is isn't even on par with the Happening in my opinion. And I loved the 6thsense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village. This one is just not in the same league.But if you liked that turd of a movie called paranormal activity then you will probably like this. If you want to see something refreshing watch Hidden instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could cross reference all the low ratings to any mention of disliking the two main actors (the children), I am sure I will find a lot of correlation.I personally thought the kids did a great job, barring a few moments when I felt like they were acting too grown up. The movie itself is quite simple and passes quickly. You won't remember it six months from now, but till then, whether you hated it or loved it, you will recall that it was fun.Finally, many people are saying that it is a found footage film, but there is some inconsistency in this which might be either intentional or not. The shots telling us what day it is every morning are not explained, and (I am not sure, but) some of the shots when the kids are speaking with their mom are seemingly from the third camera. My point being, that may be the movie does not need to be rated low simply because it is a 'found footage' themed fare. There is a twist of course, but I saw it coming. It is not that I am smart, but I think M Night did not want to have a hairpin turn like his recent movies which backfired, so he decided to go with a half-way-there twist.I suggest watching when it is on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M.Night Shyamalan is back. The Visit is one more movie that you should definitely watch as its his best work since The Village.There are lot of negative reviews on the film which I still don't understand why? Why not appreciate a good movie? I mean can you do better?Its also very underrated and has very less reviews, as this film is Shyamalan's big comeback after 10 years.This movie is filled with everything you can expect in a Night's movie, the subtle form of story-telling, the surprise plot twists and attention to minor details and great execution.Definitely a MUST watch!! If u liked The Sixth Sense, The Village, you will like this :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could have made this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, this film is barry average. It is a run of the mill horror flick with some strange attempts at humour along the way. Like many pictures in this genre, it does build brief scenes of suspense with a well timed jump in your seat climax, but it is all a bit predictable.This is M. Night Shyamalan, not some college students given three days to create a horror film. If I was asked to make a scary film with no money, and only a few people to help, my check list of events on my storyboard would look like this:1. Hand held camera 2. A house in the middle of nowhere 3. A couple of weak vulnerable characters with very little back story 4. Strange people living in this house 5. The mobile phones don't work properly 6. Strange things start happening after a few days 7. Although these people are clearly crazy, the protagonist can't quite see it yet 8. Strange noises being when it gets dark 9. The lights don't work properly at night 10. Protagonist no1 goes to investigate in the dark 11. Use the torch on the hand held camera to scan the dark room 12. A scary face appears in the darkness......... You have just created 'The Visit''.... Well done. C- It's worth a watch for a few of the laughs, a few moments of obvious suspense and one or two really obscure moments (which include adult nappies)!! I really want M. Night to be great again, but I fear the worst....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Took the curious all the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story really isn't that interesting at first. Also with all the trailer scenes already kind of leaked the scary parts, this movie quite literally didn't have anything to offer anymore. What interested me into watching this movie is purely the fact that it stood on the box office a few weeks ago, when it's not the month of Halloween yet. After I'm all about 20 minutes into the movie, I've already figured out about the grandparents may not be who they say they are, so that really takes all the surprise out. But having seen many of M. Night Shyamalan's works, I still watch this movie to the end, still being curious at how will this movie develop even more. And as I predicted, like all other Shyamalan movies this movie really serve a good dose of mystery and thriller side that comes on screen suddenly without significant buildup before. But like other Shyamalan works this movie also leaves the audience with not so satisfactory climax at the ending. The whole POV camera angles is just the fresh new take to add to Shyamalan movies, although it's been a common thing in horror genre nowadays. The acting overall is a little bit below standards for me as Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould did just enough for their parts but didn't really quite build on the whole brotherhood between their characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>finally m.night shyamalan delivers a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M.night shyamalan is a talented director who lost his way for quite a while with disasters such as the last airbender and after earth plus few others. After a promising start with the likes of the village and signs he is back with this comedy horror film now there is a few films that try to cover both genres comedy/horror and fail badly like cooties but this one delivers with horror moments when needed and comedy that are timed perfectly. This film is along the lines of the conjuring but lucky its only along the lines and not a total rip from it. Basic story a single mom life goes crazy after her children visit there grandparents with some twisted results. Olivia Dejonge (becca) and ed oxenbould (tyler) are the kids and play there roles well, don't expect a massive scare in this film as it was done on a low budget but what you will get is a great film that shows when m.night shyamalan does try he can deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit is nothing short of a miracle for M Knight Shamalan as he serves up this tasteful parody of the overused found footage horror movies. Though it is nowhere near perfect, Shamalan manages to convince us that he is back on the right path of making great twist ending films. However, the problems with The Visit, being overly cautious and riddled with jump scares, are counteracted by the good points, being surprisingly funny and the mocking of various horror tropes and clichés. The film may not be perfect, or any where near, but what is served to us is fun, well paced and exciting to watch. Whilst most of the film teeters on the edge of being too horror-type- ish, the things that work are what is in between the lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decently Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I now wonder what to compare The Visit with. If you look back to Shyamalan's earlier masterpieces The Visit seems sub-par. If you look at the last seven years of his career this film looks like a welcome return to decency.The Visit is by no means a great film, and it is not as smart as, say, The Conjuring was. But the only thing I found bad about it was the predictable ending. Other than that The Visit is a perfectly good horror film. It was scary in all the right ways, weird without being too unrealistic.The characters were good and the film had nice drama. Deanna Dunagan, who played Nana, was my personal favourite in this film. The biggest source of tension in the story is the uncertainty felt by the two children. At one point their grandparents seem completely normal, then they switch between confused or violent. You really don't know what to expect and it creates a great mood for the film.As for more spoiler filled details what I really didn't like was how at the end of the film the sad, dramatic mood was utterly ruined by the humorous rap part. It completely killed the atmosphere and just seemed very amateurish. And what was with the Hansel and Gretel themes? It seemed like they would go somewhere, but they never do?Overall I would say The Visit is average, but far from bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's great to see that M. Night Shyamalan is back doing what he does best. The Visit isn't classic Shyamalan like The Sixth Sense or Signs, but it is much better than The Happening. It seems like he has learned his lesson and returned to his roots. The big budget movies aren't for him, and that's okay. Shyamalan makes low budget thrillers with a twist and he makes them pretty well. I hope this is a lesson to him and the studios. Let the man stick to what he does well. You can read more about The Visit and also about the future of M. Night Shyamalan at actionmovieman.blogspot.com There is a spoiler-free review that gives more details about the movie. In short, I think it is worth watching but I would wait until it comes out in Redbox or on Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, but Not Very Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit is often hilarious, seldom really scary, but features one of the best twists in Shyamalon's career since The Sixth Sense. If you're expecting a great horror film, you may be disappointed, but if you're looking for a fun time at the theaters this is a good choice. Whether it be good or bad, I could not stop laughing while watching this film, up until the end. The film relies on jump scares to scare, but most of them are hard to take serious and come across as funny. I didn't like the characters in this film, Ed Oxenbould did as good as he could, but Olivia DeJonge plays a 15 year old aspiring filmmaker who knows more industry lingo than Steven Spielberg, the fact of the matter is if the girl were that smart she wouldn't be making a documentary about her grandparents. Throughout the dialogue is annoying, the plot's a little thin, the characters are flat, the film fails to scare, and the found footage aspect wears thin quickly. However all shortcomings fade by the end as a twist at the level of the Sixth Sense completely flips the plot on it's head, this twist saves the movie and makes a fun film to watch a great theater experience. I highly suggest you see this in a theater so you can hear the laughter and then listen as the theater goes dead with the reveal of the twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit: Humor and Horror Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is M.Night Shyamalan's way of telling and getting back at his critics..."OK, you want a good horror movie, Let me give you a medley of the best horror stories and films ever created and I am gonna put this adult diaper full of s**t on your face!" And how he did so with the virtuosity of a master. With subtlety and subliminal images of the best horror films ever created like The Shining and Suspiria. He even paid homage to Asian horror flicks with the claustrophobic hide and seek scene and the surprisingly predictable but necessary twist revealed at the last 15 minutes of the film. Even the most recent movies such as The Taking of Deborah Logan and Oculus are not spared. The only things that are not so subtle here are the "found footage" premise, the Hansel and Gretel/Little Red Riding Hood references and his parody of James Wan's horror hits.What made this movie a success is how it was treated. How he managed to build and layer the story with humor and dread is a testament of how great a story-teller the director is. It is a lesson for every aspiring horror directors on how to do a very scary film without the usual in your face scare and gore tactics. After all, our imagination is so much scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the cinema yesterday and I enjoyed it, as I thought it was alright. Not only did it make me jump a few times I also found it very funny, as the boy does crack a few funny jokes, and it can often be funny watching the Gran go crazy (although I am not sure if that was intentional). I also thought the twist at the end was excellent, and scared me psychologically. However, even thought I said the boy was funny, I hated his rap at the end. I thought it was a terrible ending to an otherwise good film. This is because it was just ending emotionally, as the mum and daughter hug, and you see clips of them as young children with there father. At that point I thought what a good ending, but then I see some stupid rap by the brother to end it, and that completely broke the emotion that I was feeling, and really annoyed me. Other than that though it was a good movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan Can Still Make Good Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed and I actually came out impressed. I'm usually pretty open-minded when it comes to most films but I thought this movie would be horrible as soon as I heard the name of M. Knight Shyamalan. I don't know if it's because my expectations were so low or what but I really enjoyed this movie. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but it's decent and that's more than I can say for many of Shyamalan's recent work. Let's talk about the story.This film revolves around two children named Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and their first trip to see their grandparents. Their mother (Kathryn Hahn) had a bad fight with her grandparents when she was younger so she didn't have anything to do with them for most of her life. This means that the younguns also didn't have anything to do with them either. However, she's finally making up with her parents and sending her children to go visit them. The children start their visit innocently enough but they soon find out that something is seriously wrong with these people and old age isn't the primary explanation.There are a few recognizable faces here but these definitely aren't popular actors in this movie. However, that actually kind of helps the movie since I wasn't distracted by known actors pretending like their trying to make a documentary. DeJonge and Oxenbould both do a great job with their characters and they seem like kids that I've met before. That really shouldn't be difficult since children are all over the place but it's nice not to see them act too "childlike". I did find myself cringing some when Oxenbould started his little rap songs but they didn't take up very much time. I was really surprised to see how creepy the grandparents were. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie play the the grandparents and right off the bat you can tell that something isn't quite right about them. It starts off subtle but things get really crazy pretty quickly. I laughed at the idea of scary old people but these two really are unnerving. It's also nice to see Kathryn Hahn in this kind of movie. I can't help but smile whenever she's on screen. Her enthusiasm is contagious.This movie does a lot right that many of Shyamalan's movies have been missing for a while. The dialogue between the characters is surprisingly natural and reminded me of conversations I've had with my own family at times. The characters were interesting and the scary parts were actually scary. The grandparents do a great job of unnerving us but I have to admit that the house and the country around them also help to make everything feel not quite right. It's not a scary house by itself but it comes off scarier thanks to the weirdness going on inside. Unfortunately, the film still has a few parts that made me cringe a little.Let me get this right out of the way. I can't handle seeing little kids rapping. He doesn't rap often but I think I almost audibly groaned every time Oxenbould did a little rap song. I'm guessing it's supposed to be cute but it didn't work on my iron heart. There's also a lesson trying to be taught to us throughout the film about letting go of your anger and forgiving those closest to you but it honestly felt a bit too forced to me. The children have some problems with their own father since he left them when they were still fairly young but it just comes in at awkward times throughout the film and then we get back to weird grandparents again. The only other thing that kind of bothered me was how easy the twist was to figure out. I knew what was really happening about fifteen minutes into the film. It didn't take any of my enjoyment away but it does surprise me to so easily predict a Shyamalan twist.Overall, I was really impressed that the movie was actually enjoyable and turned out to be decent. There are a few hiccups here and there but it felt like a great movie simply because my expectations were so low. It's nice to see that Shyamalan can still make good films. I can't help but wonder how closely the studio kept a rein on some of Shyamalan's crazier tendencies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait a minute. The Visit is a...good Shyamalan movie? Stop the presses!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think for a lot of kids, one of their biggest fears is not being able to sleep in the same house as their parents. You could be staying with a grandparent you're your best friend, but your smart enough to know that while these people know you, your parents understand you better. I can't think of how many times that while I was staying with my grandparents, I'd wish my mom and dad would be home sooner from their vacation. The old fashioned home I was in wasn't scary, but the age of the place was intimidating. It was almost haunting-like.That's not to say my grandparents were bad people; I loved them in fact. Most kids live by routine and a departure from that can become frightening itself. People can outgrow this, but show me a kid whose never been intimidated by another surrounding and I'll show you a man whose never been afraid. One of my biggest questions I asked myself as I drifted into sleep in the guest room was, "Did my grandparents feel this way when they first moved in?". Two kids question their new surroundings from familiar people in The Visit. Young teens Rebecca (played by Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (played by Ed Oxenbould) are planning to stay for a week with their grandparents who've they've never met before. Their visit is the product of their single mother Paula (played by Kathryn Hahn) who has been estranged from her folks and doesn't want to open up why, even though she agrees to let the children visit them.Rebecca is an aspiring documentarian and has decided to record her upcoming visit by camera (The Visit is shot in a found footage style for this reason) while Tyler is an amateur rapper. The two take the train to the Pennsylvania countryside to have what is hopefully to be a fun and informative week.Their greeted by their grandpa "papa" John (played by Peter McRobbie) and grandma "nana" Doris (played by Deanna Dunagan) who live on an isolated farmhouse. At first, they seem to be loving and want to spoil the kids with games and unlimited treats from the kitchen. The only rule given is lights out at 9:30, as their old. The kids start to hear noises at night and notice strange behavior and mood swings through out the day. Though dismissed as dementia, the kids try to figure out what could be up with these people and whether their mothers past had anything to do it. As soon as I saw the name M. Night Shyamalan, I went in expecting another scary story that I can laugh at for being dumb and unfrightening. The Visit however may have broken Shyamalan's bad track and let me to declare that the movie is "not that bad" Yea, your probably in shock that this is actually a descent film, but this remains the first in my book that the director may finally be in on the joke. Though The Visit is a horror movie, this also happens to be a funny story, especially with the two kids who are pretty good actors, my favorites though have to be the grandparents who seem to carry a blanket of warmth and uneasiness. That's not easy for an elder to pull off, but I could see how I would have been fooled at around this age. This can unfortunately come off as a bit uneven in tone in various spots, but I think the film still works. The other factor I usually criticize Shyamalan for is his use of sudden twists, but I found it both scary and made sense the more I thought about it. The Visit heavily relies on how much one doesn't know.I'll give this seven sets of baked cookies out of five. This happens to be a good horror film for those that want a genuine scare without much of the blood and guts one would find in a typical slasher. The Visit is a nice return to form for Shyamalan.</fullReview>

I think that works on a certain level because we're not just observing this scary behavior but one day we'll also be engaged in it.I could have done without the white kid rapping (that stopped being funny 30 years ago) and the schmaltzy, feel-good, "tinkly tinkly" music ending.

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan has (partially) redeemed himself. A respectable comeback of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit - 7/10 Shyamalan has moderately redeemed himself after a series of disasters. It's more thriller/comedy than horror but there are a handful of genuinely creepy scenes. Slow pacing, but the tone that something is very "off" makes the film interesting even while nothing is actually occurring. In that aspect (and only that aspect) it reminded me of Rosemary's Baby. Both directors managed to load seemingly harmless events with tension and foreboding. That's the part I appreciated the most. I also appreciated that the twist this time wasn't something totally off the wall, i.e. he didn't try to hard. It was a perfectly respectable twist within the realm of normalcy while still being slightly shocking. The only negatives are that it's got slow pacing in the first act, but it does pick up considerably about 30-40 minutes in. Also the found footage gimmick is beyond tired at this point, but the utilization of it is slightly smarter than some other films I can recall.Bonus points for the funny as hell son Ed Oxenbould. Aside from the seriously creepy grandparents he makes the film. The daughter is a decent actress as well , but the son got all of the funny material. All in all Shyamalan has nothing to be ashamed of this time around. I may just go and see it again .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Visit, I knew I had to create an account and write a review. I honestly was disappointed in the entire movie and did not find it chilling or frightening. When viewing the trailer, I really didn't see much potential in it but decided to go see it after seeing many positive reviews on IMDb. I honestly should have stayed home. While the movie does contain a perfect setting to offer some really creepy scenes, it lacks a "spookiness" element to the film and doesn't set the bar for creepiness. I feel like there was something missing throughout the film. All of the actors were believable except for the boy, who i found very annoying. The are a few jump scenes that did offer some scares but nothing major. The ending had an interesting plot twist to it but I felt like there was an emptiness (in the movie) that hadn't been filled. While the movie isn't the worst I've seen from M. Night, it's definitely not his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The precocious 15-year old Becca and her younger brother Tyler go to spend a week with their grandparents Nana and Pop Pop in wintry rural Pennsylvania to allow their mother to go on holiday with their boyfriend. The children have never met their grandparents: their mother remains estranged from them since she walked out as a teenager for undisclosed reasons. Would-be documentary maker Becca films everything, hoping to find a way to heal the estrangement. However, Nana and Pop Pop don't always behave exactly as expected.M Night Shyamalan writes and directs and, after his career in the director's chair ? an almost straight line from the high point of The Sixth Sense to the low points of The Last Airbender and After Earth ? one hopes for the best and expects the worst, and that is almost exactly what we get here. The good news is that this film is a considerable improvement on Shyamalan's last two or three outings. The bad news is that this is yet another subjective filming movie (the footage isn't "found" as such, so "found footage" is a misnomer in this case), and it is made as if Shyamalan has never seen one of these. It is slow.It's not too bad, though. The four main performances are all good, there is a nice build-up of uneasiness as the kids gradually realise that there is something profoundly weird going on, the reveal doesn't cheat the audience, and the resolution is pleasing. Two elements I didn't like were what happened as regards Tyler's germ phobia ? I thought the "in your face" payoff wasn't sufficient to justify what was otherwise a dead end ? and Tyler's rapping, which was just plain annoying. Twice.But overall, Shyamalan drags himself up a touch with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Goodness.... Shyamalan is back!!..Not the Best Good step in the right direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie and that the Director and Writer was M. Night.... Not gonna lie I was skeptical at first and thought it was gonna be the same Stick from her past movie, but it was interesting enough for me and my girlfriend to check it out.(Sound and design) First i have to say that this movie is a Found Footage movie and I have to say that this is the best use for found footage unlike in other movie where they come up with a horrendous reason to involve it, but this one takes the cake for that and I usually hate found footage. The sound and design are good as typical for an M. Night movie and it does create a calm and relaxing and then creepy and horrifying atmosphere you really get that feeling of emptiness and despair and creates a tense feeling for the audience.(Story and Acting)The story is about two sibling visiting there grandparents, who lives in a house near a small mountain town for the first time due to a bad relationship between The sibling Mother and Parents, but as the days past the siblings start to see some weird behavior from there grandparents and something even more terrifying secrets along the way... By far the acting is really good in this movie and I was expecting some deadpan acting from "The Happening" and "After Earth" but the acting from the kids and the grandparents are really top notch. The Grandparents especially, they really do come of as weird and derange and it keeps your attention and on your toes through out the entire flick. The pacing of the film is good as well a little off at time due to the fact that they spend over five days at the grandparents house and at time I felt that they glance over days but it is a found footage so its understandable. The does has a comedic edge and it is a welcome edition to the movie because it gives a bit of a relief from the horror section and it actually is funny and does fit with the theme and its rare for a movie to pull this off its obvious that M. Night didn't want this movie to be entirely full of scares.(Overall)This movie is not the Best but the best step in the right direction for M. Night Shymalan and I can say that if he keeps this up then he can surely reclaim his status a great writer and directer from the Six Sense and Unbreakable. I'm really excited to see more from him the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw this movie tonight, my daughter is a horror fan and dragged me a long. I was not expecting much even though I have liked M. Night Shyamalan's movies in the past. The last few of M. Night Shyamalan's movies were not horrible but not great by any means. With this movie, he is back. I had heard there was comedy but it is not like you think. It is more comedy relief and we need it because the movie is so tense, it really is a thriller and keeps you anxious through out. Great vibe.Do yourself a favor and do not read too much about the plot, let is surprise you and go in fresh. There is a thread of dread all the way through this movie. The acting and story was excellent all around.This movie is under-rated score-wise. it deserves a higher rating (even though the rating isn't too bad but it should be higher). The movie is tense, creepy and the crowd who attended all seemed to be into it full bore and creeped out. One of the better scary movies I have seen in quite some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night is on a short list of true film makers with vision and skill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've said a million times. I love M. Night Shyamalan. He's the last of a dying few true film directors who knows how to write, and make a movie. He plays the audience like a master at his craft. And although some may disagree. I think since Sixth Sense people's expectations of his film are way too high. This was another excellent movie. I was creeped out. I laughed out really hard. I was truly scared for some of the characters in this film. Even if you can slightly see where the plot is going, or "Twist". Doesn't take away that this film was brilliantly written and filmed. From the casting down to the filming style. It's like your "Lost Footage Film" but not. M. Night takes everything to the next level. Can't wait to see what he does next. 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan attempts a comeback after four consecutive box-office flops.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, that was weird.Filmmaker M. Night Shyamaian initially made impressive films, "The Sixth Sense" (1999) being his most successful. His following films "Unbreakable" (2000), "Signs" (2002) and "The Village" (2004), also got a bang for their buck. The following four films he directed after "The Village" bombed both with his fans and at the box office, with "The Happening" (2008) barely making back it's money. Many entertainment pundits predicted this was the end of his film career.Now Mr. Shyamalan is trying to make himself relevant to Hollywood again. His latest film, "The Visit," isn't his best film, but it's also not so bad either. It's also his cheapest film to date, not counting the first two films he directed before "The Sixth Sense," made for a mere five million bucks. Hopefully this will leave him more room to at least break even, unlike his more expensive flops.The film consists of a documentary two children, a 15-year-old girl and an 13-year-old boy, decide to make of their visit to their grandparents and the premise is that we're watching their product, similar to the "Paranormal Activity" franchise, which, by the way, is produced by the same production company, Blumhouse Productions. It starts with a single mother in her mid-30s (Kathryn Hahn) who reveals to her daughter filming her that she ran away from home fifteen years earlier after a falling-out with her parents and that she cut off all communication with them. She doesn't say what led to her leaving them, but also tells her that her parents looked her up on the Internet and have invited their grandchildren to come spend a week with them at their Pennsylvania farmhouse. Reluctantly, the mother sends her two kids off hoping to build bridges with her estranged family.The children consist of teen daughter Becca and her younger brother Tyler, played respectively by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, both fresh out of Australia. Becca is a high-school freshman and Tyler is an aspiring rapper. Both are greeted warmly by their grandparents who meet them at the train station. Their grandfather is referred to as PopPop (Scotland's Peter McRobbie) and their grandmother as Nana (Deanna Dunagan). Upon their arrival the children bring their own DSLR cameras to continue their documentary, as well as their laptop, which they use to keep in contact with their mother via Skype. The grandparents appear to come off as nice, but also require the grandchildren to observe one ground rule: they need to be in bed by 9:30pm. A minor inconvenience, but the children grudgingly agree.On their first night, strange things already start to happen. Becca wakes up to go down to the kitchen to get something to eat. She brings her laptop equipped with a camera hoping to document more useful things for their film, only to find Nana walking across the hallway and throwing up on the floor. That's the first of many strange things surrounding their grandmother. Their grandfather isn't any better. One time he takes his grandkids to their mother's childhood school, only to confront an innocent passer-by across the street whom he wrongly accuses of spying on them. Both grandparents gradually engage in behaviors that come off as very strange and worrisome to the grandkids at first, but then become more menacing and threatening. There are plenty of "what the hell" moments, as well as moments that will have you shaking your head, one of them being when Nana puts Becca in an awkward situation by requiring her to climb into an oven to clean it. And of course, what's a horror film without a few cliché jump scares? The film also has it's funny moments, Tyler especially is a riot. At times when Becca tries to include Nana in their documentary, she tries to find out from her what happened that lead to their mother leaving them, only for Nana to go into a conniption fit, prompting Becca to cut the interview short. Unbeknownst to the children, the grandparents have a story that will eventually lead to them fighting to survive their weeklong stay.While I've seen better films made by Mr. Shyamalan, "The Visit" is a fairly good effort for him seeking redemption from people who have all but written him off. There might be some hard-core fans that may be disappointed in the sense that this film is not like any of his earlier more successful work. Some may be disappointed that this is just another "found footage" film. This is a movie with a twist that will catch you off guard.One thing is certain. After watching "The Visit," you'll never feel the same way about the board game Yahtzee again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The return of M. Night Shyamalan!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when M. Night Shyamalan was an up and coming sensation with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable under his belt, just before he started to believe the Hype Hollywood was gassing his head with? This movie will refresh your memory.When I first saw who the director of this found footage movie was I thought Shyamalan was on his last legs, but after seeing this movie it was like a boxing champ starting from the beginning in the poor old hood he came up from in order to train for his biggest fight yet. It's the best found footage movie I've seen since the original Paranormal Activity. It was about a group of kids spending a week in the house of their long lost grandparents. Shyamalan was able to sculpt a realistic situation of kids being freaked out by their strange older family members that was chuckle out funny and at the same time uncannily scary. It's has a Catfish feel to it, but in the hands of Shyamalan The Visit makes the ghost of Hitchcock totally envious and angry that this movie is not a part of his own filmography.This is the movie you want to see, 100% entertainment!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit, is easily M. Nights best movie in years.This is a movie where you are creeped out at one moment and then laughing the next, and for the right reasons. This is not a so bad its good type movie, its a genuine good/great movie. The found footage aspect in this movie also works well. I can believe why this is being filmed.The child actors in this do a great job, as well as the grandparents. Probably some of the best acting in a M Night film.This movie is a major step in the right direction for M. Night and I believe he has won back a decent amount of people with this and also Wayward Pines, the TV series he made earlier in the year.</fullReview>

Know that you must watch the film twice to fully appreciate it; I'll assume that approximately zero percent of film "critics" took this action, which is reflected in many of their reviews (which frequently mention "comedy" elements). There's nothing funny about the grandparents here, which can only be understood upon revelation of the "twist," and the second viewing, as mentioned, when everything is clear. Forget what you've heard, and prepare to be terrified, should you understand what it is that you're watching! Give this movie a chance, and then watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I in a night of Shyamalan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Contains strong spoilers****It's often in my opinion and experience that movies that are filmed like an documentary is the scariest. The one that pops out in my head right now is The Blair Witch Project. There's a lot of these movies.I like intelligent and innovative horror movies. I like intelligent and innovative movies with new turns and twists that makes me say "Oh...!! THAT'S A NEW ONE!". This movie did that to me.So... off to a visit. A documentary about siblings making a visit to their grandparents for the first time. They arrive. They are cozy. It's on the countryside. Old people with little love and making cookies. Then. Something strange is going on. Is it just in a state of mind? Is it only a blown up illusion and experience of old people making impression unto the younger ones? Or is it...? That thought is driving this whole movie for a good amount of time. M. Night Shyamalan is turning up the heat after having gone through his typical mental and psychological perspective of different topics. It's coming closer....it's coming closer.........The actors and the director is great. I really like Ed Oxenbould after seeing him in "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day". His charming innocence and beautiful eyes makes the aspects of horror in this one even more....spooky? Olivia DeJonge is also bringing her A-game in this one, so are the old couple.M. Night Shyamalan is getting right to it and I sense there has been both contemplating and development on his behalf as a director and movie writer. I have almost always liked his movies as they are very different from other things. "The Visit" may be his return to the big arenas.Some big laughs and some big scary jumps from this one. Enjoy!7,6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not fresh, but served well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea is not entirely new. The theme of the movie is similar to this 1999 Bollywood flick titled "Kaun?" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195002/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) that translates into "Who?". In fact, Kaun? engaged the audience differently and IMHO, told a similar story better. Also, "Kaun?" might have been one of the first real-time movies made in India which makes it extra special. The events in Kaun? unfold during the course of a rainy night.But Shyamalan serves the movie well. He moves the camera a lot in "The Visit" as if to make it up for the ultra-steady shots he has mostly stuck to all this while. The perspective is the kids' experience. The junior actors are very good (though the characters they play might seem to be a little too smart for their age) and the senior actors play it with incredible ease.With some good thrills coupled with humor, Shyamalan ensures that the movie keeps you engaged. A 6 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Twist You Never Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real twist here is that for more than a decade M. Night Shyamalan has built up a beautiful fecal mountain of great terrible movies, then marketed The Visit as possibly the holy apex of said ****-mountain, and somehow the movie turned out to be his non-ironic best since the days his name wasn't considered a joke. I feel like every movie he's released since Signs has been a piece of performance art leading to this ultimate mind bending twist ending where the movie with the worst trailers possibly ever turned out to be decent.Bravo, Mr. Shyamalan.The real key here is that Shyamalan has finally shed the comically serious attitude all his movies have had to this point. The Village, The Happening, Devil; they were all ironic comedy gems because the tone was so serious but what you saw on screen was an absolute joke. This movie incorporates a lot of intentional comedy that has you laughing WITH the characters rather than at them. The dialogue is Shyamalan's best probably ever. So you bond with the characters and enjoy yourself. Then when the suspenseful moments come, you are surprised that you actually care about the characters and the suspense is working. The twist was obvious and you could forecast it a mile out, but with Shyamalan you can't really avoid that.Overall, it's no masterpiece of course, but as an ironic Shyamalan lover over the past 10 or so years, I can confirm that I actually agree with his non ironic fans who are calling this his return to form. The trailers are extremely misleading and the movie is nowhere near as ridiculous as the "Get in the oven" trailers would have you believe. Solid 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surpassed my expectations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into the theater I had no idea that this is directed and written by the one who brought us The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I grab a large popcorn and coke to try and maximize this experience. Having seen a portion of the trailer with my cousin (hence missing the titles that came out by the director) I'm expecting another cheeky horror movie.The first fifteen-twenty minutes come off bright, I smile at the jokes made by Becca and Tyler and just relax, remember to take it easy and not hold up high standards. The movie goes on and, if you've seen the trailer, not everything is as it seems during this lovely visit.Without any spoilers I'll be coming to my conclusion. Shyamalan finds a perfect balance between horror and comedy, and shows us there's definitely chemistry when children and the golden-age is involved. Besides the typical jump scares directed at the kids rather than the viewers, I found this to be a very mood lightening movie that might just bring back my belief, that there's yet more to be added to the horror genre.Probably worth noting, I stopped taking "scary" movies seriously times ago, but when it comes to horror-ish thrillers I find pieces like The Perfect Host, Coherence, Triangle and so on, perfect for me. I'm also a fanboy of horror movies shot purely from a camera point of view, and I'll never stop loving them no matter how many clichés are out there.Hope you enjoyed reading my first review! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan regains form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am one of the few Shyamalan fanboys in the world. Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village and even the Happening being some of my favourite movies. So I always get excited to hear he is back at work. The Last airbender and After Earth, proved that this underrated genius needed to go back to basics and stick to his own work. He has done so and has, for me, succeeded.The Visit is stunningly beautiful, and yes it is a 'found footage' sort of movie, with the main character, Rebecca, being an aspiring filmmaker, she sets up amazing shots which bring a certain feel to the movie. One thing MNS always manages to bring to the table is an amazing picture.The acting is beyond superb, Olivia De Jonge (Rebecca) is incredibly talented, but the show stealer is rapper/ladies man Tyler, played by Ed Oxenbould bringing some much needed comic relief to counter the tense atmosphere of the movie.Nana and Pop Pop set the mood slowly, the tension builds at every interaction, and one thing is certain, they will make you hesitate to send your kids away to their grandparents at the next school break.Not wanting to give away too much, I will finish by saying, there is a very slight MNS trademark twist, maybe more obvious than his previous ones, but overall this is a stripped down basic fabulous horror piece, that will keep you on edge and make you paranoid of old folks when leaving the cinema. Shyamalan is back on form and has stepped up his game after the terrible big studio movies he helmed recently. A truly original piece, it is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had me worried m night shalyman has not done a great movie In 13 years. But this film excels at everything it scares you and then 10 minutes later brings a smile to your face one of the best examples of horror combined with comedy that I have ever seen. My favorite scene surprisingly was the hide and seek scene with the two children and grandmother under the house because it was both terrifying and funny. The actress who plays the grandmother I do not know who she is but she really needs to be in more films she was so awesome and was very scary she really sold me on being the freaky grandmother and had a creepy side to her as well. The movie was shot in a found footage type style that I know some people do not like but I didn't mind it at all I found it refreshing to see a film that was filmed like an in home documentary/ found footage format. But my favorite character in the film had to be the boy he was so funny witty his rapping you've got to see it and the teenage girl was okay to but seemed a little too much of a perfectionist she's very much like Dawson from Dawson's creek. Overall a great horror film and something m night shalyman needs to continue if he wants to be a successful filmmaker 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long awaited return to form for M.Night Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sees the return of M. Night Shyamalan, a director who is known for great films such as 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense', but on the opposite end of the spectrum he has also made films like 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth', and then 'The Happening' sits somewhere in between terrible and genius. It feels like we have been waiting forever to see M. Night return to making good films and it looks like with this film i can say that the seemingly impossible has happened, 'The Visit' marks the return of the master of twists. For me his return happened this year with the AMAZING mini-series Wayward Pines but in terms of movies this is the return. It is not one of the best horror movies i have seen recently but the combination of horror and thrills with some laughs here and there really worked in this film as oppose to his other attempts. If i was to describe this movie in one word it would have to be 'weird', this movie was just so incredibly odd and at times creepy and it had me on the edge of my seat more times than not. The grandparents in this film were some of the most unsettling characters this year, there was something really odd about them and i couldn't put my finger on it. Even when they weren't creepily crawling around there was always something off about them, and M. Night managed to show that really well. I won't talk any more about the grandparents and what is going on with them as his famous 'twist' is back, even though i didn't really think it was that great i definitely couldn't pick it out until the reveal. When you try to add comedy into a horror film that looks like it was trying to take itself seriously you run the risk of it becoming too cheesy. But somehow he managed to make the comedy really work, it wasn't overpowered by the horror and it didn't make the film look too silly, although, it definitely had its fair share of well timed comedy. There were surprisingly a few laugh out loud moments that lighten the mood and contrast the dark tones very well making it quite enjoyable. The performances in this film were actually pretty damn good but not exactly great. The grandparents played that creepy and mysterious role well and were very convincing, also the two kids played the characters well even though i thought the characters were kinda typical stereotypes in these types of horror films. In terms of what i didn't like, i have to say that the first 15-20 minutes was very cheesy and at times cringeworthy whilst introducing this family. But when the horror elements get introduced that is when the film picks up and the kids grew on me. The pacing was also a little off, similar to Paranormal Activity, you have patches of creepy activity and then a few patches of more slower story driven sections. Some of these more slower scenes i felt went for a little too long between the thriller scenes but it was just a minor thing. In the end, this was a very difficult film to review, it was just a very weird film and it is going to take me a couple of days to take it all in and get a clear view of what was good and what wasn't so for now i gotta say i enjoyed this film. It was a good blend of comedy and horror had gives a good amount of fun and at the same time creeps you out. It was definitely a film worth watching and i am curious to see if he can continue this good run. - 6.8</fullReview>

The final is really cool and i really enjoyed it. I really recommend it to anyone who loves the genre. I prefer this one than "The village" or previous movies from the same director, as it uses this original cut, helped by 2 young good actors, that play really a good part in the footage. Also the 2 elderly have done well, but what is cool is the whole idea and concept of this film. The lack of music, due to the genre ("found footage story") does not affect at all the general outcome, and even without music, thanks to the chilling scenario and background where it is filmed (an isolated farm in the countryside during winter, is perfect.

		<shortDescription>The Visit Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Becca and her younger brother Tyler (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) say goodbye to her single mother (Kathryn Hahn) as they board a train and head to Pennsylvania to meet their grandparents for the first time while she goes on a cruise with her boyfriend Miguel (Jorge Cordova). Welcomed by their grandmother (Deanna Dunagan) and their grandfather (Peter McRobbie), all is fine until both children notice that their seemingly innocent grandparents begin to behave strangely. Once both children discover a dangerous secret, they must now wonder if they can make it out alive.I will start off by saying do not dismiss this film just because it's a M. Night Shyamalan film. Sure his last few films have been terrible (or so I've heard, I haven't seen them personally) but this one is actually good. First of all, I liked the story. Didn't really care too much about the fact the mom is divorced and there's no dad. I would have liked to learn more about the backstory between the mom and the grandparents but I didn't mind too much because it was better that they were a little mysterious. I'm not going to say much more other than to expect a twist. I don't think I'm surprising anyone with this considering that it is a M. Night Shyamalan film. Even after watching the film, I went back through it and there are clues to what happens later on. My favorite part of the film happens to be the performances of Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie as the grandparents with Dunagan stealing the show as Nana(grandmother). I thought that they were both able to portray the right amount of caring innocence and creepiness. Both children were great as well as they were still being kids but they were smart characters and that they had some great one-liners. The sad thing about that was that most of the one-liners, although sometimes funny, were at the expense of making fun of old people and all of their intricacies. I laughed at the first ones but then it started getting old. I thought the performances were elevated thanks to the script as the conversations between the brother and sister felt real and natural as did that with the grandparents. There was good chemistry all around even with Kathryn Hahn as their mother who was good despite not getting to see her too much. This film has been advertised as a horror film but I didn't really see that. I thought it was more of a suspense/comedy film. Where the suspense comes from the viewer waiting to figure out what is wrong with the grandparents and what are their true intentions and the comedy comes from how the children and us, to a lesser extent, try to go about doing it. I think they did a great job at both. I just wish they took a few more liberties with the story to make it scarier. While watching the film, there were a few moments that could have gone differently. This won't spoil anything since it was in the trailer but when the grandmother asks the girl to go inside the oven to clean it, she can lock her in and turn it on. Overall, I came into this with low expectations and came out pleasantly surprised and entertained. If you give chance, maybe you will be too.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

Character's self-filmed movies, like this one, don't always work, but this was done in a clever way, with angles and shots that shine more often than not. All actors are pretty good, even the sometimes grating Oxenbould playing Tyler. Deanna Dunagan must have studied some kind of insanity manual to do this, she's very good. Creepy, funny and with a neat twist. There's a real hilariously sick, or sickly hilarious scene that will haunt you for weeks if you're a germaphobe.</fullReview>

Really? I always thought that was impossible to put those two together...you know what? I was wrong! All what's happening to their grandparents is at the same time shocking and silly so here is the mix of comedy and horror, and then you have that "brother moments" that demystify all the suspense behind the movie and gives you good laughs! The whole movie is from the perspective of the two brothers who are trying to make a documentary about their trip to grandparents house and this allows you to get deeply into the movie and feel it almost in the first person. This is a different movie from all the horror and terror movies I have seen at the moment because even in those moments of breathtaking you can't stop laughing, not because what you're seeing is funny but because it's all nonsense and silly. Other aspect I liked about this movie is that you don't have any paranormal activity all just problems of humanity but this fact doesn't remove all the horror behind the movie. The only thing I didn't like was the rushed end, they could have explored more that great finale when all the things are explained because after this moment the hole suspense ends and it just becomes a normal ending...but disregarding this point I think the movie is perfect and you will certainly enjoy every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit is a refreshing film that works for what it is. M. Night Shyamalan is a great director. Despite his last films were not good, they seem to want to go up again and with this new horror comedy, we can see their desire to evolve.This film is not his best work, but after so many disappointments, we have to take a chance on M. Night and I'll have faith that the next work is even better.The performances are very good, especially the boy, this kid has talent and his character is one of the best aspects of the film.In will respect history, does not make much sense, it is a bit ridiculous but if we forget a little and think that this is a comedy, we can enjoy the film without any problem.When I left the cinema, I did not know what to think but then I thought: this is not a good movie, but it works.I recommend to go see the movies. Support the work of M. Night. He is doing his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so glad that Night Shyamalan gave us another great movie as we got used to after watching "The Sixth Sense" or "Unbreakable". "The visit" is a very simple story but it really scares you out of your chair, the tension is present the whole movie. When I say simple story I don't mean "stupid", it is very intelligent and also familiar, because it deals with troubles in one particular family. The performances of Olivia DeJonge (Becca) and Ed Oxenbould (Tyler) were outstanding, bright talents that hopefully will offer us many more good performances. This is a very good scary movie and you must watch it if your are fan of genre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's long awaited redemption!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what happened to M. Night Shyamalan after the Sixth Sense, but I absolutely HATED just about everything he had a hand in afterward. So naturally I was extremely skeptical when I saw the first trailer for The Visit. Though it seemed promising, so had numerous other Shyamalan products. It was only due to my recent binge watch of Wayward Pines that I decided to take a chance on this movie, and I'm so glad I did!Much like my experience with Wayward Pines, I was utterly captivated by The Visit. It was way better than I expected, and I think the best part was just how elegantly simple it was. It starts out scary enough... old people doing weird, old people things. It begins as just an uncomfortable and awkward situation all around. But then the film takes a deeply disturbing turn that not everyone may expect, though I'm sure the idea will cross your mind at some point half way through the film, as it did mine.I haven't had this much fun with a Shyamalan production EVER, and this is definitely one of the most satisfying horror films I've seen in a long time. I found myself genuinely unsettled and spooked beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan comes back strong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We can all agree that Shyamalan's recent films haven't been the greatest. They were dull and weak and didn't really impress viewers in any way. I went into 'The Visit' not expecting much due to the simple fact that it was a M. Night Shyamalan film. Though, I can honestly say that watching 'The Visit' was undoubtedly one of my favorite cinematic experiences to date. With the perfect mix of comedy and horror, 'The Visit' will certainly not disappoint. It is the type of film where, even if you don't think it was scary, you definitely thought it was funny. 'The Visit' contained a solid story with great performances from the whole cast. Disturbing horror and dark humor makes for the perfect combination in this gem! Also, since this is a Shyamalan film, there has to be a twist!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DHKR: The Visit- "A Parody of Shyamalan's Other Films"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys, you won't believe this, cause hell knows I didn't when I saw this. The Visit is out, and I urge anyone who hates Shyamalan's films to go see it, because you will have a F-yay-ing good time with it. Probably because almost every red flag is held up in the first five minutes of the movie. It's a found footage-format, with child actors and elderly people going crazy, and it just bloody works! The film even graciously starts off with a black screen with the title in red bold letters, as if it's saying 'We don't care anymore!'This film starts off very generically, with the children and their movie-making hardware that seem to have unlimited battery life. They record their mom, a train attendant who used to be an actor, all before going off to meet with the grandparents. The girl is a stuck-up and the boy is Alexander from Alexander and the Who F-yay-ing Cares Anymore. Well, here he's kinda like that, but I hoped for the best. Maybe he would have an endearing performance that'll be timeless. But then I heard him rapping and then I said "Well Never Bloody Mind". For the first three quarters of the film, each of the clichés start to fester up and it seems like the best bad movie of all time. Some scenes at night show Granny puking on the floor and another where she's stark naked and scratching at the door like a house cat that's been trapped outside in Christmas time. Oddly, those "Scary" scenes from then are strikingly limited compared to the other scenes out in the day, where what you can assume are creepy scenes or scenes that forward the creepy plot, are straight up bloody laughable. Every cliché, and I mean EVERY cliché Shyamalan has used in his recent films, are played for laughs. Some classy, most not so much(There's a scene where Ed Oxenbould's character enters a creepy shed after seeing the creepy grandpa exiting it to find something creepy, only to find a bunch of plastic bags filled with used adult diapers.) Most of the child actors have good acting skills, at least from what I saw from Oxenbould's character. I can't stay mad at him for one bad movie, and he's showing off to be a pretty good comic relief that knows when to be serious. The first lead child actress, Olivia DeJonge, also seems to be growing into a good foil for second lead Oxenbould. Both work off each other and they seem to have good chemistry, which is why I think the film doesn't implode on itself right from the get go. The other main characters, the titular creepy stock elderly couple that serve as the antagonists, also work well as a team. They have good chemistry as much as the children, and they seem like nice outdoorsy farming people. Well, until the sundowning sets in. Most of the time, when Nana(She's usually the only one who's affected) is sundowning, she shows off the stereotypical crazy senile lady type, but she's usually a nice, down to earth and kind woman. even in the daytime scenes, where she 'acts' scary, it's usually playful and never horribly inappropriate. Pop Pop on the other hand is always creepy. not the kind of creepy where he acts strange, but rather, he's creepy in the way that he's always distant and cold around other people. I wish I could tell you more, but all I can say is that between the two, Pop Pop is the sane man to Nana's crazy monster lady. Then, the film holds up it's hand and it has this unusual shift in tone. in the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th Quarter, the film turns into a really suspenseful, dark, and yes, scary movie. Plot points are raveling together and things go absolutely insane. And yes, it ties in with the big shocking twist. Shyamalan is known for his quite predictable twists, but here, I was actually shocked and surprised, even when much stupider things popped up for potential twists(Some I won't spoil, but I'll say one has to do with aliens)And no, I'm not gonna spoil the twist. I really do think you should see this movie and watch it first before you find out. You....you guys seriously will be shocked to see. Guys, The Visit was just a fun blast of a movie. I urge everyone to see what's in store.Final Result: 3 and a Half Stars- B-Ranking</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Long-Awaited Return to Real Filmmaking. A Visit Worth Taking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on what I've witnessed, The Visit was something I did not expect to be so frightfully and humorously blended by a decade-long troubled filmmaker. Definitely marks a return for M. Night Shyamalan as a director. From a retrospect, this is a movie that has a few similar themes as his past hits that date back to 1999. Ever since The Sixth Sense to Unbreakable, and then Signs, these had interesting stories with twists not many would expect to understand until it's unveiled. Here, in this movie, its twist was done admirably (albeit accompanied with some humor leading up to it), but to avoid spoilers, you'll have to see for yourself on how it unfolds.Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play young teen siblings Rebecca and Tyler as they must spend the next few days at their estranged grandparents' house. Their mother Paula (played by Kathryn Hahn) has had quite an unpleasant history with them when she married at a young age and had thus not spoken with them since. Although they remain uncertain of what really happened between their mom and her own parents, Rebecca - an aspiring filmmaker - decides to explore further of the goings-on in the grandparents' house, but not without following their few ground rules that continually piques her and her brothers' interest further.With Shyamalan's storytelling/twist crossed together with Jason Blum's Paranormal Activity "found footage" concept, it helped pull the spotlight on the two sibling characters as the real stars that shine in this movie. Ed Oxenbould's Tyler shows off interesting humor when nothing bothers him. He started to somewhat remind me of Haley Joel Osment (Sixth Sense-era) when he is put on the spot as the potential, troubled victim in one scene. While Olivia DeJonge's Rebecca has a rather inquisitive personality and can't help but play detective on the strange behaviors their grandparents openly express day in and night out, especially.In the past decade, people have constantly been mocking, berating, and even pointing out M. Night Shyamalan's blunders that they ultimately found him a lost cause to the filmmaking industry. However, with a relatively low production budget and allowing him to be paired with 'Paranormal Activity' producer Jason Blum for this latest suspenseful flick, it all actually worked out. It was pleasing with the thrills and sudden surprises that I couldn't anticipate all of them so easily. Not quite at the groundbreaking level as The Sixth Sense at all, but it was more than enough to satisfy that this is Shyamalan written all over it. If anyone had caught his mini-series Wayward Pines (with Terrance Howard), that show basically jump-started his squandering career and giving him the push needed to produce a new, interesting movie. When the credits started to roll, I was at a loss for words. I just nodded my head confidently since all it took was for Shyamalan to return to his roots. He rightfully earned this one and I was not left disappointed. As long as Shyamalan sticks with this type of storytelling he knew well those years ago, he can't go wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it! Possible spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend and I chaperoned a group date with 7 teenagers 14-15 years old, and my ten year old son; we went to the late show (had a football game first), and the theater was still packed (especially for our tiny town). There seemed to be a pretty even mix of adults and teens waiting to see what M. Night Shyamalan had in store for us this time; since I've seen the majority of his movies, I knew it was going to be weird lol.My friend and I both enjoy "horror" movies, and we did jump once or twice; but I'm sure the other people viewing the movie thought that "those two crazy women in the back need to be committed" because we spent the majority of the time laughing hysterically. It wasn't that the movie was stupid or anything, it was the fact that BIG, grown men where screaming and hiding their eyes. Some even ran from the room at one point early in the movie.This movie definitely uses the element of surprise, lots of screams from the majority of the audience; they also did a great job of making the scared viewers "feel better" by following it up with a bit of comedy. All in all, I enjoyed it, and will most likely see it again when it is released to DVD.</fullReview>

However, The Visit is a little gem. Daughter wants to repair mothers relationship with her mother in the form of documentary. They go to grandparents(whom they've never met) house.All seems right in the world...not really. Thats when it starts to get creepy on a serious level. Sure it had some jumps, well I jumped as did most the theater, but it on a level of creepy that is plausible. Which it what makes it such a gem. Also the relationship between the brother and sister was hilarious and lovingly believable. Definitely worth the watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really interesting blend of a few different genres and a few different styles of camera work. The audio work is noteworthy as well - you'd never guess it was made on a micro budget of $5MM thanks to the terrific sound effects. A thinking-man's (or woman's) horror film, this opens up a whole new chapter in the genre.I'm among the many who were perplexed by perplexingly bad movies that M Night made - particularly The Lady in the Water - but I'm glad some of his instincts are still intact!The movie is ever-so-slightly off-center that it's charming. For instance, the dialogue doesn't always flow in the direction you'd expect.Watch this insightful interview with the director for more context: https://youtu.be/g5IpXWkSJbA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creative mastermind of contemporary psycho thrillers redeems himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most fascinating and controversial contemporary directors. His newest independent movie goes back to his roots and offers an increasingly addicting plot, a solid acting performance and a twist that is so simple you might not even see it coming. The creative Indian artist manages to make a convincing movie despite a limited budget, a rather unexperienced crew and a lot of found footage material that is usually employed in some of the worst contemporary horror films like ''Devil's Due''. In this movie, the idea of the found footage material makes sense for once and even adds some intimate depth to the two main characters. The fact that two young and rather unknown actors are taking the lead somehow adds to the credibility of the scenario. Even the limited budget turns out to be an advantage since this movie comes around without any distracting special effects. Still, the camera angles, the lighting techniques and the soundtrack are decently chosen and add to an overall positive impression.What makes this movie stand out is its curious mixture of genres. In fact, M. Night Shyamalan once said that there are three different versions of this film and I'm really curious to watch the other two. One version is an over-the-top comedy flick, the second is a creepy horror movie and the cinematic choice that I'm reviewing right now is in fact a convincing mixture of both. Let's add that the beginning of this movie almost feels like a mixture of a documentary and a reality television show. Most of the times, humorous horror movies can't convince me and feel ridiculous to me since I even disliked the original ''Evil Dead'' flicks. In this clever case, the movie starts with a few awkward scenes where the audience might not be sure whether they should laugh or feel scared which adds to the overall uneasy atmosphere of the film. In the beginning, one doesn't clearly know where this movie is going to lead us. There are a few creepy horror movie sequences. Other moments feel like light slapstick comedy scenes. The behaviour of some characters shows hints at a solid psycho thriller. The background story of the movie includes dramatic elements. M. Night Shyamalan leads us to a surprisingly coherent and entertaining potpourri of genres before the final thirty minutes of this cinematic cut clearly prove that this version ends up being a gruesome psycho thriller or horror movie. The twisting and turning story is so captivating that the final twist comes almost unexpectedly despite its simplicity.It has become an almost popular trend to expose M. Night Shyamalan's most recent efforts to unjustified prejudice but let me tell you that true fans of this director and the psycho thriller and horror genres will get more than they could expect from this movie. Despite its subtle diversity, this film is to the point and never loses its clear guiding line. Despite its slow build-up, the film always remains entertaining and even gripping. This movie might not be the director's opus magnum but its mixture of grounded cinematic elements and experimental influences from diverse genres makes this one of the director's best movie of the past ten years and one of the better psycho thrillers or horror movies of a rather unconvincing cinematic year 2015. If you are a sucker for any of these two genres, I can warmly recommend this movie to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Creepy Return-to-Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit begins with the words "An M. Night Shyamalan Film" plastered on the screen. Based on his recent track record, I was worried this proclamation may end up being the scariest part of the film. Luckily, the infamous filmmaker has taken a step back in the right direction with his most purely horror film to date. Sure, his propensity for hackneyed exposition and odd dialogue hasn't disappeared completely, but they are accompanied by some truly original horror images, shot with an immense skill for effectively terrifying timing. The Visit is a decent little creep-show that's a shocking return-to-form for Shyamalan. This success is largely thanks to its narrow scope: two teens must spend a week with their grandparents who are growing increasingly strange. We never really leave the home of the elderly couple, allowing the unique scares to be at the center. These thrills are effectively eye-covering, but what makes them fun is their ability and intention to cause laughter as quickly as screams. Some of that humor exudes straight from the jokes in the scares, but much of it is just an acknowledgment of having been tricked. The spookily exaggerated performances may be a turn-off for some, but they enhance the simultaneous feeling of dread and silliness that make this film work. That balance is where The Visit works best, but when it tries to reach deeper it falters. Luckily, Shyamalan rarely let's his ambitions get in the way of the scary good times. With some truly unforgettable moments and a heart-dropping reveal, this small-scale chiller reminds us why we fell in love with this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Night of Signs shines in The Visit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a truly enjoyable movie-going experience (except for the teenage girl behind me who kicked my seat every time she screamed). I have not experienced an audience laugh out loud so much or scream out loud so much in a long, long time. The Visit had the potential to be a truly horrifying experience. Night expertly takes the audiences hand (grips it with a vice like strength) and drags you through each twist and turn. He gives you time to laugh and then scares the laugh right out of you. The Visit incorporates what I love best about Night's excellent storytelling - an element of redemption, reminding the audience of some of life's more important lessons. Thus relieving you of having to have it be unbearably terrifying. A huge nod to the two young actors who were magnificent in this film. Thank you! You both did an incredible job!! We are returned once again to the confines of one family, one house, one memorable week, one marvelous Night experience. I loved it. Well done Night! Well done!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, M Night Shyamalan has made some questionable films. This is NOT one of them. It's listed as horror/comedy, but the humor is still scary. It isn't an awkward blend of horror and comedy. Shyamalan, bear with me while I spell his name, makes the simplest things horrifying. Deanna Dunagan is beyond creepy, but she was a good actress in general. She was more than just creepy. I didn't like that I was told that there was a twist, because I figured it out early. The one thing that I was a little confused about was that I felt like the grandma was made to seem evil and demonic, but then they said that she was from the hospital and she was a murderer, but they never explain her weird movements that don't seem human. My other complaint is that the kids had the cameras when they were being attacked. Other than that, it was a great story and it was so scary that I was afraid to swallow. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fully prepared to be disappointed in this film. I walked in thinking it was going to be another terrible M. Night Shyamalan film. Boy was I wrong. This movie was actually scary, and surprisingly funny.The film is about two siblings who decide to visit their grandparents, whom they've never met. Before the kids were born their mother had a huge falling out with them and hasn't seen or spoken to them in 15 years. The eldest child, Becca, decides to make a documentary about her trip with them and really wants to patch things up between them and her mom. Their grandparents seem normal at first but they soon see some odd things. Nana has sundowners, a form of dementia, and they see her do some crazy things after bedtime. Becca catches her roaming around the house puking, banging doors, scratching at walls, and just acting super strange at times. Pop-pop isn't too normal either. He's hoarding used adult diapers in a barn and gets confused about having to go to a costume party. All things that are brushed off as them being old.Becca is an overly serious filmmaker, or at least she wants to be. Her pretentious attitude is for the most part entertaining. Her brother Tyler is like any younger brother, annoying. He wants to be a rapper which makes for some hilarious scenes. He stole the show. The jokes made were exactly like kids his age. It never felt out of place and a lot of the punchlines were met with applause from the audience.Honestly this film suffered from bad marketing. The first trailer I saw was one scene where Nana asks Becca to get into the oven (photo to the right). And that is it. I think all the trailers made the film seem cheesy and that the plot and twist was going to be a let down. But it really was a good movie and the trailers should be ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M Night Shymalan hasn't had the greatest reputation as of late, has he? Shymalan came right out of the gate and took all genres of film by storm with his directorial debut in The Sixth Sense, which is one of my Top 10 Favorite Films. Then, he seemed to go downhill a bit from there. Some might argue Unbreakable is his best movie, but I don't agree. Signs has some genuinely great moments in there, but it's FOR SURE not his best movie. The Village is just okay. Lady in the Water is not good. The Happening...wow. This is a "so bad it's good" movie, so it's enjoyable. However, The Happening was when people really thought that Shymalan is terrible, which I don't think is true necessarily. But oh God...The Last Airbender and After Earth are AWFUL. However, now it seems...SHYMALAN HAS MADE A COMEBACK! This movie is a return to what Shymalan is best at. Low budget drama/horror. However, he has also added some entirely unique stuff in this movie that is new territory for him.The plot of The Visit is that two kids are visiting their grandparents whom they've never met before, and as their stay goes on, they see that their grandparents are seriously WEIRD and creepy. I won't say much more because there were plot elements in this movie that surprised me greatly that I did not know about before walking in the theater.The Visit adds horror and comedy, and it equals wildly enjoyable results. I can't say that it's gut-busting hilarious, but it's very funny. The horror? I can't remember many scenes where I was really scared, but it has some frightening sequences and moments in there.The part that really makes the horror/comedy gel together so well is the performances. Shymalan has indeed had some horrendous child actors in his films, but the two in this movie are marvelous. They get all the right cues correct in all the appropriate moments. The actors that play the grandparents are so well at portraying these totally messed up people.Found footage has been so overused. The Visit makes it feel very refreshing, though, and it's all thanks to Shymalan's direction. There are none of the dull and stupid found footage gimmicks here. The found footage here makes it feel so REAL, and I can't remember the last time a movie did that since The Blair Witch Project. Also, it also makes perfect sense why found footage is used in the context of the movie. The girl in the movie is an aspiring director. Simple, but perfect.Shymalan is famous for putting mind-blowing plot twists in his movies. While The Visit's twist isn't as much of a powerful punch as his previous ones, it's still pretty shocking.Shymalan's films can be emotionally deep, especially The Sixth Sense. He tries to incorporate that in The Visit here, but I thought these moments fell flat, sadly. They feel out of place and not very emotionally hard-hitting.Remember what I said earlier about how some of this movie is entirely new territory for Shymalan? Well, some people criticize him for having joyless, bland styles in his movies (which I don't agree with personally). This movie, though, has a lot of humour as I said before and is very eccentric. What I am trying to say is this is basically a crackhead's kind of movie. LOL. I, for the record, am not a crackhead. Once again, LOL.Another thing some people do not like about Shymalan's films is their slow pace, which I have no problem with. In fact, I think slow pacing fits in to all of his best movies perfectly. This movie does have a bit of a slow pace. If that is something, you've always disliked about his movies, The Visit may not change your mind about not being a fan of his.Some of my friends made remarks saying how stupid this movie looked from the trailers and commercials. Honestly, I can't recommend this movie to them because those short clips of it are a pretty good overview of what the movie is like. For me, though, as the title says, I thought The Visit was wildly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, we have M. Night Shyamlan back in rare form with his new horror-comedy film 'The Visit', which definitely doesn't look like a Shyamalan movie at all. In fact, this is one of those "found footage" movies that rejuvenates this sub-genre of filmmaking once again. The world was introduced to M. Night Shyamalan back in 1999 with his hit film 'The Sixth Sense', which quickly led the young director to super-stardom as one of the coolest and imaginative directors of this modern era. Not only that, but he re-invented the "twist ending" again, which became a trademark of his down the road.He followed up 'The Sixth Sense' with 'Unbreakable' (one of the most underrated movies of all time), followed by the alien invasion film 'Signs'. After that those three movies, it seemed that Shyamalan took a turn in his filmmaking that had audiences and critics alike slamming his movies, one after the other. Even though I enjoyed the hell out of 'The Village', I know many others didn't. Then after that, there was a string of films that most critics and audiences consider some of the worst movies ever made.Even with Shyamalan's last film 'After Earth', the studio never marketed his name to the movie, in fear that people wouldn't go see it, given his track record. This was strange, because studios used to bill his name to drive audiences in, not the other way around. That all being said, I'm happy to announce that this M. Night Shyamalan film is a great welcome back for the estranged director and a great step towards greatness again, even though the film doesn't have the trademark Shyamalan look to it. Made up of a cast with almost no recognized actors, minus Kathryn Hahn, and filmed on a $5 million dollar budget, this new mix of horror and comedy called 'The Visit' is well worth your time and equally packs a good amount of scares as well as laughs.'The Visit' follows brother and sister Rebecca and Tyler (Olivia De Jonge and Ed Oxenbould respectively), who are early teenagers, living with their single mother Paula (Hahn). Witty, oddly intelligent, and hilariously fun, these kids are making a documentary of their life and adventures to show their mother and her troubled past. In order to allow their mom some much needed vacation time with her new boyfriend, the kids are going to stay with their grandparents for the week, whom they have never met, nor has their mother seen them since she was 19 after a bad falling out. Rebecca and Tyler take the train to visit their grandparents on their farm in their small town, documenting every little thing, even Tyler's hilarious freestyle raps.They meet their grandparents Doris and John (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) with open arms and all seems happy for the time being. But, it's not far off that Rebecca and Tyler begin to notice very strange and creepy things going on after lights out with their grandparents, and it only gets worse with each night passing. Shyamalan wrote the script here, but i'm not sure how much of it was improv or written, but whatever the case might be, he has shown once again that he can be a master of horror. There are so many creepy and down right scary moments that you'll be on the edge of your seat gasping for a breath.Equally though too, you'll laugh as much as you're scared, even if some of the laughter is of the nervous kind. Shyamalan and his actors take you on this ride, full force, never giving in, and never allowing you to guess the twist, which of course there is one, and it's remarkable. The "found footage" aspect is brilliant up to a certain point, where I think it could have gone into a full narrative look and been just as good if not better, because there were some odd mistakes and weird camera movements.Other than a couple of unexplained plot holes, 'The Visit' does exactly what it aims to do, which is to scare you completely and make you laugh throughout. I never knew Shyamlan had it in him to make me laugh, but he sure does, thanks to the brilliant young actor Ed Oxenbold. Deanna Dunagan also shines here in her role as the grandmother, who will make you feel right at home, but in a split second, make you too scared to come out of your room. There is also a bit of heart and soul to this picture as there is with most of Shyamalan's work, which was nice to see. M. Night Shyamalan is back and I hope it stays this way. If I were a younger kid, watching this movie, I would NEVER EVER want to visit my grandparents again. I can't wait to see it again.Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Visit From Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Ed Oxenbould, Olivia DeJonge, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn Hahn.The Visit revolves around two siblings, Becca(Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler(Ed Oxenbould), on their trip to met their estranged grandparents who they never previously had met. As they reach they are given a rather straight forward rule by their grandmother(Deanna Dungan), Don't stay up later than 9:30. Since the kids do, all hell breaks loose as they view some of the strangest things humans can ever do from their elderly grandparents.Shyamalan IS a great writer/director. He crafted a highly suspenseful and psychological thriller in the Sixth Sense. A emotional thrill ride for Unbreakable(My favorite of his). And, finally a pitch perfect atmosphere for Signs. This dude knows how to make movies. Though he's had more misses than hits, but he is persistent. I got to say his persistence payed off, big time.This movie was great! I was entertained the entire time. Shyamalan placed a close to flawless script in motion with taut, suspenseful thrills that grabs hold and never really lets go. That was marketed in the trailer. What wasn't marketed was the sheer hilarity of the script. I had a feeling that this would be a spoof on horror movies and I was right. The black comedy in this movie is untouchable and is thoroughly enthralling. Along with the thrills and comedy comes with a lot of thick emotional heft which was lacking in his past few entries. Finally the script offered realistic dialogue with little to no use of modern day jump scares with a twist so powerful it'll leave you breathless.On to the performances. The comedy in this movie is entirely credited to Ed Oxenbould. His instant out burst of rap are contagious. Not to mention his grade A sarcasm and charm should definitely land his a Golden Globe nod if not an Oscar. He was Mother Julia Roberts Good. He was the best part of this movie. A close second is Dianna Dungan. She was creepy, menacing, sympathetic and sweet all rolled into one beautiful performance. Although I didn't find documentarian Olivia Dejonge as entertaining as Dungan and Oxenbould, she added a certain depth to the movie as she and Oxenbould get over their personal phobias.As for negatives I had one minor one that snowballed into a big one. It's the over exaggeration of insanity of the grandparents' part. It was tolerable at first but then became tedious to watch nearing the end as they started to resemble real horror icons. Alas it slayed a close to perfect movie.The Visit is an extremely enjoyable entry into Shyamalan's filmography that ranks up to Signs and close to The Sixth Sense. I highly recommend a watch if one is looking for a comedy and a thriller but can only buy one ticket. The Visit gets an 8/10 or an A-.This movie is truly a welcome Visit from Shyamalan and a true end of summer treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>he Visit manages to do two great things: it breaks the losing streak Shyamalan has been having for over a decade, and it manages to continue a winning streak for 2015 horror. The Visit is about two siblings who visit their estranged grandparents for a week while the girl, Becca, films a documentary about their stay. After a few strange encounters, they realize something is seriously wrong with their hosts. Although it wasn't as terrifying as Unfriended or It Follows, The Visit is the most fun I've had watching a horror movie in the theater. You'll be laughing your ass off through laced fingers; it's just as thrilling as it is funny. The movie perfectly punctuates every intense scene with some witty dialog from the kids. I smell a comeback for a once-acclaimed director, and the first step is with the wickedly fun The Visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went with my older brother and his girlfriend in cinema and we watched it. We had a positive thought about this movie. It was really, really good movie! Something similar of The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014), but by way DL is still creepier. The Visit is so scary, creepy, shocking, dark, little disturbing and funny. It's about two young children who they went to visit grandma and grandfather that they have never seen them. Grandparents were really behaved so strangely. You could get shocked if you discover their private life or things. First third of the movie was so creepy, chocking and it was very dark! And again it was really good, the only thing that grandma should to fix own character to be more creepy as crazy grandma from Deborah Logan, but anyway she was also good in the movie. I'll recommend this movie for everyone or horror fans, especially found footage fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Return To Form For M. Night Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a brother and sister go on a week long visit to see their grandparents who they have never met, things don't go as planned.The low budget feel, comedic aspects and natural scares make this psychological thriller M. Night Shyamalan's return to form. His choice to use found footage works in the context of the film and lends for some great scares. The performances are brilliant, Olivia Dejonge's "Becca" is a fully fleshed out character with struggles of her own, her filmmaking sensibilities add to her likability as a character. The grandparents played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie are fascinating to watch from every creepy gaze to all their craziest moments. However Ed Oxenbould is the stand out, as want to be rapper "Tyler", he acts as the main source of comic relief in the film and is hilarious in doing so.I love how this film sucked me in from the beginning, it's sets up its characters in a way that made me invest in them. Information is given at perfect stages throughout the film which helps to develop the characters and make them seem fully realized.The direction of this film is perfect, build ups of tension are not accompanied by music which adds realism to the sense of dread. The horror aspects come from the what if factor. The spontaneity of the grandparents behavior also has a part to play in the execution of the psychological horror.As for negatives, some of the uses of hand held camera did become frustrating at times which weakens the scares overall. Also I thought some of the events came across far too ridiculous to be freighting.But Overall I loved The Visit, its lovable characters, comedic aspects, clever use of tension,and smartly crafted story make a one hell of an entertaining journey. I am going The Visit an 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest films I've seen this year! Welcome back, M. Night Shyamalan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is back! For reals this time! Now I know that his movies in the past decade or so with "Lady In The Water," "The Happening," "The Last Airbender," and "After Earth" got us wondering what the hell happened to the man who gave us "The Sixth Sense," and "Signs" and I don't blame ya, 'cause it baffled me too. But let me assure you that Shyamalan's latest installment, THE VISIT, is one helluva a comeback on his part, it's one of the scariest and also one of this year's most hysterical films and I mean that in a good way. Turns out all it took is for Shyamalan to go back to his smaller budget roots plus the involvement of super producer Jason Blum.Shyamalan cast two very talented and very young Australian actors for this film, Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould who play American siblings, Becca and Tyler respectively, who get sent by their loving single mom (Kathryn Hahn) to the countryside of Pennsylvania so that they would get to meet and hang out with their grandparents for the first time ever.At the beginning, the story gives you an idea that Kathryn Hahn's character's relationship with her parents didn't end well thus they haven't spoken to each other in years and that kinda sets the emotional tone.But what's supposed to be just a normal visit to grandparents' home, just like any of us would with our grandparents, things start to go wrong for Becca and Tyler because Nana (Deanna Dunaga) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) start displaying weird and scary and unexpected episodes that can't be explained by the simple fact that they're old.It's found footage style, so just brace yourself in case you're not a fan of this type of filmmaking, but I don't think it distracts or takes away from the horror or the suspense. The character Becca is an aspiring docu filmmaker, so that's the found footage entrance, Becca would have cameras and she'd interview the grandparents, the character Tyler is a wannabe rapper, he provides much of the comedy in this film.May I just say that THE VISIT is as frightening as it is also hilarious, and not in a way that the movie is so bad that it's laughable, not at all, I usually don't associate M. Night Shyamalan with comedy but the humor in this film, the timing, the jokes hit every single target, I'm genuinely impressed, the jokes are intentional and they land, every last one of them. It's a side of Shyamalan's storytelling that I'm not used to but I welcome it.THE VISIT is also an effective horror/suspense, just the mystery of trying to figure out what has gone wrong with the grandparents, that pretty much keeps you tied to your seat, it's so scary that while I was watching it, I found myself doing what I used to do when I was a kid watching horror movies and that is to cover my eyes with my hands but with a few fingers open because a part of me was still curious to see what was going on.The build-up is great, the execution is great, I think the young actors are talented, and I have to give credit also to the veteran actors who play the grandparents Deanna Dunaga and Peter McRobbie, they know how to play creepy and psychotic perfectly. The film is very Hitchcockian, THE VISIT reminds us of the M. Night Shyamalan we used to admire and it's good to have him back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: M. Night ShyamalanWriter: M. Night ShyamalanStarring: Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dugan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn HannRelease Date: September 11, 2015MPAA Rating: PG-13 for disturbing thematic material, including terror, violence, and some nudity, and for brief languageRuntime: 1 hour and 34 minutesStudio: Universal PicturesIf I had to name a director who has gone downhill after making great movies, It'd be M. Night Shyamalan. Whilst The Sixth Sense wasn't his first film ( he directed Praying With Anger and Wide Awake, before this), it was the one that made him famous, and he followed it up with Unbreakable (my favorite Shyamalan film), Signs (which I think is good, but not great, like people say it is), and The Village (which I think is very underrated). However, to me, after The Village, Shyamalan started making crap after crap, with Lady in the Water, The Happening (it's so bad it it's good though), The Last Airbender (my least favorite movie), and After Earth. I was hoping that The Visit would be his return to form, and I'm happy to say that not only it is his return, but also one of his best films, IMHO.The plot of The Visit focuses on two siblings, a teenage girl (and aspiring filmmaker) Becca, and her little brother, Tyler. When their mother goes on vacation, with her boyfriend, for a week, she sends her children to visit their grandparents. However, whilst it all seems normal during the day, at night, the kids start to not notice some incredibly strange behavior from their grandparents, at night. So both of them (especially Tyler), concerned about their grandparents' behavior, are trying to find out what is going on with them.I know a few people has said this, after the movie's release, but with most recent Shyamalan films (such as Lady in the Water and The Happening), audiences usually laugh at Shyamalan's failures. This time, we are laughing at him. Don't get me wrong, this film is definitely scary, however there are lots of funny moments as well, particularly the comic- relief that we get from Tyler (easily my favorite character in the film). Another thing that this film succeeds at is balancing the horror and comedy, so well. Seriously, there are little to no tonal shifts, as this film had me laughing out loud, at some points, and getting really terrified at others. There is also a plot twist (one of Shyamalan's trademarks), and I hear a lot of people see it as good but foreseeable. Maybe it was because I never saw this kind of twist before, but I really didn't expect it coming (though I can see why people would say otherwise), and it at least makes sense to what's gong on, so I found it pretty clever, and it's executed perfectly, as well (not giving any spoilers). Sure the film is not perfect, as it does have a few false scares and a couple of questionable character decisions, but it's still a blast of a script.Another thing that this film improves upon other Shyamalan films is the acting. For a director who had films that were able to turn Mark Wahlberg super awkward, and Will Smith incredibly bland, the two child actors, Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould are really great here, and I did buy into their chemistry, as bother and sister. Oxenbould is especially great, as he is able to bring lots of charisma to the already hilarious Tyler, especially when the kid sings rap songs. The rest of the cast do very good jobs, as well, with Deanna Dugan and Peter McRobbie being really creepy as the grandparents.M. Night Shyamalan also seems to be a lot more confident, this time around. His direction does a great job, bringing much suspense, atmosphere, and energy to the film. Seriously, there are so many terrifying moments, including one that I won't spoil, but I will say that it feels a little like Paranormal Activity (you'll see what I mean if you watch this movie), and I honestly felt that it was the scariest scene in the whole film. The cinematography is also very nice to look at.Overall, after making four craps in a row, M. Night Shyamalan is definitely back. Sure, this film may not be perfect, but I just had a lot of fun with it. Its humor is incredibly hilarious, and the film is really scary as well. It's also well paced, acted, and directed to boot. I honestly think that this is his best film, since Unbreakable.FINAL VERDICT: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Visit (2015): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, Kathryn Hahn: Creepy thriller about presumed innocence. Kathryn Hahn plays Paula Jamison, a divorcée who is off on a cruise with her latest beau. Her two children, Rebecca and Tyler are played by Olivia DeJorge and Ed Oxenbould. They give this film its found footage presentation as they film everything. They are being sent off to their estrange grandparents whom their mother conceals resentment towards. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie play Doris and John Jamison and they seem friendly enough until they issue a 9:30pm curfew. This results in strange occurrences of Doris scratching about in the horrid nude and John concealing his feces and shotgun in the outhouse. M. Night Shyamalan's career began with such promise until hitting several career embarrassments. Here he tones down the budget and allows for ominous atmosphere. What works against it is its inability to decide whether it is scary or amusing. It is includes a scene involving an adult diaper that is beyond cruel. DeJonge as Rebecca struggles with resentment towards her absent father. Oxenbould as Tyler is upbeat and expresses himself through rap and hip-hop. Dunagan and McRobbie are the right kind of strange and whacked as this old couple who are not what they seem. Hahn as Paula is briefer but much of her is played out through dialogue. This is a weird thriller about the not so innocence of the seemingly so as it stresses the void left when parents are absent. Speaking of which, it is great to see Shyamalan visit his roots again. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a bow, it's Manoj, again!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit is an intelligent thriller that uses our senses to disguise the secrets just like the Sixth Sense did.The whole movie is made out of the footage from what kids have shot with their DSLR cameras. The natural camera angles makes some visual tension. The acting by the two talented kids is what captures the audience's imagination. And of course, the actors who played grandparents did an excellent job.Manoj Shyamalan could have cut the final movie as complete comedy or complete horror but he made it as 50% comedy initially and got the horror slowly unfold itself in the rest of the movie. Writing the screenplay is very difficult especially when it deals with the footage from reality-show-kind-of-scenes. But like he managed the same in Sixth Sense without reveling a bit of suspense till the very end, he did the same in this movie.Without revealing too much about the story, I can say that The Visit can be compared with The Sixth Sense easily. However, instead of serious drama, here the scenes are funny most of the time.I loved the movie myself along with the audience when I watched it today in the theater. I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it is Shamalayan's best film in years, it is still lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit tells the story of two young children visiting their grandparents with whom they've been estranged from for 15 years. At the willingness of their mother, the children are sent to spend some time with their grandparents to get to know them. As they get to the grandparents house, they notice nefarious events beginning to occur. As an M. Night Shamalayan film, The Visit is surprisingly funny with bouts of some truly terrifying scenes. The problem here is Shamalayan seems to be selling himself short here by the style in which it is presented. That style being the cheapest way to make horror films nowadays, that is through the found footage genre. The Visit displays elements of old school scares mixed with today's technology but never really capitalizes on it like it should. The Visit would have worked better as an actual film rather than a cheap found footage horror film about crazy grandparents. If there is anything wrong with the film, it is definitely with the style. It is cheap, you can tell it's cheap, you can feel it's cheap but what keeps you moving are the performances and the actual story. The story here is surprisingly well done considering the catastrophes that Shamalayan has willing stamped his name on in the recent years. It features some surprisingly funny moments, especially from Ed Oxenbough, whose performance as Tyler is the true highlight of the film. The rest of the cast does very well, including Kathryn Hahn (whose role is more a cameo of sorts). The story, as I said above, was very good. The suspense is suspenseful, the comedy is funny and the horror is horrifying but it all doesn't seem to click over the found footage style it is conveyed as. Overall, The Visit is a welcome return to form for M. Night Shamalayan but considering what he has done prior to his slump, you can't shake the feeling that this could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely funny, scary &amp; original portrayal of how high tech kids see the elderly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so much fun because it got me to relate how as a child I had to use humor with my siblings to deal with some of our elderly relatives who were not all there and had developed some strange habits and behaviors that made it difficult to determine motive and intent and whether we should consider ourselves in danger.Very good child actors with realistic and well grounded persona's convey this same fear &amp; doubt in dealing as respectfully as they possibly can with downright disturbing (potentially dangerous) behaviors from their grandparents they're visiting for the first time.Probably the most original movie I've seen this year considering it borrows from the live camera view techniques of "Paranormal Activity" only with much better actors that convincingly put you right in the middle of it like no other movie of its kind where the audience literally sees through a child's perspective. And we all know how frightening that can be.I can tell you for sure I've never laughed so hard at something so disturbing and scary in any movie. I got a sort of "Abbott &amp; Costello Meet The Wolfman" vibe only the scary parts are WAY MORE SCARY and realistic and the humor is as you'ld expect from tech savvy, video game playing, wise-cracking kids. I swear the boy's character reminds me ogle eyed, lisp talking Ralph from "A Christmas Story" but with one heck of a mouth on him.</fullReview>

Young actors really shines, but granny... She added a special spice to this "soup". I can imagine children watching this movie and after being scared to stay alone in their bedroom or something. Whole movie is recorder hand-held, because main character girl is director wannabe, so she decided to shoot a picture about her moms childhood and her relationship with her parents (her grandparents).

		<shortDescription>A return to form, a revitalization of a genre, and so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things surprising and unique about M. Night Shyamalan's "The Visit," but probably the most surprising thing of all is the genuine optimism from the general public and film community for this film to be good. Leading up to the film's premiere, I saw hopes, pleas, and cries for this film to be good, contrary to hopes that a film tanks or winds up being a total failure, which seems to be the norm from cinephiles nowadays about any film. Given Shyamalan's track record has been fairly pitiful of late, with his most recent films "The Happening," "The Last Airbender," and "After Earth" being massive critical failures after claims he was the next Steven Spielberg following breakout films like "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable," this positive, cheerful sentiment, to me, is unbelievable. The things he was once commended for - twists, inventive setups, and compelling buildups - became subjects of parody when discussing Shyamalan with his recent tread into lackluster film territory, but "The Visit" rekindles the spark that was lost in Shyamalan's films for so many years.The film revolves around Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), two young kids who are preparing for a week-long stay with their grandparents, John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan), when their mother Paula (Kathryn Hanh) and her current boyfriend go on a resort cruise. Rebecca and Tyler have never met their grandparents, due to their mother not speaking to them following the marriage and subsequent divorce from their father, so this vacation will be completely out of the blue for both of them. As a result, Rebecca, who loves film, decides to turn the experience into a documentary, featuring her and her brother meeting their grandparents for the first time and getting to the bottom of their mother's long-lost contact with the two.Upon arrival, John and Doris seem a little out of it. At first, Rebecca and Tyler just recognize the couple as being elderly. The only rule the grandparents enact for their grandchildren is that they cannot leave their room past 9:30pm. One night, however, Rebecca leaves her room to get a snack and sees both of her grandparents acting strangely, talking to themselves, vomiting, and engaging in what looks to be demented sleepwalking. Both her and Tyler are determined to find out what exactly is wrong with their grandparents, all while trying to piece together the strained relationship between them and their only daughter.In efforts to predicate "The Visit" off of what made his breakout beyond your average thriller director, Shyamalan also winds up breeding much-needed life into the found-footage genre. Through his characters, Shyamalan exposes the inherent inanity and frustration bestowed upon others when one person decides to go around and film everything they're doing. Rebecca's precocious "cinephile" tactics become used as dictation methods for her Tyler, who hilariously states, "nobody gives a crap about cinematic standards" when she's discussing the bar she's setting for her documentary. This nuanced manner of self-parody allows for "The Visit" to function on the plane of a found footage film whilst being a bit playful with the style.It's also amazing to note how funny "The Visit" can be, particularly thanks to Ex Oxenbould, who, after this and "Alexander and The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day," is becoming quite the child actor, thanks to his unique appearance and decidedly natural presence. Oxenbould delivers some of the funniest lines in the film, as he plays the antsy little brother who is an aspiring rap artist, spitting bars whenever he gets the opportunity. The prevalent humor also helps emphasize the terrifically managed duality of having uproariously funny humor and well-paced, frightening suspense both exist in the film. Miraculously, one doesn't triumph over another, nor does one become the more dominant element, and "The Visit" remains consistently funny and scary, something I never saw coming.I realize this is less a review and more the ramblings of an awestruck viewer, but "The Visit" is one of the most peculiar mainstream films to be released in sometime and I have no doubt it will have that effect on some people. Shyamalan makes conventionality scary here, with the old house, decorated with wallpaper, hardwood floors, and antiques, captured through beautiful, rural cinematography by cinematographer Maryse Alberti. This is the essential element of "The Visit," I feel and that's the fact that Shyamalan doesn't do much groundbreaking here. Merging comedy and horror is something that has been common since the spoof films of the 1980's, the woodsy environment and singular house in the middle of nowhere is an exploited cliché, and two youths trapped at the mercy of their surroundings is another commonality in many horror films. It's the personal expertise which Shyamalan verifies in this film, reassuring audiences who have fallen off from him in recent years that he can still concoct a rich, involving story and shock on numerous levels. The film has the surmounting dread and strong scares of a good mystery in addition to humor greater than most comedies this year. "The Visit" already, even with its considerable praise and strong pre-release reaction, is looking at being an underrated delight from Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Proves M. Night Shyamalan is Still Capable of Making A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is going to be a very quick review for "The Visit". I extremely enjoyed this film! This proves M Night Shyamalan can still be a talented film maker. After The Village, Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth I pretty much gave up on seeing anything impressive from him. I was wrong, this film is actually super enjoyable and I had to blast. First thing you have to know about going into this film is that it is Hilarious! I found it more of a comedy more than a horror. The little boy in this film made me laugh every time he came on screen. This film is very campy like Evil Dead 2 or Scream but the comedy is took to an even higher level. The found footage in this film works because it really feels like this girl wants to make this documentary, plus the lack of music in the film made it feel even more realistic! All the performances in this film are great, the film is capable of being very humorous and tense at once, and the twist and turns that happen in the film are smart and intelligent. Im going to give the Visit a overall score of:(A-) &amp; (9/10) Please check out this film I highly recommend it for comedy lovers and people looking for a new take on the found footage genre. Glad to have you back Shyamalan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much like last month's film, The Gift by Joel Edgerton, The Visit is another film this year that completely took me by surprise. It was a film that I did not even know about up until the last couple of weeks when I saw that it was to be released in mid September. It was another film that I had seen no trailers for, and knew absolutely nothing about the film. Closer to the release date, the film was gathering good reviews from most critics and I have to say that my curiosity was peaked. It had been a long time since I had seen a film by M. Night Shyamalan (the last one I was to see was Signs in 2002) and after Signs, he really did not have a critical, or box office hit for quite a long time. Well basically up till now. Every film he made after Signs, was almost always critically panned and proved to be box office poison. I did not watch any of those films because of the sometimes atrocious reviews they were receiving as well as when I went to see Signs, I strongly, strongly disliked it. I remember it was a film that I wish I could have gotten my money and time back for after I walked out of the theatre. That was 13 years ago, so perhaps if I gave it another watch now maybe I would think differently, but as it stands I am here to review The Visit, and that is what I will do. This is another film that falls into the category where the less you know about the film going into it, the more I think you will end up enjoying it in the end. The theatre I went to was mostly occupied by teenagers who were in their early teens. Usually seeing a film where the teenage audience screams, laughs and generally makes themselves very vocal during this type of film would probably bother me, but surprisingly this time around, I found it to be a good atmosphere for the film and kind of even further enhanced my enjoyment of the film. The Visit, is shot like a documentary film and thankfully for the most part there is none of those shaky camera shots that nauseated me for an entire day after I saw The Blair Witch Project on the big screen. The film is certainly one of the most unusual films I have ever seen, but I mean that in the best way possible. At times, The Visit blends comedy, horror and at times can even be very gross and childish, but at the same time I loved every minute of it. At times what you are seeing on the screen is so bizarre and out there that you want to laugh at the film because some of it seems almost pathetic in a B movie kind of way both with it's jokes as well as some of the scares and situations it conjures up, but everything here is so entertaining and technically well done that you can not help but have your eyes glued to the screen and be fascinated by it, while at the same time even being disgusted, disturbed, or in disbelief over the whole thing. The story and the way it works here is certainly the work of bent and undoubtedly a very creative mind. Shyamalan seems to be having a lot of fun with this film and it definitely shows and we as an audience are having a blast with the film as it goes along because regardless of whether you end up liking the film, or not, I think most people would definitely have to say this is one of the strangest films in recent memory for a mainstream release and will certainly stay in your memory for awhile to come regardless if you liked the film, or not. Shymalan has proved that he directs children and teenagers well. Look at Haley Joel Osment's Oscar nominated performance in The Sixth Sense. Again the two young leads in this film played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould are terrific. They are smart characters, they are interesting characters and they play against type by actually doing everything right in this film that usually the young people in horror films don't do. They have wonderful personalities and some interesting character dissection of them is quite fascinating and at times moving regarding them as well. As for the adult actors in the film, I won't say too much as to give anything away, but just like the young performers here, they are also terrific. The film is certainly an offbeat one and is destined to become a cult classic in it's own right and rightly so. The film may seem a bit uneven at times, but I think it was all orchestrated that way perfectly and in it's own weird way it plays out beautifully. This is certainly the most fun and unique film experiences I have had at the theatre this year and The Visit will not be a film I will soon forget and I hope it gets Shyamalan back on the map as well as making stars out of these two terrific leading young actors. And again whether you like the film, or not, it will certainly leave an impression on you and one you won't soon forget which in it's own right is a pretty powerful aspect of a film. One of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan is Almost Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Visit is M. Night Shamalamadingdong's latest piece. It is a found footage film about two kids going to meet their grandparents for the first time. It explains the Found Footage by making the girl an aspiring film maker putting together a documentary on the trip. While there the grandparents start acting creepy, and things get scarier and scarier. So, cool, everyone is praising Shyamalalalala on "returning to form," and in certain ways he has. He made something that I think compares best to Signs. It wasn't fantastic. But it had certain cool elements. Lets talk about what didn't work. Shamama's twist is known to be in every film. In this, you can see it coming from a mile away. The film gives too many clues too early on and it is very easy to piece together from there. The "documentary" feel is cool, but no 14 year old girl is going to have 2-3 different angled shots set up while in some of the shots (especially in the third act) is going down. They try to explain this away with having the brother doing some of it, but it still doesn't feel real, it feels too professional. And lets talk about one more thing I hated: this movie had jump scares. And they don't make sense within the film. The jump scares come from the actors doing things that don't make sense and feel staged. They don't feel organic with the rest of the film. With that being said, there are some praises I need to give this film. First, it is definitely Shahamanahamana best film in years. He gave fans what they have wanted for a while: a stripped down, real version of himself, without all the ego. He even went so far as to parody himself within the film. He actually wrote in things about trying to film stupid things for aesthetic, or random music that doesn't fit the film for "artistic reasons," and just random cinematography bull. It was nice for him to realize who he was and be able to make fun of that in a way. Next, I want to praise the child actors. These kids were pretty fantastic most of the time. I wont spoil anything but I will say there is a fantastic scene in this film where raw emotion comes through, and these kids show they have a future in Hollywood. And finally, I want to praise this movie's comedy. This film is not a horror. It is a Horror/comedy and the comedy is great. It works right where it needs to in a good way. Is this Shazamala's best work? No! This is just another one of his shitty films. But it did show potential for him to start to grow again. I would give this film a 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your cookies and milk Grandparents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the dawn of storytelling in cinema; while there have been masses of tales about wonderful loving parents, there has never been a shortage of depictions of creepy parents: such as films like, (1987) 'The Stepfather', (1994) 'Mother's Boys', (1960) 'Psycho', and even Disney's '1950' 'Cinderella'. In contrast; on the most part, grandparents seem to have a special place in the lives of both storytellers and their audience members. The common consistent characteristics of grandparents in cinema are the loving and or uplifting ones such as, (1981) 'On Golden Pond', (1987) 'The Princess Bride', (1985) 'Cocoon', and (2010) 'Little Fockers'. As a matter of a fact the concept of a grandparent is so beloved, that it is the subject of that old iconic Thanksgiving song, 'Over the River and Through the Wood'. This seems to be the ol traditional American portrayal of grandparents both on the small screen and the grand silver screen . . . . . . . . . that is until the recent release of M. Night Shyamalan's new film, 'The Visit' this month. Enter: Two adolescences in their early teens, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and sister, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge); is sent by their single mother, Paula (Kathryn Hahn) onto a train to stay with their grandparents for a week; whom they have never met before. The only thing Tyler and Rebecca know about their grandparents is that they are their mother's parents whom Paula for some unknown reason has not spoken to them in 15 years. In the same joyful spirit of that Thanksgiving song, both kids travel equipped with their video cameras; in hopes of creating a documentary about their trip. Upon departing the train, the two are met by their grandparents, John (Peter McRobbie); whom the kids go on to address as the name 'Pa pa' and their grandmother, Doris (Deanna Dunagan) whom they address with the name of, 'Nana'. What begins as a typical cozy demeanor of grandparents in their house in a rural snowy area on their farm, slowly deescalates into the impression of uncertainty in the minds of the grandchildren. On their first day, Pop pop gently gives them two advisories: it's best to stay out of the basement, and also explains to them on the first night there: "We're old people. We go to bed at 9:30". In the case of Nana, sleep does not appear to be on her agenda: Upon Tyler and Rebecca hearing some noise downstairs a couple of hours past their grandparents' bedtime one night, the two leave their bedroom and spy Nana walking in the darkness naked clawing at the walls as she makes raspy guttural and hissing sounds. When they; out of concern tell Pop pop the next day what they witnessed, grandfather dismisses their concerns by telling them that it is just one of her symptoms of being old and suggest to them that they do not leave their bedroom after 9:30 PM. Pop pop would be considered to be the completely sane of the two grandparents; if it weren't for the periodical times of him suddenly freezing in position outside and staring towards the kids. There is also the fact that Grandpa tends to spend a lot of time in the shed for some unknown reason, which eventually results in Tyler and Rebecca going inside when Grandpa is not there to investigate with their video cameras. As the days go by, both grandparents' characteristics become more strange and eerie as they periodically act out in ways that cause both Tyler and Rebecca to wonder if their Grandparents are mentally stable. The plot takes you on a journey of mystery of twist and turns. I must admit that I almost left the theater at the very beginning of the movie. While I do love movies, I usually don't like mock-documentary style films. As the opening shot revealed a mother being interviewed on a video camera, I came close to leaving. However, I quickly started to notice that this was no ordinary mock-documentary film. While it was obvious that the movie was meant to give you the impression that you were watching a real home video presentation by someone, that illusion began to rapidly fade for me due to the camera angel shots. Most of the 'The Visit' is composed of beautifully crafted shots that could not possibly have been setup by teens in a matter of seconds. I think Shyamalan did a brilliant job in crafting a type of film I would not ordinary like into a type of movie that captured my attention the whole time! The movie reminded me much of one of Alfred Hitchcock's movies. The variety complexity of camera angels such as high and low contributed a lot to bringing an already suspenseful film to even broader magnitudes of greatness. I strongly disagree with the fact that the production company seems to have labeled 'The Visit' a horror/comedy film. While there indeed were some comical moments in the film, it by no stretch of the imagination felt like a comedy to me. The word 'horror' might be misleading to some people thinking they are going to see a slasher movie. The film does indeed qualify to have that word in its genre, but it's the Hitchcock creepy suspense style that transpires in most of the movie. Contrast to traditional horror films, this one strongly deals with characters' development where you get to know them: both good and bad sides of them. As a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, I've liked and disliked movies he's created. However; in my opinion, this is the best movie I think he has directed since, (1999) 'The Sixth Sense'. Like 'The Six Sense'; it is a movie I would love to see again because upon learning what is behind the mystery, you want to watch the film again to spot any clues that you might have missed the first time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets you by the throat and by the funny bone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been agonizing to watch M. Night Shyamalan over the past decade, a director who came bursting out the gate back in '99 with The Sixth Sense, a brilliant piece of cold terror that earned him two Oscar nominations and, for me, stayed the course with his next two pictures Signs and Unbreakable. But then . . . it all went belly up. Shyamalan became a punchline, a dead serious parody of himself who in film after film just couldn't get it right. Like George Lucas, he proved time and again that he's a great visionary, but as a writer he leaves a lot to be desired.I'm not going to call The Visit a comeback ? he'll need a few more good movies to earn that. This is a very good, highly entertaining and economical thriller that proves that he still has the knack to tell a good story. Whether it is a fluke or not remains to be seen, but all I can say is that this time he got it absolutely right.The Visit is a creepy and often very funny movie that blends together every tired horror movie trope in the book (creepy basements, night sounds, the phone out of order, mental patients, creepy old people, ominous warnings, disappearing nosy neighbors) and whips them up into a stew that is fun and entertaining. He even takes the shopworn convention of the found footage movie and makes it palatable. Yes, the whole movie is being filmed by a hand-held camera but there's a reason for it.We're introduced to Becca (Olivia DeJonge), aged 16, and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), aged 13, who come from a troubled home. Their dad walked out on a whim and their mother is suffering a form of emotional PTSD. Due to some family trauma early in life, the mother hasn't seen or talked to her aging parents in years and the kids have never even met them. So, figuring that she needs a vacation, she takes a cruise with her boyfriend and sends the kids away for a week to get acquainted with the grandparents. Tyler's passion is freestyle rap, while Becca has designs on being a documentary filmmaker ? she films he entire trip.From the moment the kids arrive at the train station, something seems a little off. They meet their grandparents Doris and John, referred to as Nana and Pop Pop. They're unusual, but since they're elderly we kind of give them a pass. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) looks like something out of a fairy tale with her long grey hair, her aprons, her baking, and her strange dementia-like symptoms. Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) looks like he might be at home in a pancake commercial. He is a kindly old farmer who asks the kids to obey two rules: 1.) Don't go in the basement and 2.) Don't leave your bedroom after 9:30.Things are bizarre from the start as the kids wonder what Pop Pop is doing out in the barn and what those strange sounds are in the middle of the night? Why does Pop Pop attack a man across the street and why is Nana sitting in rocking chair laughing at nothing in particular? Skype conversations with their mother assure the kids that, well, they're old folks and they have their ailments and their peculiarities.Determined to understand what's going on, Becca and Tyler do some investigating by leaving the camera in the living room at night to capture Nana and Pop Pop's activities. What they uncover tells them next to nothing but what they see will no-doubt leave them scarred for life.The dread intensifies. The grandparents show up out of nowhere and do things that can't be explained. It gets worse and worse from there and Shyamalan is smart to ramp up the tension by breaking up the days with big blood red letters that announce "THURSDAY MORNING." Every time we see that it's a new day, we know that the story is about to go to another level. He shows his best gifts here at being able to establish tone and mood and the creepy feeling that something is happening. He spends long chunks of the movie just letting the film's tone hang in the air, and never seems in a hurry to spring the trap.If the film has a weakness, it comes in the emotional scenes. Becca and Tyler have a tragic backstory and it is dealt with efficiently, but those scene don't seem to fit organically to the horror. The mixture of horror and pathos worked in The Sixth Sense where we felt the tragedy of Cole's mother. Here it feels like an intrusive add-on. I appreciate immensely that the two kids are allowed to have a loving bond and typical sibling rivalry that makes them more than just pawns in a horror story ? they really feel like living breathing human beings. They're the all-too-human link to very inhuman circumstances.It is so easy to see where this movie might have gone wrong. It's a batty, overwrought story that seems to borrow from every horror classic from Halloween to Paranormal Activity to Psycho ? there's a scene where Becca approaches Nana from behind while she is seated in a rocking chair that had me averting my eyes. It's a high-wire act. Either you'll get on board with this insanity or you won't. But you can't deny Shyamalan's desire to entertain. He's in command of his material here, it may be ridiculous but he's got you by the throat and by the funny bone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M Night Shyamalan makes a decent comeback, in a good horror comedy. But more is desired from the once mastero maker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay I am just going to say it on the onset that M Night Shyamalan is back, I mean after four pathetic flop films in a row(After Earth being the worst)finally making a decent flick is a big thing. I mean he is not back to Sixth Sense form, but like they say one film at a time right. The Visit from its trailer seemed a little underwhelming, it seemed like your regular overly hyped horror film, but what The Visit ended up being was a horror comedy,a genre hardly ever explored.M Night Shyamalan pulls off the hard genre by making even the creepiest scenes funny, the climax is a good example of this. But where the film succeeds the most is in character development of all 4 leads,but more about that later.Story wise the film is about two kids a girl in her teens named Beeca, and a boy named Tyler who is around 10 years. They are going to two stay with there grandparents for a week, who they have never meet before. This is because the kids mom had a fight with here parents when she was 19 years old about marrying a older man(the kids dad), who was her substitute teacher at her high school. The kids are dealing with there own problem because of there father leaving them, the boy has become a germ-a-phob, and the girl has lost all confidence.So while at there grandparents house they start to notice that both there nana, and pop pop are not in there best mental health, especially after 930pm the grandma goes crazy. The rest of story is about twist and turns regarding there grandparents, and the real truth about there health.Acting wise both kids Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould are pitch perfect casting, they are just superb. But the 2 grandparents Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie steal the show with there creepy act.Let me first talk about the negatives of the film, The Visit even though having a runtime of only 1hr 34min at times feels really slow especially in the first hour, at times one feels bored, and loses interest. Things just are not moving forward, there is too much character development when it comes too the kids. However in the plus the side, the film has been shot in a very interesting documentary style something M Night Shyamalan has never tried, and it works. But the films biggest positive is the characterization and casting of the grandparents. From the beginning they creep you out and they keep getting better till the end. And the films last 30 min the pre climax, and climax make up for almost all the negatives the film has.You will be scared, and laughing at the same time in the climax, its edge of the seat thrill at its best.Another big positive for me is that most horror films go into the logic less space of ghosts, monsters etc. Most horror films want you to believe something that is not true (hopefully),but M Night doesn't go the regular path, rather he makes a horror film that one could actual believe is true. And thats a big thing. Overall The Visit is a horror comedy,but I laughed more than I was scared, but I did see the audience members get spooked which was a positive. Finally if your a fan of the Horror genre give The Visit a watch, its a good film from, a one time amazing director trying to find his midas touch again.3.25/5* or 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good M. Night Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Visit", starring Olivia DeJonge-Hiding_tv, The Sisterhood of Night; Ed Oxenbould-Alexander and the Terrible,Horrible,No Good,Very Bad Day, Puberty Blues_TV; Deanna Dunagan-Unforgettable_tv, Running Scared; Peter McRobbie-Law &amp; Order_tv, Spider-Man 2 and Kathryn Hahn-Bad Words, Step Brothers.This is a movie written &amp; directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who has done some good movies-The Village, Signs and The Sixth Sense-and a few clunkers-After Earth, The Last Airbender and Lady in the Water. Thankfully, this one aims more towards his good material. Kathryn is a single mother of two teens, Olivia &amp; Ed. Kathryn left home when she was 19 years old-on bad terms with her parents-and her kids have never even seen their grandparents. After finally talking to her parents, Kathryn decides to send the kids to spend a week and get acquainted with Nana &amp; Pop Pop, who live out in the country. Kathryn decides to take a vacation while the kids are gone and puts them on a train to be met by Deanna/Nana &amp; Peter/Pop Pop. Everything is fine at first but then things get a little strange. Deanna &amp; Peter start acting loony and warn the kids not to go down into the basement-'It's moldy down there!'-and tell them that their bedtime is 9:30pm-'It would be best if you don't leave the room after 9:30!' When the kids ask about some of the strange behavior of Peter &amp; Deanna they are told that they are just 'sundowning', which is explained as an old folks disease that affects them when the sun goes down, sort of like sleep walking. The real reason for their behavior is the M. Night twist, and it is best if you don't know about it going in-but if you really want to know, let me know &amp; I will spoil it for you. The only problem I had with the movie was the kids filmed everything, so most of the movie has that 'Blair Witch/Paranormal Activity' hand held camera feel to it. In the movie, Ed is also an aspiring young rapper that loves to rap on any subject given him and as the end credits start, he does a funny rap-there are no scenes at the very end. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, language and nudity and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 34 minutes. I liked it enough to buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually did not know it was a M. Night movie until I went in. Once I did I did not expect much but I was very pleasantly surprised, The movie had me, my friend and the rest of the audience lolling. It had many comedic moments as well as a major plot twist, I give it 4 snaps up out of 5. It was not blood and guts scary, which is good since I do not like those kind of movies, but it was keep you on the edge of your seat suspense and had the just right amount of humor to make you laugh too. I last saw a decent "suspense" movie a few years back in which I could not predict the outcome and had given up any hopes of finding one again, but rest assured this one fit the bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Original, Artistic, Roller coaster Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a guy who loves Director M. Night Shyamalan, Blum's horror work, &amp; Horror-Doc style film-making, this was certainly an original piece of work in all aspects! For once a Docu-Style horror/comedy- thriller that isn't really about possession, or some kind of dark entity...it is literally what it is...a 94 minute feature of wacko's who are so literal you don't even know it's believable! I am very picky with horror-comedy (preferring Wes Craven's Scream quadrilogy as an amazing example of a perfect horror/comedy-thriller). This feature does an amazing job with character development (which some of these types of horrors lack), cinematography/framing for a modern docu-horror piece, amazing acting, an original story-line that isn't completely predictable at a least 50/50 ratio, &amp; the running time of the feature was well used! Didn't feel too long, but not too short either! Of course M. Night's dazzling twist was completely unexpected and brilliant! I appreciate M. Night trying something new with working on a piece with one of the top horror filmmakers/producers of this century right now, and completely hitting this genre out of the ballpark &amp; completely owning up to the docu-style horror industry, not just living up to modern viewer standards, but also getting a descent round of applause from some of the critics. It could've been a little more frightening but hey, for what it was, I was still on the edge of my seat throughout the last 45 minutes of the feature, while still laughing &amp; cringing at times. I give this feature so much credit from someone who is more of a fan of true serious horror, than dark comedy thrillers but this one blew it out of the ballpark. Go get your friends/loved one, go to the theaters with an open mind, sit back, relax your thoughts, and just enjoy the roller coaster ride. You won't regret it! You will be laughing, cringing, jumping at times, asking yourself questions, and the most important of all you will be at the edge of your seat!!! It just gives you this horrible feeling and makes you feel awful with all the emotions this movie spits at you!! 9/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while he was off Hollywood's radar after the cinematic abominations that where The Last Airbender(2010), and After Earth(2013), can't really say much about The Village(2004) and Lady in the Water(2006) cause I did not see those. But I hope The Visit will put him back on Hollywood's A list.A single mother(Kathryn Hahn) who has not spoken to her parents for years, gets a message from them online saying they want to meet there two grandkids. So she sends her children named Becca(Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) on a train to meet them. When Becca and Tyler finally get there to Papa(Peter McRobbie) and Nana(Deanna Dunagan), things seem to going okay for a while, until some weird moments start taking a hold. Are Becca and Tyler just imagining things, or is something not quite right with there grandparents? Shyamalan proves he can direct, even a low budget film, the found footage really works here, gives you a feel like it's really happening. The scenes in the house are effectively creepy, giving a haunted house like feel to it. Olivia DeJonge really gives an effective performance, so does Ed Oxenbould, who has an acting ability to defines his years. Deanna Dungan is quite watchable in her performance, so was Peter McRobbie. I like the way the film is quite funny in spots, but it never overshadows the creepiness. It's M. Night Shyamaan's best film in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very surprising!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got invited to catch a late night flick and didn't have many options to choose from at 12am. My choices were between The Visit and The Perfect Man, so we decided on this film. I went in with the lowest expectations ever, even questioning my decision and considering just calling it a night and getting some much needed sleep instead, but ultimately decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, this film had me laughing out loud, at the edge of my seat and even made me jump one or two times. This is a very clever film with two awesome young actors who just stole the show. Great storyline which keeps you looking for answers and also provides a good message.I think the previews or marketing has failed this film as it does no justice to such a well produced movie. Overall I recommend this to anyone, whether you like horror or comedy or even drama, I suggest you give The Visit a shot just like I did, because you will be pleasantly surprised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night comes back swinging (twist will NOT be revealed here)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor, poor M. Night Shyamalan! In his first feature film he gave movie goers the shock of a lifetime. He managed to throw an enormous twist at a tech savvy, internet early world and people kept it to themselves so everyone else could be shocked and now its pop culture history. But now, every time M. Night makes a film, people have expectations that are astronomical. The guy could never hope to attain the expectations people have. Now for me, as an M. Night fan, he has made some of the best movies I have ever seen even besides The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable, Signs and Lady In The Water were all brilliant as far as I'm concerned. But he has stumbled as well. The Happening is easily one of the worst movies I've ever laid eyes on. I actually feel sick when I think about watching that again. Devil was okay at best and After Earth...well we all know how everyone felt about that. So here comes The Visit. Well in my opinion, this is the M. Night Shyamalan that fans should expect. It is dark and creepy and has you asking so many questions. Its more typical "horror" than you'd expect from him and has its share of "jump" scares that are more effective than usual. I even jumped more than once and it takes a lot to catch me off guard. The acting is nearly brilliant and this very well could have been a 10 for me (like I would say The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and Lady In The Water were for me) if not for the fact that it is done as a "found footage" film. This also proves how much I liked the story and performances in this film because I HATE found footage. It was good once or twice when it first was new but now its completely overdone, ridiculous and story ruining. I still stand by the fact that this would have been better without found footage HOWEVER Shyamalan does it better than most and avoids the usual "always have a camera on" pratfalls and plot holes.The two youngsters in the film are played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould and they are fantastic. They both give A+ performances and I hope this does great things for both of them. As siblings they are near perfect and they both have very distinct personalities and back stories. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie don't get outplayed though because they are both fantastic too. Its such a small cast and all eyes are on the four of them and Dunagan and McRobbie play every aspect of their bizarre characters to perfection. The four of them have such great chemistry as a cast and they bring the film up a few notches for sure. Usually a comedienne Kathryn Hahn does a very good job in a small role as the kids' mom. And that's about it for the cast but that's all that's needed. You will be impressed because the casting for this is fantastic.There is one glaring plot hole to this story and after you've seen the movie and read some reviews you will likely read it and realize that they're right. So you have to suspect belief for this one aspect. It is technically explainable no matter how implausible and it doesn't ruin the movie for me by any means. It might be like The Sixth Sense where the first time is exponentially better than the other times. The film is creepy enough to completely entertain you, the twist is exciting enough to make you not think about plausibility at first and best of all I happen to think that this is at least a start to M. Night Shyamalan's return to the top of his game. It is a genuinely freaky "horror thriller" and that is not easy to find nowadays. Definitely worth checking out although in Canada the film is Rated PG which is ludicrous because be warned it is scary, some nudity, a fair bit of bad language and definitely mature content. Enjoy! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another horror classic from Universal . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . THE VISIT makes THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE look like a friendly game of Twister, by way of comparison. Landmark disturbing films feature things that the audience knows instantly they can never Unsee. Linda Blair's hide-the-crucifix trick in THE EXORCIST or the cake knife girl in the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD are two examples. Diaperstein is a leading candidate for this distinction from THE VISIT. Old folks are the Number One Fear for people born in this century. Geezers' Social Security and Medicare costs will suck up half of everyone else's assets in a few years, and oldsters' adult diapers will fill ALL remaining landfill space in America even sooner. Writer\director M. Night Shyamalan does a great job of unmasking these supposedly benign Golden Agers, exposing them for the disconnected, self-centered, resource-hogging abominations that every child of the 21st Century fears they really are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No One Loves You Like Your Grandparents!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new M. Night Shyamalan movie "The Visit" is unique in that it combines horror with comedy effortlessly! A single mother named Paula Jamison(Kathryn Hahn) with 2 teen kids, 15-year-old Rebecca "Becca"(Olivia DeJonge) and 13-year-old Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) is in a new relationship with a guy named Miguel. Becca and Tyler want their mom to have this relationship work out because the marriage she had with their father ended in divorce. Becca wants to have an extended family that gets along. Paula had a falling out with her parents 15 years earlier when she was 19. She ran off and married her teacher who became Becca and Tyler's father. Becca and Tyler never saw their grandparents either maternal or paternal because of this falling out. Becca is an aspiring filmmaker who talks about nuances and other parts of film while her younger brother is a wannabee raper. Both kids are pretty precocious. Becca is so serious about her craft she tells Tyler not to fool around with his rap music while she films him. Becca has a new project in mind. Her mother's parents have contacted Paula online with the desire to see their grandchildren. Paula is reluctant to let the kids stay with their grandparents while she goes on a cruise with Miguel. Becca and Tyler want to see the grandparents they never met before. The grandparents live on a farm in Pennsylvania and are retired. They spend their free time volunteering at a mental hospital, Meadow Shade.The kids take a train to Pennsylvania and their mother goes on her cruiseafter sending them off. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) show up with a sign that says "Becca &amp; Tyler" and homemade pretzels. Tyler raps for his new grandmother about pineapple upside cake. Becca talks about her new movie she wants to make about the visit with Nana and Pop-Pop. The first day goes by uneventfully. The rest ofthe week is another story entirely! Becca and Tyler discover their grandmother getting up at night to claw the walls while naked or vomiting. Pop-Pop says she has a form of dementia called "sundowning." Basically, Nana goes crazy during the night at 9:30 and he tells the kids not to leave their room at that time. Her craziness doesn't stop in the daytime. A game of hide and seek under the porch with their grandmother turns scary for the kids. She seems to be stalking them under the porch. She follows the kids and walks away from them with her dress riding up and no underwear. Pop-Pop is also acting weird and he is paranoid about strangers and is incontinent and keeping dirty diapers in the shed he doesn't want the kids to go into. The basement is also off-limits to the kids because of the mold. Into all this craziness, a man from Meadow Shade comes to the house and asks about Nana and Pop-Pop. The grandparents are conveniently taking a walk and haven't been volunteering lately. Tyler is also making fun of Nana's nighttime excursions. He is quite funny with the imitations! Tyler also will not quote normal swear words and he says he will use the names of female pop stars instead (i.e., Sarah McClaughlin when he sees the dirty diapers, Katy Perry when Nana gets crazy). Becca and Tyler skype Paula on her trip and tell her all that has been happening with their grandparents. Paula says her parents were crazy when she was young and Nana used to sunbathe naked in the yard. Nana apologizes to Becca for spilling dough on the computer because this blocks the kids from seeing their mother. Nana also goes all-out crazy when Becca asks her why the falling out with Paula happened 15 years earlier. Another visitor fromMeadow Shade comes. She is a young woman named Stacy who has a blueberry pie for Nana and Pop-Pop. Stacy says she is grateful to them for counseling her. At the end of the week, Stacy comes back and confronts Nana and Pop-Pop in the yard. The computer is cleaned off and Paula can see the kids. Tyler holds up the computer to the window and the huge reveal comes up---NANA AND POP-P0P ARE NOT THE REAL GRANDPARENTS! The two people Becca and Tyler are staying with were residents of the Meadow Shade! They escaped, killed the biological grandparents, and took on the identities of their victims. Becca finds the dead bodies of her real grandparents in the basement and pictures of them with the impostors. She and Tyler kill the impostors and escape to the police and their mother. This was the funniest, most suspenseful of all M. Night Shyamalan movies! All the characters, especially the fake grandparents were really great! Deana Dunigan as Nana could turn on a dime from kindly grandmother to crazy old lady and Peter McRobbie was quite excellent as Pop-Pop. One will never look at old people the same way again after these performances! This movie was a fun roller-coaster of surprises and suspense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't say M. Night is Back, but he did make a DECENT FLICK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm, this was a tough one I must say. - This experience was definitely original.M. Night Shyamalan attempts his first found-footage film, where a sister and brother, Becca and Tyler, spend a week at their out-of-touch grandparents' house in a small Pennsylvanian town. After the first night, they discover some strange things happening at night, involving the grandmother. It isn't much later that the Grandpa BEGINS getting out of wack.I think everyone already knows the premise of this story. - The whole film is mixed with horror and comedy, but not like most of those dumb low-budget horror films. This one is different; very eerie. I could not help but laugh at how dark it was. The grandparents seem incoherent at times which adds to the suspense. As time progresses, the two siblings find more and more abnormalities through out their stay.I would RECOMMEND this movie to the simple-minded folks who DO NOT OVERTHINK movies. This is not the type of film that should be praised, nor is it going to put M. Night Shyamalan back on top, but it is a treat to watch. Honestly, I don't think Mr. Shymalan will ever bring himself back up. Especially, after The Last Airbender.One scene in particular that gets you thinking is one of the very first weird occurrences with the grandma. - The two kids are playing hide and seek under the shadowy porch when all the sudden she pops out of nowhere and trying to catch them; whispering sweet nothings to them and crawling like a demon.&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;I RATED this film a 5 out of 10, only because it is not my cup of tea for a mind- teaser. I say, when you make a comedy "dark" then you should take it all the way. Don't half-ass it! Burns those fricken kids! That's just my opinion. There is also the tone of the film which did not really match all the way through. The morals sort of screwed you, or not. Depending on your IQ, I guess.-- Michael Mendez</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and Funny Rolled into One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has many creepy scenes that are mixed with bursts of humor that you'll laugh at even though odd and strange things are happening at grandma and grandpa's house during a visit by their two grandchildren. Over the course of the week, things get more and more unsettling and it becomes pretty apparent that this visit probably wasn't the best idea, but their mom, who had become estranged from her parents many years before, wants the kids to get to know their grandparents, and they certainly discover some interesting facts about grandma and grandpa. The actress who plays grandma does a great job of alternating between a kindly old lady and someone who seems to be becoming completely unhinged. Grandpa seems a little more stable, but that doesn't really last for long. The final act has both terror and (slightly gross) humor blended into it and makes you wonder if you really know the people you are related to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the now ubiquitous faux-documentary horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What looked like yet another (terrible) found footage/faux-documentary turns out to be M. Night Shyamalan's best movie in over 10 years. "The Visit" manages to build dread throughout while also being thematically rich.Becca and Tyler are visiting their estranged grandparents whom they have never met for week, while their mother (who hasn't spoken to her parents in years after an unidentified incident) goes on a cruise with a man she's dating. Becca is a 15-year old wannabe auteur filmmaker who documents the entire week long trip trying to make a film about the reconciliation of her grandparents and her mother, while Tyler is a 13-year old rapper who is skeptical from the get-go about his grandparents. Both children have insecurities brought on from their father leaving their mother five years prior. As the week goes on, their "Nana" and "Pop Pop" begin acting stranger and stranger, from attacking strangers to projectile vomiting, and the kids switch from making a heartwarming documentary to figuring out what's wrong with their insane, and often violent grandparents.The performances are all top notch. Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play Becca and Tyler, respectively, and both are distinct, well performed and well written characters. Often adults don't know how to write for children, but the writing here is smart, and feels natural. There weren't moments of "kiddy" dialogue that induced groaning or eye-rolling. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) also give excellent performances that progress from normalcy to sheer insanity as the film moves on.Thematically there is more to the movie than just scary grandparents. The characters have depth. We learn about their insecurities, and why they have them, and there are actual resolutions and payoffs to the plot points. In comparison, the "Paranormal Activity" films are mostly just boring nonsense waiting for a few jump scares. Here, there is no boring nonsense. There might be occasional nonsense, but it's not boring, and it's mostly for comedic effect. Similar to many of Shyamalan's films of yesteryear, this does have some sort of twist to it, but it's one that feels natural and makes your heart sink into your stomach.This is also M. Night Shyamalan's first film that could be labeled as a comedy. His previous films were often so serious that they bordered on over-self importance. Purposely or not, the pretentious filmmaker attitude of Becca actually seems to mirror the audience perception of how Shyamalan approaches his craft. Assuming it is purposeful, there are several laughs at the expense of the auteur filmmaker, and lots of laughs in general in this picture. But the humor and over the top horror are grounded by a nice level of drama that makes the picture rewarding.Overall, this is a welcome treat for fans of Shyamalan's best films, and people who aren't yet tired of the faux-documentary approach that horror films have been taking recently. Great performances, surprisingly good comedy, and often edge of your seat, this is one of the better, if not the best of this genre which started with "Blair Witch" 16-years ago and sadly has only become more prevalent. Hopefully it's the start of an upturn for the career of M. Night Shyamalan who shows here that he still has the ability to effectively tap into our emotions.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. PG-13 (contains violence, terror, rear nudity and language). 94 mins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What An Amazing Movie By Our Favorite Shymalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's "worst" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the "comic book" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visit is mind-blowing for all the wrong reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At two different screenings, I had two good conversations with a good guy about the strangeness of M. Night Shyamalan's career. His first mainstream films Sixth Sense and Unbreakable really both dealt with mental issues and powers in a powerful way. We also can't forgot the famous Newsweek magazine proclaiming Shyamalan as "The Next Spielberg" which now just looks foolish. With Signs coming in 2002 from him and The Village in 2004, both reached a level of strangeness that I wasn't fully into and this wasn't on the same as level Sixth Sense or Unbreakable surely. Still I support these movies more than most people. It's really his films Lady in the Water in 2006 or The Happening in 2008 where I got off the Shyamalan train. Both suffer from using stars like Bryce Dallas Howard and Mark Wahlberg improperly and I still say The Happening has one of the worst twists ever. It's just hard to believe a guy can create some of the most interesting films around and also some of the biggest disasters. His new film The Visit is mind-blowing for all the wrong reasons.A middle age mother (Kathryn Hahn) has a falling out with her parents with no contact with them and after she has two kids of her own, she decides to send Rebecca (Olivia De Jonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) to finally meet their grandparents for the first time. Once they get there, these are not the grandparents we expected.The point Shyamalan is really trying to make is that going to your grandparents house is not usually an exciting experience. Rebecca is an inspiring filmmaker who brings the nicest cameras to document her experience which just sounds like the dullest film you could put together. The film wants to evoke some humor by Tyler who is really the typical mischievous little brother character and he's also an inspiring rapper. Acting by both of them is surely not an issue but still nothing special nor do they make their characters likable. The writing has humor in it which really makes you question the direction to the film because it's not at all marketed as a horror comedy. Even though it is marketed as a horror film, it does not have enough killers or a lot of horror elements. The movie just seems lost on direction and it's off-putting as to it's tone through every act.The grandparents are the main asset to the plot but they are also the biggest downfall. Again, the acting by Deanna Dungan as Doris Jamison and Peter McRobbie as John Jamison are not an issue but the script is a problem. There is a scene with some really bad nudity and my friend said sitting next to me "That wasn't eye candy." They are basically old people who don't do a lot of anything and for some reason the idea of pooping (yes) is a plot point to them which just falls back to the bad direction. Once you get to the twist which is really uninteresting and pretty basic, many plot holes comes into place. It's never good when you have so many questions after a film like this one.For a story using found footage and using pretty much one setting, location should be somewhat important you would think. It's an old house and the characters only venture out into town rarely. These kids must be so bored in this house! By what the twist is though, so much more could be done with the characters outside of the house. This twist is made to have somewhat of an investigation type plot and could introduce more characters which is another thing it's needs but when you only have a budget of five million, money has to play a factor somehow.Even with The Visit being a screening, the audience I sat with has some strong reactions to how tiresome this movie was. Guys beyond me were bashing the movie right from the beginning. My friend whispered "We are not even an hour into this" and "This really needs to be over." People two rows in front of us picked up the twist very early on and some people left early. Sure, this wasn't a well-behaved audience but they all gave an accurate reaction to this movie. We were all pretty much done with this very early into it.M. Night Shyamalan has now hit a bottom that I thought he had already reached. The Visit has really some nice ideas and has the plot to be scary but the results are not there and the movie is ludicrous. With that small budget, The Visit is surely going to make back it's money but this should be on the list of the worst films of the year. Actually it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is surely the worst for Shyamalan to date. It is just basically the worst at everything.</fullReview>
