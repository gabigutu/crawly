		<shortDescription>The letter is "A"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful film this still is, so long as you're not hamstrung with all the modern pc prejudices. Sadly I feel that one far-off day this film will be banned, when apparent white moral repugnance of the past overwhelms the remaining whites with shame. I've seen "The Letter" now maybe 12 times and it hasn't polluted my mind with imperialist or racial stereotypes, just filled it with pleasure that Wyler at Warners could make such an atmospheric studio-bound gem in 1940.At the start woman shoots man - but was it murder or justified homicide? All of the cast are superb in their roles, Bette never looked sexier, Herbert Marshall never so realistic, and Gale Sondergaard never so sinister - but James Stephenson! He only made a few more films before his premature death but his understated sweaty performance as the lawyer in this electrifies me every time I watch - without him it might have a very different story! Although on a serious level it is (to me) typical Somerset Maugham fare, I haven't read any better from him as yet. Bette has some fine lines and scenes, and only occasionally hamming it up. Steiner's music is repetitive, but memorable anyhow, and the photography gleams well under the Warners arc-moonlight. But as near perfect in every department as it could get, it's still dignified Stephenson's film - he steals every scene he's in, come what or who may. The Hays Office was the real uncivilised savage at the end, not the inscrutable "Orientals", but even with such a contrived messy ending it remains compulsive classic viewing for me, once every couple of years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chalk up another winner for the great Bette Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a career that spanned almost six decades, it would be hard pressed to cite one definitive Davis performance. There are so many, and with the number of Davis fans worldwide, it would be redundant to list them here.However, Davis's performance as adulterer/"devoted" wife "Leslie Crosbie" has to rank as one of her finest. Davis does more in the short span of ninety-five minutes (the film's running time) than an actor of lesser skill could do in an entire career. Her "Leslie" is delicate, yet demanding, appealing yet repulsive, and submissive yet authoritative. The character dominates every inch of the screen and the actress makes full use of those trademark "eyes" of which Kim Carnes sang.The supporting cast is equally as brilliant, with Herbert Marshall outstanding as her loving (but dim-witted) husband, James Stephenson, suave and determined, as Davis's lawyer, Victor Sen Yung (later to achieve fame as "Hop Sing" on TV's "Bonanza"), and Gale Sondergaard, magnificent in the speechless yet captivating role of "Mrs. Hammond."And praise of this film is not complete without mention of its score. Max Steiner contributed one of film's greatest musical accompaniments. So powerful is this work that Laurence Rosenthal adapted themes in his score to the television version, starring the late Lee Remick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among the three Wyler-Davis' collaborations (the others being "little foxes" and "Jezebel" ) "the letter " is their triumph.The repugnance that most of the French critics feel for the great Wyler is one of their major flaws (coming from "les cahiers du cinema " and the stupidity of the nouvelle vague ravings)."The letter" is a splendor.A screenplay so simple and so effective it's a wonder it grabs us till the last pictures.A first sequence to rival the best of Hitchcock.A feverish sticky deadly atmosphere from the mysterious garden where a malefic full moon shines on Davis' inscrutable face to the seedy place in the Chinese quarter where they smoke opium and where Gale Sondergaard spins a web :in this memorable scene when she forces Davis to kneel down,she almost surpasses the star,which will seem an impossible task to some,and yet..Every time Sondergaard appears on the screen ,she's absolutely terrifying.I was saying that the screenplay was simple ,but that kind of simplicity takes genius and I wish today's stories had this implacable logic.As always in Wyler's works of that era,the ball sequence is a recurring theme (see the admirable scenes of "Wuthering Heights" and "Jezebel" )Thus,the finale scenes revolve around a ball,beginning with Davis's entrance and ending with a view of the dancers from the outside ,? la "Wuthering Heights" .Excellent performances by the whole cast,fabulous directing,particularly in these last pictures ,where Davis is walking through the garden ,under a bad moon rising..You must see "the letter".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help comparing "Witness for the Prosecution (1957)" with this one "The Letter," as they represent a good study in contrast. The former I recall has many bouts of loud dialogue, in particular the courtroom scenes of constant shouting which reach fever pitch at times. Whereas in this "Letter" movie the atmosphere is ever so subtle, very subdued dialogue, and far more impressive because of it. I rather liken it to a warrior noisily clashing by day on the battlefield contrasted by another kind of warfare, that of stealth night fighting in shadows and lit only by moonlight. Both these movies deal with the guilt or innocence of the main character.Bette Davis gives one of her great portrayals, and Herbert Marshall as the sympathetic husband is well suited to the role, with that wonderful voice of his too, what more could one ask! I don't really know James Stephenson in many roles but here he makes us feel how difficult the situation was for him to deal with -- truly a razor's edge for each and every one of the characters involved. I've seen this movie many times and it just gets better at each viewing, always most intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Davis' best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty simple movie if you think about the plot and the few actors who star in this movie. However, despite such simplicity, this movie is exceptional throughout--particularly the incredible opening scene. In fact, this might just be one of the all-time best opening scenes as Bette Davis very coldly unloads all six chambers of her handgun into her now ex-lover. The utter coldness and thoroughness of this act is extremely shocking. You know that Bette is guilty of murder, but the movie shows how her ultra-decent husband has deluded himself into believing her innocence. And, along the way, a previously decent lawyer illegally helps her beat the rap. Nearly as exciting is the film's conclusion where justice is meted out to the sociopathic Bette.The film has excellent acting and dialog, but to me the biggest stars are Ms. Davis and her excellent emotional range and the director, William Wyler, who framed and executed this film so well. So many camera shots are simply perfect. It's just an incredibly artistic and beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening sequence where we see Bette emptying her gun on this poor unsuspecting soul, you become riveted watching one of Ms. Davis' all-time flawless performances.In a nutshell, this tells the story of what happens when first we practice to deceive. Bette claims she was attacked by a friend she has seen only casually until she was forced to "defend" herself against his unwanted advances. Initially, it looks like a slam dunk but when the case is taken to trial, more and more, Bette's lies get the best of her.Not a sympathetic character for the most part. There is one chilling scene where she, totally exasperated with having to remember so many lies, makes a confession to her husband. It is a fascinating scene for while you recoil at her seemingly selfish attitude, there is this underlying, reluctant admiration you feel for this woman's brutal honesty.Excellent supporting cast all around, most notably, Herbert Marshall as the poor unsuspecting (it appears many men fall under this category when dealing with the Divine Ms. Davis!)husband whose main goal is to support his wife. Now whether she deserves this loyalty is another ugly story.Excellent mystery with certainly enough twists and turns to keep you totally engrossed in a very good story.*Just watched it again last night (10/8/2006) - I'm tellin' ya guys - after 900 viewings, the movie still rocks!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Bette's peak, or close to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any film role of Bette Davis got permanently identified in the minds of the public with her career it was that of Leslie Crosbie in THE LETTER. For years, if people wanted to do a quickie "imitation" of Davis, they just had to say the line "PETER...GIVE ME THE LETTER!!" In actuality Davis does not say that line anymore than Jimmy Cagney said, "You Dirty Rat!", Eddie Robinson said, "SEE!!...YAH!!!", or Cary Grant said, "Judy, Judy, Judy!!!". It was a capsule urban legend style commentary on a speech pattern (supposedly) and an image of the actor/actress in a typical role. Still the legend would not have begun except for the role and the film. THE LETTER is based on a Somerset Maugham short story, set in Malaysia in the 1930s. Leslie Crosbie is the wife of a hard working plantation overseer Robert Crosbie (Herbert Marshall) who one night shoots one Peter Hammond, a well known member of the local British social set in the colony. She claims she shot him in self-defense because he was going to rape her. The British colonials rally around Leslie, and she engages Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) as her barrister.Initially Joyce seems to feel this will be a simple case, but suddenly he finds that Leslie (on some minor details) is not consistent in her story about the shooting of the caddish Hammond. Then, Joyce's clerk (Victor Sen Yung) quietly drops a bomb of his own - the widow of Hammond, a local Malaysian woman (Gale Sondergaard) has some evidence that the defense may want: a letter written by Leslie to Hammond desperately asking him to come to Leslie's home that fatal night because she needed him. Stephenson taxes Leslie about this, and finds she has lied - she lured Hammond to the bungalow, he refused to desert his Asiatic wife for her, and she shot him in anger. It is a fascinating film to watch because of the rich tapestry of characters involved. Leslie maintaining a near hysterical control over her emotions in the face of the murder she committed and the resulting trial. Joyce trying to do extreme damage control by purchasing the damning letter (and thereby ruining an unaware Robert Crosbie, not to mention threatening his own legal career by suborning evidence while an officer of the court). Mrs. Hammond, as controlled in her non-speaking as Leslie, but her face the face of retribution and hate. Maugham also showed a 20th Century realism in his handling of the relationships of the overlords of the colony with the Asiatics who live there. There is no real love for the colonial overlords, and the performance of Sen Yung is wonderful in it's polite but deadly malice.The film's story is so well known I won't have to mention it's conclusion. The great question regarding the film was the conclusion. The story ended originally with her rejection of Robert's forgiveness because Leslie still loved Peter, the man she killed. Davis wanted William Wyler to end the film with this conclusion. Instead, the Hollywood Code required Leslie make a larger personal payment for her sin of murder. I have never had a problem with the ending Wyler put on, but Davis was right - the other ending would have been just as effective emotionally. But neither of these conclusions would have been good at all, had the rest of this film not been so splendid to begin with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette Davis and William Wyler, a winning combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In `The Letter' William Wyler takes a predictable plot and turns it into a brilliant film with the help of one of the grande dames of film. For hell hath no fury like Bette Davis with a revolver in her hand. The film opens with Leslie Crosby (Bette Davis) emptying her revolver into a man on her front porch, shooting him twice after he hits the ground. She tells the police she was defending herself against his sexual assault. She seems to be headed for an easy acquittal until (surprise) an incriminating letter surfaces that suggests that she summoned the victim to her house with the clear intention of murdering him.Can the evidence be suppressed? Will she be acquitted? Was she really in love with the victim? The answers to these questions are obvious to all but the most na?ve viewer. Yet, despite the transparency of the plot, this film works for two reasons: Bette Davis and William Wyler.Bette Davis is arguably among the best actresses of all time. She was originally signed by Universal Studios, who dropped her because she didn't have the looks to be a movie star. Still, Warner Brothers decided to take a chance on her in 1932, signing her to a seven-year contract that would produce two Oscars. She was nominated for best actress eleven times, winning twice (`Dangerous', 1936 and `Jezebel' 1939). She was nominated five straight years from 1939 to 1943. This performance was in the middle of that run. It is classic Bette Davis, utterly in command of every scene. Her portrayal of Leslie is superb, a duplicitous and cunning woman who could manipulate any man to do her bidding. It took another woman to humble her. This is Davis in her prime and it is awesome to see her at work. She could make a dog food commercial exciting to watch.What Davis was to acting William Wyler was to directing. (The two shared more than a professional relationship, and it was widely rumored at that time that they were romantically involved.) Wyler was nominated for best director twelve times winning three (`Mrs. Miniver', 1942; `The Best Years of Our Lives', 1943; `Ben Hur', 1960). Like Davis, he was also nominated for this film. Wyler's camerawork here is fantastic. In black and white films, lighting is critical, because the director doesn't have the luxury of relying on color to dramatize the images. Aided by veteran cinematographer Tony Gaudio, Wyler's use of lighting and shadows in this film is brilliant. It could serve as a primer for dramatic black and white cinematography. Gaudio was also nominated for an Oscar for this film, one of his six nominations in a forty-year career.This film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture, but it was shut out. Despite a predictable story, I rated it a 9/10 on the strength of the acting, directing and cinematography. It is an excellent opportunity to see Bette Davis during her glory years in one of her many outstanding performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Better than in The Letter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis, late in life, told Boze Hadleigh in one of her numerous interviews with him that she could not be accused of repeating herself. Audiences who have seen at least half of her films can witness just how different her take on each role is, in each one giving powerhouse performances, and even if the movie in itself was less than stellar, she would make sure the viewer remembered her.She wasn't averse to taking on roles in which she was required to be nasty and at times, unsympathetic, and in her most Oscar-lauded period, extending from 1934 to 1945, she immortalized a number of horrible females, none a copy of the other. This was not the first of one of her "bitches" (she had played several in her early years at Warner's) but is one that becomes burned into our minds. As Leslie Crosbie, the elegant housewife being blackmailed from the wife of the man she murdered, Bette is nasty like few actresses have dared to be, and her nastiness comes mostly from how genteel Leslie seems to be -- this is a woman who would not be out of place in Greenwich, Connecticut, throwing quaint dinner parties and playing bridge.The very opening sequence establishes who her character is going to be and thanks to the vision and direction to William Wyler, we also see what kind of woman he wanted Davis to play from the very first scene: a masterpiece of suspense (despite this expression sounding clichéd). On a moonlit night in a Malaysian plantation, a shot rings out and breaks the calm. From the distance a man stumbles out, mortally wounded, and falls to the ground. Leslie, like a lioness, closes in from behind him and holding herself on the railing, staring right at this man, she shoots him five more times. She lingers on, as if studying what she has done, and makes no move to escape the scene. She already has her alibi and will use it to escape punishment.She is well-matched, though, by another key performer in this movie. Gale Sondergaard, the actress whose likeness became the character whom we know as the Evil Queen from SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, excellent in playing lugubrious women, steals the film right out from under Bette Davis' shoes with her short yet intense scenes as Mrs. Hammond, the scorned widow looking for retribution. With no lines in English, looking regal in her Malayan gowns, she is the person driving the plot to bring Davis down. However, I wanted more from her: she is riveting. Her hardened mask of a face, able to convey so much anger at Davis who seems like she will get away with murder, is so intense it seems like it must give way to fury.While being a melodrama, the production values are first-rate and THE LETTER is more a suspense-drama. Leslie's guilt can't be in doubt, but the fact that she may get away, unpunished, is clear, particularly in one scene when she walks right by the place where Mr. Hammond's body lay dead and shows no signs of breaking down. Directed by William Wyler it seems as if he were playing with the viewer, wanting to get a reaction, wanting Leslie to be discovered. He brings out Davis' best in several key scenes and Wyler photographs her beautifully, showing her face masked with the shadows of bars in front of her, those huge eyes just staring ahead, thinking ahead of what we know. While there is one moment when the story somehow drags a bit as when Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) is trying to come up with a way to defend Leslie (despite the timely appearance of a damning letter), he manages to sustain the story's intensity as the noose tightens around Crosbie and threatens to swallow her whole. A performance for the ages, a movie that is perfect in almost every sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable drama that begins with several literal bangs; we're fascinated from that moment until the last frame of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wife (Bette Davis) of a rubber plantation administrator shoots a man to death and claims it was self-defense. Her poise, graciousness and stoicism impress nearly everyone who meets her. Her husband (Herbert Marshall) is certainly without doubt; so is the new district officer (Bruce Lester); while her lawyer's (James Stephenson) doubts may be a natural skepticism. But this is Singapore and the resentful natives will have no compunction about undermining this accused murderess. A letter in her hand turns up and may prove her undoing.This remarkable drama begins with several literal bangs, and we're fascinated from that moment until the last frame of film. Davis, with her precise and intricate manners that match her character's elaborate web of deceit (symbolized by her compulsive crocheting), gives a fiery, mannered, mysterious performance that may equal anything she's done. Marshall and Stephenson are both subtle in their acting and refined in their manners. William Wyler directs an adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's play (Maugham provided the material for Davis's breakthrough role in "Of Human Bondage") and never makes a false move until the censor-imposed ending. Tony Gaudio's photography, with the light often hitting people from a full moon or through the slats of blinds, is splendid. Max Steiner's music, though repetitive, is very effective. A great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon Over Malaya</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler directs Bette Davis in a fine screen adaptation of a Somerset Maugham story. The plot is sheer melodrama and has la Davis in all kinds of hot water, legal and personal, in British Malaya. Wyler's pretentious direction works better here than elsewhere, and this is one of his finest films. The combination of the director's grandiose desire to turn everything into high art meshes nicely with Maugham's journeyman but psychologically complex, basically mediocre tale. Add to this a bravura performance from his star, and the result is a highly watchable and intelligent movie.The tropics are nicely evoked without without drawing too much emphasis to the fact that everything and everyone seems to be wilting in the heat. Wyler and his screenwriters have clearly done their homework, and along with the cast present a believable picture of the closed society that was the essence of British imperial rule. These people are more snobs than not, but they are often decent snobs, good friends to one another in a tight spot, and carry themselves with a kind of quiet dignity that seems to have died with the empire. There are some fine performances aside from Miss Davis', notably from James Stevenson as her lawyer, who yet seems to be her lover, but isn't; and Herbert Marshall, who may as well her lawyer but is in fact her husband. The moon figures prominently in the film, seeming to hover over the action, perhaps even dictating it, and giving the movie perhaps a stronger resonance than its civilized melodrama deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Performance of Bette Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Singapore, Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis), the wife of the administrator of a plantation field of a rubber company, shoots six times in Geoffrey Hammond.and pleads self-defense to her husband Robert Crosbie (Herbert Marshall) and her lawyer and friend of the family Howard Joyce (James Stephenson). The case seems to be easy and simple, but a letter written by Leslie to Geoffrey and in the hand of the Hammond's widow may sentence Leslie to death by hanging. When the widow decides to sell the letter for US$ 10,000.00, Howard faces a dilemma between his friendship and his career."The Letter" is a great film-noir, nominated for seven Oscars, and with awesome performance of Bette Davis in the role of an evil and cold-blooded woman. The story and the characters are very well developed in an increasing tension. The direction of William Wyler is precise as usual, and uses long and low paced shootings along the scenario, giving a perfect view to the viewers. The use of shadows in the black&amp; white cinematography is also amazing. I am not sure about the meaning of the full moon, but maybe it discloses the real feelings of Leslie, covered by the "clouds" most of the time while living with Robert. Anyway, the full moon has an important symbolic meaning in the film. James Stephenson, in the role of a honest lawyer living a dilemma between saving the life of his client and friend, or staining his career, and Herbert Marshall, performing a naive cuckold in love with his unfaithful wife, have also magnificent performances. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "A Carta" ("The Letter")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the allegories here are effective and striking. Bette Davis is at her best, married in a passionless marriage, involved with a Malaysian. I do not think her character was simply "evil". There are many gray areas to the film. This theme goes along with the story, in keeping with a passionate affair, and subsequent murder.Vicor Sen Yong and Gale Sondergaard hold the key to the mystery. "The Letter" must be retrieved. When Davis' husband, James Stephenson finds out about the affair, he is at first hopeful they can still move on, buy a large plantation in Sumatra.The atmosphere is moody and classic. Mystery in the Chinese quarter; Chung Hi has something to sell everyone. At one point Davis picks up a set of elaborately carved ivory knives. Describing her love affair, Davis mentions, ..."even my agony was a kind of joy"... .This film is proof that creativity and artistry can be submitted on film without obvious and blatant performances.I miss the subtlety and passion conveyed in these noir films.Yes this is melodrama, in the best sense of the word. Would we ever see something this mood-inspired and effective today?. I highly doubt it. It is very telling that this type of film would be very hard to create today- and I cannot think of one actress who could ever convey the meaning and mood as Ms. Bette Davis. Perhaps that is modern society's loss. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to recap the oft-repeated plot.Too bad Gale Sondergaard's evil dragonlady doesn't speak English and Davis does. I kept hoping for a verbal face-off between these two queens of acid tongue. There is the one scene, of course, where the dragonlady humiliates Davis's proper lady (well, not too proper) by dropping the incriminating letter on the floor so Leslie (Davis) has to stoop before her. But what does cool cucumber Leslie care now that she's got her get-out-of-jail-free letter.These high-class British pictures always fascinate me with their refined ways and "oh so proper" conduct. It's fun to watch the characters shed their well-bred propriety for the animal instincts that finally bond us all. Too bad the suffocating Production Code wouldn't allow a peek into the hot and heavy affair Leslie was having. Seeing the uptight lady with her hair down would have been a revealing treat.Still, it's that suffocating atmosphere of thwarted desires and broken dreams that lifts this 90-minutes above the ordinary. The lush studio jungle alone is enough to suck the air out of a dozen dirigibles. And what about the cloudy moon that finally registers Leslie's dark fate. For once, the director's (Wyler) slow, deliberate pacing works because of the richly developed characters. I especially like James Stephenson's struggling attorney. He's so restrained on the surface while he watches his self-respect go steadily down the drain. Then there's Sen Yung's oily little functionary, all groveling politeness and calculating brain. What a fine, well-selected cast.I like the movie's ending better than what I take to be the novel's. Poor lying Leslie can't stand herself anymore, so in a moment of rare honesty blurts out her true feelings and accepts her punishment. Note how quickly director Wyler skips over the colonial cop's presence in the final sequence. I expect he was as annoyed by Code requirements as anyone else.Anyhow, this is old Hollywood hitting on all eight and in consummate b&amp;w in ways you just don't see any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Right Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a prime candidate for They-Don't-Make-Them-Like-That-Anymore nostalgists with several key ingredients present and accounted for; it was released in 1940, as close to the heart of the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood as makes no difference; it top-billed Bette Davis at the height of her fame and with not one but Two Oscars under her belt; it featured an exotic location - okay, it was shot on the Sound Stages and Backlot at Warners, but they specialized in creating illusions of exotica, remember Casablanca?; it was helmed by one Willie (Wyler) and adapted from the canon of another (Maugham) and it was a melodrama in the best sense of the word. Wyler sets the mood impeccably letting his camera explore the humid tropical night that could be anywhere South of Pago Pago then nailing it specifically with a shot of a rubber tree dripping its liquid gold into an applicable container. This image is more subtle than you might suppose because it is a visualisation of the first line of Cole Porter's great hymn to obsessive love 'like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops ...' (Night And Day) and it leads us into a story of obsessive love whose strength is that nowhere are we SHOWN this affliction; where most movies would begin as this one does with Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) emptying all six chambers into a guy who was dead after the first shot and THEN treat us to a flashback showing just what led Davis to that ultimate step, here Wyler is content to let us IMAGINE the one-sided passion between Crosbie and Geoffrey Hammond. This is a world that Maugham made his own, where English expats feel naked in the tropics unless attired in full evening dress with a Pink Gin welded on to their hand. Poor Bart Marshall didn't fare too well with Davis; he was her (literal) long-suffering husband in Wyler's The Little Foxes and here he is the poor sap who she's been cuckolding - ironically, in a previous (1929) version of the same story Marshall played the victim, Geoffrey Hammond. On paper the acting honors should be Davis's by divine right but here she's given a run for her money by James Stephenson - who made only three more films, released the following year, before dying prematurely - and Gale Sondergaard who has the cards stacked against her by speaking only Malay and Chinese and is forced to rely on her face and eyes which luckily are the most expressive on display. Trivia buffs will relish the names Robert (Marshall) and Leslie (Davis) Crosbie though to be fair Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope had made only one 'Road' picture with Bing Crosby the previous year yet ironically it was The Road To SINGAPORE, and equally not too many people would have been aware of Bing's younger brother Bob (Robert) Crosby who led his own band. This is Davis at her considerable best and is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable &amp; Very Well-Acted Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a fine cast, an atmospheric setting, and a tight, tension-packed plot, this is a memorable adaptation of the Somerset Maugham story. Both the story and the film are well-constructed, and indeed both are also aptly titled, in that "The Letter" is what drives the characters and most of the action.The opening sequence starts out with a languid look at the rubber plantation, immediately establishing the atmosphere, and then suddenly grabs your attention with the shooting. From then on, most of the suspense is psychological, and the scenario is very well-crafted, wringing everything it can out of the setup.The cast is led by Bette Davis, who gives a vivid performance in the kind of role that she seemed born to play. Herbert Marshall is also excellent as the husband, using little mannerisms and gestures to complement his lines, as he convincingly portrays his earnest, naive character.The supporting cast has many good moments of their own. James Stephenson's performance is essential to making the movie work so well. His portrayal of the anguished lawyer could not have been surpassed, as he flawlessly shows his outward restraint and inner torment. Victor Sen Yung also performs well - his oily character is perhaps somewhat uncomfortable to watch, but he is essential to the plot, and Yung plays him to good effect. Gale Sondergaard has very few lines, but she establishes an imposing presence all the same.The British colonial setting, with its clubby atmosphere, its social inequalities, its opportunities, and its contrasting cultures, is done well, and even the tropical heat is believably rendered. Light and darkness are also used well - in addition to the frequent shots of the moon, the slats on so many of the windows not only make for attractive scenery, but at times they are also used creatively, as they let just a little bit of light shine on characters who themselves might not want too much light to come into their lives.Everything adds up to a memorable melodrama with many strong features, well worth seeing both for the cast and for the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Wrong Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb film that is damaged a bit by a mediocre score (it's Detective Movie Music, and it's all wrong for this movie) and the ending. Davis headlines for Wyler again but Stephenson is the standout as the lawyer at the center of the trouble. Underplaying all the way, he conveys beautifully the mounting hidden strain of an honest man caught between honor and friends. But Davis is also in fine form, and even looks a little sexy. Marshall is as good as he was playing another part (the lover) in the 1929 Jeanne Eagels version, which is also worth seeing. Despite the score and the ending the film is one of the pleasures of the period. The sets and photography are excellent as an atmosphere of Old Malaya is conjured up better than in a hundred color films. The writing carries just the right weight-- it doesn't feel like the adapted play it is. Director and cast all understand what they are doing. Sondergaard is a bit much, but she's not in the movie for long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly moving, gorgeous, ominous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Letter (1940)Another highly refined, gorgeously filmed, over-the-top melodramas with precursors of film noir in that 1940 cusp of Hollywood greatness. Yes, this is a terrific film. The way it is made, under director William Wyler, and the camera-work of Tony Gaudio, is breathtaking. The coming and going of the light, the movement of the camera through long, slow tracking shots, is engrossing, and almost famous in its own right. This is a year before Citizen Kane, and Wyler, in his consummate perfectionism, was surely an influence on Welles.But this is an tour-de-force of acting and drama, too, with Bette Davis in one of her best straight roles (there are so many, I know, including her collaboration with Wyler in The Little Foxes the next year). She plays a woman who has committed a murder in front of many witnesses at a Singapore rubber plantation bungalow. And then the aftermath follows, a dark, dreamy, illicit world from both the native and the expatriate (British) populations, which intersect only warily, and with false smiles. The husband, played by Herbert Marshall, is a model of a man blinded by innocence, by a simple idealism that many viewers will share, and see the fault in. And the lawyer (James Stephenson) is amazing as a kind of prototype to the film noir hero, trying to negotiate a world that has flaws he can't get around, especially ones brought on by a woman, the Davis version of a femme fatale.This isn't really a hard core noir except in the broadest sense. It has a murder at its core, it's dark and ominous, morality is under pressure, and people's loyalties are tested and paid for. For me it defines drama at its best, pure brooding, fast, beautiful beautiful drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good classic Bette Davis yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I was surprised at the audacity with which this movie was presented. The movie starts off right away like a good-sized rollercoaster from the first minute. Davis presents herself in such an unrelenting and unsympathetic way that it was almost scary, she would have gone over dead bodies to be acquited of the cold-blooded murder that she committed.The acting was top-notch. Bette Davis delivers a very good stone-faced performance that is very believable, those eyes just seemed to not feel a thing. Now I know what people mean by "Bette Davis Eyes". But I think the male leads were even better. James Stephenson as the lawyer who has to live with the fact that for the first time in his career he has bend the law to save a client who is guilty was superb. The anguish of his conscience was readable off his face throughout the second part of the movie, after being the cool-headed councillor in the first part. The other exquisite performance was by Herbert Marshall, Davis' husband who is used beyond his knowledge in the scheme to get his wife off the hook. He is slowly but surely destroyed during the course of this movie and Davis doesn't seem to care a bit in the end. He is prepared to give her a second chance and forgive the whole thing, but she doesn't even spare him at this moment in the movie. She got what she deserved in the end.The twists in the storyline were not the brightest in the movie business but still they were executed in such a manner that they presented a nice surprise every time one came around the corner. The "struggle" in the end was very stylish, and the sheer fact that Davis wanted to be with her lover rather that with her husband was a very bold step for her to take.A big honorable mention goes out to the set decoration, these are so lavishly created that they didn't at all seem like studio sets. The Chinese quarter and the plantation sets were exquisite. The lighting of the several sets was very well establishedAlthough sometimes this movie drops into the extreme melodrama that seems to haunt movies of that time, but this is all fine when you look at the big picture.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really impressed by "The Letter" It was filmed in studio but I was so immersed in the film that I forgot all about it. Bette Davis is wonderful with her big eyes and oval face - a sweet black angel.The cast, especially the lawyer played by James Stephenson, is also very good. The wonderful cinematography and editing manage to transport us to Malaysia at the time of the British colonization - a rubber plantation, the residence, the jungle surrounding it, the Chinese quarter etc..The story runs like this. In the first scene we see Leslie (Bette Davis), wife of a rubber plantation administrator, shooting a man dead in front of the plantation workers. She says she hardly knew him and had acted in self-defense because he was drunk and had tried to make advances on her. It seems that the trial will be just a formal procedure and she will be acquitted. And suddenly there appears a letter that sheds an entirely new light on what happened. The shadow of the gallows looms over her. What will be done? Many roads are still open. Money and the will of a woman can do wonders! Will it work? Don't be mistaken. "The Letter" is not keen on denouncing the "evil" woman. It tells simply a story (inside the moral standards of the time), but doesn't try to pass judgement. So Leslie is shown as a woman, a complex human being and not as a "scarlet woman". The film shows her contradictions and shows us that there were not much choices in her life - married, staying inside the residence, learning to knit to overcome her boredom, waiting long days for the return of her husband."The Letter" is visually very rich, and the soundtrack helps to enhance the inner feelings of Leslie and the elements of nature take an important part in stressing her mood and feelings. This film is very absorbing. Near the end it becomes a bit melodramatic. The camera angles hint at what will happen - something lying outside the door, the clouds, the moon, the shadows and the soundtrack reveal us what will be. And what will be will be. There was no other way around at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My baby, she wrote me a letter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence to William Wyler's "The Letter" is arguably the best of his career. A full moon in an exotic location with plantation workers sleeping in hammocks, the camera tracks around the tranquil scene hinting of injustice and oppression. As the camera moves toward the main house, the night is pierced by a gunshot and a man staggers out followed by a woman who continues to fire the weapon. The moving camera zooms in on the act and it sets a vivid picture in the viewer's mind of all the ambiguity that's to follow.Bette Davis may have never been more convincing as a well-bred woman who must account for a lurid act. First to her husband, then the police and finally to her attorney, James Stephensen who matches Davis scene for scene as the respectable veneer is masterfully peeled off by Somerset Maugham's sensational script. Maugham succeeds in teaching us a lesson on the hypocrisy of privilege and oppression of the Colonial Imperialists, managing to entertain us as well with first rate melodrama that still rivets modern audiences.Tony Gaudio's masterful cinematography compliments the proceedings and Wyler never misses a step in the pacing of a screen adaptation of a theatrical work. That this doesn't ever feel stagebound may be it's biggest achievement.As lives are ripped open and relationships and reputations ruined, we never lose sympathy for anyone. And when justice is delivered it comes at the hands of those who are oppressed, and for the time, that's revolutionary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mystery Thriller from Bette Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of Bette Davis's finest films. She gives what absolutely must be one of her greatest performances in her acting career.The film literally starts off with a wounded man stumbling painfully out the front door of a house while Bette Davis shoots him until all the bullets have gone. Afterwards, she spins a tale to her husband and friends that he made a pass at her, and in the heat of the moment, shot him - six times! But then, her story is dishevelled by the existence of a letter, of which the dead man's widow has possession of. From there on, this film builds on suspension, until, in the final few scenes of the film, it's almost unbearable. But then, the inevitable finally happens, whether the audience wants it to or not.This movie really makes for great viewing, so for fans of movies, I and many others would definitely recommend this one.

		<shortDescription>1940 Davis &amp; Wyler Murder Collaborate in Singapore Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Letter," (1940) Bette Davis &amp; director William Wyler are collaborating again (they did the Oscar-winning "Jezebel" together in 1938). This movie earned 7 Oscar nominations: Best Actress in a Leading Role, Bette Davis; Best Actor in a Supporting Role, James Stephenson; Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, Tony Gaudio; Best Director, William Wyler; Best Film Editing, Warren Low; Best Music, Original Score, Max Steiner; Best Picture. The plot is about an adulterous woman who murders her lover, then lies about it. But, there is a letter that could prove a murderous truth.Davis (Leslie Crosbie) is the wife of rubber plantation administrator, Robert Crosbie (Herbert Marshall). Mrs. Crosbie unloads a pistol shooting one of their friends &amp; her adulterous lover, Geoffrey Hammond (David Newell). Summoning everyone she can to his death scene, Mrs. Crosbie claims it was self-defense because Hammond was trying to rape her. Because her poise, graciousness, and stoicism impress nearly everyone at the scene &amp; during the investigation, it seems as if Mrs. Crosbie is going to get away with murder. Her husband is certainly without doubt; so is the district officer; while her lawyer's doubts may be a natural skepticism.However, the murder happens in Singapore, where the resentful natives do not hesitate to expose the unaccused murderess. Her attorney's legal aid cleverly presents him with a bribe for a love letter in Mrs. Crosbie's handwriting that could prove she's anything but innocent.Wyler's feeling for the bonds of people within their culture is remarkable for the period of this film. After all, this film was shot during WWII, when Asians of any kind were being oppressed by Americans. Instead of portraying Asian characters as 'primitive', Wyler reveals an early cinematic feeling for ethnic diversity sensitivity, without taking traditions of Singapore out of context. Plus, Mrs. Crosbie murders a white English man who is married to an elegant Singapore woman. Their inter-ethnicity is down played as if a cross-cultural marriage was not an issue, at that time, in the least.Davis' performances directed by Wyler are always stunning. Wyler has a way of bringing Bette's many character facets out. "The Letter" contains such a complex mix of emotions. Wyler &amp; Davis obviously could bring out the best of emotional artistry in the film cast &amp; crew! That's what made them the greatest film-making collaborators.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb William Wyler-Bette Davis collaboration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, the great Bette Davis performances began in 1939 with "Dark Victory". This film, just a year later, was another of the great Davis performances in this most productive period in her life when she was still getting top notch scripts.What's interesting about this film is that at no point do we wonder if Bette Davis is innocent of murder. We know she's guilty...she admits she's guilty. But she and her husband (Herbert Marshall) seem to feel she deserves to be set free simply because she belongs to the upper crust of Malaya's expatriate community. So, the drama is not in the courtroom (and, yes, there is a courtroom scene). The drama is the disintegration of the marriage once Herbert Marshall realizes the full truth of his wife's unfaithfulness. The interesting question, however, is the ending. She knows if she walks out in the garden in the moonlight that there is great danger to her...that she has no means of self-defense. Yet, she goes out there. Was it suicide? William Wyler, the director, was nominated for the Academy Award for this film...and deservedly so. The acting cast is tremendous. Bette Davis is as good as she ever was in this film...and quite lovely. Herbert Marshall has long been a favorite of mine, and he is excellent here as the husband...although, at points of high emotion in this film he either turned away from the camera or covered his face with his hands; I wondered...does he have difficulty showing emotion, or was that what the director wanted? James Stephenson was superb as the lawyer who betrayed his own profession; this film was his "big break", and he was nominated for the Academy Award (supporting actor) for it; then, just as his late-in-life career was taking off...just 1 year after this film was made...he died of a heart attack. We'll I'll say this about Gale Sondergaard's role as a "Eurasian"...she didn't have to spend much time memorizing lines! But she was good at giving menacing looks. Victor Sen Yung as the lawyer's helper...well...so sleazy a role...I guess we all liked him better at Hop Sing many years later on "Bonanza".This movie has a scene -- the opening scene, in fact -- that you never quite forget: Bette Davis walking down the steps of their bungalow, repeatedly shooting the man with whom she is having an affair. Classic Bette! Highly recommended as one of the best films of Bette Davis' career!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film of the kind that just isn't made any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems incredible to me that The Letter, a melodrama filmed at the height of Hollywood's monochrome era, was made over 70 years ago. Based on a play by one of my favourite English novelists and short story writers of the 20th century - Somerset Maugham - it is a tale of betrayal, blackmail and murder. Set during the heady days of the British Empire amidst the rubber plantations of Malaya, it examines the hypocrisy and unfairness that seemingly permeated the execution of colonial justice. As the film opens, gunshot is heard on the verandah of a bungalow in a rubber plantation. A man, Geoffrey Hammond, is killed by Leslie Crosbie (played by Bette Davis), the wife of the manager of the plantation, Robert Crosbie (Herbert Marshall). Leslie explains her actions by saying that Hammond made sexual advances towards her - thus encouraging the inference that he tried to rape her - and that she shot him in self-defence. Her explanation is accepted, and it seems likely that she will be acquitted in court of any wrongdoing on the grounds of justifiable killing. However, before the trial begins, an incriminating letter emerges that casts a rather different light on things. Events continue from there: it would be unfair to disclose any further details of the plot.The Letter is good, solid entertainment - of a kind that is rarely seen in the cinema these days. The acting is excellent - Davis, Marshall and James Stephenson (who plays Leslie's conscience-stricken lawyer) all give very effective performances. The direction, by William Wyler, is also top notch - as is the score. The one problem with the film is that the minor, non-English characters are portrayed somewhat negatively and simplistically. They are one- dimensional in a way that is perhaps mildly offensive by today's standards (although that is possibly an unfair criticism to level at a film that was made in 1940). The lawyer's clerk (well played by Sen Yung) is depicted as an oleaginous, money-grabbing person; and a go- between (also a person of Chinese origin) is seemingly an opium-smoking, villainous layabout. Nonetheless, The Letter is a very good film. It is ideal viewing for a wet Sunday afternoon - or, for that matter, any other time of the week. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot sweaty summer nights of murder and intrigue in Singapore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have Bette Davis and William Wyler been better. There I said it, got it out of the way quick, so we can move on to more important matters. So we can examine why this movie is captivating enough to suggest for it if nothing else then at least an important position in the map of 1940's American cinema, yet why it doesn't seem to be mentioned with much frequency along with other classics of its time. Not why THE LETTER is a triumph as a perfect melodrama because it's not perfect or flawless, it's not the spotless unblemished masterpiece that one can examine from all angles and admire it from all angles equally, the ending does leave a peculiar aftertaste after all, but why THE LETTER succeeds despite the ending, perhaps even because of it, in a way that transcends melodrama. Because if melodrama exaggerates not the situation but the reaction to it then THE LETTER remains not moderate or understated but at least true to it.As though anxious to get done with the potboilerish aspect of film noir so it can get on with what actually matters, the relationships between human beings flawed but passionate and the compromises they will have to make, the movie opens with the murder that sets the story in motion. The wife of a plantation supervisor in Singapore has just shot down another man outside her bungalow. The story seems predictable at first, not least of all because Bette Davis can hardly pass for an 'innocent gal'. But then again this is not a trial movie we're seeing. We can smell it a mile off she didn't kill the man in self defence as she claims and indeed the movie doesn't take long to settles that score.So what IS it that makes THE LETTER a great movie? I think it's a combination of how narrative and images mesh, story and atmosphere, one complimenting the other, enhancing, funneling portentous intrigue unease and foreshadowing into each other while they remain true to an overarching aesthetic and theme. This is a grim movie and the foreboding atmosphere Wyler builds compounds that. If a monster doesn't leap across the screen in the third act, the movie still feels like a distant kin to the horror films of the same time produced by Val Lewton for RKO. Clouds slowly blocking the moon, liquid rubber seeping off rubber trees, the sweaty faces of the Indonesian workers in their cramped quarters, the mysterious Eurasian mistress, the exotic nights of Singapore full of promise passion and murder.Against this backdrop of mystery and intrigue, Wyler unfolds the relationships between deceitful wife, the lawyer who must defend her even though he knows she's guilty and who will have to violate his professional ethic code to save her not out of pity for her but out of friendly consideration for her husband who mustn't know the truth, and the husband, the loving faithful plantation owner who doesn't even think of questioning his wife's innocence because that would mean questioning her own devotion and love to him and who will discover only too late that he wasted not only the money he gathered through a lifetime's hard work but also the promise which that money would buy him, promise of a quick retirement in Sumatra and peaceful unburdened life with a wife he loves, without his knowledge agreeing to exchange all this, hardships and reward for them, past and future, to buy back the innocence of a wife that betrayed him by cuckolding him with another man. The intricate web of lies white or otherwise, the struggle of flawed human beings who find themselves in the need to compromise what they most want for what they must do; this I believe is THE LETTER's greatest success.Grim and dripping with bitter poignant irony, THE LETTER works so well, even at its melodramatic finale, because it reflects life as we know it, a certain kind of infallible truth that cuts deep because we recognize it in ourselves every time we fall in love against our better judgement, every time we have to lie and compromise our integrity and honesty for the sake of someone close to us, every time we realize we give up what we most need for that which in the end destroys us. That Wyler goes the extra mile to drape such a strong script with beautiful cinematography and great camera-work used with the moderation and restraint of the master storyteller who knows he doesn't need to show off to impress, who's confident that he can impress by giving room to the characters to grow as they must, is a further testament to the greatness of this movie. Rarely have Davis and Wyler been better. The same is true for 40's Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette at her finest as Leslie Crosbie in this Somerset Maugham story. She is drop-dead stylish in an Orry-Kelly gown as she guns down the overseer of the rubber plantation that her husband (Marshall) owns. Her tale of having been subjected to crude advances from the overseer elicits much sympathy, and her acquittal on the charges of murder is eminent. No one has any reason to suspect anything else, except the overseer's wife, a stereotypical Chinese Dragon Lady, played by the begowned and bejeweled Gale Sondergaard. The highly underrated Miss Sondergaard, originally cast as the Wicked Witch in *The Wizard of Oz*, would lose her Hollywood career with the McCarthy witch trials of the 50s, and has little to do in this movie except look inscrutable and flare her nostrils. But Bette has *plenty* to do, working every inch of the set as she finds out that Dragon Lady has a letter written to the overseer from none other than Leslie Crosbie, begging him to come and see her the night of the murder when her husband was out of town. That letter is offered to Mrs. Crosbie's attorney, urbanely played by James Stephenson, who is aghast at its implications, but purchases it on behalf of his client for $10,000. Now guilty of withholding evidence, he does only what is necessary to keep his client from hanging. Crosbie's husband knows little about any of this, and truly believes his wife killed the man in self defense, until the purchase of the letter eventually forces the truth to come out. Mrs. Crosbie was in love with the overseer and had been having an affair for years. She had been unaware until very recently, however, that the overseer had Dragon Lady for a wife, and Dragon Lady wasn't so eager to see the whole mess swept under the rug. When it appears that Mrs. Crosbie will get off as scot-free as OJ Simpson, Dragon Lady has the lovely Mrs. Crosbie murdered, but not before Crosbie destroys her husbands illusions and tells him she doesn't love him, that she still loves the dead man and always will. All's ill that ends ill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full-Blooded Melodrama with Memorable Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler's version of the Somerset Maugham classic is very much of its time, full of colonial stereotypes of the true British gentleman and his spouse, stiff upper lips and scheming orientals headed by Victor Sen Yung as lawyer's clerk Ong Chi Seng.And yet the film remains probably the best of several versions available on different media. Although relentlessly studio-bound, Tony Gaudio's photography is particularly memorable, as the camera relentlessly pursues the protagonists, never letting them out of its sight. The use of symbolic close-ups on the eponymous letter, and the knives that Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) encounters on her visit to the Chinese junk-shop warn us of what will follow. Deep-focus establishing-shots of the opulent interiors of the British colonists' quarters remind us of their lives of privileged affluence, seldom punctuated by uncomfortable realities. This is why the murder of Geoff Hammond (David Newell) causes such a stir, and why lawyer Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) is willing to risk accusations of malpractice in order to guarantee Leslie's innocence.The story is a familiar one, that of Leslie confessing to a murder and then trying to deceive her well-meaning husband (Herbert Marshall) while preserving her reputation. We know what will happen in the end (the Production Code would not have permitted anything else), but director Wyler ensures that there are plenty of things to remember on the way. The action proceeds through a series of shot/ reverse shot sequences interspersed with lengthy takes, giving the film a faintly stagy look. Yet this doesn't matter, as it allows us to concentrate on Davis's unbelievable range of facial expressions, as well as her unique eye-work as she tries to maintain a respectable facade while knowing in her heart the futility of her task. Elegantly costumed (by Orry- Kelly), with scarcely a hair out of place in her coiffed look, she is the very epitome of the colonist's spouse.The supporting cast are equally good, but in different ways. Marshall carries off the role of the husband like a cut-price Ronald Colman, seldom losing his sang-froid until the moment when he discovers the truth about his wife. Stephenson is especially good as the lawyer, walking ramrod-straight through each frame with an air of authority, but guiltily acknowledging his secret in the courtroom scene (even though judge and jury do not notice it). In the non-speaking role of the deceased's wife, Gale Sondergaard - who would later distinguish herself as the baddie in several Universal horror films - smolders with suppressed rage as she tries to stare Leslie into confessing her sins.The film is only ninety-one minutes long, but the action unfolds with such intensity that viewers are rendered exhausted at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The letter is extremely complex crime - drama based on adultery and murder with impunity by the end of the film significantly different from the usual. Director Wyler through a great opening scene, which is accompanied by an extraordinary musical background emphasizes mystery. When the murder on the night of the full moon commits a married woman, it is more than enough for the mystery. I must admit that I like the beginning of the film. The atmosphere was excellent throughout the film. I am convinced that not a single moment the director had no intention of calm experience. At the end of the film begins and ends with the murder. Correctly or not. It is a matter of taste. Exciting certainly is.In the end, the director must thank the actors in a very good performance. Already tense atmosphere they are made tighter.Bette Davis as Leslie Crosbie, It was flawless. I knew that Bette will be at the height of the task. See her in the role of women villain who kills her lover and again throughout the film show with the most brightness in relation to the long protagonist is a very interesting experience. She is a cold-blooded killer who fought with their own confused feelings.James Stephenson as Howard Joyce, since his implementation depended importance of stories. The character who is "crucified" between the profession, friendship, rights and justice. I'm truly sorry that his character at the end of the film is lost and remains undefined.Herbert Marshall as Robert Crosbie and Gale Sondergaard as Mrs. Hammond are good in the roles of caring and injured husband and the dangerous and angry widow.The story is slow and a bit morbid, but it is full of suspense and excitement. Wyler has combined essential elements. The end is infused with irony. I sincerely wonder if the main protagonist had to pay the same price?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We see a charming community of buyers, sellers, on-lookers and otherwise pleasant folks conversing idly. The chirps and chatter of the crowd is not a busy kind, but a calm one, like the low roar of a ceiling fan. A record scratch to the communal bliss comes in the form of Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) unloading a revolver into a man until he's down on the ground, and then she shoots a little bit more. After the echoes of the bullets drift away into the ether, she turns, as if being watched, and it blinded by the light of the moon.So begins William Wyler's "The Letter," a noirish yarn of murder, deceit and all things in-between. Naturally, Crosbie pleads innocent to the murder, claiming the man tried to rape her. However, the titular piece of paper is found, and then all bets are off. It's a simple enough premise, but where this movie shines is its mood and performances. There is one fantastic scene in particular, when Crosbie's lawyer (Howard Joyce) breaks the news to Crosbie's husband (Herbert Marshall) that a letter's been found that might be detrimental to her case. The way her husband hesitantly defends her--and doesn't even inquire as to the contents of said letter--and the way in which the laywer avoids eye contact, due to a combination of embarrassment and doubt, is a testament to the talent of both actors.One would be remiss to ignore Bette Davis, whose giant, made-for- the-movies eyes each seem to be telling a different story at all times. There's a lot of moving parts to her literary character--the torn allegiances, the all-seeing eye of the moon, the knitting, which grows more fervent as the film goes on--that a lesser actor might have folded and simply milked the melodrama inherent to the character.A problem with a lot of these plot-heavy films, reliant on reveals and gasp inducements, is that a lot of the flair is lost, due to the duty to hit certain plot points at certain times, and repeat them over and over again so the audience doesn't feel stupid. However, "The Letter" succeeds mostly at avoiding such things, and feels more like a star vehicle for everyone involved--like a star bus. While Wyler is more famous today for "Ben-Hur" the most epically epic of all film epics, his ability to hone in on a small, more personal story, and condense it to a point of pure potency, should not be forgotten. Also, the ending of the movie is a result of the Hays Code, but I think it still works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Melodrama That Still Packs A Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its considerable age, this classic melodrama packs a punch that's every bit as strong as when it was first released. Its plot which features murder, adultery and blackmail is thoroughly engrossing right from its impressive opening scene and powerfully portrays the hypocrisy and double standards that were so prevalent within British colonial society in the early years of the 20th century. This movie, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards, boasts a screenplay that was adapted from W Somerset Maugham's 1927 play of the same name and is notable for its quality and the number of quotable lines that it contains.One quiet evening, on a Malayan rubber plantation, a gunshot is heard from inside the owner's bungalow before a wounded man appears on the veranda followed by a woman who keeps shooting at him continuously until her revolver runs out of bullets. Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) arranges for her husband to be called, and soon after, Robert (Herbert Marshall) and their mutual friend and lawyer Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) arrive on the scene accompanied by the district police officer who's British.Leslie explains that their long-time acquaintance, Geoff Hammond (David Newell) had arrived at the bungalow unexpectedly and in a drunken state had attempted to rape her. In order to defend herself, she felt she took the only option that was open to her. The three men listen sympathetically and seem convinced by her story but in the circumstances, she still has to be arrested and kept in a Singapore jail until the trial, even if the outcome is expected to be a foregone conclusion. Only Howard Joyce has any doubts about Leslie's account of what happened. His suspicions arise from the fact that she kept shooting at the victim after he was clearly incapacitated and also because her story was so detailed and remained word-perfect every time it was repeated.Howard is convinced that his client will be acquitted until his assistant Ong Chi Seng (Victor Sen Yung) gives him a copy of a letter that Mrs Crosbie wrote to Hammond on the day of the shooting. When he shows the document to Leslie, she admits that it's authentic and makes it clear that she and Hammond had been involved in a long-term affair which he'd wanted to end after marrying the Eurasian woman (Gale Sondergaard) who is now in possession of the original letter and has demanded $10,000 for its return.Howard is very uncomfortable about being involved in an arrangement to recover the letter because doing so would be both morally wrong and illegal but he's persuaded to do so by the manipulative Leslie. The repercussions that then follow after the trial, go well beyond the expectations of everyone involved.The opening sequence of this movie which precedes the dramatic shooting incident is a wonderful example of William Wyler's virtuosity. The movement of the camera beautifully reflects the calm mood of the rubber plantation on a moonlit evening whilst it also very effectively sets the scene for the action that follows.Bette Davis is magnificent in her role as she displays the veneer of refinement, sophistication and superiority that masks the powerful passions that rage within her and Herbert Marshall and James Stephenson are both exceptional. The colonists' innate belief in their own superiority is exemplified when Howard says "Juries can sometimes be very stupid and it's just as well not to worry them with more evidence than they can conveniently deal with" and in a remark that relates to the difference between Leslie's outward appearance and her real nature, he says of Robert, "Strange that a man can live with a woman for ten years and not know the first thing about her".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Through no fault of yours, I wrecked your life!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a life of privilege, should the rich have to face consequences like the rest of us? Here director William Wyler plays out that question through the story of pampered plantation wife Leslie (Bette Davis), who fatally shoots a man in the back and then claims attempted rape.In a classic case of karma, Leslie had written the victim a letter, desperately begging him to visit. The missive, which suggests that Leslie loved this man, has mysteriously found its way into the hands of the dead man's wife, who seems open to putting a price on it.Ms. Davis turns in a powerful performance as a highly polished phony, the type of woman who would think nothing of betraying the husband who has given her every luxury she could desire.This supremely paternal man is played with poignancy by Herbert Marshall."Why do you make her go through the ordeal of a prison?" he asks.Lying is a way of life for Leslie, who also tries to pull the wool over the eyes of the lawyer who is trying to save her neck, portrayed by a very handsome and dapper James Stephenson.The barrister is perhaps the most interesting yet least well-drawn main character in this drama.Howard is a supremely rational observer, at one point telling Leslie, "It seemed to me some of the shots must have been fired after he was lying on the ground." He has always considered himself an upstanding and honest representative of his profession. Yet he's willing to risk his license to protect the loathsome Leslie and shield her na?ve spouse.Ms. Davis is excellent in this film but seems at times to be overacting a little. One can really understand why they made a song called "Bette Davis Eyes" in the Seventies because her incredible orbs veritably underscore suspenseful scenes. It seems overdone at times, as if the audience needs extra help in getting the point.Still, Wyler expertly conjures an exotic, tropical environment under a dazzling full moon -- a place in which the "native" people serve the whites but maintain a fierce brotherhood in which an eye-for-an-eye mentality counts more than the verdict of a bewigged court.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singapore revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with Bette Davis (Leslie) shooting David Newell (Mr Hammond) on the porch of her luxury house in Singapore. Not just one bullet but six. He's quite deliberately shot dead. She summons her husband Herbert Marshall (Robert) who is working on a rubber plantation elsewhere and he arrives with lawyer friend James Stephenson (Howard). We then get an amusing scene where Davis recounts the incident pointing an accusing finger towards Newell and his sexual advances. Well, it's clear cut, they all agree, he obviously deserved it. What!! Anyway, that's what they think. He deserved it! Davis is told that she will be arrested and charged with murder but things should be OK. After all, he deserved it. But, they hadn't counted on Newell's widow Gale Sondergaard. She is seriously pis*ed off and very scary. A letter emerges that could change the course of the trial?.I found the film thoroughly entertaining. I had just wasted my time watching 3 films ? Grapes of Wrath (1940), The Little Foxes (1941) and Citizen Kane (1941). My fortune turned with this offering. At last, some actual entertainment. The cast are excellent with stand-out performances from Davis and Stephenson. Despite this, it is Gale Sondergaard who gets my favourite vote. She is very sinister, menacing and she out-evils Davis. One scary woman! The film has a claustrophobic feel to it, especially in scenes that take place outside the house. It's dark and you can feel the intensity of the native inhabitants who inhabit another side of Singapore life.It's a shame that the Production Code ever existed. We have a policeman turn up, completely out of place, right at the end to ensure justice is administered. But, you just know that this is not part of the story. Just ignore that bit and the film has a memorable ending. Definitely one to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis classic where she plays the wife of a rubber plantation owner who shoots a man to death and pleads self-defense. At first everyone believes her story but a letter Bette wrote to the dead man casts doubt on her version of things. Exceptional film noir offers one of Bette Davis' best roles and best films. Some would argue it IS her best. It's certainly one of my favorites. Terrific supporting cast that includes Gale Sondergaard, Herbert Marshall, Frieda Inescort, James Stephenson, and Cecil Kellaway. Great score from Max Steiner. Beautifully directed by one of the all-time greats, William Wyler. One of the best movies Warner Bros. put out in the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sinister Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the Early Examples of Film-Noir, a Style that was Emerging at the Beginning of the 1940's that was Stifled by the War and would be Re-Born Fully and Without Impedance After Victory. The Movie is a Dark and Shadowy, Gloomy and Depressing Story of a Murderess that is Hiding Behind a Self-Defense Plea and in this Atmosphere of Black and White Crevasses and Horizontal Lines there are a lot of Places to Hide.The Movie has a Mono-Tone of Despair with some Highlights of Deception that are Immediately Foreshadowed by some Oriental Blackmail and Shady Dealings. The Picture was Huge at the Academy and the Box Office and to this Day Bette Davis Fans Slobber All Over it, but it is the Ambiance of Affectation that is the True Winner Here with an Unforgettable Dragon Lady (Gale Sondergaard). It is so Downright Cloaked in Mysterious Images and Sinister Side-Bars that the Film Itself is what makes this Work so Well. The Filming that is, in Stark Lines and Dark Characters. Sombre is the Word, and this is one of those Movies where the Whole is Made into Something Special.Studio Boundaries and Production Code Ethics Hamper this a bit, but Hardly Enough to Detract from the Drama and the Enjoyment. Maybe a Tad Overrated and not All That, but it is Melodrama of the First Order and Peak Hollywood, and for the Curious about Bette Davis at Her Fully Formed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may get away with murder, but it will come back to haunt you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moon is being covered by dark clouds on a quiet night as gunshots ring out. All of a sudden, Bette Davis appears, continuing to shoot, killing a man dead and claiming he tried to make love to her against her will. You know she's lying, because, she's, well...Bette Davis! This Somerset Maugham classic is a masterpiece, and in the hands of Davis's favorite director, William Wyler, it comes off as a moody melodrama filled with mystery and many fantastic performances. Herbert Marshall, who later played her emotionally neglected husband in "The Little Foxes", is cuckolded here as a man who trusts his wife implicitly, foolishly believing every word she tells him. Family friend James Stephenson slowly learns the truth, and as her lawyer, is shocked in horror as he must defend her knowing the truth thanks to a letter that surfaces which could indite her.Then, there's Gale Sondergaard, playing a cobra like Eurasian woman, the dead man's widow, deadly in her grief and vengeful as she sets up the exchange of the letter in exchange for cash, yet her intentions aren't to fee Davis but move forward with her own revenge. Sondergaard quietly speaks only two lines in her brief moments on film, yet every slow-moving camera close-up she gets reveals more than a dozen lines could explain. While Davis is certainly wonderful, it is Sondergaard's presence that you will visually remember, particularly as she makes one entrance out of a beaded curtain, and then one spookily towards the end.Davis gives a truly multi-faceted performance, certainly evil in some respects, desperate to atone in others. She seems to be aware of accepting her fate, perhaps hoping her attempt to atone will somehow save her soul. Marshall doesn't play the husband as a dumb patsy: It is obvious that his life for his wife is genuine, and that he longs to believe everything she says. Stephenson as the attorney is quite excellent, deservedly nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, revealing quietly his disgust towards Davis as well as his professional obligations.As for the mysterious Oriental atmosphere, there are some definite stereotypical performances of certain Asian characters, especially when Davis and Stephenson visit the Chinese Quarter. Willie Fung, in particularly, plays a revolting Chinese man, his sinister laughter revealing a hatred towards the Caucasian characters whom he considers scum for their dealings with the dragon lady Sondergaard. While this movie seems really ripe for parody (especially on "The Carol Burnett Show"), the only example I can think of where this may have been spoofed was with Sondergaard's character being imitated comically by Beatrice Lillie as Mrs. Meers in "Thoroughly Modern Millie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette At Her BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wuthering Heights" director William Wyler tangled with the Hays Office when he made the adulterous melodrama "The Letter" with Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall, and James Stephenson. Scenarist Howard Koch's adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel concerns the gradual unraveling of the mystery surrounding an alleged shooting in Singapore. Although this atmospheric epic was lensed entirely in black &amp; white on a Warner Brothers' studio sound stage in Burbank, cinematographer Tony Gaudio makes everything appear so authentic that it doesn't matter that the film wasn't produced overseas. Essentially, Bette Davis is the whole show as a woman defending herself against cold-blooded homicide. Initially, we believe she is both pure and incorruptible. Of course, she turns out to be nothing of the sort. Miraculously, Wyler never lets this loquacious melodrama bog down in blather. He makes every minute count and Koch's screenplay yields one surprise after another right up until the haunting finale. Each of the characters has been sharply drawn, from the devious Davis, to the na?ve Marshall, and finally the sagacious Stephenson. Meantime, in a supporting role, Gale Sondergaard makes quite an impression as Hammond's wife with her Eurasian appearance. Victor Sen Yung, best remembered as the Chinese cook in the NBC-TV western "Bonanza" is unctuous. Ultimately, "The Letter" exemplifies the theme of women versus women first, women versus men second, and women versus society third.The movie opens at Rubber Company Plantation Number One as everybody has settled down for the evening. Suddenly, gunfire erupts, and a wounded man staggers from the main house. He crumples on the steps, but this doesn't stop the woman from emptying her revolver into his body until she has discharged all six shots. Talk about a movie with a bang-up opening! Naturally, Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis of "Jezebel") claims the deceased, Geoffrey Hammond (David Newell of "Tanks a Million"), made unwanted advances. She summons her husband, Robert Crosbie (Herbert Marshall of "Trouble in Paradise"), from Rubber Plantation Number 4. "He tried to make love to me," Leslie explains to her husband, "and I shot him." Robert contacts his close friend, a lawyer named Howard Joyce (James Stephenson of "Essex and Elizabeth"), and they listen to her explanation. Of course, everybody believes Leslie until Joyce learns about a letter from his smarmy native assistant, Ong Chi Seng (Victor Sen Yung), who knows exactly what kind of time bomb the letter represents. As it turns out, the man who Leslie riddled with lead had a letter from the planter's wife. Furthermore, it appears that the dead man had been carrying on with another dame, a native woman, who has the letter. Later, we learn that the Eurasian woman was in fact Hammond's wife. Joyce's opinion of Leslie plunges after he makes this alarming discovery. Now, he suspects the worst and lets Leslie know about his suspicions. Leslie realizes at this point that she has just been skewered by the truth. Later, a reluctant Joyce decides that they must get the letter. "I don't think it's right, but I think it's expedient." The sad facts that the letter represents hasn't dawned on Robert. Joyce adds, "Juries can sometimes be very stupid. It's just as well not to worry them with more evidence than they can conveniently deal with." Eventually, Joyce explains to Robert that the letter is available for an imposing price: $10-thousand. Shrewdly enough, the blackmailer with the incriminating letter knows that Robert Crosbie has the amount of $10, 452, in his account at the British Malaya Company. Ong Chi Seng gives Joyce two conditions about how the letter must be obtained. You cannot help but feel that the bespectacled Ong has more to do with this transaction than he lets on; indeed, he tells Joyce that he will receive two thousand dollars for arranging this transaction.Although the jury exonerates Leslie of the shooting, our heroine is not off the hook. Poor Robert believes that now would be the perfect time to buy another rubber plantation in Sumatra. He doesn't know yet that virtually his entire life savings are sunk in the incriminating letter. Eventually, he insists that he be allowed to peruse it, and the whole bloody mess comes to light with Leslie confessing that she had an affair with Hammond. She couldn't control her emotions and she was doubly upset because Hammond had taken up with a native woman. Just when Leslie believes that she has got it made, the Asian woman kills her at the end. "The Letter" is suspenseful, and Wyler provides us with a glimpse of the destitution that this highly strung woman endured. She thought she was above the law and couldn't be touched. Not surprisingly, Bette Davis gives a stunning performance, and James Stephenson is superb as her solicitor who has no qualms about doing whatever is necessary to get his client off. Unfortunately, Leslie's husband Robert is crushed by it all. "The Letter" is an unforgettable drama, certainly not the kind of movie that you want to watch for mindless fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Davis another Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quell my intermittent Bette Davis mania, this time comes THE LETTER, a William Wyler helmed Film-Noir, garnered 7 Oscar nominations including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR, ACTRESS and SUPPORTING ACTOR, a rare fete for the usually overlooked genre in the voters' perspective. Davis is Leslie, a lone wife in Singapore with her rubber plantation administrator husband Robert (Marshall), mercilessly shoots a man to death whom she claims to be a sex offender, and under the aegis of her loyal friend-cum-lawyer Howard (Stephenson), she seems to be able to get away from the murder, but a letter proves it is only her side of the story and the price to buy the letter will cost all the fortune they have.Leslie is a quintessential femme fatale, a haughty but lonely woman in a hostile oriental surrounding, erodes with daily blandness (lacing is her ostensible escape), Davis is a marvelous presence in eliciting sympathy for her unsympathetic character through her bulging eyes, they allure viewers to speculate the unspoken stuff, particularly when she resort to Howard for help, and her secret starts to divulge, with hindsight the plot is quite discernible, but it is Davis' pure force of personality makes the whole case a beguiling enigma, even until the ultimate confession, one might find it hard to believe the truth is as plain as it is. Thanks to the ludicrous Production Code, her demise is sine qua non, but the coda is nevertheless a spine-chilling one with the effects of the ominous full moon shades. Stephenson is the antithesis of Davis' jealousy-ridden, murder-possessed viciousness, oscillating between a decent lawyer and close friend, his suave and dispassionate complexion also undergoes a fatal makeshift, his two-hander with a cunning Victor Sen Yung is textbook accurate in exposing racial prejudices at its time (even being an Asian myself, I was purposefully motivated to loathe Victor's sugarcoating extortion, nonetheless, it is a well-acted piece of work for an Asian performer to occupy quite a long screen-time). Sondergaard, as the other woman in a winning stance, conscientiously clad in her clunky Malay outfit and felt absurd in her Euroasian lineage (it is an inevitable side effect to pass off a Caucasian as an Oriental), but she impressively steals the limelight whenever her menacing visage is theatrically highlighted, while she is more than an acquisitive money-seeker, her venom is tangible and her dagger is sharpened and will taste some blood. Although the finale is expedient and falls into banality to be morally corrected (she just cannot fool herself to restart her life with a man truly loves her in spite of all her wrongdoings), Wyler's cannon is always a golden mine for cinephile to devour and cherish, THE LETTER is a less achiever than THE HEIRESS (1949, 9/10) due to its foibles in my humble opinion, but Davis should have brought home another Oscar as Olivia de Havilland did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"With All My Heart, I Still Love the Man I Killed!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1940, after only a decade in Hollywood, thirty-two-year-old Bette Davis was at the top of her game; she had already played a slutty English waitress, a drunken actress, a spoiled and manipulative southern belle, Queen Elizabeth I, Empress Carlotta von Hapsburg, and an old maid aunt, the last a role which required her to age forty years over the course of the film. She picked up two Oscars for Best Actress on the way. And her finest work was still ahead of her; witness this stunning piece of cinema from 1940, Davis's second collaboration with director William Wyler and a film as hard and sparkling as a diamond and as dark and gloomy as an abandoned mansion.Davis and Wyler were a great team. He directed three of her best films: JEZEBEL, which won her her second Oscar, this one, and THE LITTLE FOXES the following year. Of the three, this one is my personal favorite; seventy-two years after its release, it remains in most ways astonishingly fresh, having escaped a good many of the ravages of time that often plague classic movies.The story, based on a play by the great W Somerset Maugham, is a bit of a shocker for 1940. The film opens with a cold-blooded murder: the camera pans slowly across the driveway and servants' quarters of a Malayan plantation, gradually working its way to the front steps, where a shot is heard. A man comes staggering out the front door, followed by a woman with a gun who continues to shoot the man even after he is down, until the gun is empty and her emotion spent. At this point we do not know what this emotion is, but the lady, by name Leslie Crosbie (Davis), is clearly suppressing something.With astonishing aplomb, she faces the crowd of plantation workers who were awakened by the noise and dispatches one of them to fetch her husband Robert (the great Herbert Marshall, one of Davis's favorite co-stars) at once. When Robert hears what has happened, he brings along family friend and attorney Howard Joyce (James Stephenson), and Leslie proceeds to tell her version of what happened. Couched in Production Code language, she basically accuses the murdered man of trying to rape her and insists that she was only defending herself.This is where things get hairy. One of Joyce's assistants, Ong Chi Seng (Victor Sen Yung), approaches him in private and hints that there is a compromising letter that would do his client considerable damage were it to come to light. The letter, as it happens, is in the possession of the murdered man's Eurasian widow (the brilliant Gale Sondergaard in an astonishing performance in which she does not speak a word in English), and contains an urgent summons to the late Hammond to come and see Mrs Crosbie "at once; I am desperate." I must state here that this is the film's one flaw: set in colonial Malaya, the line of demarcation between the British characters and the "natives" is as clear as a line of chalk drawn on the ground: the English are proper, civilized, and respectable to a fault; the Asians, on the other hand, are shifty, sneaky, "inscrutable" in the WORST stereotypical way, and have no compunction about seeking blood for blood. However, distasteful as these stereotypes are, the film does make a somewhat muted statement calling attention to how unfair they are.That being said, there is still much to praise about this excellent film. It is short, barely ninety-five minutes; its script is taut and suspenseful, Wyler's direction is, as always, nearly flawless, and I think this movie makes better use of Bette's enormous eyes than any of her other work; many scenes take place in darkness or semi-darkness, only to have the light suddenly shine on Bette's face, and she invariably looks directly at it, unflinching.Special mention must be made of Gale Sondergaard. A beautiful and talented actress, and winner of the very first Supporting Actress Oscar for ANTHONY ADVERSE, Sondergaard's career was irreparably damaged during the McCarthy era when her husband was investigated by HUAC. A pity, for this enormously talented lady was a real miracle on screen. As I noted before, she never speaks a word in English; the character speaks only Malay and Chinese and we don't always get a translation of the few lines that she does utter. But her face, especially her eyes, speak volumes.Mrs Hammond offers to sell the letter to Leslie for ten thousand dollars, with one condition: Leslie must bring the money to her in person. The payoff scene is marvelous: Mrs Hammond, rather than handing Leslie the letter, drops it at her feet, forcing Leslie to kneel in front of her to retrieve it.There are more twists and turns in this fascinating film before the final credits roll. In many ways the film is as dark and mysterious as the Malaysian Colony was perceived to be by the West during the period. And although it is very much Davis's show, she is surrounded by excellent actors and she is very generous with them; Stephenson in particular is a standout. Sadly he died the following year.Davis, who would mistreat Herbert Marshall again in THE LITTLE FOXES the following year, once observed, "I adored Herbert Marshall; it was dreadfully hard to have to be so cruel to him." As usual for the lady, difficulties were simply made to be overcome.This may well be Davis's coldest and most unsympathetic performance, yet at the same time she never looked as lovely as she does here; the contrast is brilliant.Even if you aren't a Davis fan, this is a great movie that every film buff should see. As Robert Osbourne would say, it is "one of the essentials."</fullReview>

Exotic, doesn't even begin to describe the look and feel of it. Davis, Maugham and Wyler make a pretty potent combination and the perverse undercurrent to the story provides an additional sting.

		<shortDescription>Davis at Her Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letter, The (1940) *** (out of 4) Remake of the 1929 film has Bette Davis at her very best as a woman who murders her lover but claims self defense to try and save her own skin. Her husband (Herbert Marshall) believes her to be innocent as does her attorney (James Stephenson) but soon the dead man's widow (Gale Sondergaard) informs the lawyer and defendant that she has a letter that proves her self defense claim is false. The story itself is quite simple and the screenplay never really allows anything too unfamiliar to happen but that doesn't take away from the charm of the film. Director Wyler does a very good job at keeping everything moving and the performances are terrific as well. What works so well in the film is the Malaya settings, which the director uses to build the atmosphere in the opening minutes. The opening sequence with Davis shooting her lover was so brilliantly done that you can't help but feel that nothing that follows will be able to match it. The way Wyler shows the rubber trees and the moon perfectly builds the atmosphere and puts the viewer in the mood for what's going to follow. Davis is wickedly good here delivering a very sharp performance and one can't help but really hate her character. The way her character is written is somewhat one sided but Davis really digs in and delivers so much more. As much as we hate her, at times Davis makes us understand what she did and why. Marshall is also very good in the film and one can't help but feel bad for him. Stephenson nearly steals the film as the moral guarded lawyer and Sondergaard (THE SPIDER WOMAN) is pitch perfect without having to say a word. I think the one thing that does bring the film down is an explanation as to why Davis has to stand trial. The film pretty much shows the police believe her reasons for shooting the man yet we still have a trial. I think more drama could have been added had we known the prosecutors stance on the matter but we're never given an idea on why they are charging her outside of some custom. With that said, the film is pure Davis magic and that alone is reason enough to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Killer Opening and a Dead Letter Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis wields a gun well, firing shot after shot into a man, in the killer opening of "The Letter". Do not miss the opening minutes of this film. Then, the story unfolds - Bette (as Leslie) is the respected wife of upstanding Singapore plantation owner George Brent (as Robert Crosbie). Ms. Davis claims the dead man was an old acquaintance who entered and attempted rape. Davis' story is not questioned; then, a man goes to lawyer James Stephenson (as Howard Joyce) with a letter from Davis to the dead man, which contradicts Davis' story.Davis' performance is masterful; in the opening she is able to arouse viewer suspicion without ever actually saying anything or indicating guilt, directly. Mr. Brent and Mr. Stephenson are appropriately supporting in Davis presence; they seem to often play opposite a commanding actress in showcase film. Gale Sondergaard is startlingly effective as the wife of Davis' victim. William Wyler and Tony Gaudio directed and photographed artfully. The entire production is superb, with a slight letdown as the story comes to confusing end. ********* The Letter (11/22/40) William Wyler ~ Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall, James Stephenson, Gale Sondergaard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Stephenson's Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the pivotal roles in "The Letter" is that of James Stephenson as Attorney Howard Joyce. Stephenson's performance in this film has rightly been hailed as a cinematic classic.The year was 1940. But "The Letter" was only one of a whopping seven films made that year. The previous year he made a jaw-dropping fifteen, and the following he got out two before dropping dead with a heart attack. I wonder why? Looking at the actor's total profile, he had a full starring career on the British stage before he made his first film (at "old" age 49). So, in just five years (from '37 to '41) Stephenson totaled thirty six films. Talk about an actor working himself to death!Still, his work in "The Letter" goes down for all time as one of the cinema's great supporting performances. The film itself is a superlative melodrama--a success on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top five Bette Davis performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Letter is a great film and one of Bette Davis' top five rolls next to Margo in All About Eve, Jezebel, Baby Jane, and Little Foxes. Bette makes you sympathize with her character while also knowing she must pay for her crimes. Isn't that what we all seem to want Bette to do...pay for her crimes in her roles? Here she is at her most glamourous and most innocent(?). It also was the fourth nomination in a run that came to 7 Oscar nominations and 2 Oscars (Jezebel 1938 and Dangerous 1935) in 10 years. Check it out and return to filmmaking when it was always satisfying and Bette Davis was at the top of her game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed "The Letter". Bette Davis is never dull, but Herbert Marshall's performance is what drew me, understated, yet, powerful. He was a wonderful actor with a combination of talent and class. Also, yes, the film seems racist in it's depiction of oriental people, but it accurately reflected the attitude of Europeans that colonized Asia, Africa, etc. Please, don't let that keep you from enjoying this gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Based on the Somerset Maugham play about murder and deceit as well as ultimate revenge has Bette Davis as Leslie Crosbie stand trial for the murder of Malayan rubber plantation foreman Geoffrey Hammond, David Newell, whom Leslie claimed she shot in self-defense. At the beginning of the movie we get to see Leslie gun down a helpless Geoffery Hammond as he staggers down the steps of her veranda and falls flat on his face stone cold dead.Not denying what she did Leslie tells both her shocked husband Robert, Herbert Marshall, and his attorney friend Howard Joyce, James Stephenson, who came on the crime site that a drunken and overly aggressive Geoffrey tried to have his way with her. It's just when things got a little out of hand that Leslie grabbed the revolver that Robert left for her, to protect herself from thieves and grubby drunken swines like Goeffery, and blasted Hammond away!Leslie's reason for killing Geoffery is so convincing that it's a sure bet that she'll get off on a water tight self-defense defense since Geoffery deserved everything, six bullets in his chest and back, that he got! Agreeing to defend Leslie Joyce feels that all she has to do is tell her story to the jury and she'd be acquitted within five minutes of debate in the jury room. The thing that turns the whole case upside down is Joyce's former assistant Ong Chi Seng, Sen Young, who somehow came into possession of a letter that Leslie wrote the very day that she shot Geoffery! That letter, if in fact Leslie wrote it, can give the jury a whole new outlook on the reasons for Leslie gunning down Geoffery! It can also convince the jury to convict Leslie and have her sent straight to the gallows for first degree murder!***SPOILERS*** Going against his better judgment and risking disbarment or even a prison term Joyce decides to buy the letter off Ong's contact who just happens to be the murdered Geoffery Hammond's Eurasian wife Gale Sondergaard! It's that letter, or the lack of it, that convinced the jury to acquit Leslie of murder! It was also that letter that, in her trying to retrieve it, ended up costing Leslie her very life!Great "Crime and Punishment" movie that shows that you can't get away with murder even if you finagle a jury into finding you innocent of it. Besides Leslie's poor sap of a husband Robert who's entire life savings, $10,000.00, went into buying the incriminating letter in order to get her off it was really attorney Joyce who ended up with the sh*t end of the stick. Joyce more then anyone else in the movie has to live with what he did, successfully defending a person whom he knew was guilty, for the rest of his life! As for the doomed Leslie Crosbie she played it cool, by not showing any emotion at all for what she did, for almost the entire movie until her guilty conscience kicked in and then accepted what ever fate, good bad or indifferent, had ultimately in store for her!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of Bette Davis' best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Malayla a woman, Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis), shots down a man in cold blood. She claims he tried to molest her. Her husband, Robert Crosbie (Herbert Marshall) stands beside her. She has to stand trial for murder but keeps proclaiming her innocence. Then her lawyer (James Stephenson) finds out about an incriminating letter against her that she wrote to the man she killed...Lushly filmed (for Warner Bros.) drama that's just great. The script is intelligent and well-written and it's all beautifully directed by William Wyler (LOVE the moon shots). The acting is just perfect--Davis is superb; Stephenson matches her (they were both nominated for Academy Awards) and Gale Sondergaard throws in a chilling portrayal of the Eurasian widow of the man Davis killed.SPOILER ALERT!!! This was originally a play but they had to change the ending. It was revealed she killed the man in cold blood--she gets off free--but realizes she's married to a man she doesn't love. That's to be her punishment. However the Production Code wouldn't allow that in the movie--she had to pay for her crime. So a new ending was added where Sondergaard kills her. I think it still works but Davis and Wyler complained bitterly about it. END SPOILER!!!!This was nominated for multiple Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and was a big hit. For some reason it's not that well-known today. That's too bad because it's very good. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt in my mind that "The Letter" was Bette Davis' best picture with Warner Brothers, where she made most of her films. She was at her most dynamic in a remake of well told story. Ably supported by Herbert Marshall and James Stephenson, not to mention the brilliance and mystery of Gale Sondergaard. Filmed quite superbly, in which the mood of the Tropics was captured perfectly with both cinematography and background music, Davis strolls through the film and takes every opportunity to show us her great acting skills that certainly stamped her as No. 1 for many years. The final scenes are quite harrowing, and the opening scene, after the credits, is a classic that is so well remembered by everyone who sees this movie. It is a film that can be seen several times without becoming tedious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT FILM WITH A HOLLYWOOD ENDING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewer: walter flakus from Macomb, IL USA I call this a "Hollywood ending" not in the sense that it is a happy ening, but one which seems to be contrived to follow the production code of the day which stated that all wrongdoers must be brought to justice. Bette Davis, in one of her great performances, is killed off by Gale Sondergaard who herself is arrested by the police at the end. I really don't know if this ending is in the novel but it does not ring right with me. After all, Leslie Crosby was cleared of the crime and could have gone on living even with the torture memory of the lover she murdered in cold blood although I doubt if she would have remained faithful to wimpy Herbart Marshall for long. Gail Sondergaard, the dragon lady wife of the knocked off husband, just seems to be unable to get enough revenge. The 10 grand she got for selling the incriminating letter to Bette apparently was not enough to satisfy her. I especially liked the scene where Leslie tells her husband how much she still loves her vengefully slain adulterer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bette Davis Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like this film was especially made for Bette Davis, as this was the type of role that Davis always appeared in if not horror films later on in life. Bette Davis,(Leslie Crosbie),"The Corn Is Green",'45, played a horrible wife that did every thing she could, except love her husband. The poor husband was Herbert Marshall,(Robert Crosbie),"Duel in the Sun",'46 who worshiped Leslie and put up with all her evil ways with adultery and plenty of lies. Robert Crosbie finally asked her one question,"Do You Love Me?" and from then on Gale Sondergaard,(Mrs. Hammond) finally showed her true feelings for Leslie and gave a great supporting role. Gale Sondergaard played very evil roles through out her career in Hollywood and turned down the role of the "Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz". If you want to see a Bette Davis Classic film, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did sort of expect more of an actual film noir, but this still stands out in Bette's filmography. She plays this part down to a pat, and in this one like a few others she shows much vulnerability in certain moments and she's transcendent in them and in others. The film as a whole is gripping from start to finish, and although the ending left me sort of cold it doesn't really lessen the film's impact. It's definitely a very, very good film with some great performance at its core, and it only mixes up the variety of Bette's role choices and it brightens it up with something a little bit different. This is heavily recommended to anyone not just Davis fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Bette Davis Did Herself In ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis garnered another Oscar nomination for this 1940 drama about a letter that would have done her in. She had killed a man and claimed self-defense.Davis again is at her neurotic best; as the conflicted lawyer, James Stephenson was excellent and merited a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.Gale Sondergaard, as the victim's widow, doesn't say much but her actions and grimaces tell you what she is all about.As he did the following year in "The Little Foxes," Herbert Marshall plays a sympathetic husband. Of course, his part in the 1941 film was far superior. Remember his death scene on the staircase?Leave it to Max Steiner to come up with a repetitive but haunting theme. You know that Bette is doomed at the end with that music.Unusual to see the fine treatment that Bette received while imprisoned.The ending is one of an Alfred Hitchcock-type thriller. Hell hath no fury as a woman scorned. Tell that to Sondergaard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sterling melodrama from William Wyler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler's "The Letter", based on a play by Somerset Maugham, tells the story of a rubber plantation manager's wife who shoots a man to death, supposedly in self-defence. However, as additional details come to light (including an incriminating letter) it seems that a charge of murder may be warranted.Bette Davis is the undisputed star of the picture and she revels in the melodramatic lead role. She garnered an Oscar nomination for her performance and so did her co-star James Stephenson, who delivered the film's best performance as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the cast fares pretty well though Herbert Marshall seems out of place at times.Meanwhile, William Wyler's Oscar-nominated direction is laudable, which will come as no surprise to those familiar with his work. He's given strong support here by the cinematography of Tony Gaudio as well as Max Steiner's atmospheric score, both of which were Oscar-nominated.The plot, while unabashedly melodramatic, makes for an entertaining film which climaxes in memorable fashion. Though likely too melodramatic for some, "The Letter" nevertheless contains much to make viewing it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Are you going to let them hang me?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture by picture, I'm becoming more of a Bette Davis fan with each discovery of her work. With "The Letter", she captures your attention right out of the gate with that gun blazing entrance on screen, defiant and in control, unnerved by the certain sensation that her action will create. There's virtually no way you can watch that opening scene and not hang around to see where it all goes.The movie gives free reign to Davis' great range in portraying Leslie Crosbie, wife of a rubber plantation owner who commits a revenge murder on the lover who jilted her to marry a Eurasian local. I have to say, I don't think I've ever seen a more lethal looking woman than Gale Sondergaard as the widow Hammond. She conveys more menace in a simple on screen close-up than with a whole scene of dialog. For once, those Bette Davis eyes had met their match.The portrayal I really keyed in on here though, and it's just a personal quirk of mine because of all those Charlie Chan films I've seen, was that of Victor Sen Yung in the role of Ong Chi Seng. Most of the time you see him in one of those throwaway comedy relief roles, but here he's a cunningly calculating thorn in the side of attorney Howard Joyce (James Stephenson). Affably polite, all the time you wonder if he's a villain or just the messenger. I think it's the best role I've seen him in.Say, here's something I picked up on right away, and it distracted me for a few minutes after watching it. When Ong brings attorney Joyce and Leslie to meet Mrs. Hammond to exchange money for the letter, it's mentioned that the cobra lady speaks only Malay and Chinese. So how did she know what was in the letter? I know, you can rationalize an answer to that, but it just seemed to be a little detail that no one pays attention to.There's also that business with the dagger. Combined with the Hayes Code insistence that someone in the picture had to 'pay' for the murder of Hammond, I thought it would have been a much more resolute ending if Leslie had driven herself emotionally to the brink by it's appearance at the door. That rationale would have made more sense than going back a second time, seeing it gone, and then go looking for trouble. Either way, the incongruity of it all as the camera pans upward to the party still going on inside makes it one of the most surreal endings in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie and everything about it. The actors were magnificent - what can you say about Davis' Oscar nominated role? It was perfect. She was so believable in this role. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and gorgeously lit.What I find most interesting is that the film is based on a play written by W. Somerset Maugham that first appeared on Broadway in 1927. It was adapted for the screen by Howard Koch who had to rewrite several scenes to get it past the Hollywood Production Code ( i.e. Movie censors). In the original play, Davis' character gets away with her crime and is forced to live out the rest of her life overcome by guilt. But the censors back then wouldn't allow a character to get away with BOTH Adultery and Murder (seems hard to believe with what they allow on screen nowadays). So Koch rewrote the ending so that Davis' character does pay for her crime in an ironic twist of events. My how the times have changed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine wine that has aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene down on the old rubber plantation to the final triumph of the inscrutable orient, this film keeps us in our seat. Wyler,the screenwriters, and Leslie Crosbie manage to wreck three lives in an amazing 98 minutes. Hammond was dead a few frames into the film, but lawyer Stephenson will never be able to practice his trade with the same suave surety again, and husband Marshall is unlikely to ever recover from the kick in the gut as Leslie/Bette Davis tells him she still loves the man she killed.Maugham's tight little melodrama comes off better in the hands of master Wyler than Forster's Passage to India, another tale of colonial life brought to the screen by David Lean. Made in 1940, and written long before that, Maugham's and the film's characters did not have to include an Edward Fox giving an apologia for his fellow white men, and so we are able to concentrate on the pure melodrama of the story of a woman who shot her lover.Stephenson is wonderful; as we watch we wonder what price he will ask Davis to pay for his breaking of the rules. He never speaks to her without a pause, as if to say 'what I am telling you is not all that is on my mind' and there is a certainty that he does not know what she will do with this information in the future.Davis was probably the only actress of that time to be able to carry off her role, but the comment of another reviewer that she is not colonial enough is very well taken. We are used to seeing weak men playing opposite her, but Marshall provides more dignity than that as the noble cuckold.My only fear is that someone will try to remake it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six chambers and Manicheism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie and revelation to me last week in TCM channel abroad from England where I saw "The letter" directed by William Wyler in 1940. Bette Davis now as wife too much well educated of a genuine planter, very rich to pay a ransom and influent at any chamber of trade on the region in Singapore, during the administration of the British Empire between the two wars of the last Century. The opening sequence is a short quick moment of this entirely fiction, describing visually the rural workers sleeping on the hammocks, as guessing in a special tropical night with moonlight showed by the camera like a snake awakened. Moving slightly to the right as a panoramic till the entry of the farm house ; unexpectedly, in meantime, when a farmer coming out marching abruptly, but suddenly stepping down, vacillatingly, at the same moment that instantly a gentle and expressive woman shooting at his back two shots without mercy ; after another step, in horror and perhaps with him still alive, she discharges - against him, in cold blood, as almost a corpse - the other bullets from her small pocket pistol. The sensation of the whole scene is tremendous : they wake up the local workers astonished with the amount of responsibility of the current event, as if it was the beginning of an unrest inside the plantation of rubber, like when it was seen, premonitorily, at the beginning of this movie illustrating this famous sequence claiming in the plot symbolically a close-up with some drops of a white substance as latex. But this woman, who does think she is ? A kind of fine insurgent killing the substitute of the true boss, as scapegoat of the exploitation inside this framework of subterranean desires, that the local people seem didn't understood enough and even divining why it was occurred like that and not in an other way. Calling the police is not worst, even though the lady is correct with them and that it was what they did. Wyler directed a kind of incomprehensible movie of suspense, new as genre at the time. Its evaluation as plot is under subject of caution, because the opening long shot as if it was expressively conducted within a combined traveling with such an elliptic panoramic, over the plantation of rubber at the board of ancient Malaya. Thus, switching the romantic touristy folks, half sleeping outside with the tropical heat, in an exotic thriller. An overview giving the point of view of a bird attacking the vindictive framework, where the continuity is broken too for watching the sensation of facade like if dispatched by an epileptic insight and before such a dry emotional explosion from inside the bungalow, as though when someone fires another and after this one steps down forever. After his final cut, it was introduced - against his own will as director - an artificial end, as allegedly conforming to the Code that it was accomplished by the studios in Hollywood at the time and the enormous commercial success of it had immediately closed the row. I read the tale from 1926, after seeing this movie and I was astonished with the foreclose talent of Maugham, who never and since then has had another adaptation such as it was this one made long time ago.

		<shortDescription>Dated, but strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One irony of older films where racial prejudice is not tempered, is that they give a very clear presentation of the racial dynamics and attitudes of the time without being filtered through politically correct speech. You also see clearly that even in those days, prejudice was linked with being an unkind person. The other irony is that many of these films actually did a better job of casting minorities.THE LETTER is one of these films with a clear "colonial" mindset that manages to bring in actors of other ethnicities in some interesting and nuanced roles that actually throw light on inter-race dynamics by what is not said just as much by what is. This, of course, is allowed by the sensitivity of the Director William Wyler, who cast Victor Sen Yeng in a strong supporting role. A flawed character, but they're all flawed in this noir piece.As was often the case, a character actress was cast as the exotic. In this case it is striking, Danish-American Gale Sondergaard (born Edith Holm Sondergaard ? it doesn't get much more Nordic). She is believable, brilliant and seething in a largely silent role (her few lines are in another language).A strong performance by Davis in an extremely unsympathetic role makes this film remain interesting even if it is dated. I don't think this is her best role, it doesn't compare to her work in "Of Human Bondage" and it is hard to believe that this tightly wound woman is one that several men are obsessed with. Still, her strength was always not shying away from unpleasant aspects of her characters, and she brings this role alive with ambiguity and conflicting emotions played against the emotional restraint expected by that society. The black and white photography is really beautiful. The real "time piece" element in this film is the running commentary about her restraint and how wonderful she is; what seems cold and austere today was considered good behavior then. Because of this, it may be hard for younger audiences to access, but if they are aware of this going in, it remains a breathtaking snapshot of a certain time in social history, with a good story and fine acting.</fullReview>

But it didn't take away from Bette Davis's great acting, or the sense of reality that she brought to the role. Even Herbert Marshall the wimp seemed real to me, as did the actor playing the lawyer. It was an easy film to watch and get into and get beyond the fact that it's from 1940, which is much different from so many of the other films of that time.</fullReview>

There are the old boys smug as if the Imperium will go on forever. In this setting, a femme fatale murders her former lover; as her former lover has mixed with the natives, the hankypanky defence has a ring of truth to the all-white colonial jury it might not otherwise have. Yet there is that letter out there that the "victim" sent to her ex-lover; can the ex-lover's native wife be persuaded to sell it? Many have said that there are elements of this film that are politically incorrect by modern standards.I don't think so. The movie rather graphically shows the superficiality of colonial life and its remoteness from the environment.Heavy wigs and black robes on the judges and barristers seem particularly inappropriate over the white suits the torrid climate requires. Britian, the movie shows, may be in power but its grasp on the physical environment is weak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did Bette Davis murder a man to protect her modesty or was there some other reason? This is a wonderful drama and impeccably acted by all, but Bette says so much just with her eyes. She may be saying one thing but her eyes are often telling a different story. Just watch her in the scene where James Stephenson reveals he has come into possession of the letter - what *isn't* being said verbally *is* being said with her eyes. Bette is the focus of all the attention when she is on screen but she has some stiff competition here in the shape of Gale Sondegaard. Although her character barely speaks and has a mask like face, the hatred and malevolence in her eyes is a sight to behold. James Stephenson is outstanding as a lawyer who puts his job on the line in order to save his client. His is a great performance and it is a real tragedy that he died not too long after making this film. The black and white cinematography is superb, capturing the shade and shadows beautifully in the many moonlit scenes. A great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis appears here in a role perfect for her considerable talents, that of Leslie Crosbie, a woman first seen holding a smoking gun and looking at a dead body on the veranda of a house in British Malaya.A potboiler story by Somerset Maugham gave 'The Letter' some bite. This film was a remake of the early talkie starring Jeanne Eagels, made in 1929. Davis is as good as ever under the safe and sure direction of William Wyler, a reliable but inventive pair of hands to helm this production. Herbert Marshall appears as her detached husband, Robert, a man of few emotions, while James Stephenson is sympathetic as lawyer Howard Joyce, and Gale Sondergaard is the widow of the murdered man.'The Letter' is an amoral tale which gives Davis free rein to do some serious scene-chewing in the way only she could.

		<fullReview>In the opening scene of The Letter, which takes place under an ominous, full Malayan moon, Leslie follows her lover, Geoffrey Hammond, onto the veranda of her home and shoots him several times. Later she claims he tried to attack her and she was acting in self-defense. Her husband Robert (Herbert Marshall) believes her; her lawyer and friend, Howard Joyce (Robert Stephanson) doesn't....After Leslie is released on bail, she learns that Hammond's widow (Gale Sondergaard at her mysterious best) is in possession of the incriminating letter Leslie wrote to the deceased on the night of the shooting. Risking disbarment, Howard agrees to pay the $10,000 Hammond's widow wants for it. But there is one stipulation: Leslie must come for the letter herself. Under William Wyler's strong, expert direction the confrontation between the two women is the most memorable scene in the film. As Leslie faces her nemesis, and looks straight into her eyes, the complexities of her character are revealed. During this moment nothing is said, the only sound being the foreboding twinkle of wind chimes....Davis's twisted, hypocritical Leslie Crosby is one of her best acting jobs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Line Between Thinking and Committing Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You already know that Bette Davis' face not only betrays no anxiety but simply has none as she empties a revolver into the body of a man. He is never otherwise shown in the film in flashback. He is a figure never seen but around which the whole plot pivots. You already know that her lace making is the boldly exact work of a woman without a hint of burden on her moral sense. She absorbs herself with it during her trial for murder as collectedly as she would on a comfortable evening in the armchair with music on.If there is any ambiguity that Bette Davis is the star of this film, high above all others, it is overturned by William Wyler's painstaking paneling of her in every shot: When Davis is alone in a shot, the mise en scene appears virtually cloaked around her like velour framed to balance a birthstone. When she is in compositions with other actors, they are usually angled with their backs to the camera and pressured to the edge of the frame to better implant the star at the center. Nevertheless, Davis underplays her role. As a woman accused---indeed guilty, as we gather in the first five minutes, of murder, one would probably figure for her to be leaving no furnishings unbitten, to be creeping from one end of the set to the other, bracing her fists and panting and bristling just though she were about to foam at the mouth. This is, after all, the Bette Davis we have come to presume from her later movies such as The Little Foxes, All About Eve, Baby Jane and Sweet Charlotte. In this second of her three alliances with William Wyler though, she consistently looks to be calm, at her most suggestive and calculated. It was under Wyler's direction, in the end, that she won her second Oscar and that she was nominated as Best Actress two other times. Maybe he knew how to subdue her more audacious inclinations, or maybe, as is clear from his other work, he just knew how to draw subdued work from even the most overstated of actors. Walter Huston and Charlton Heston come to mind.The film is not immaculate. But that is no one's fault except for the Hays Office and the studio era Production Code. Aside from the resulting contrivance and dampening of actual thematic poignancy plaguing the film's final scene, this Maugham adaptation is a flaunt of the skills of a prolific and highly consistent American director, a dauntlessly passionate movie star who eschewed guile and vanity for being purely herself, the emotionally seasoned actor Herbert Marshall and the tight cohesion and mannered deliberation of the cast and filmmakers' collaboration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens up with Bette Davis' character shooting a man six times. It is immediately involving and difficult to turn off (even if it is 5 in the morning). The cinematography is gorgeous and a prime example of excellent black and white lighting. People who watch current movies notice that most are heavy on the action and skimpy on the dialogue, especially murder movies. In the 40's, they knew how to make movies! The movie is dialogue heavy giving the actors opportunities to shine.My least favorite aspect of the entire film is the music. It is not innovative but very repetitive. Of course, any comments that are not PC reflect greatly on the culture in which the movie was made and our maturing as a society. Don't lambast old films because of racism: see them and try to grasp the societies that accepted and condoned the behavior. One could extract commentary from "The Letter" on expatriates, economy, foreign law, rich foreigners exploiting the work forces and raw materials of other countries, but I other will just get a good murder movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder and blackmail in colonial Singapore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six shots ring out through the humid night air of a Singapore rubber plantation. Leslie (Bette Davis), wife of plantation owner Robert (Herbert Marshall) claims that she shot Geoff Hammond in self-defense, but a letter exists that contains some hints to the contrary... Such is the premise of "The Letter," a rather innocuous title for this moody melodrama.Davis does a fine job as the hypocritical Leslie: her famous eyes flash with scorn or widen in fear. Other good performances come from Marshall as the weak, good-hearted husband; James Stephenson as Leslie's morally conflicted lawyer; and Victor Sen Yung as the lawyer's clerk who hides sinister news beneath his subservient smile.The murder-and-blackmail plot of "The Letter" is pretty basic (and with a bit of tinkering could easily be adapted to many time periods and cultures) but the movie gets much of its power from its colonial-era Singapore setting. Melodramatic music, often based on Asian-style melodies, plays throughout, and William Wyler's direction is wonderfully atmospheric, full of nighttime breezes and lurking shadows. Gale Sondergaard gets to make a terrific entrance through a beaded curtain, which helps compensate for the fact that her character doesn't speak a word of English and is rather an Orientalist stereotype.Production Code rules forced the ending of "The Letter" to deviate from Maugham's original story, but the new conclusion works surprisingly well--it's sleek, elegant and foreboding, as is the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The studio system may have had its faults, but when you see some of the films from the period when The Letter was made, your jaw just has to drop in amazed admiration. What a perfectly honed machine for making movies! For one example, look at the sets. They're all completely phony, but they are beautifully and elaborately done with immense attention to detail, even those that are seen only briefly.One of the other things they did well at that time was dialogue. It was well written, well edited, well enunciated and simply well acted.Even the reviled Hayes Code was not all bad, since it forced film makers to be subtle -- so unlike the crassness of most of today's productions.This is a very atmospheric film (great lighting and music) and everyone in it acts well -- except that I am not totally convinced by Bette Davis, and I see no cause for three men (including the lawyer) risking and ruining their lives for the character she portrays.I think the best acting comes from James Stephenson as the lawyer. He's truly first rate in this. Victor Sen Yung and Herbert Marshall also deserve special mention.On a minor note: one little gaffe is the mistaken use of left-hand-drive cars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A full moon is shining among the clouds at a rubber plantation in Malasia. Fires are shot inside the main house and out comes a man trying to flee from the place only to be followed by a woman with a revolver shooting at close range. After he falls, Leslie Crosbie, realizes what she has done. All the emotions going through her are seen in those expressive eyes that shine as the moon is reflected in them.As the investigation of the murder begins, Leslie keeps to the scenario that she has concocted in her mind: Geoff Hammond tried to take advantage of her. With her reputation at stake, she adopts that posture until a letter is brought to the attention of her lawyer. The missive contradicts her story because its content. The Crosbies are part of the English elite in the country; scandals such as the crime that was committed are a rare occurrence. Robert Crosbie, the husband, will never believe his wife was involved in a love affair with a cad. Somerset Maughan's play "The Letter" is the basis for this Warner Bros. picture that defies to show its age as new audiences keep discovering this great work. Thanks to William Wyler, and his star, Bette Davis, the film will live forever. The combination of the director and the leading lady proved to be a valuable commodity for the studio. This was the type of melodrama worldwide audiences couldn't get enough of.Bette Davis was an attractive woman who knew how to portray a character. Ms. Davis used her expressive eyes to convey all the emotions those women she played were experiencing at the time the camera was on her. Her take on Leslie Crosbie was what made her the star she was. She goes from being a snobbish woman to the despair she felt at her acquittal. After all, she was set free, but she still didn't have the man she loved!The second best thing in the movie was James Stephenson, who played Leslie's lawyer, Howard Joyce. This brilliant British actor died much too young. Gale Sondergaard, appears as the native widow of the dead man and who unravels Leslie Crosbie's life. Herbert Marshall is also seen as Robert Crosbie, the deceived husband who sticks by his woman until the end.The adaptation from the original material was by Howard Koch. To his credit, it doesn't feel like a filmed play. Max Steiner's musical score works perfectly with the action. The film will remain one of William Wyler's best works for the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great old movie----------------</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent acting and high-caliber movie craftsmanship elevate this old-fashioned, mannered story.One of the most well-made scenes in movie history is the one in which Bette Davis's character pays off her ex-lover's wife in order to obtain "the letter". This scene is perfectly staged so as to achieve maximum tension despite the minimal dialog. A subtle example is the raised platform upon which Sondergaard stands, which reinforces her dominant victory over Davis.James Stephenson gives one of the finest and most subtly effective performances ever, in his role as the lawyer. The lawyer is on the razor's edge ethically and knows it. Stephenson conveys intense psychological tension and ethical/moral conflict with subtle movement, facial expressions, voice inflections, etc. His Oscar nomination for this was well deserved.Unfortunately, the overall setting of manners and quibbles among Colonials probably can't resonate with today's viewers. It is the major drawback of this movie, but for me it is more than overcome by the movie's many good qualities that will continue to make it watchable in any era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Wyler gets out of the making of epics mode here to team with Bette Davis &amp; Gale Songergaard in a film noir type of mode. When looking at this film considering the year, 1940 &amp; the fact that it is entirely shot on Warner Brothers studio, the film is quite an achievement. It is worth at least one viewing, &amp; the DVD contains a recently discovered alternate ending which is curious after all these years. Bette Davis is super in the lead who in the very first scene shoots her lover. The rest of the film is a back drop about how all this happens &amp; explains the motivation behind the opener. Gale Songergaard is excellent in a supporting role as the spooky woman who wants revenge for the murder.The black &amp; white filming is very effective &amp; Wyler is super in handling camera angles &amp; making the Warners back lot seem like a rubber plantation which even in 1940 is a stretch just short of amazing. There is a dark quality t this film &amp; the finale with the full moon going behind the clouds &amp; then coming back out is shot with expert direction. It foreshadows Wylers later Cruicifiction work in 1959's Ben Hur.While not a total classic, this film is not a waste of time or talent in front or behind he camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette Is Letter Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis gives a fascinating performance in the equally fascinating William Wyler film THE LETTER. Set in steamy Malaya, the film follows Leslie Crosby (Davis), the plantation owner's wife, who has just shot a man to death on the steps of her home. She swears she did it out of self-protection. Her devoted husband (Herbert Marshall, excellent) never doubts her innocence, yet a mysterious letter and her not-so-certain lawyer cast doubt over Leslie....Davis is marvellous as the icy Leslie, coldly and calmly doing needlework while everyone else falls to bits around her. From the opening scene, with a mechanical, evil-looking Davis gunning her lover down, we never doubt Leslie's guilt. No, the real pleasure (howevere perverse) in seeing THE LETTER is watching how Marshall, completely in love with his wife, slowly cracks at the seams as he realises she is not the woman he thought she was...The film is high soap-opera, and I guess I marked it down a bit because the plot seemed readily familiar. Yet Wilder's direction, knowingly melodramatic yet lovingly crafting every scene, Steiner's haunting score, Davis' unnerving acting and the Warners studio exotica make it reach a notch above the average scorching, over-heated sudser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racism rears it's ugly head in Singapore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis just excelled at playing evil characters cloaked in a veil of respectability (Regina Giddons in "The Little Foxes" (1941), Stanley Timberlake in "In This Our Life" (1942)). The "Hollywood Reporter" claimed "The Letter" was one of the best films of the year. Leslie Crosbie is one of Bette Davis' finest portrayals and William Wyler guided her with his usual brilliant direction. "The Letter" was based on a W. Somerset Maugham play and the first filmed version was released in 1929. It starred Jeanne Eagels, who delivered a powerhouse performance - she was nominated for an Academy Award posthumously. Bette Davis performance can stand beside hers - funnily enough in the 1929 version Herbert Marshall (in his first American film) played the murdered lover and in this one he is the loyal husband.The film for me is about the racism and superiority that most White people felt when living in Singapore at that time. Leslie can't stand the fact that her lover has abandoned her for a Eurasian woman (Gale Sondergaard) who he has married. Leslie is also aghast (as is her lawyer) that one of the conditions of receiving the letter is that she will have to meet Mrs. Hammond and take the letter from her personally. Sondergaard played Mrs. Hammond as almost reptilian and very symbolic of how Orientals were perceived at that time. Robert Crosbie's (Herbert Marshall) disintegration had to do with Lelies's fall from the lofty pedestal he had placed her on. Howard Joyce (James Stephenson) has a noticeable breakdown when he realises the truth of Leslie's character. "How can a man live with a woman for 10 years and not know what she is really like".There are no "friendly" natives. When Ohg Chi Seng (Victor Sen Yung), the assistant in Joyce's office becomes part of the plot - he is instantly shown as sly and not trustworthy. Frieda Inescourt plays Dorothy Joyce, a typical society matron, who champions Leslie but doesn't know the first thing about her.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis may have had her problems with Warner Bros, but they were the perfect conduit for her particular talents. This movie is an ideal example of that extraordinary partnership.The story begins on a Maylasian rubber plantation in 1940 before the sun finally set on the immortal British Empire. It is important to know this in order to explain the often inexplicable behavior of the principal players.Bette shoots a planter who makes unwanted advances toward her - so she says. As the true story unfolds, we get to watch her transform like a lizard shedding skins. Denial, outrage, deceit, cornered desperation. You get to see it all - Bette doing what Bette does best. It reminded me of her performance in "One Man's Poison" opposite, her then husband, Gary Merrill. A lesser actress with less expressive eyes could never have gotten away with this kind of melodrama.As I said, we have to put ourselves in the colonial mindset of the times to understand the performance of the principals. Herbert Marshall plays the humiliated husband with all the stiffness of a wooden leg. James Stephenson as her attorney, reminds one of John Williams' clever and dogged, but verrry verrry proper inspector in "Dial M For Murder". Sen Yung as a slimy blackmailer and Gale Sondergaard as the vindictive widow are painted as sufficiently oily Orientals with no apology. Perfectly appropriate in the context of the times.Bette's explosive tour de force at the end is very much like the brightly burning candle on top of the cake. if I can use that metaphor, then Herbert Marshall becomes the melting wax.After seeing this movie several times I gave it a 8/10. I can't say why I didn't give it a 10 except that I came away feeling vaguely disappointed in the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film captures Davis at her best...Gale Sondergaard at her most sinister...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A full moon rising over a rubber plantation in Malaysia, a sleepy staff of workers in hammocks--then shots ring out and Bette Davis comes down the steps shooting at a man who stumbles to the ground. So begins "The Letter" -- and William Wyler has filled it with such atmospheric effects that it rises to the level of great cinema art. The moonlit sky, light and shadow falling on a piece of lacework, shadows shifting as the moon slides behind clouds, wind chimes stirring as Gale Sondergaard makes an entrance to confront the woman who has killed her husband--with an incriminating letter in her possession.The confrontation scene alone between Davis and Sondergaard is worth the price of admission. Gale Sondergaard is a menacing presence in almost any movie but here she is perfectly cast as the unforgiving woman who stares at Davis with such cold defiance and hatred.Others in the cast are first rate too--especially James Stephenson as the lawyer who soon realizes his client is lying. His struggle to come to terms with her is expertly realized--and Stephenson unfortunately met an untimely death shortly after the filming. Herbert Marshall is excellent as the husband who feels the sting of betrayal and suffers from the knowledge that his wife still loves the man she killed. The ending--while required by the movie code of 1940--is nevertheless an interesting one and, in my opinion, totally satisfactory. Don't miss "The Letter". It's a superbly written, acted and photographed film with some memorable incidental music by Max Steiner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this a spoiler alert because I think this would make a great libretto if Terence McNally got hold of it for, say, Jake Heggie. I can see Patricia Racette or Phyllis Pancella in the Bette Davis role depending on whether they want a soprano or a mezzo.It would have to be tightened -- a lot! But from an operatic standpoint, now that composers are writing operas for their audiences, instead of for their undergrad theory teachers, it gives an opportunity for some great solos and ensembles.The reason I cite Racette, is that she is currently singing Butterfly as a hero instead of a pathetic victim, and I see **SPOILER ALERT!!!** Leslie preferring death rather than life on a Sumatran rubber plantation with Robert and no social life.The reason I cite Pancella, is that she sang Lizzie Borden at Glimmerglass Opera and had the audience on her side as she climbed the stairs to murder her father and step-mother. No high notes or big climax at the end, just the audience siding with the character who follows her passion, retribution be damned. A sort of repressed British Carmen.Is that an oxymoron?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis won her fourth Best Actress Academy Award nomination for this moody William Wyler melodrama, made previously in 1929 as a vehicle for stage actress Jeanne Eagels (who also won an Oscar nomination for the same role). The movie gets a high ranking at IMDb, but it's not one of my favorite Davis films. There's nothing exactly wrong with it, but it just left me a bit cold and uninvolved.The story begins with Davis gunning down a man outside her plantation home in a sweaty tropical country. From there, the film unravels the mystery of what led up to that moment. Is Davis's character a victimized heroine who was acting in self-defense, or is she a lethal femme fatale and a great faker to boot? I'll leave it to you to find out for yourself.The film has all the stylistic panache one would expect from a William Wyler movie; it has the look of a film noir before film noir was even a recognized genre. It put me in mind a little bit of something Graham Greene would write, given its tropical setting and moral ambiguity. And however indifferent I may be toward the movie as a whole, I do have to admit that it has a remarkable ending, and if Gale Sondergaard doesn't give you the creeps, you're a better man than I.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Faithfulness, loyalty, and honesty are very important for a man and a women during their marriage. It's important for a husband and a wife to be in direct communication in whatever they do, and not have to lie to one another in times of peril. Forgiveness between a man and woman is great to keep the relationship strong. Through Wyler's eyes, it's important for the woman to tell their husband the truth about their affairs with other men while their husband was away on a business meeting. It's also important for a person not to kill somebody that was attempting to make love to them.Midler's portrayal of Leslie through her acting was excellent. Midler portrayal of Leslie was very dramatic, emotional, and unpredictable through her actions throughout the film. The character's acting skills throughout the film were excellent. The slow moving establishing shots through the film were shot really well at night, heightening the mood and tense atmosphere surrounding the house as Midler committed the horrific murder. The long establishing shot of the mat, the counter,the door and the porch stairs was shot well to allow the viewers to see the path that Midler took to commit the murder. Various uses of repetition of the moon moving through the clouds, the checkered mat, and the viewing of the outdoors at the view of the crime scene kept the tense mood alive and foreshadowed the aftermath of Midler's fatal consequence of committing murder and showing that consequences will be served for committing crimes to other individuals.The overall lighting and focus throughout the film was excellent. The use of the artificial lighting was very high in contrast and brought out excellent cast shadows and reflected lights on objects and actors throughout the film. Often times, soft focus was used on Midler's face in times of distress in climatic scenes. The use of shallow focus on characters while they were talking to the main characters that were often in focus was shot well. The use of natural light in the outdoor scenes was used well.If you're interested in dramatic, climatic film noir films, then this film is a great movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis plays the wife of a Singapore plantation manager who thinks she's free of a murder charge until "The Letter" surfaces in this grand 1940 film directed by William Wyler from a Somerset Maugham story. The film also stars Herbert Marshall, James Stephenson, and Gale Sondergaard.Davis is Leslie Crosbie, the well-liked and respected wife of Robert Crosbie (Marshall), who shoots a man several times and claims he was trying to molest her. Stephenson plays her lawyer, and it's all pretty much a slam dunk for him until his clerk (Sen Yung) tells him the native wife of the victim (Sondergaard) has a letter in her possession that proves that on the night of the murder, her husband was invited to the house by Leslie, and the letter mentions that Robert would be away for the night.William Wyler was one of Bette Davis' best directors - she obviously admired him and allowed him to guide her performances. Here she is a woman who is very aware of her impact on people, including the opposite sex, and has cultivated it very carefully, all the while keeping a secret that would bring her down a couple of pegs. The scene where Stephenson confronts her with the letter is masterful: He quietly suggests there might be a problem, and, even as she's denying the letter, you can see her thinking of a way out. James Stephenson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance. He was on the cusp of a really wonderful career when he died very suddenly about a year after this film was made.Wyler has created a tremendous tropical and mysterious atmosphere that represents Leslie herself - something going on quietly, in the dark - the night isn't what it seems, anymore than she is. Hard to believe it was a set on the Warner Brothers lot, because you can almost feel the heat and the breeze.One of the best filmings of a Maugham story, and a perfect vehicle for Davis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fan Of The Classics Would Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How one views this movie depends, I would think, on how one generally views classic-era films. For those who enjoy them, this is one to see since it stars one of the great actresses of all time, Bette Davis. For those who prefer faster-paced, modern movies, this would not be recommended.Although it helps, you don't have to be a big fan of Bette Davis to enjoy this movie. Myself, I enjoyed Henry Stephenson and his character, "Howard Joyce" in here the most. He got better and better as the film went on, and for me, was the star of the film. Sadly, Stephenson died about a year after this movie came out.Most people will enjoy yet another sterling performance from Davis, who plays a shady character, "Leslie Crosbie, " a woman trying to get away with murder. Davis is good at playing despicable, scheming liars and she does that well here in this film.Based on a stage play about privileged people who obviously can't control their love lives, this is a very "talky" movie, so beware of that if you are one that prefers a little more action. In addition, if you're looking for some cool lines from the mysterious Gale Sondergaard, forget it: she didn't utter a word of dialog! Her billing suggested a bigger role, but it was not to be. True, she looked mysterious with some wonderful film-noir-like photography on her, but there wasn't anything else to her role.William Wyler's direction and Tony Gaudio's photography give us good atmosphere, which I why I wanted to see this on DVD after seeing a so-so VHS tape, but that second viewing was enough. Being a "classic" in the "classic era," it's worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephenson Steals the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine adaptation of the Maugham play about the consequences of a murder at a rubber plantation in Singapore. There are good performances from Davis as a woman scorned, Marshall as her weak husband, and Yung as a somewhat shady lawyer. However, the acting honors go to Stephenson, who gives a wonderfully understated performance as Davis' defense lawyer, brilliantly conveying the ethical dilemmas that confront him. Sadly, Stephenson had only a five-year film career, dying prematurely the year after this film was released. Wyler does a masterful job of evoking the time and place, helped by beautiful cinematography and atmospheric score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece despite the contrived ending. Hollywood ordained that Bette Davis (Leslie Crosbie) pay the price in the end, whereas in the novella Leslie Crosbie would forever live with the knowledge that she would never have back the only man she truly loved. The acting is tremendous and the sets are awesome. I can never get tired of this film - a product of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oriental Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things I found implicit in William Wyler's film of The Letter is the racism of the British colonists in Malaya. Essentially in this melodrama we're talking about Bette Davis's boyfriend throwing her over for a Eurasian woman and Bette not liking it a bit.The film begins with a homicide. Bette Davis empties a revolver into her lover's body. She's been having an affair with him for some time, but he hasn't come a callin' recently. Her story to the authorities is that the man tried to attack her and she resisted. Of course she's not quite telling the truth.For propriety's sake there seems to be no great desire by the British authorities to investigate what happened. Davis's attorney and family friend James Stephenson learns only what he needs to know to get her acquitted. Her husband Herbert Marshall is unwilling to face the truth until it smacks him in the face towards the end.It's the natives who have their vengeance in the end. Maybe the best two performances in The Letter are those of the deceased Eurasian wife Gale Sondergaard and her crafty accomplice Victor Sen Yung. They exact what the Anglo-Saxon legal system dare not deal with.The Letter is a high class melodrama brought to life by Director William Wyler and star Bette Davis. Davis was probably at the height of her career at this time. The Letter is one of her best screen roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film, but a one note performance from Davis spoils it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is indeed a great film: thrilling and inspiring. But Davis gives yet ANOTHER of her one note performances and keeps it from being a 10 star film. It is a shame the producers could not have given the role to someone of a more iridescent artistic ability like Joan Crawford, Vivien Leigh or Rosalind Russell. They certainly would have created a true classic in every sense of the word. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre production from a familiar pairing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Letter", William Wyler's 1940 film about murder, deception and the consequences of both, was a lot darker than I actually expected it to be. Bette Davis is Leslie, who is first introduced to the film when she is shooting a man multiple times on the front steps of her house in Malaysia. She tells her husband Robert (Marshall) and attorney Howard (Stephenson) that though the man she shot was in fact a long-time family friend, he was making advances on her and she feared for her life. Unfortunately, the truth is that she was having an affair with this man, Hammond, he spurned her and she shot him. This is discovered when Howard is contacted by an associate with the news that there is a letter in existence which was written the day of the murder by Leslie inviting Hammond to come to the house that night, and Hammond's widow has it. Since her original story would be a slam-dunk acquittal in court, Howard and Leslie, while keeping this a secret from Robert, buy the letter back for a large sum to secure her freedom. Unfortunately, this doesn't ensure that she will no longer be blackmailed, that Robert will never find out, or that Leslie's life won't be in danger for what she did.I found "The Letter" to be a decent film, but it was really odd. I guess I had never seen a Wyler film that was so dark, even when he teamed up with Marshall and Davis in "The Little Foxes". "The Letter" was downright scary at times, though I think that was due largely to the really frightening Mrs. Hammond, played by Gale Sondergaard. She was described as a wicked woman with a frightening white mask of a face, and that's pretty much what she was. The hard looks that she would give, without saying a word, were actually really unsettling. The denouement was so wild and over-the-top that it left me actually kind of humored. The film was good, and I always enjoy Herbert Marshall; (everything I've seen him in make him seem like such a soft-spoken, eloquent teddy bear) but I think I was expecting something either different, or something more out of the film and out of the actors, particularly Davis. 5/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amusingly mannered Bette Davis vehicle concerns the wife of a rubber plantation foreman near Singapore indicted for the killing of a man she and her husband were acquaintances with--she claims it was self-defense, but an incriminating letter she wrote to the victim on the morning of his demise puts her future in jeopardy. Camp/exotic atmosphere and music (like Martin Denny on downers) keeps this soap opera from being a bummer (the underlying message of it all being that any woman who cheats is "evil"). There are some intentionally funny visual jabs and performances, but it's really Bette's show: with her saucer-round eyes and precise diction, she's quite mesmerizing--but with her silly feminine wiles, fainting spells and poker-faced reactions, she's also infernally confounding. Either way, the picture loses dramatic vitality whenever she is off-screen, the men being of little consequence. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and thinly plotted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand the big deal about this film. After a beautifully filmed opening sequence, "The Letter" deteriorates into a mind-numbingly boring waste of time. The plot is obvious ? Bette Davis murders a man whom she claimed tried to rape her -- and then an incriminating letter that she'd written to him on the same day surfaces.The film coasts on Davis's charm as a rather loathsome character, with only her performance, some great cinematography and a clever (albeit completely predictable) ending to hold it together. The story's thin, most of the acting is atrocious, the dialogue is even worse? and then there's the score ? easily the most obnoxious and redundant musical score that's ever assaulted my ears. If it's your cup of tea, good for you, but I personally found it to be a pretty dull waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowdlerized Maugham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maugham's misogynism created delightfully evil female characters and Bette Davis seemed to have the talent to play them on the screen. So, it should be no surprise that this film's main asset is Bette Davis. Unfortunately, it may be the film's only asset.After seeing this film, I went back and re-read Maugham's short story because I recalled a different plot. Well, the Hays Code script expunges the word "rape", turns Hammond's Chinese mistress into a Eurasian Mrs (played by Gale Sondergaard who stares but says nothing), inserts a supposedly dramatic meeting of the two women and then kills off the adulterous Bette Davis at the end. Worse, the urbane Herbert Marshall plays Bette Davis' cuckolded husband whereas Maugham's character is a more realistic, thick-headed planter.The movie's opening scene shows a rubber tree with sap running but that's the end of any connection to colonial plantation life. (Wyler inserts occasional moonlit palm trees in an effort to create, I suppose, south sea romance. It doesn't work.) In short, Maugham's 30 page story is much, much better. The movie removes the British Malayan context and flattens Maugham's usual laconic view of human foibles. The end result is not one of Wyler's better moments and amounts to a 1940s Hollywood, Bette Davis vehicle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film, 1940 must have been a lousy year for movies if this one got nominated for best picture. While it isn't all bad, it is it's own brand of cheese! The best performances are from James Stephenson and Sen Yung. Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall, who portrays her husband on screen ham it up for all it's worth. Set in Singapore in those long ago British Empire days, amidst the grandeur of the Rubber plantations our story unfolds. Here it is plain and simple. Bette opens the movie with shooting some guy named Jeffrey Hammond. She stands around looking dazed as natives all move in for a closer look. One is summoned to go and find the local law. While another goes to find happy Herbert, off at some remote place where they grow rubber. Oh the guy sent for the law, also gets the family lawyer. The investigation begins and soon Bette finds that she must be imprisoned until the trial. It looks like and open and shut case, for Bette claims the man she shot was after her body and wished to make passionate love to her. Herbert even mutters "Swine" in reference to the now bullet riddled Hammonds. Well it turns out there is a LETTER! A letter written by Bette to Hammonds asking him to come out to the plantation. This letter is in the possesion of Hammond's Eurasian wife. She says she wants money before she turns it over to Bette and her lawyer. I tell no more, because if you have gone this far to read about this movie you might want to be surprised. Watch it once and then say you did. Then see if you are able to ever watch it again.MM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie on PBS one night and was entertained by the mannered acting and Bette Davis. She was something to watch as the conniving wife, cold and calculating. The implied racist was also something to watch. Worth seeing for Bette Davis and the dated treatment of people who are other than white.</fullReview>
