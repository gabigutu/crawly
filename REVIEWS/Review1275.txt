		<shortDescription>The Dreams of the Discontented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Petrified Forest" (Archie Mayo, 1936) is most fascinating for its eager willingness to voice criticisms of wealth, power, authority, and inequality in America. Perhaps its acute social commentary should be unsurprising considering that Warner Brothers released the romantic crime drama during the depths of the Great Depression, but it is freshly relevant just the same, striking a note that would not be witnessed in the films of the forties and fifties. In speaking to the exploitation of workers, the snobbery of corporatism, the repression of women, blacks, artists, and literary poets, the reign of gangland crime, the American government's complicit abuse of power, and the loss of individuality in an increasingly meek age, "The Petrified Forest" manages an equal-opportunity iconoclasm that belies any party affiliations. Simply put, the film is unafraid to criticize America, and it's that sense of freedom that makes it particularly delightful. Best of all, "The Petrified Forest" voices its dissent through colorful witticisms and engaging banter, never taking itself too seriously or losing its sense of humor. "The Petrified Forest" is also particularly notable for marking Humphrey Bogart's first major screen role as the nominal villain and escaped gangster Duke Mantee. The unshaven, pompadour-sporting Bogart is leering and menacing, brooding and growling and glowering, projecting the lonely, hard-bitten cynicism that would soon become his trademark. At the same time, however, he also emerges as a sympathetic and noble figure, one who transcends his criminal trappings through a fierce sense of integrity and individuality. Not only did these hard-boiled character traits become the template for the Bogart persona, but they also serve as a source of magnetism within the film's social milieu. Aside from the corporate oilman (Mr. Chisholm, played by Paul Harvey), Duke Mantee's hostages in a desert diner come to admire and salute his rugged individualism and defiance of the status quo, even as he endangers their lives. They yearn for the empowering resistance that he embodies and the gritty social rebelliousness that he wears on his prickly face, and when the film, before its final shootout, labels the confrontation as "Duke Mantee vs. the American government," it's clear that the sympathies of its principal characters reside with the Duke. "The Petrified Forest" is also noteworthy for the dynamic contrast between its two black characters. One of them (Joseph, played by John Alexander) is virtually the embodiment of the pre-sixties Hollywood stereotype, a meek, shuffling, subservient chauffeur who always looks to his wealthy boss for paternalistic approval before opening his mouth. The other (Slim, played by Slim Thompson) is one of Duke Mantee's gangster associates, and he's clearly a liberated, autonomous, independent soul who offers his opinions on his own accord while mocking his "colored brother" for his subservience. He's almost a figure out of 1966 rather than 1936, and the difference between these two black men highlights the social conflict that the film heeds. On one side is the ruggedly individualistic and socially defiant Duke Mantee and a black man who marches to his own beat; on the other is a fat cat corporate tycoon and his docile and emasculated black servant, who, in turn, represent the American status quo. And so while Mantee and his gangsters are nominally the villains of "The Petrified Forest," at heart they constitute the film's heroes and rousing saviors. They are the men who obliquely brighten the hopeless despair and repressed frustrations of a trapped waitress who is secretly a talented painter (Gabby Maple, played by Bette Davis) and a fatalistically passionate French drifter-poet who is hitching his way to the Pacific Ocean (Alan Squier, played by Leslie Howard). They also seem to enliven several of the other repressed characters, from the restless wife of the cowardly tycoon (Mrs. Edith Chisholm, played by Genevieve Tobin), to an ex-college football player struggling to release his pent-up energies (Nick, played by Eddie Acuff), to an old man who longs for Billy the Kid, Mark Twain, and the legendary individualists of a bygone era (Gramp Maple, played by Charley Grapewin). To be sure, the film doesn't explicitly paint Duke Mantee and his fellow gangsters as heroic saviors, but it's clear where the film's sympathies lie.Ultimately "The Petrified Forest" is about an umbrella of misfits and their discontent with the repressive and exploitative American establishment, and it's that pulse of iconoclasm that keeps it audacious and provocative after all these decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Petrified Forest (1936) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is one of the reasons I love old movies so much - intriguing writing, great acting, and interesting characters hold our attention throughout the movie without needing to resort to desperate all-out action, explosions, and computer effects.Leslie Howard is a gentle intellectual roaming the Arizona desert who happens upon a quaint little cafe/gas station in the middle of nowhere, amidst sand and cactus. He immediately stirs the emotions of big-eyed waitress, Gabby (played by an adorably youthful Bette Davis), who holds a dream of going to France and finding herself in the world. But despite their quick and mutual adoration for one another there is impending tension hovering around their introduction, as news continually escalates about a killer named Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart) who's on the run and not far from the diner. Eventually, the infamous gangster shows up with some thugs and takes over the cafe, holding an array of wonderfully colorful characters hostage.This was originally a play with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, and leading man Howard reportedly refused to do the picture without Bogie being in it. As a result, this is noteworthy also as Bogart's big breakout movie, and it would only be a few more years before he would hit super-stardom all on his own. Humphrey seems to put a lot into his gangster character, investing Duke with the necessary evil demeanor, yet also with a hint of heart and soul. Leslie Howard and Bette Davis make a wonderful pair, and both give fine performances; which makes the potentially talky twenty minute scene where they first get acquainted actually completely captivating. Charley Grapewin is delightful and funny as Davis' chattering grandpa. Dick Foran, playing a strapping and comical football star who pumps gas while always trying to woo Gabby, was very good in this film and it's probably the best work I've seen him do in movies, before he wound up as a "B" player for Universal. His character here is in complete contrast from the heroes and "singing cowboys" I've been used to seeing him play.At first watch I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending (which I will not reveal) but after thinking about it I came to the decision that it really fit the story well after all, and is actually very poetic. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Leslie Howard Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Based on the stunningly emotion play of the same title Petrified Forest is the tale that Acting great Leslie Howard will always be remembered for.He is at the heart of this film as a disillusioned intellectual whose personality never survived the war. Bette Davis is also strong as the waitress who Howard shares his secrets with. Humphrey Bogart made an impressive screen debut repeating the role of Duke Mantee at Howard's insistence. Howard and Bogart played the roles on stage and it is a treasure to see these two actors performances preserved for posterity. Those on this page who have questioned Howard's portrayal of his role are obviously missing the entire emotional through line of his role. Howard was far ahead of his time, an extremely naturalistic actor in a Hollywood obsessed by type casting. Watch this film and be moved by the story. you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly relevant piece of cinema...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best context to look at "The Petrified Forest" is through the context of the first great disaster of the 20th Century: World War I (or, as it was known then, "The Great War"). I had just finished reading a long, thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe (all wars usually are, but this one especially), one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape. Maybe that's why Leslie Howard's character, Alan Squier, wound up wandering through there, as it probably reminded him of more than a few days and nights in No Man's Land (a term invented by the Great War to describe the space between enemy lines). A lot of non-American WWI veterans came out of it really messed up. The whole foundation of the 19th century's ideals had been laid to waste by this new and brutal world that WWI brought about. So it's not very suprising to me that Squier feels "obsolete", as he puts it; the role he had hoped to take with his world doesn't even exist. The best he can do is give Gabrielle Maple the chance he can never have.Duke Mantee (played by Bogie in a superb, breakthrough performance) is also a relic, but from a different period, that of the Roaring Twenties. Not for nothing were such outlaws as John Dillenger and Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow glamourized during this period; one could possibly point to our current fascination with serial killers as this phenomenon's modern equivalent. But by 1936, the period of the romantic outlaw was drawing to a close if it wasn't already over (a point made five years later in "High Sierra"). Mantee is totally without hope of escape or even a reprieve. He sees his fate as clear as day and doesn't kid himself about his chances of eluding it forever. That, more than anything, would explain his rapproachment with Squier and perhaps his reluctance to shoot him until Squier gives him no choice. Mantee may know his own fate well enough, but he has no wish to inflict that fate on someone in the same position.Granted, there's a lot more layers and angles going on in "The Petrified Forest" than what I've just mentioned here, but this was the one that grabbed the most. Because human nature doesn't change that much, perhaps that's why this brilliant stage piece still holds my respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart's Breakthrough Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Petrified Forest" is widely regarded as Humphrey Bogart's breakthrough film, which indeed it was. Bogey had made several forgettable films between 1930-34 before returning discouraged to the New York stage. There, he acquired the role of Duke Mantee in the stage version of "The Petrified Forest" in which Leslie Howard was the star.When Warner Bros. bought the film rights they wanted Howard but also wanted Edward G. Robinson for the Mantee role. Howard interceded on Bogart's behalf saying that if Bogey wasn't cast as Mantee that he wouldn't do the film either. Bogey never forgot this favor and years later named his daughter Leslie after Howard.The story takes place in a dusty road side cafe/gas station in the middle of a desert. The film is essentially about a bunch of life's losers with no real future except for the young waitress Gabrielle Maples (Bette Davis) who dreams of leaving the dusty desert for the bright lights of Paris.A wandering intellectual/writer Alan Squier (Howard) comes to the cafe broke and hungry. He strikes up a friendship with Gabrielle who admires his cultured manner and love of poetry much to the chagrin of would be boyfriend Boze Hertzinger (Dick Foran) a has been football player who now pumps gas. Inside the cafe we meet Gabrielle's father Jason (Porter Hall) who fancies himself as a war hero and Gramp Maples (Charlie Grapewin) a senile old timer who likes to tell stories of his encounter with Billy the Kid.Into this peaceful setting comes gangster Duke Mantee (Bogart) and his three pals Jackie (Joe Sawyer), Ruby (Adrian Morris) and Slim (Slim Thompson). The gang is on the lam from the law. Mantee holds all of the people in the cafe hostage including travelers the Chisolms (Paul Harvey, Genevieve Tobin) and their chauffeur Joseph (John Alexander). The rest of the film deals with the conflicts between the various characters and the growing love story between Alan and Gabrielle.Bogey reportedly patterned his Mantee after real life gangster John Dillinger right down to his speech and movements. In fact if you look at photographs of Dillinger, you can see the resemblance. This might explain Bogey's CP3O (the android from "Star Wars") like posture. Notice how he holds his arms and his walk.The two black actors (Thompson and Alexander) were also in the New York stage production. Dick Foran was appearing as a singing cowboy in a series of "B" westerns for Warners and welcomed this chance at a straight role in a major film.Although Bogart definitely dominated the film, one can't help but admire the performance of Leslie Howard as Squier. Bette Davis just emerging as a major star has little to do but stare wide-eyed at Howard.After this film, Warners signed Bogart to a contract. He would play mostly gangster roles in Cagney and Robinson films with the odd lead in a "B" picture such as "Black Legion" (1937) until 1941 when he became a major star after appearing in "High Sierra" and "The Maltese Falcon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger in the Desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Sherwood's The Petrified Forest had a run in 1935 on Broadway for the first half of that year. Warner Brothers bought the film rights and shot it the following year. Leslie Howard and at his insistence, Humphrey Bogart, came west to repeat their stage roles.For Bogart it was a return to bigger acclaim than he had gotten in his first trip to Hollywood in the early Thirties. He hadn't made much of an impression then, but he was in Tinseltown to stay after The Petrified Forest and his frightening characterization of criminal on the run, Duke Mantee.The Petrified Forest takes place in a filling station/greasy spoon truck stop on the edge of the Arizona desert. About as desolate a place as you'll find. Three generations of the Maple family own and operate the place. Grandpa Charley Grapewin, Father Porter Hall, and daughter Bette Davis who dreams about the fact there's more to life than this nowhere place. Bette also has to contend with former college football star Dick Foran and his clumsy efforts at courtship.Along comes Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard who's a blase world weary vagabond who's seen better days. He and Davis hit it off and she comes to realize that there is a great big world out there. The first third of the movie involves the two of them and I have to say that in the mouths of players less skilled than these two, Robert Sherwood's dialog would have sounded like so much romantic drivel.For Davis, Gabrielle Maple is a unique part and not one she'd play later on as her features hardened. An intelligent and romantic young girl is not a typical Bette Davis part, but she does bring it off.As for Howard, Alan Squier is a typical part for him. Not too much different than Ashley Wilkes or Philip Scott from The 49th Parallel.The remainder of the film is when Duke Mantee and his gang take refuge at the filling station and hold captive anyone who's there or wanders in. A lot of souls are bared under Mantee's guns and the climax is spectacular.Two other actors who repeated their Broadway roles are Joseph Alexander who's the chauffeur of a rich couple who stop at the filling station and Slim Thompson a member of Mantee's gang. Both of these players are black.Joseph Alexander is a menial and Slim Thompson really rubs it in to him, telling him the day of liberation has come for some time now. In 1936 that was practically revolutionary.Alexander had a substantial career, but I have no idea what happened to Thompson. He had no other film credits and only one other stage appearance on Broadway in the original production of Anna Lucasta.Moviegoers of all generations should thank Leslie Howard for insisting on Humphrey Bogart being in this film and helping to create a screen legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film gave a tremendous boost to Bogart's screen career...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Archie Mayo, "The Petrified Forest" gave a tremendous boost to Bogart's screen career by providing him with a ready-made showcase for his talent? The movie was a very faithful adaptation of the play as it told of a group of diverse personalities who find themselves held at bay in a small service-station-restaurant by a ruthless gunman and his gang on the run from pursuing police? There were heavily symbolic overtones involving the overrunning of the doomed intellectuals by corruptive brute force? Into this truly fragile framework, the screenplay weaves a tapestry of penetrating character studies? First there is Alan Squier (Leslie Howard), a disillusioned writer and intellectual who realizes he is a member of a vanishing breed of men whose visions of a Utopian existence have given way to the oppressive realities of a world that no longer has any room for his type of dreamer? Frustrated and quietly despairing, he meets a dreamer of another type, Gabrielle Maple (Bette Davis). She shares Squier's love of beauty and poetry and dreams of fleeing her repressing entrapment at the restaurant and traveling to France? Into their world of fanciful idealism enters Humphrey Bogart?the reality, the brute force which threatens not only the dreamers but all of society? It is a finely truthful portrait of ultimate evil, magnificently played by Bogart with all the uncompromising ferocity the role demanded? It was one of Bogart's finest portrayals and it was the model, although considerably restrained, he would follow for the next years of his career?Final note: Duke Mantee was a killer on the run? He was not a big-shot businessman? The assumption put into the audience's mind was that this mobster was a bank robber, a hold-up artist, an escaped convict... but never a wealthy criminal controlling an empire of corruption from plush offices on the 18th floor?Approximately twenty years later, Bogart recreated his original role in a television production of "The Petrified Forest." Directed by Delbert Mann, the play featured Lauren Bacall in the Davis role and Henry Fonda in Howard's part... After all those years, Bogart still had the character down perfectly and received excellent notices?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A question of simplicity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would be the best actor to play a failed writer, a romantic dreamer? Yeah, Leslie Howard seems to be a nice choice... And what if we take this pretty and young Bette Davis (before she becomes the best villain in the story of cinema) and make her play a rebel girl that's longing for a new life far away from that dusty Arizona hole she lives in? Lastly we give Humphrey Bogart the role of a bloodthirsty gangster that walks like a bulldog... Now that we have the perfect cast we just have to write a simple film-noir script, full of humor and with some touches of poetry and romanticism. That's it, a 80 minutes long wonder.This is cinema, my friends. Quite a lesson of how to create characters and how to make a great movie with a few sets and with six or seven actors. "Petrified Forest" is 70 years old, but it'll remain magnificent for ever and ever.*My rate: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race and Gender Issues Tackled in a Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have seen this film many, many years ago but I have no such recollection. I rented it last night and was amazed at the issues handled by a fine cast in a pre-World War II gangster film. A black chauffeur for a rich couple is not typically stereotyped but has a say as to how he does his job. A second black character is an equal member of the gang of fleeing desperadoes with no reference to his race and he engages in conduct no different than his cronies. A quick interchange between the two black characters is fascinating. The Rich Wife spills out her anger and frustration about a loveless marriage in terms as realistic for many today as it was when the film was made.The love story is dramatic; it is also unreal. Leslie Howard, who was to die in World War II when the plane on which he was a passenger was shot down by the Luftwaffe (there's a strange story about THAT interception), relates his failed marital history with a genteel but real frankness not usually found in pre-war cinema.Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart shine in their roles. Bogart was starting off on his long career as a bad guy and does his promise come across. Davis is appealing with a naivete absent from most of her later films.This is definitely a film with an agenda. Comments on patriotism seem suspended between caricature and seriousness. A sign, "Tipping Isn't American-Keep Your Change," hangs prominently in the desert cafe. Tipping isn't American? During the Depression? Methinks not.One of the best films from a long-ago Hollywood that had its too often underappreciated cohort of serious thinkers."Petrified Forest" is both a fine film and a reminder of a Hollywood that occasionally showed its ability to address sensitive issues when even discussion of some of them was largely infra dig for most cinema moguls and their claques.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A glorious movie based on a very wise and compassionate play. It is a savage indictment of a lifeless civilization. Confronted by death in a hostage situation, one elderly wife bitterly reproaches her husband of having stifled her personality: "You took my soul, you stenciled it on a card and filed it". Leslie Howard gives up his quest for bliss, and seeks to die in style for his beloved. Bogart represents nature lashing out against man. Alas, few movies from the thirties achieve this height of artistry. Hollywood makes a mistake when drawing plots from novels rather than plays. The concentrated compactness and intimacy of a play cannot be had from a sprawling novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Bette Davis Learned to Steal the Show . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . it was when she was 27yo. and she stoled the lead from Leslie Howard (a veteran actor by 1936) and Humphrey Bogart (who landed the supporting actor role via Howard's petitions to Warner Bros.).In the desert of the US Southwest, Davis runs a desert diner and store owned by her dizzy daddy. Howard is a visiting vagrant writer on foot who stops in the diner to eat. After Davis waits on him, they strike up an intense conversation. However, the gangster Duke Mantee and his mob are making their way through the desert leaving a trail of blood behind them. Thus, Bogie, putting on a real thug act, also enters the diner scene where almost the entire film is set.This was Davis and Howard's 2nd match up on the silver screen: Of Human Bondage was their Oscar-worthy-but-overlooked 1st. Their screen chemistry was simply sensual and a true pleasure to absorb.Bogie's gangster character was nearly comical compared to Howard's philosophical and sophisticated wanderer. Davis played the young woman who has a talent for capturing the colorful desert scenes on canvass, but wants to go abroad to France, where her long lost mother is from and resides.Therefore, Davis' character acts like a bridge between the two key men opposites: Bogart and Howard. She's both "street smart," from having to run the desert diner, and intellectual, since she is an avid reader and artist.Given that this motion picture was filmed with sound barely beyond the silent years, Davis' live stage experience shows &amp; shows up Bogie by far. There would never be a time in the history of Davis and Bogart's five movies together when Bogart was ever able to command the lead away from Davis. However, in "Dark Victory," Davis and Bogart did make a great love match.It was later during "The Big Sleep" when the 25yo Lauren Bacall and the 46yo Bogie brought out the very best in each other. So much so immediately after that film was made they were wed. It was to Davis' credit that she groomed Bogie into a better actor. He wouldn't be the last actor Davis groomed into greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Siddown and keep yer yap shut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really an unusual movie (or, to be more exact, filmed stage play) for its time. There's nothing unique about the situation. A gangster and his handful of hoods hole up in an isolated desert cafe with hostages of varying characters. But it's impressively written, and handled deftly by the performers. There aren't that many movies in which I look forward to the appearance of Betty Davis, but she's just fine here. The film is all the more surprising because the theme it treats is an old one -- the replacement of the old and exhausted by the new and visionary. (Cf., "Shane" for another example.) It may have struck a more responsive chord with audiences of the early 1930s -- that old and exhausted business. (The rabid capitalism of the past must have seemed a little old-fashioned. When this was written, income taxes were negligible and there was no social security. The robber barons were able to keep just about every nickel they could squeeze out of their non-unionized subordinates.)There's a kind of robber baron in this movie too. A businessman with an expensive car, a black chauffeur, and a wife who doesn't love him. It's a bit stereotypical, true, but it's hard to overcome the necessity for sketching in a character with a few lines of dialogue without seeming lazy or preachy. About half-way through, by the way, his wife gives him hell for his selfishness. The two black characters (the chauffeur and one of the gangsters) are never referred to by their race. Both are highly individuated people and the one exchange between them is kind of funny. Bogart as Duke Mantee gives what is probably his most highly stylized performance. His menacing posture is that of someone who has recently suffered a stroke in the region of the cerebellum. He even speaks oddly -- not his usual snappy lines, but long, drawn-out, ominous, yet resigned to his fate. He seems to agree with Leslie Howard that they are washed up, which is the reason he agrees to kill Howard, who will then leave his insurance money to Betty Davis so she can return to France where she was born. It's Custer's last stand. And that forest is indeed petrified.There's a bit of philosophizing and poetry -- but not enough to dull the narrative. And Villon is the perfect poet for Betty Davis. Not aristocratic or elegant, a thief from the lower depths really, but filled with passion. ("This is the end for which we twain are met.") He could have been Davis leaving the petrified forest and involving herself in something most people would recognize as more grand. Howard has misspent his life. He's only written one book, so he's obviously a failure. I didn't care for that remark too much, since I've only written one book myself ("Fine Wines of Mississippi") and nobody read it except my Mom, and her only at gunpoint. So maybe Howard overplays the world weariness. But he and Bogart are the only two characters in the movie who seem to know what it's all about. The gangsters and the football player are airheads. Davis is full of dreams. The businessman thinks only of himself. His wife brims over with resentment. The old man is foolish and tells lies. Only Howard and Bogart see through everything.It's quite a good movie. It shows what you can do with some good actors, a decent script, and very little in the way of extravagant special effects or expensive location shooting. (The windblown desert sets look the way windblown desert locations should, and so seldom do.) My advice? Siddown, mug, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you're a hostage of your own existence, a real hostage taker can set you free ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A drifter is hitchhiking in the middle of Arizona's desert, but the cars passing by him are as eager to stop as the tumbleweeds. The opening shot of "The Petrified Forest" reflects our very loneliness : we all have goals, we all wander in our lives and we all depend on helpful people.The man makes it to a roadside diner to find people with seemingly purposeful lives. Gabby Maple, played by Bette Davis, is the owner's daughter, a young idealistic servant killing time by painting, reading French poetry and dreaming of visiting Bourges, her mother's hometown. Her father (Porter Hall) who couldn't keep his war-bride wife in USA, spends time, expressing an ironic bitterness toward anyone's bitter at his country. Dick Foran is Boze, a former college football player who sees Gabby's heart as a trophy to win. And Grampa (Charley Grapewin) keeps bragging on his status as the one guy "missed by Billy the Kid".The characters divide the world in two: those who look at the future, Boze and Gabby, and those who remember the past, angrily (the father) or enthusiastically (Grampa). Generation is an important factor since the film is set during the Great Depression, which more resonates as a state of mind, what kind of future such a gloomy period can ever paint, except for the younger generation, who didn't live, or merely, the War? Gabby thinks of the Great War as the event she owed her existence to, and the source of an existential quest. The mysterious voyager is Alan Squier, as if Alan was a wording of Alone, and with his dandy look and affable mannerisms, he belongs to another era and since eras condition states of mind, his is enigmatic. Indeed, the man, a writer, played by a suave and wonderful Leslie Howard, speaks in poetry and philosophy, a failed artist who wasn't cut either for marital commitment. Alan's constant amazement hardly hides what he is deep inside, a misfit, an outcast and an intellectual malcontent. Yet his detachment gives him an undeniable aura, he has no goal but is not turned to the past either. And if Gabby is enamored, she doesn't want to marry either, she just sees in him an invitation to escape.People with high hopes believe in their destiny, what they wait for is a sign, a little oddity that breaks up the morbid routine and enlighten moroseness with a light of hope. When Alan finally leaves, mooching a car belonging to wealthy tourists, the Chrisholms (Paul Harvey and Genevieve Tobin), you can see desperation in Gabby's eyes as if the only sparkle that could've her ignited it started to fade. But destiny didn't say its last word, the passengers are carjacked and when they all join the diner, they find a new guest : Duke Mantee.And it's one thing to have people blabbing about life and death, their views are elevated to another dimension when their lives are endangered. Mantee will be the trigger, so to speak, to a series of self-revelations. played by a youngish Humphrey Bogart, Duke Mantee is less an imitation of gangster-legend John Dillinger than Bogart's own approach to the role he played on the Broadway play, a man so worn-out, so tired of being pursued by Police, on having to keep his guard, that he ended up walking slowly and carefully as if he was at the verge of starting a shootout. He's a living tickling bomb, a man who's had enough. Even at 37, Bogart could illuminate the screen with tiredness, combined with a savage reputation and the fact that he risks his life, by waiting in the diner, for a mysterious Doris. Mantee is not the immigrant gangster; he's the quintessential, romantic desperado with an attitude, and a respect to the old-timers. Gramps loves him immediately, he's an authentic bandit, and inevitably, Mantee fascinates the hostages and there's more than Stockholm syndrome in that.There's an obvious identification between Duke and Alan, both are from the past, a vanishing breed, one by not acting enough, another by acting too much. Duke is the Yin to Alan's Yang and between them grows the genuine bonding of men who got nothing to lose, inspiring among the hostages, various reactions from various personalities, Mr. Chrisholm tries to buy his freedom as if the usual rules were still applicable. Boze tries his luck but Duke neutralizes him, he's the only to speak overtly against criminals, but while he's right in the absolute, in a life that became relative, he missed many points. Mrs. Chrisholm wants to run away with Duke, she exhorts Gabby to follow her dreams, unlike her. Duke's presence is a conscience's catalyst.Duke incarnates a sort of a new order, an escape from codes and conventions, sometimes with positive results, see how obedient the black chauffeur is, contrarily to Slim Hope, there's no segregation in gangster world since they reject everything from society, the good as the bad. And even a bad action can deliver from a bad condition. Duke will give Alan's life a meaning. Alive, he's useless, but dead, with his life insurance policy, he can build Gabby's future. After all, when Depression is caused by money, maybe money is the solution? Since people are valued through their wealth, so why not translate it into a generous sacrifice? Alan came to the end of his road to better start Gabby's. Their romance was doomed, because Gabby's happiness depended on Alan's act but for the brief time it lasted, it was magnificent.And if you don't believe it can happen, keep in mind that without Howard's insistence to have Bogart playing his part, Bogart's career would have fallen down. Bogart would be grateful for Howard, who sadly passed away during World War II, by calling his daughter Leslie. Howard was to Bogart what Duke was to Alan, what Alan was to Gabby, a life-changing blessing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most profound films of the thirties. Made from an extremely literate play by Robert Sherwood, it explores the mind of the idealist. Leslie Howard was born to play the part of the disaffected English writer. He speaks his poignant lines with conviction... Bette Davis shows her dreamy side and this film, and it's just as compelling as her bitchy aspect... and Bogart, well, this is the first film in which he really IS "Bogart". A good/bad man in an impossible situation, he is, Howard calls him, "the last great apostle of rugged individualism". SEE THIS movie! It's one of the great romances of all-time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart plays a villain who is so mean he makes Al Pacino's "Scarface" look like an altar boy. Davis is young and gorgeous in this movie, with incredible eyes...this is long before she would become the middle-aged hag with the cigarette-smokers voice. In this movie she was 28 and an absolute doll. The character played by Howard is flawless.Of special interest is the portrayal of the two blacks in this 1936 movie, long before the civil rights movement. Slim the black outlaw, offers Joseph the black chauffeur, a drink. "Here's your drink colored brother." Joseph asks his employer, "Is it all right Mister Chisolm?" Then Slim mocks Joseph and his Uncle Tom attitude and says, "Listen to him, 'Is it all right Mister Chisolm.' Ain't you heard about the big liberation? Take your drink, weasel." This is very interesting dialog for its time period, because I never knew there was a "New Liberation" (of blacks) in 1936.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The difference between living &amp; just existing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films, novels, plays sometimes explore the dimensions &amp; depths of existentialism by presenting an odd assortment of people from all walks of life both rich &amp; poor caught in existential crisis &amp; desperately searching for some kind of purpose &amp; meaning to their lives. We see this clearly in The Petrified Forest. Robert E. Sherwood's classic long running Broadway stage play in 1935. It's significant in giving stage &amp; sometimes screen actor Humphrey Bogart his first very successful major role. Night after night audiences were stunned by Bogart's performance as the notorious John Dillinger style outlaw Duke Mantee. The play was such a success that Warner Bros. acquired the property in 1936 &amp; adapted it to the big screen. Leslie Howard &amp; Bette Davis &amp; most of the other actors were asked to repeat their stage roles except for Bogart. Warners wanted Edward G. Robinson for the role of Duke Mantee but Howard insisted on Bogart or he would not do the film. The studio gave in to Leslie Howard &amp; film history was made giving Humphrey Bogart his first notable major film role. It's hard to picture anyone else for the role of Duke Mantee. This is not a gangster film it's more of a thought provoking philosophical drama of real people looking for meaning &amp; purpose &amp; dreaming of something better.The story is essentially about a wandering poet Alan Squire (Leslie Howard) aimlessly gallivanting in the desert &amp; eventually comes to a remote &amp; desolate gas station/restaurant &amp; diner named the BAR-B-Q in black mesa, Arizona. He strikes a friendship with waitress Gabrielle Maple (Bette Davis) an artist dreaming of living in France but is repressed &amp; stuck. Alan belongs to a vanishing breed of intellectuals &amp; brains without purpose &amp; is looking for something to believe in &amp; something worth living &amp; dying for. He feels obsolete in a world that no longer has a place for him. The 2 find common ground with poetry. But it's not just about these 2 characters, there is Jason Maple (Porter Hall) the proprietor who's dissatisfied with his life &amp; finds some fulfillment as a member of a patriotic group called "The Blackhorse Vigilantee's. There's Gramp Maple (Charly Grapewin) who reminisces's of the "old days" of Billy The Kid.There's the ex-football jock Boze (Dick Foran) who pumps gas. There is the rich couple Mr.&amp; Mrs. Chisholm (Paul Harvey &amp; Genevieve Tobin) who have an empty loveless marriage. And the 2 black characters Joseph the chauffeur (John Alexander) &amp; Slim (Slim Thompson) one of Duke Mantee's henchmen. Joseph the chauffeur is the familiar stereotypical servant, a yes man &amp; is subservient &amp; obedient &amp; only speaks when he is spoken to. Slim on the other hand is the complete opposite &amp; is very liberated, individual &amp; marches to the beat of his own drum &amp; is never afraid to open his mouth &amp; speak his mind. He is equal to the rest of the other "white" henchmen. Something that was not usually seen in movies in the 1930's.The film strikes a common chord &amp; most everyone can relate to these people.They all have a story to tell &amp; they all seem trapped in their own built in prisons. Even Duke Mantee, as threatening &amp; menacing &amp; frightening &amp; commanding as he is while holding the others hostage in a grip of fear he is also trapped &amp; there is a sense of doom &amp; futility about him. The only ones that seem content are Joseph, Slim &amp; Gramp Maple who admires &amp; welcomes the presence of the Duke as he sees him as some kind of a colorful character &amp; savior. Even some of the others are fascinated by him as he is the embodiment of lawlessness, individuality &amp; freedom. America always respects &amp; prizes liberty &amp; rugged individualism.As Gramp Maple says "he ain't no gangster, gangsters are foreigners he's an American". Even the rich wife Mrs. Chisholm (Genevieve Tobin)is drawn in &amp; asks the Duke to take her along as she is bored &amp; miserable with her "pillar of the mortgage loan &amp; trust" banker husband.The Duke like Squire is also obsolete as his kind of celebrated outlaw folk hero's have drawn to a close. The public had a fascination for these kind of outlaws in the 1930's like John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Ma Barker etc at a time when the banks &amp; government had failed the people. By 1936 these celebrated outlaws were being replaced by new hero's &amp; champions of law &amp; order. The interplay between Squire &amp; Mantee is interesting as they have a mutual respect &amp; seem to understand each other. Even during the violent shootout between the gangsters &amp; the police the movie still retains it's philosophical poetic stance. Leslie Howard &amp; Bette Davis are the stars but to modern audiences Bogarts philosophical gangster steals the picture. Who would you rather watch ??The Petrified Forest is a very unusual movie that embraces several elements &amp; genre's &amp; is most significant &amp; memorable for establishing Bogart's career paving the way to his eventual stardom in 1941 in "High Sierra" &amp; "The Maltese Falcon". Roy Earle, Sam Spade &amp; Rick all owe something to Duke Mantee for this is really where it all began for Humphrey Bogart. Even though he was in films since 1930 like in "Up The River". Bogart's next significant film was made the same year in "Black Legion" a social drama dealing with racism. Also directed by Archie Mayo &amp; with some of the same cast. Bogart recreated the Duke Mantee role in 1940 in a short radio broadcast &amp; also in 1955 on television. The Petrified Forest is a timeless classic philosophical drama that makes you think about what's important &amp; the difference between living life &amp; just merely existing &amp; no longer functioning. Highly recommended !</fullReview>

The acting is good all around, although I don't think the football player was that good.I have to say that I find it interesting seeing the interaction between the black characters; it was very funny and also quite ahead of it's time.Although some of the references in this film are lost to younger viewers, I still think it has held up well and certainly is worth watching even if you are not a Davis or Bogart fan per se.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure about others, but I cannot watch The Petrified Forest and not compare it with Key Largo. Beyond the obvious (Humphrey Bogart), there are several plot similarities. And while I enjoy Key Largo more overall, there are a couple of areas where I think The Petrified Forest does a better job:1. I much prefer Bogart's Duke Mantee to Edward G. Robinson's Johnny Rocco. Both may be real "baddies", but Mantee is a much darker, more effective character. His entrance is fantastic and he comes across as the cold-blooded killer he is. In contrast, I don't find Rocco quite as threatening. Sure, he's a killer, but he has some comedic touches (whether intentional or not) that take away from the character's menace. The Petrified Forest may not be a Bogart movie, but there's no doubting how effective he is.2. Bette Davis is just so good in The Petrified Forest that Laureen Bacall pales in comparison. Davis' wide-eyed, full-of-dreams innocence is perfect. I like Bacall in Key Largo, but she's not in the same league as Davis' Gabrielle Maple.I'm sure other IMDb users will write about deep, philosophical ideas behind the film's desolate setting and heart-breaking ending, but I'm pretty simple. I watch movies to be entertained. And The Petrified Forest never fails to provide entertainment. An 8/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this because I wanted to see Bogie, as Duke Mantee. I had no idea whatsoever that he wasn't the main character in this film, but the summary sounded promising enough. The film captivated my attention all throughout, and lo and behold - I fell in love with Leslie Howard. With no idea who he was, I started to fall in love with the character of Alan Squier, and as such, I ended up bawling at the ending. I do believe that he could have ended up living, but at the same time I understand why he did that. The tension throughout the whole hostage situation was very well-done, and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Bogie's character, "the last rugged apostle of individualism", as Alan puts it, was very believable as well.Bette Davis as Gabby Maple shined in her role, and her chemistry with Leslie Howard was great. The two of them together are just pure entertainment. The dialogue in this film is also brilliant, especially the way Alan talks, in a rather strange but not foreign way, and his exchanges with Duke, when he asks Duke to kill him. When Duke questions his sincerity, Alan replies, "I hope neither of us was kidding." Watch this film; you're really missing out if you don't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful story by Archie Mayo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of gangsters arrive at a roadside bar in the Arizona desert, in order to take the occupants hostage. Among the captives is a writer who remembers a strange pact with them.The argument of the Petrified Forest adapts a famous play, which premiered in early 1936 on Broadway. The plot that the film presents us to the squalid desert of Arizona where the viewer will find "Squier", a wanderer who does not set a clear course to be addressed, "Mantee" a cold criminal, cornered in a remote America instead of deeper, "Gabriela", a young dreamer who has spent most of his life at a gas station far from civilization, "the grandfather," an old man in kidnapping the last adventure they can live ... this huge cast of characters is going to be increased by a sober dialogue and some really great match ups that keeps emphasizing "Squier" with their own Mantee, two opposite personalities, but knowing the end that awaits them ..The aesthetics of this title is quite theatrical, focused on all the script above any aesthetic value. However the director does a great Archie L.Mayo address, noting especially the excellent presentation of the band "Mantee" with a flexible combination of close-ups finishing with an overview of the whole group The picture is also a very important factor in creating a warm atmosphere despite the situation, Sol Polito works with a large depth of field focused within an area ideal for developing a dramatic story. Within the division we find Humphrey Bogart, who although did not have the support of the production for the character, managed to launch his film career thanks to a perfect embodiment of "Mantee." Among the other actors / actresses we have to Leisle Howard, who manages a good performance as Bette Davis Warner new star of those days. The soundtrack only makes an appearance in marked moments of the plot, creating a tense atmosphere."The Petrified Forest" is a feature known to pose the first major role of the legendary actor H. Bogart, but without taking it into account, the viewer will find a wonderful film, with an interesting story and an ending so hopeless, that will not leave anyone indifferent.</fullReview>

He walks like an ape. Even if he is supposedly imitating Dillinger - it's weird to look at. I also enjoyed the married couples side conversations - very comical and a refreshing change from the serious situation with the gangsters. Also loved the relationship between Betty Davis' character and her new love interest- not a sappy love story at all. Very mature feelings on Leslie's character - he is pretty captivating.

		<shortDescription>Allegorical Depression-era drama is stagy but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Petrified Forest is a social allegory that's the product of the Great Depression. Although not as brutal and seemingly spontaneous as its later noir cousin, John Huston's Key Largo (1948), there's something romantic about a group of characters, plucked from the various facets of American society, who, by some inexplicable fate, come to meet in a greasy spoon in the middle of the Arizona desert where their destinies are played out.The diner is almost another dimension, separated from the America of the Great Depression. The social obligations, classes and morality of the characters are forgotten, leaving only the base substance of the human being, who yearns for love, loyalty, truth and freedom. Howard's intellectual pauper, Davis' waitress dreamer and Tobin's upper-crust snob are put on the same human level as Bogart's cold-blooded killer, and the result is the drawing out of the true personality of the individual, not the group whom the individual represents.Written for the stage, the material is naturally stagy, taking place, for the most part, in the eating area of the diner. But director Archie Mayo uses the layered staging of actors and the camera frame to create instant relationships between the various characters, as well as dimensions on the dialogue being spoken. Unfortunately in his search cinematic quality, at times he is almost forcing the lines down the our throat through the use of POV.Still, the material holds up well in spite of the dated quality, and The Petrified Forest ranks as a top-notch and literate crime drama with an eclectic cast of characters and dramatic tension that holds your attention.</fullReview>

I just kept saying, come on Duke, kill him already. Come to think of it, there were a a few unbelievable and irritating characters in this film that just made overall enjoyment of this film impossible. This is the classic example of a play trying to make the transition to the big screen and failing quite uncomfortably.

		<fullReview>PETRIFIED FOREST is a bit strange version of gangster drama. It was created based on the homonymous theater play by Robert E. Sherwood. Similarly evoked. Dramaturgy is good and all the characters are in some way dissatisfied with their lives. They are constrained to make a key step towards a goal.This version is a really good combination of forms of theater and film media. The entire drama takes place in an imaginary indoors. The concentration of people in general is shown as being slaves and closed, conditioned by the achievements of money, power and security. In one night the whole drama played out with two characteristic of men (Alan - L.Howard, and Duke - H.Bogart), which seems to have been the cornerstone orbiting ellipse society that is built on democratic foundations, the traces of legendary heroes and war triumph. The two outlaws in different roles, one is actually a poet, the other a criminal. Deep within the society is well camouflaged, tinted and prohibited frustration that we call humanity. The margins and marginal aspects are also thematic coverage. The story is interesting. It rises and falls in the dialogue.Leslie Howard as Alan Squier is a young passerby, traveler and writer who wanders aimlessly. Depressed at odds with the whole world looks for meaning that can be among other things, love and death.Bette Davis as Gabrielle Maple is a girl who dreams of romantic dreams and read poetry. Falls in love with a man who tells her exactly what she wants to hear. With him, she can escape from reality. Bette Davis is terribly charismatic.Humphrey Bogart as Duke Mantee is a gangster and a murderer on the run. In his story the women and around her all spinning. Duke has resigned. This is crucial Bogart role in his early career.Characters are in a particular vortex of frustration and self-pity. The troubles are becoming aware of each other. Seen from a philosophical point of view this is a good movie. Acting suffer a little, while Cinematography is suffering far more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Archie Mayo, The Petrified Forest was a great talky hostage thriller. I liked the setting - a caf-gas station in the middle of nowhere that serves barbecues, whiskey and beer. And I liked the characters - A lonesome waitress who dreams of studying art in France. Her parochial and small minded father. A hilarious whiskey guzzling granddad. The gas station attendant who covets her. A failed but pontificating artist. And a bunch of jailbirds who take them hostage. Leslie Howard (the talkative artist) and Humphrey Bogart (leader of the jailbirds) make a great Stockholm Syndrome pair. Their interactions and mutual admiration were very well written. Howard's character is overtly talky and some people on the message board were complaining about it, but I thought the stuff he said was very entertaining. Bette Davis was very pretty - this is one of her more demure roles. Charley Grapewin holds his own among the star cast as the energetic and morally repugnant grandpa. The writing is mostly terrific. There are some great one liners. There are references to famous writers and popular culture figures. There is some great editing like when a radio announcement about men on the run is synced with the introduction of Humphrey Bogart's and his fellow jailbirds. This film ought to be remade. Best Regards, Pimpin. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly intriguing character-driven drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredibly intriguing character-driven drama.The Petrified Forest tells the story of three disparate characters, whose lives cross paths for a brief time at a diner in the middle of the Arizona desert: a wandering philosopher, of sorts (played by Leslie Howard), a waitress (played by Bette Davis) and a gangster (played by Humphrey Bogart). There are other characters, of varying importance, but these three are a microcosm of society: the jaded pessimist, the idealist and the pragmatist, respectively.The interactions between these three are incredibly interesting, and symbolic. There is also a fair amount of action and intrigue: what will happen to all of them?Very thought-provoking.On the negative side, Leslie Howard's jaded philosopher can get overly pretentious, to the point of annoyance. He skirts the line between profundity and pretentiousness throughout the movie. His lines also make you think you're watching a play, rather than a movie.Bette Davis is delightful as the waitress: the wide-eyed zeal of her character is apparent throughout. An early-career role for Bogart - at the time he wasn't the big star he would later become - but already he shows all the traits we would know and love. Solid, swaggering, menacing performance by him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boulevard of Broken Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched The Petrified Forest I was at an unsure time in my life, fearful of the future and with my own sense of individualism and artistic ambitions. Watching Leslie Howard as Alan Squier as failed artist who eventually takes his own life so a young girl could be the artist he never was, made me fearful and depressed of what my own future held in store for me. I felt for this character to the point that it hurt because I was worried that someday I could become that character, perhaps not to that extreme but destined to a similar fate. Gabrielle (Bette Davis) Is a character is stuck in a rut and dreams of going to France. At the time when I watched this film and I was dealing with the uncertainty of if I would ever leave my hometown or would I always be stuck here. Few other films have ever had characters which spoke so directly to me.The Petrified Forest's most notable contribution to cinema is the breakthrough role of Humphrey Bogart. Bogart was never more terrifying than the role of Duke Mantee. I generally don't think of Bogart as an actor who is scary, but here he is a guy I would not want to be stuck in an elevator with. Just like the characters in the film, Bogart's acting career had been marred with failure up until this point. This likely being his final chance to make it in Hollywood no doubt must have fueled his performance. I know a film is good when I have to think and contemplate which actor (Howard of Bogart) gave the better performance. How often do you get to see gangsters and intellectuals involved in such profound conversations? Howard and Bogart play characters who are worlds apart yet develop a mutual respect for each other as they discover they share a bond with their individualism. Also look out for Bogart's head being framed over a moose head so it looks like he has antlers though out the film. Fascinating characters (all with such unique dynamics between each other) in a fascinating story is already one of the most important things I could ask for from a movie, even better when they affect me on a personal level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A miserable little service station on the edge of nowhere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Petrified Forest is directed by Archie Mayo and adapted to screenplay by Charles Kenyon and Delmer Daves from the play of the same name written by Robert E. Sherwood. It stars Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Genevieve Tobin and Dick Foran. Music is by Bernhard Kaun and cinematography by Sol Polito.Undeniably from the off you know this is adapted from a play, in fact such is the obviousness of the painted sets it's basically a play on film, but it matters not. For The Petrified Forest is an ode to language by way of vivid dialogue, a love of memorable characters, dealing out an unquenchable thirst for dreamers, loners and the regressed; and it unleashed a wonderfully primal Bogart on the masses.You bet your last dollar that it's talky and claustrophobic, joyously so, characterisations are rich and there's intelligence of thought in the writing, this is not merely a bunch of stock characters holed up in a service station, held hostage by gangster Duke Mantee (Bogart) and his gunny cohorts, each person here represents a different strand of mankind and it's fascinating stuff. Especially the contrast between Bogart's scowly criminal and Howard's disillusioned intellectual, while two polar opposite black characters also make for a clinically interesting subtext. It all builds patiently towards a socko ending, no cheating to be found here.Beautifully performed by the cast, a treat for the eyes and ears and to my mind it be required viewing for the classic film fan. 9/10</fullReview>

I kept waiting for a movie that would give him that perfect role and this is it. The plot/script and the writing is so on point!! You think of your ultimate bad guy...you visualize him in your mind and rarely does he appear on screen but that is just what happens when Bogart walks on the screen and starts to work his magic at the restaurant everybody is holed up in. Without giving too much away, Bogart is on the run and wanted. He and his crew need to meet up with the rest of the members of their gang, more specifically Bogart's love interest and the spot selected is a little restaurant off the beaten path. All they want to do is just wait things out quietly, however, they end acquiring a few hostages who make it difficult to do this....and this is when things really start to heat up!! Personally, I hate when someone starts to tell the whole movie, so I'm going to stop here and just tell you to RUN TO WHEREVER YOU HAVE TO GO TO RENT, BUY OR BORROW this one and treat yourself to The Petrified Forest it is one of the best movies ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustophobic gangster on the run drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great cast! Great script! Great set! Hammers itself into the top 100 movies of all time! Tobin, Acuff, Harvey, Sawyer all in terrific roles! Bogart shuffling across the scenes is outstanding. Bogart's poor English is excellent coaching. The viewer never knows what is about to happen next. The Denver Post newspaper prop was expertly prepared. I've watched this picture over 30 times and never become tired of the story, the filming, the direction, the character actors, the props, the diner, or the main players. Bette Davis is absolutely beautiful and is the consummate pro giving a stellar performance. Leslie Howard is well cast as the hitchhiker and certainly deserved top billing although Bogart ultimately stole the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine adaptation of Robert Sherwood play about a group of people held hostage by gangsters at a roadside diner in the Arizona desert. The terrific cast includes Howard as a failed writer, Davis as a waitress with big dreams, Grapevine as Davis's sauce-loving grandfather, and Bogart in his breakthrough role of gangster Duke Mantee. The actors work well together, with Tobin and Harvey rather amusing as the bickering rich couple (he refers to her as "my dear idiot wife"). It is is very nicely directed by Mayo. We get an early glimpse of the tough-guy persona that Bogart would parlay into super-stardom. Unfortunately it got him typecast in gangster roles for years until his star turn as a "good" gangster in "High Sierra."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is Duke Mantee, the world famous killer, and he's hungry."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you hear it said that "they don't make movies like that anymore", you can rest assured that "The Petrified Forest" fits into that category. Though set in the sparse, almost barren confines of Black Mesa, Arizona, the film comes to life with sparkling and intelligent dialog that underscores it's mission to give meaning to the lives of it's two protagonists - Allan Squier (Leslie Howard) and Gabrielle "Gabby" Maple (Bette Davis). Squier is a "tourist afoot", hiking his way across the desert to the Pacific Ocean, when he finds himself in an out of the way diner populated by it's owner Jason Maple (Porter Hall), daughter Gabby, Gramp Maple (Charley Grapewin) and an itinerant gas jockey named Boze (Dick Foran).Most will find the film's tension in the presence of escaped killer Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart), on the run from the law, and with his gang the object of the "greatest manhunt in history". Delving deeper, it's the conflicting world views expressed by Allan and wistful dreamer Gabby that deliver the film's resonance, even as the immediate life or death threat of Mantee's muscle overtakes the film's second half."There's something in me that wants something different" is Gabby's lament to Allan, he a world traveler who has given up his dreams as a writer and poet. Penniless, he seems almost trapped in a futile existence, though his brief visit to the Black Mesa Bar-B-Q will soon offer a grand moment of glory. Gabby magically and quickly finds herself head over heels in love with Allan, finding him worldly and intelligent, though to him, intelligence is "brains without purpose". Squier's presence deflates the ego of Gabby's would be boyfriend Boze, who effectively delivers the film's defining comment when viewed in retrospect - "Everybody's entitled to their own way o' thinking".With a handful of films already to his credit, Humphrey Bogart finally gets his hands on a meaty role in the figure of Duke Mantee. By the time his gang makes it's way to Black Mesa, you know he's the man in charge. So does Gramp Maple, who's prior brushes with celebrity include Billy the Kid and Samuel Clemens. Though generally not taken seriously by his diner companions, he's vindicated by the appearance of the Duke - "You can't tell a killer except by his chin". For his part, Bogey affects an odd posture, one that won't be seen again in any other film; he bows his arms across the front of his body in an almost ape like stance giving added menace to his authority.Earlier, Mantee and his cohorts hijacked the vehicle of a wealthy businessman named Chisholm (Paul Harvey). Representing industrializing America, he's everything his wife detests, hating herself for a loveless marriage and denouncing his timidity in the face of danger. As Allan and Gabby share a passionate conversation, director Archie Mayo poignantly frames their face to face encounter around the background features of Mrs. Chisholm, dramatizing the lost purpose and vitality of a woman who gave in to her family's wishes instead of her own.Ultimately, Allan Squier strikes on the one defining idea that will give his life some meaning and purpose, he will sign over his five thousand dollar life insurance policy to Gabby so she can use the proceeds to return to France to live out her artistic dream. To make it come true, Duke Mantee will have to kill Allan. Mantee has no qualms about the proposal, but has no personal quarrel with Allan and seems rather to almost enjoy his company. Squier must force the issue, so that "As long as I live, I'll be grateful to the Duke"."The Petrified Forest" covers a lot of ground, and even manages to reflect on racial constructs in the exchange between the two black men in the film. Slim Thompson is Duke's driver, but a man in his own right freely challenging and offering advice to his boss. On the other hand, Chisholm's chauffeur Joseph is typecast as the subservient employee, who has to ask permission to have a drink when offered by Slim. The scene lasts only a few seconds, but long enough for the symbolism to jump out and grab the viewer.Having just viewed "The Petrified Forest" for the fourth time, I'm even more in awe now of the film's powerful story and the director's deft use of it's principals and supporting characters. There's not a wasted moment, and every scene seems to have a purpose, even if it's a rolling tumbleweed across the desert landscape. They just don't make them like that anymore.Bette Davis made her film debut in 1931 in "The Bad Sister", a movie that also included Humphrey Bogart. The two would team up again an incredible five more times by 1939, in order - "Three On A Match", "The Petrified Forest", "Marked Woman", "Kid Galahad", and "Dark Victory". Davis was top billed each time over Bogey; oddly Bogart usually wound up in supporting roles in most of his Warner Brothers films when teamed with fellow contract players Davis, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a brooding tale of desperate characters who are brought together by fate at a desert diner. The two characters we see the most of are Gabrielle Maple (Bette Davis) and Alan Squire (Leslie Howard). Gabrielle is a dreamer working in the diner who wants to escape her tedious existence, and reads poetry to aid her fantasies. Alan, a disillusioned idealist, turns up at the diner and helps fuel her romantic illusions. The pair get an unexpected reunion when Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart) a murderous gangster, and his gang, take hostages in the diner in a bid to hide out from the law. The movie is a concoction of suspense, romanticism and philosophy, with a superb performance from Bogart as the violent, brooding Duke. The emotions and philosophies are timeless and this movie is a fond reminder of a glorious age of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is WHY We Should all Love Classic Movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis always had a unique way of really making her character. Gabby Maple (Bette Davis) is a beautiful diner waitress with big dreams of moving to France to be an artist. She works with a football player named Nick (Eddie Acuff), who is taken with her. Gabby Maple makes a statement early on about always wanting to be free. Not married, not tied down. You can see that part of her means it, and the other part of her is begging to fall in love. An "intellectual" named Alan Squier (Leslie Howard) flies in and falls in love with complicated Gabrielle Maple, who falls in love with him, and within 10 minutes of the start of the movie you see the tension and drama of a classic love triangle. It doesn't last because Alan Squier is a wanderer with no money, and hitches a ride with a wealthy couple, Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm (Genevieve Tobin &amp; Paul Harvey). The fact that Mr. Squier has no money seems only to make Gabby love him more! Gabby and Alan clearly adore one another. Each seems to be jealous of the other's life. There's a perfection about this movie that's hard to put into words. It's romantic in the word's native definition. Once Alan leaves, their car is hijacked by 3 gangsters who are on a killing spree. Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart) is the chief gangster. Humphrey Bogart's performance in this movie is fantastic. He's brought great depth to this character. He's not a heartless gangster, nor will he hesitate to kill you. He calls the women "ma'am" and you can clearly see his respect for them. As you also see his respect for the elderly in one moment where he chastises Alan for speaking poorly to Gabby's grandfather. Alan is a failed author with a failed marriage which he stole from his publisher. He remains that Gabby is the only one he's ever truly been in love with. Classic movies have a way of making a 5 minutes relationship seem like true love, despite the relationships they each had prior. The Petrified Forest is an example of this. It briefly discusses the meaning of life, and death. Death is glorified, and you see the deeper theme of a person being enlightened upon death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic desert diner drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Petrified Forest" is set in a diner in the Arizona desert, and focuses on the characters there prior to and during the take-over of the diner by a notorious killer and his gang. The film is based on a play, and it is not surprising given that all but one scene is set at the diner.Bette Davis gives a fine performance as an idealist young waitress that is enchanted by a vagabond that happens upon the diner, Alan Squier. My favorite performance of the film was from Leslie Howard as Alan Squier, the directionless, weary and philosophizing intellectual. All of the dialogue in this film was well-written, but Squier's lines are particularly eloquent and his references to books and historical figures are interesting. Humphrey Bogart is also great in his breakthrough role as Duke Mantee, the notorious killer. Mantee is gruff, controlling and at times sarcastic, but he has a slow, piercing voice and a methodical manner. The supporting performances are also of note too, particularly that of the excited grandfather often ready with invented tales.The film's premise is simple, so this film relies on its characterizations and dialogue to retain viewer interest. Both are equal to the task, the dialogue remains engaging as the characters share their innermost thoughts and the film considers American society of the time, and especially love and self-sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even without the dramatic events in the last part of the movie, it would be hard to forget this movie because of the memorable acting performances that make the characters so believable and interesting. Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart are all excellent, and the rest of the cast is very good, too.The first part of the film introduces the audience carefully to each character, mostly through their conversations. Howard, as a drifter in search of a purpose, comes into the roadside diner where Davis, the idealistic dreamer, works as a waitress. They are the center of attention, but the other characters also are part of the ongoing theme about finding meaning and value in life. Meanwhile, the gangster-on-the-loose Mantee (Bogart) is not seen, but we find out plenty about him. This first part is often somewhat stagebound, but the fine acting keeps it on track, and it is essential in setting up the more dramatic second half of the film, when Mantee and his gang take over the diner. All of the characters are part of a tense and interesting scene as they are all - including the gangsters - confronted with situations they cannot control.At times it gets rather melodramatic, at other times (early on) a bit talky, but always worth watching - "Petrified Forest" is a film to see if you appreciate good acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a treat to watch nearly 70 years after it was made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching it today, much of the film is relevant today as in the year it was made or perhaps rather when the play of Robert Sherwood was written.The swipes at the "Republic", the minorities, the "tip" in America are as relevant today as it was then. I know very little of the director, Archie Mayo, but the lines of the play have only aged as good wine.The opening crane shot is brilliant--you anticipate that the lonely man walking in the desolate land in a suit with a staff is not a hobo but a misfit and probably from a good family. Surely, that shot is Mayo's not Sherwood's. The cars that pass by have no time for him. What a prologue without a word spoken on screen!Bogart is captivating in arguably his finest performance--"Key Largo" is probably comparable. Bette Davis is equally captivating. Leslie Howard is urbane. In spite of the studio backdrops, this film has a life of its own because it combines love and goodness, through the world of a handful of misfits--gangsters, dreamers, old liars, quixotic idealists, dumb ex-sportsmen, cowards and wives who hide behind rich husbands. What a kaleidoscope! What a petrified forest of Americana! What an entertaining film! This film deserves more attention than it has received over the decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie, I remember why I love the Golden Age of cinema. The pace and action are perfectly timed, the story is perfect for the depression era audience who were captivated by tales of adventure and outlaws. The story is simple and some will say basic but it remains timeless. The actors need to carry the movie since there are very few scene changes and they are all brilliant You can see Bogart emerging into the force he will soon become. I have watched the movie a dozen times and have enjoyed it more each time. Do yourself a favor and cook up some popcorn, get a soda and prepare to watch what I believe is one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh shut up, Gramps!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart owed his successful acting career to Leslie Howard who threatened to quit the cast of this movie if the studio picked Edward G. Robinson for the role of gangster Duke Mantee as it had originally planned to do. In that case, all of us loyal Bogey fans should have named our firstborns "Leslie", as the Bogarts did in real life. Without Leslie, we wouldn't have Bogey, and that, Monsieur Rick, would have been a true tragedy.From the very start, there is an overwhelming claustrophobic feel to this stage play made for the screen, which is probably no accident. The main set is an isolated, shabby cafe in the middle of the Arizona desert. The scenery outside the window appears to be painted as if it never pretended to be anything but a stage set component. The clouds don't move. In fact, very little moves in this film except for the actors, who have the entire burden of carrying it to success with very little music, cinematography, or anything else for assistance other than a simple camera.Leslie Howard plays Alan Squier, an intellectual vagabond who doesn't even have thirty cents to his name in order to pay the cafe bill. Bette Davis portrays Gabrielle "Gabby" Maple, the waitress who serves him and who is the owner's daughter. Apparently, she doesn't meet many wandering, poetry reciting philosophers on the job because, greatly impressed, she instantly falls in love him. It's love at first sight, at least for Gabby anyway.Enter gangster-on-the-run Duke Mantee with his ruthless partners and a couple of rich folks, the Chisholms, who suddenly find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. While most Americans in 1936 have been physically and psychologically beaten by the ongoing economic depression, this couple clearly doesn't have to worry about money as much as their miserably failed marriage. In this case, money doesn't help them because Mantee takes them hostage along with all of the struggling, poor folks. Everyone in this film becomes victimized in some way or another, regardless of their socioeconomic status.The hard economic times are very much on the mind of the creators as several characters, both rich and poor, don't miss a single opportunity to criticize the inability of the federal government to protect them from hardship or evil, while others feel compelled to defend the country in general. As vulnerable hostages of merciless gangsters in the middle of the desert, there's just no predicting what words will be unloosed from their anxiety-stricken tongues, especially from Gabby's very annoying grandfather.Bogart stands out as a notorious gangster boss who is obviously tired of being constantly pursued by the authorities. His body is tense. His eyes are very cruel and very threatening. I am a fan of Eddie Robinson, but if he played the role of Mantee, as was originally planned by the studio, the character would have been a very different kind of thug. It's no surprise that this film launched the successful acting career of Humphrey Bogart as his energy, intensity, and charisma explode here, again without any assistance from fancy cinematography or a musical score. In this film, it's all about the acting, which is generally very good, but in Bogey's case it is superb.Anyway, what kind of an idiot of a father would deprive his hard working, financially disadvantaged daughter the extra income that she deserves by placing an obnoxious sign near the register that "Tipping is Un-American"? This is the same guy who pretends to be part of a tough vigilante force which more closely resembles a bunch of elementary school crossing guards running frantically from true criminals at a time when they are needed the most. As a matter of fact, considering the idiots she had as a father and a grandfather, one wonders how Gabby turned out to be such a decent, sensitive human being at all. Who could blame her French mother for having the good sense to leave her WWI groom and return to her native country at the earliest opportunity. Of course she should have taken Gabby with her, but then, alas, there wouldn't be a picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soon to be Star Discoveries in Melodrama Overload</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this film was made just a few years after motion pictures started "talking", it's a great movie thanks to budding talents of Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart. Clearly, their soon-to-be discovered star power propels the somewhat melodramatic story line. Within a few three years, all three would be superstars.Davis flits dreamily from scene to scene as a dreamy-eyed but tired, somewhat life-edgy waitress at a dump of a 'gas stop' in the middle of nowhere. Soon her life will be propelled into her dreamed-of destiny by the conflicting characters of Leslie Howard, who exudes line after line of platitudes, whimsy, and advise one can almost gag on it after awhile..thankfully Humphrey Bogart thrusts himself angrily and menacingly as a gangster on the lam running for Mexico with his cronies. The three decidedly different characters whirl around each other while the remaining cast drifts around them almost listlessly in contrast.Stellar directing clearly at work weaving the contrasting roles seamlessly. Each primary actor could easily hold court by their own talent power.Very entertaining, engaging with a titular splash of thought-stuff humming beneath the lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this years ago, when I didn't know much about anything, and I remembered it as a gripping gangster flick.This time around I realized it was about something more complex -- learning about oneself and personal evolution. Sometimes transformation occurs in the unlikeliest of locales, and here we see the possibilities unfold at the edge of a desert out West.The first to gain insight is Leslie Howard playing the kind of guy I used to adore -- the unusual man who thinks in literary and philosophical terms but is unequipped to engage in a normal relationship. The drama here enables Alan Squire to realize all that and finally give of himself to another. Bette Davis excels as the naive, artistic waif who falls for Alan's musings. She doesn't get her man but she does gain the means to finally launch herself onto a trajectory of independence. However, it's Humphrey Bogart, still six years from his "Casablanca" triumph, who surfaces as the most complex and interesting in this dusty, tumbleweed-swept tale. The killer Duke Mantee has been betrayed by an unnamed and unseen blonde but there is something in the interaction of the ensemble here that prevents him from taking everyone down along with him. "Even if she did betray you, don't commit a worse crime -- don't betray yourself!" Duke is advised. And he is able to hear. "I spent most of my time in jail and it looks like I'll spend the rest of my life dead," he says toward the end. The physical and psychological terrain of this film is a little reminiscent of a much later desert tale, "Baghdad Caf."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PETRIFIED FOREST (Warner Brothers, 1936), directed by Archie Mayo, is a faithful screen adaptation to the notable Robert E. Sherwood 1935 stage play that featured Leslie Howard, Peggy Conklin and Humphrey Bogart. For the motion picture carnation, with the names of Leslie Howard and Bette Davis above the title, it's the fifth billed Humphrey Bogart who gathers both praise and attention in a standout performance. It didn't earn him a Best Supporting Actor nomination, nor did it immediately elevate him to major leading roles, not yet, anyway. It did, however, mark the turning point of Bogey's career and a studio contract. For his first important movie role, it is Bogey, and Bogey alone, who made THE PETRIFIED FOREST from becoming another mediocre talkative stage-bound play reproduction into something worth seeing.Opening with an aerial view of Arizona's scenic location of the Petrified Forest, the camera comes to the focus on an lone unidentified drifter walking miles down a dirt road through sandy winds and dust bowls. Out in the middle of nowhere is a service station/restaurant run by Jason Maple (Porter Hall), a World War veteran and member of the Blackhawk Vigilante Committee; his daughter, Gabrielle (Bette Davis), a waitress and avid reader of Francois Villon poems; and a crusty grandfather (Charley Grapewin) from Virginia City whose much exaggerated stories amuses his linemen customers. Boz Hertzlinger (Dick Foran), a former college football hero now working as Maple's hired help attendant, is crazy about Gabrielle, but her feeling about him is far from mutual. Entering the Black Mesa Bar-B-Q is drifter, Alan Squire (Leslie Howard), who comes in for a wash up and a meal. Gabrielle, bored of her existence, becomes fascinated by this unsuccessful intellectual author with no purpose in life. Their common bond soon causes the jealous Boz to force Squire to pay up and leave. Obtaining a ride over to the next town by customers, Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm (Paul Harvey and Genevieve Tobin), chauffeured by Joseph (John Alexander), the car is stopped a mile down the road by notorious killer, Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart), and his mob, Jackie (Joseph Sawyer), Ruby (Adrian Morris) and Slim (Slim Thompson), stranded by their disabled car cluttered with bullet holes while heading for Mexico after their Oklahoma City massacre. Trading their car for the Chisholms, the gangsters drive off, leaving the victims stranded. Alan, soon followed by the Chisholms and Joseph, return by foot to the Maple place where they encounter the Mantee mob once again, this time holding everyone together at gunpoint as they get washed up and awaiting their lunch special of the day.The Arizona setting for the Petrified Forest takes no precedence as opposed to the involvement of strangers in their one day union. The story, in general, is divided into two parts. The first half hour revolves around the meeting and character study of two basic characters, played by Howard and Davis. This was their first union since OF HUMAN BONDAGE (RKO, 1934) where Davis stole the show from Howard playing a nasty, cockney waitress. Davis plays a waitress again, but this time in a more gentler mode. The second and most interesting half centers around strangers bonding together while being held hostage at gunpoint, and Grampa Maple enjoying every minute of it. Much of this point benefits greatly by sharp and intentionally funny verbal exchanges between head gangster and his "guests." The Duke Mantee character doesn't make his grand entrance until 35 minutes into the story. Prior to that, his Duke Mantee character is much discussed through spoken dialog, found on the front page of the Denver Post or through further news developments on the radio, thus, a preparation for the upcoming arrival of the notorious killer on the loose. Joseph Sawyer, one of Mantee's gunmen, recites the now famous line, "This is Duke Mantee, the world's famous killer. And he's hungry." Mantee's presence demands attention, and gets it, too, right down to Edith Chisholm (Tobin), the bored wife of a rich banker, wanting to go away with him. Though not so much in the terms of "glorifying an American gangster," it's basically on simplicity of how Mantee is portrayed. Reportedly inspired by noted mobster, John Dillinger, Bogey's mannerisms, bushy straight hair, unshaven face and tired eyes are enough to keep him in main focus, in spite the fact that Howard's Alan Squire is in nearly every frame of film. Even though Squire and Mantee are opposites in terms of mannerisms and background, their personalities indicate that they have something in common.With very limited action and underscoring, director Archie Mayo keeps the pace going through his numerous camera angles. Also of interest is the performance of two black actors, Thompson and Alexander, also from the stage play, giving natural performances as opposed to the stereotype commonly found in motion pictures of the day. Also as a reflection of the times is the sign over the counter stating "Tipping is Un-American. Keep your change." Distributed to home video in the 1980s and later DVD, THE PETRIFIED FOREST (remade by Warners in 1945 as ESCAPE IN THE DESERT with Helmut Dantine, and role reprized by Bogart in the 1955 television adaptation opposite Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda) continues to find a new audience of interest whenever shown on Turner Classic Movies. Make sure Duke Mantee doesn't leave you petrified.(***1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not Bogart's movie...it belong to Leslie Howard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film I was still a kid, and I hated the film. But that was a scratchy print on the late late show. Now, over 40 years later I watched it again with a beautiful print on TCM, and what a different viewpoint I have of the film. But I will start out with one big criticism. The artwork on the scenery is just the worst I've ever seen in any film.There are really two stories here. The first we come across is the meeting of Bette Davis (a somewhat sophisticated young lady who is stuck at her father's gas station/restaurant in eastern Arizona near the Petrified Forest) and Leslie Howard (a world traveler who plays a man who is...well, what I always think of when I see Howard...wistful). Davis is attracted to Howard because he is an intellectual, and she wants a life beyond rural Arizona.Then a wanted murderer comes to the gas station/restaurant -- Duke Mantee -- a superb role for Humphrey Bogart, although afterwards he starred or co-starred in quite a few forgettable B movies before gaining more recognition and better parts. Mantee has a different effect on the various characters. Davis seems to admire Leslie Howard all the more. Howard seems to find a destiny in an otherwise empty and unfulfilling life. Gramps is excited to meet another murderer (he had once known Billy The Kid).If you think is a Humphrey Bogart film, you're wrong, although it did bring him to Hollywood. This movie very much belongs to Leslie Howard. He is excellent, as is Davis. Bogart is, in my view, more menacing there than any of his other gangster films.There are several good supporting performances here. Genevieve Tobin is very good as the socialite. Charley Grapewin is excellent as Gramp Maple. Paul Harvey is good as the rich husband of the socialite. The worst performance here (not to mention a really dumb character) is Dick Foran as a foolish football player.Highly recommended, although I have a hunch this won't show up on many DVD shelves...it's almost too intellectual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the depression, British drifter Leslie Howard (as Alan Squier) is trapped in an Arizona desert diner with French-American poetry lover Bette Davis (as Gabrielle "Gabby" Maple), after notorious gangster Humphrey Bogart (as Duke Mantee) takes the small group of inhabitants hostage. Not bad as a staged film, but lacking adaptive skills in the motion picture medium, "The Petrified Forest" nonetheless grasps Robert E. Sherwood's words well; he beautifully captured a stifling era. There is also great star power with Mr. Howard and Mr. Bogart in their elements, and preserving stage roles. As always, Ms. Davis is at least entertaining, getting over her line "Did you ever been in love before?" Bogart's gangster persona is notably pure and unsympathetic in this early incarnation; after this, his stock rose considerably.******** The Petrified Forest (2/6/36) Archie Mayo ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Genevieve Tobin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very apparent when watching The Petrified Forest that it was designed as a stage play. Bette Davis can't seem to lower her voice to save her life and Leslie Howard, while a great actor, waxes poetic like an inebriated Lord Byron. If you can stand Davis' yelling, Howard's soliloquies, and Dick Foran's large man-breasts, grossly accentuated by his tight-fitting shirt, then you might find this to be an enjoyable little movie. Humphrey Bogart steals every scene he's in, which isn't as many as you may be led to believe. All of the film's best moments feature Bogart. If you're a Bogart fan, this is a must-see. Otherwise, unless you enjoy films of the 30's, particularly ones that seemed like filmed plays, you might want to watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Petrified Forest is Somewhat A Monument ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leslie Howard stole the show here as the philosopher-writing drifter who drifts into the lonely life of Bette Davis, a waitress with aspirations of going to Paris, in this 1936 film.Howard, who tells his tales of woe, talking about winning the war with nature and finding brief, but tragic love with Davis.As Davis's grandfather, Charley Grapewin, Uncle Henry of "The Wizard of Oz," fame brings comic relief as an old-timer obsessed with old days of Jesse James.Humphrey Bogart, as Duke, the crazed killer enters the film with his gang in taking over the diner and hurling all sorts of people into the dingy place as hostages.Frustrated with his life and wanting to give Gabrielle (Davis) an opportunity, Howard asks Duke to do something which the crazed killer complies with at film's end.This is a film of emotional turmoil, of dreaming beyond your dreams. That desert atmosphere with the gusting wind tells you what this film is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid And Menacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solid, well written film with fine performances and a menacing, breakthrough acting job by Humphrey Bogart. Set in a desolate, desert cafe in a desolate Arizona town, Bogart and his murderous, violent band of criminals hold up and hold hostage, a various assortment of people. There is an intellectual(Leslie Howard), a waitress with big aspirations(Bette Davis), a jock(Dick Foran), a vigilante(Porter Hall) and a rich, squabbling couple(Paul Harvey and Genevieve Tobin) among others. The action is limited as this is basically a filmed stage play, but the dialog crackles and is crisply delivered by the actors. Director Archie Mayo does a fine job in the film noir style creating dark, shadowy and sombre moments. He also does a great job wringing out the atmosphere as the viewer can really get the feeling that they are in this desolate cafe in the middle of nowhere with a howling wind and blowing sagebrush. The performance by Bogart is astonishing. Unshaven, menacing and brooding. He may have been the screens first truly mean and scary gangster. A fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Greats Excel in suspenseful Petrified Forest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis and Leslie Howard give classic 30's performances while Humphrey Bogart gives one for all ages around the interior of a roadside dirty spoon and filling station in the American South West. Meanwhile director Archie Mayo stays out of the way in filming what is basically a two set stage play. Based on the Sherwood Anderson Depression era play about a hostage situation and the cross section of people it brings together it's a touch dated but nearly the entire cast is flawless with Bogart's Duke Mantee holding center stage. He's one of the darkest villains in film history but by risking everything to meet up his moll becomes every bit the romantic the well versed wandering dreamer Allan Squier is. Leslie Howard is charmingly, fatalistic, Bette Davis has never been more cute and innocent and this could be 100 plus film actor Charlie Grapewin's finest performance.Interspersed between the hostage situation and the romance of the star struck lovers is a socially conscious message that mocks a rising fascism with a buffoonish para-military local group and raises questions regarding other ills plaguing the country at the time. One minor but intriguing scene between the black gang member and the very staid black chaueffeur of the wealthy hostages raises an interesting message about equality. One could argue that if they'd moved this play off the stage and given it to Milestone and his tracking obsession it might have made a finer film. It would be impossible to get better performances however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talky but pretty good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....and everyone's heard of the 'Duke Mantee' role which helped put Bogie onto the road to stardom. He is quite convincing, obviously modelled on Dillinger--sitting, glowering, pointing w/ his gun and ruling the second half of the movie as he does the BBQ w/ ease. The first half--is kinda slow and talky, w/ Foran, Davis and Howard trading jobes, dreams and stereotypical commentary back and forth 'til you really are just hoping someone comes by and pushes Howard out the door.I agree w/ the strikingly modern portrayal of Slim Thompson-seen almost as an equal in the Mantee clan as 'Jackie Cooper',( it's a better part than Sam Jackson had in Goodfellas, for example._ Contrast it w/ the Uncle Tom limo driver and you see what I mean.Porter Hall by the way looks an awful lot like Mel Blanc doesn't he? I enjoyed how these three strutting 'vigilantes' are completely at a loss when actually confronted by Mantee. That was funny.Overall an obvious talky play was the source, but it's well handled, fakey cloud painting backdrop and all.*** outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes talky, but Howard is stunning, Bogart and Davis strong, and the writing very literate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Petrified Forest (1936)To say that Leslie Howard is perfect is to explain why Petrified Forest is sometimes a great movie. It's a movie about performances in words more than deeds, and his, among the three famous leads, is the most leading. Howard's sense of ease, his struggle for meaning without getting pompous, and his understanding of the other people from the inside is truly the meat, and the potatoes, of the movie.And the play, which he starred in the previous year. The movie remains a play, set mostly in one colorful (black and white) roadside restaurant and water stop on the edge of the desert. For an action picture, it sometimes talks too much, and it lacks what you would call action. But that's because it isn't an action picture, it's a literate exploration of the end of the frontier. This is exemplified by everyone, including Howard as a footloose and heartbroken loner aptly named Alan Squire, escaping the culture of civilization in Europe for the real thing, the old wild west. And he discovers that the wild west doesn't really exist any more, and that he's a man out of step with the times.Except that for a brief moment, the past resurfaces, namely as a gangster, a true "desperado" in the form of Humphrey Bogart, representing the end of the romanticized outlaw. Like Howard's bookish romantic, Bogart's character, Duke Mantee (another great name), is out of step. And Duke knows it just as much as Alan, but his way of showing it is with grunts and violence. Still, the two men, opposites in some ways, are in the same dilemma, and they understand it, and acknowledge it in each other.The witnesses for this meeting of minds and of poetry, both fine and rough, are all characters and caricatures of various kinds--the old timer who is both funny and blind to the truth of what's happening, the rich man who is so above it all he can't take the time to be afraid, and his wife, who sees the romance of Alan's position, and who see how her own life is a tragedy. The other star, of course, is Bette Davis, still fairly new to Hollywood (just five years in) but nevertheless well established with almost thirty movies made. She shines here in a role that only demands a kind of honest and starry attitude that she nails. She might not have the more moving innocence of, say, Olivia de Haviland, she provides a more likely spark and frontier spirit, repackaged for the 1930s.The year of the movie's release was the depth of the Depression, with Roosevelt running for reelection and the American West known more for its hardship than any sense of hope. But it's now four years after the end of prohibition and the real gangsters of earlier Warner Brothers films (including Bogart as a thug, along with Davis, appearing briefly in the great pre-code 1932 film, Three on a Match) are mostly gone from real life. Likewise, the western villains like Dillinger (the model for Duke Mantee) and Ma Barker, and of course Bonnie and Clyde, were all dead by 1934 and 1935. So the play, written in 1935 by multiple-Pulitzer winner Robert Sherwood, was a timely success before being adapted for film, with Leslie Howard producing for Warner Brothers. The result was almost bound for success, and though the movie is known now mostly as Bogart's breakthrough movie (his earlier films had him typecast as a second-string villain), it is really not Bogart who dominates it, but Howard. And of course, the writing, the play itself, which sounds sometimes dated to our ears. But imagine the themes of redemption, and love, and escape (in all senses) and you can hear something powerful for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Work of Eagerness and Tenderness Amidst Peers of Its Era Which Were Poles Apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Petrified Forest is a philosophically romantic story of life in the most desolate places, hence the title. It's set in the Petrified Forest area in northern Arizona. An intellectual hitchhiker played by Trevor Howard drifts into a roadside diner run by a proud, traditionalist man, his dreamy daughter Bette Davis, and her grandfather, an old man with a lot of stories about the old days and a fascination with outlaws.When Davis's mother moved back to France when she was a young child, she felt like everything in her heart moved there with her, leaving her an empty shell of herself living with her stern, purist father. Davis reads poetry, dreams about visiting Bourges and wants to study art. But she's in a dry, dead nowhere working a tedious job and being pursued stubbornly by hunky jocks. When Howard arrives, he is so much more schooled and wise, having been all around the world, and by that mere background, he draws naturally in to conversation with strangers beyond small talk and eventually focuses in on the one fit to enter his adventurous, idealistic, strangely humble existence. That eventual focus is the character of Bette Davis, his lone waitress, out of her element, to whom he expresses interest in seeing her paintings and hearing her recite her favorite poem. To Howard, who appears to sees himself as an unsuccessful writer, she is the future and he finds her enthusiasm and optimism both endearing and revitalizing.Hurtling headlong into this nonentity of a world is Humphrey Bogart, nailing the rotten-to- the-core persona of his character, a wanted gangster, who with his gang of ruffians, holds everyone in the diner hostage. However, some of life's dead skin has been blistered and peeled back. Trevor Howard gets to the heart of exchanging stimulating words with the stoic villain of Bogart, and makes an agreement with him. With Davis out of the room by chance, Howard signs over an insurance policy to her and asks Bogie to shoot him. His rationalization is that he is of no use to a rose in need of watering like Davis if he is alive. The world simply does not seem as if to work that way. If he is dead, however, she can live her dreams.Like Howard's individualist protagonist, the film is a profound compromise. It does not settle for a film noir. It does not settle for a love story. Even involving one's subject matter with another's in the same plot may remain within one genre, one conventional environment. By not so much combining the two but rather looking both ways in perceiving an impression of the world, Robert E. Sherwood and those who adapted his play, stages a confrontation between the two outlooks, holding them up side by side and relating their shocking compatibility. That is what is very special about The Petrified Forest. For a picture made in the 1930s, it is exceptionally written and acted, a timeless work of eagerness and tenderness amidst peers which were poles apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tipping is Un-American - Keep Your Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the stage play by Robert E. Sherwood, The Petrified Forest is a character study revolving around the idea of what it means to be 'American'. Not being American myself, I have to admit that films like this often get on my nerves; but thanks to well defined characters and some great acting; the only thing that this film can be rated as is a true classic. The film takes place mostly in a gas station in the middle of the desert, and what starts out as a rather impromptu tale of romance turns into something more sinister when a gangster on the loose decides to hide out in the station, taking all of its occupant's hostage. The plot centres on the character of Alan Squier; a failed writer looking for a cause. When he happens upon the gas station, he soon notices the tragic 'desert rat', Gabrielle Maple, and it's not long before she's infatuated with his clever observations and mysterious personality. The two share a tangible link, before he decides to leave. But it's not long before he runs into the aforementioned gangster, and the tensions are revved up when they all end up back at the gas station.The sign behind the bar states that tipping isn't allowed as it's un-American. This idea is rampant throughout the film, and director Archie Mayo makes good use of the capitalist themes. The film works chiefly because its characters are so well defined, and this pays dividends later in the film when their insecurities and motives begin to surface. The film is also a great early showcase for future talent, and although he's not really the star of the film; it isn't surprising that it's Humphrey Bogart's face that adorns the front cover. Bogart is brilliant as the amoral gangster, and his character is brilliantly offset by the likes of Leslie Howard and Bette Davis. Davis would become famous for strong performances in films such as All About Eve and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, and although her part here doesn't give her that opportunity; she fits into her role well. Leslie Howard gets a little monotonous, but he portrays his character well and delivers a fine lead performance. The desert setting is apt as it conveys the isolation of the situation well and overall this is a perfectly pitched film that makes every aspect work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger at the remote, desert caf.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Petrified Forest was the movie that made Humphery Bogart a star. He plays a gangster in this.An English tourist calls for refreshments at a remote caf in the middle of the desert and falls in love with the waitress who works there. A group of three then come in and they take the tourist with them to their destination, which they never reach. Their car is hijacked by a gang of four crooks, including murderer Duke Mantee (Bogart), who is wanted all over the States. The tourist makes his own way back to the caf and the crooks are not far behind and then they go into the caf and hold everyone hostage in there to be joined by the group of three later on. Duke shoots the tourist at the end, escapes and is finally caught by the police just after.The Petrified Forest has very little, if any background music but it doesn't need it as it is gripping enough.Joning Bogie in the cast are Leslie Howard as the tourist, a young Bette Daivs as the waitress, Dick Foran and Joe Sawyer. All play excellent parts, especially Bogie.I enjoyed watching The Petrified Forest and have seen it a couple of times now. Excellent.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film featuring Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis can act. I mean really convince you of her character. Each time I see her in a film I'm more impressed by her ability to inhabit a character. This film, set in a dry, dusty, no-where village in New Mexico, is a fascinating, though flawed, movie. The setting is very strange to modern eyes. There aren't many places like this in America anymore, but they used to be common.Bette Davis does a wonderful job playing a young girl who has dreams of escape from no-where and who seems to have some talent. Humphrey is wonderful with his thoughtful, serious approach to a character who is near the end of his rope, but faces his end like a true man. This role really "made" Bogart's career. He starred in a lot of films after this one, but his performance as Duke Mantee was talked about long after his too-early death.Leslie Howard is the weak link in the movie. I don't understand his character and as a result, I didn't find him convincing as an actor in this role. Almost nothing about his story or his behavior makes sense to me. Perhaps there really were people like Leslie, shell-shocked survivors of World War I, wandering about America in search of some meaning to their lives. Frankly, I doubt it but that was a long time ago. Given that Leslie is one of the two "stars" of the film, this is a fairly serious failing and it keeps this movie from being a great film.Still, the movie is well worth watching, and when Bogart arrives on the scene, you can see why he became one of Hollywood's greatest stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Leslie Howard's finest work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Leslie Howard but THE PETRIFIED FOREST is his best film, in my book.He was great in THE 49th PARALLEL and OF HUMAN BONDAGE, and he's great here too. In this film, he is a lazy writer gone awry, trying to live out his dreams in Bette Davis' character (who is a painter).In a way, he's totally opposite of Humphrey Bogart's Duke Mantee character, and the dichotomy really is the justification of 'classic' given to this film.Bogart's and Davis' performances are just average in this film - although at the time of the release, this was Bogart's best film. I think the old man - Charley Grapewin - and Genevieve Tobin (as Mrs. Chisholm) do a great job with their small parts. Tobin is also a very attractive lady! I enjoyed the banter between the two drivers as well, both African-Americans cast in a "white" movie at WB in '36. It's a shame they weren't given larger roles.Talky and melodramatic - and certainly unbelievable (the middle-of-nowhere desert gas station is almost always FULL of people, for starters), this stagy, yet classic film is not for everyone. Your kids will hate this film. But to me - this is good stuff. This **is** prototypical 1930's cinema.</fullReview>

A man strung out on life, and willing to take others with him when John Law catches up with his band.An aspiring writer, an ex all-American, a wealthy couple with an African-American driver and body guard, a waitress who feels trapped in her desert job, soldier wannabes, and sundry other characters. Bad guys are revealed, even amongst the captives. We see their inner thoughts as well as their worst and best get drawn out into the open.The action is spartan, and is kept mostly for the finale. Otherwise we have a dialog driven script with a few physical flourishes. If you're into "classic" films, then give this one a shot. It might entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Sherwood's ornate, excessive play about gangsters who hole up in a caf in the middle of the Arizona desert makes for a decent showcase for the actors. Adapted by Charles Kenyon and future filmmaker Delmer Daves, it's a solid, worthwhile treatment, directed by Archie Mayo in a fast, straightforward fashion. Most of the acting is terrific, with Humphrey Bogart recreating his Broadway turn as bitter, hardened Duke Mantee, lending the movie a gritty undermining which is still fresh today. Among the disparate band of hostages are penniless foreigner Leslie Howard and waitress Bette Davis (looking lovely). Howard's fey preciousness is a deterrent to the melodrama (his poetic longings are supposed to set female hearts aflutter, and perhaps they did at one time). Remade in 1945 as "Escape in the Desert". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Unusual and somewhat bizarre 1930's gangster flick involving this off the wall traveling philosopher Alan Squier, Leslie Howard, who's hiking across America to see the sights and find out with what it's, life I guess, really all about.Hiking through the Arizona Desert with his backpack Alan drops it at the out of the way, 200 miles from the nearest town, friendly Black Mesa Bar-B-Q Diner &amp; Gas Station to get some grub to eat and finds pretty Gabrielle "Gabby" Maple, Bette Davis, behind the counter. It doesn't take long for sparks to fly between the two total strangers with Gabby, being half Frech herself, going completely gaga over Alan's vast knowledge of European, mostly French, literature. As things soon turn out the handyman at the diner Boze, Dick Foran, didn't take too kindly in that Alan, a perfect stranger, was getting in on with Gabby whom he was crazy about and couldn't even get to first base with. This all of course changed when Alan who was so poor he could't pay the .30 for his meal was given a free ride, at Gabby's insistence, to nearest place of human habitation the the Phoenix Palace Hotel by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Chisholm, Paul Harvey &amp; Genevieve Tobin, who just happened to drop in by limousine at the diner to get gas. It's then that the action, that was totally lacking in the film up to that point, starts with fugitive bank robber and killer Duke Mantee, Humphrey Bogart, showing up on the scene-after knocking off a bank in Oklahoma City-with his gang of murderous cut throats. The Mantee Gang end up carjacking the Chisholm's car leaving then as well as Alan and their chauffeur Joseph, John Alexander, out in the cold cruel Arizona desert.Making his way back to Gabby's place Alan finds that Mantee and his gang are already there and that's when he gets involved in an intellectually sparring match with the cold blooded gangster Duke Mantee. Not being an intellectual himself Mantee begins to feel that Alan, who seems to be totally unafraid of him, in his half baked theories about life death and what existence is all about is either pulling his leg or is suffering from a serious case of sun stroke!***SPOILERS*** Alan who we already knew, from his previous ravings and rantings, was a bit off the wall to begin with starts to dare Mantee to plug, or shoot, him so he can finally both see the light, in if there is in fact a life after death, as well as get out of the cruel predicament that fate had handed him: A man without hope who was descant to wander the earth without any meaning or purpose in life. Mantee seemed to enjoy Alan's crackpot philosophy for a while but when the local posse surrounded the diner he soon came to realize that Alan, in keeping him there with his philosophical sermonizing, kept him from checking out and crossing the border into Mexico before the police or posse arrived!A bit of a letdown in the movie's ending with Duke Mantee getting all that's coming to him but off camera and Alan also getting his wish as a going away present from the "Duke". As for Gabby she ended up losing Alan but did get his insurance policy made out to her for $5,000.00 so she can finally visit France and find her roots, descendent's not hair, there.</fullReview>

Everything that other users have said about the overacting, wordiness, exaggerated characterizations, etc. is true, but somehow it still works and produces an enjoyable movie.Bogie is fabulous as always (although he does hold his arms a bit like a primate when he walks), Leslie Howard is playing the watery romantic that Leslie Howard does best, Bette Davis's face actually doesn't frighten me for once (no offense Bette Davis fans, she's a great actress, but I first saw her in "The Nanny" and that is how I will always remember her). The plot is a little outlandish, but if you don't take it literally (good-for-nothing artist meets waitress and a couple of hours later asks to be shot so that she can take a trip to France) but more figuratively (disillusioned man is willing to sacrifice everything so that someone he loves can fulfill her dreams) it is more poignant.

Caught in the middle of this age old story is a young Bette Davis, who in the course of hours learns to love the "hero", never stopping to despise the evil enemy.The setting is a diner, suddenly held-up by Bogart, who eventually shoots and kills the kindly Howard who 'dared' to stand up to the bully (mainly to protect Davis). The helpless waitress (with the universal 'dream' to get away and make a better life for herself), sees the crisis as a 'sign'. Before dying, Howard makes Davis the sole benefitiary of a modest insurance policy, which Davis tearfully accepts.This film lives on in Cinema History as one of the true classics of all time. The transition from stage to silver screen was successful, especially when considering that the story was made available to a much greater audience. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie version of Robert Sherwood's play, The Petrified Forest, is an oddity. An outstanding, maybe even great film derived from a basically second rate work. Archie Mayo directs splendidly this story of a poet-drifter who (literally) walks into an eatery in the Arizona desert, where he runs into a desperate, Dillingeresque bad guy who holds him hostage, and in the course of his captivity falls in love with a very naive young woman. Much of the dialogue is dated (though clever) and is written in the faux-Lost Generation style popular in Broadway plays of the twenties and thirties, which is to say there are hints of Fitzgerald and Hemingway in the attitudes expressed, but little of their artistry and originality. As the drifter, sensitive, pipe-smoking Leslie Howard has never been better or better cast; one almost suspects that the role was written for him. Humphrey Bogart, in his first good movie role, is appropriately menacing; he looks remarkably like John Dillinger, and shows even at this stage of his career much of the charm and charisma that later propelled him to superstardom. Watch him closely: he more than holds his own with Howard. Bette Davis is somewhat silly as the love interest; this was not a good part for her. There are no demons for her to unleash in this shy school-girl, and she seems at a loss as to how to play her. The supporting cast is superb, down to the smallest bit player. Mayo and Company worked wonders with the desert set, with its cacti, tumbleweeds and air of rustling menace. We know it's not a real desert, but it doesn't matter; the state of mind is all. This is how the real desert would feel in the mind of such a man as Howard plays, and this is all that matters. The shack-like eatery, with its blinking barbeque sign, is a great creation; with its creaking floorboards and dry as sand tables and chairs, one can almost smell the chili. Also, the transition from day to night is exceedingly well done and quite subtle; it just happens. You know it's dark outside without actually having to see the darkness just beyond the door. The feeling of stars and huge sky above is conveyed by dialogue only and is yet palpable nonetheless; there in spirit if not fact. Inside, the claustrophobia is well-managed; even with several camera shifts there is a strong sense of confinemnt in the film. Mayo did a better job here, with this threadbare, wildly ambitious play, than Wyler ever did with much better material, and I'm not sure why. Mayo's career drifted downward in the late thirties and forties, and of his later work the less said the better. But in 1936 he proved that with great actors, outstanding cameramen and art directors, small miracles could be wrought right on the Warner Brothers back lot, and for a while at least the desert bloomed.</fullReview>

So, his motivation seems more consistent with the dislocation of traditional religious and secular values generated by the Victorian era's Darwinism. I see Spier as more akin to Thomas Hardy's world than to Ernest Hemingway. And, he is more akin philosophically to the post WW11 European existentialists than to the (post WW1) Lost Generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting drama-crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have three interesting famous artists of all-time cinema, charming Bette Davis, polite and educated Leslie Howard with his English accent, and a terrible Humphrey Bogart as the villain of the film. Howard was an open poem, while Bette felt in love with him, but Bogart (Duke Mantee) came to continue his devastating activity. The Bogart's movements were somewhat different to his usual ones, and he was as terrible as Cagney in "Public Enemy" or Edward G. Robinson in "Little Caesar". It is my understanding that the film tried to demonstrate that smart sentences may be the best way to face a criminal. Normally those gangsters are unable to understand why their lives are so spoiled or why they behave in that way, so with a bit of smartly said words- and that's what Howard did with Bogart- the criminal may reflect a bit of what he is doing or may become lost in his misdemeanours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie which takes place in a world where the government is just a gangsters' joke, nature is balking against the intellectuals' attempt to tame it, and love is best represented by sacrifice. Fine performances by Leslie Howard, a young Bette Davis and of course, HB, who became nationally recognized after this film. Bogie plays the gangster Duke Mantee who has a dead look in his eye and nothing to lose. If you can get past the talky dialogue to the action after Mantee's entrance, you definitely won't be disappointed. One of Bogie's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few actors fill the hype their character is given.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top notch performances from the leads single this out among gangster films of its day as a classic. Howard had to lobby hard to keep Bogart his stage role, for which we should be grateful. While the film still shows its stage origins, it works for the claustrophobic atmosphere to keep locations to a minimum. Furthermore, it was stage dramas like this and Dead End which helped the gangster film bounce back from the censorship that followed Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Without films like this, we'd have had no Angels With Dirty Faces or Roaring Twenties.Bogarts' arrival on scene is a killer, especially considering he's been so well hyped throughout - all we've heard about is how dangerous Duke Mantee is. And the theme of the 'artist' or sensitive type holed up with gangsters is now legendary - reworked in films as diverse as Performance, but perhaps best with Bogart (again) as the good-guy in Key Largo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At first look an oil station for the talking's about Oklahoma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The petrified forest" (1936) directed by Archie Mayo astonishingly and seduces everybody quite cozy concerning a bar restaurant in an oil station, because Gabrielle the daughter of the absent owner and Alan a pedestrian adventurer loving each other almost at first look and this for ever. The competitive attraction that the girl provokes in another potential boyfriend, get any effect in the story itself since almost from the beginning in its compassing development written by Delmer Daves, where there is as promotion for the place of the owner the possibility that the girl maybe one day will marry the employee of the oil station, a guy that likes sport and is enough in his ground to menace someone like an intruder in heart's affair, like the fellow coming in without money for paying the bill of sandwiches. When rarely poetry was a subject of lack of inaction near a kind of adapted stage - as though also it was like an old penny station for changing horses during the mail transfer, waiting for Indians or bandits - by the studio as oil station and bar near the desert, where things happened between dust and wind, behind the windows, terrifying anybody who scares out of law mingled in a love affair with a kiss that provokes a turnabout on a glass of water. This movie is a dissertation about everything as strategy of group inside a closed space and the characters are obliged to take part in a brainstorm. It's all America seen by a foreigner and Oklahoma was on front page because it was like that since then. Leslie Howard acting as the poet has shining moments in his performance, when even an insurance life is the guarantee for the girl heritage if he will be fallen out by the bullets. There are many symbols in this movie made by Archie Mayo like a rainbow before the tempest and intuitively that small stone - which means the title - is there on the hands of the girl, performed by an unique Bette Davis at the time, where geology and philosophy nonetheless it were very unknown locally so far as well as history before the Indians near Monument Valley and religion importations, linking artificially science with desperation for the future. The set of representative characters from each social category is so much well distributed, inside the fluctuation's feeling of this group on such a stage, outside of a town and near a desert, that took the viewers for the anathemas of the time, in such a way as the free speech without having a pistol pointed straight away to the brains. As further it happens between the main rivals here, the conscious chief of the bandits and the idealist poet as representative of the human beings there, as soul of the desperation lavish style of conflict. It's a rare movie and that makes a date and meaning in it immortality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dated dialog and the controlled confinement of a play is suicide, with no payoff for modern moviegoers. The attraction of two superstars and one other star cannot save this from being a melodramatic, melancholy, misfire not only by today's standards but the verbiage probably started to fossilize before the patrons left the play, even in the thirties. It is so over written and corny that even depression era dreamers could see through the silver lining in this clunky cloud.This is as dusty as it gets and can really only be enjoyed by film and social historians as a slice of literary and cultural pop. Like today, this is what the public was offered. An empty, pretentious, commercially driven deterrent to the woes of the day. It was wrapped in plastic and sold, but did not cure the neurosis ("nature has unleashed") and was a placebo at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual and outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Petrified Forest" at the time of this review is 71 years old. It has some painted outdoor sets, a very young, pretty Bette Davis, with Humphrey Bogart and Leslie Howard repeating their stage roles as, respectively, a Dillinger type criminal and an idealistic dreamer. It's less a film than a filmed play - and it's obviously a play, by Robert Sherwood. And guess what, it holds up with some wonderful acting and surprisingly refreshing themes.Davis is Gaby Maple, who works in the desert caf owned by her grandfather. It's there that she waits on Alan, who speaks loftily and listens to her dreams of leaving the hated Arizona desert, joining her mother in France and becoming an artist. In a short time, they fall for one another, but Alan has to move on. He hitches a ride with a wealthy man and his wife, the Chisholms, but on the way out of the desert, they run into the escaped murderer Duke Mantee and his gang, whose car has broken down. They steal the Henderson's car. While their chauffeur is attempting to fix the Mantee vehicle, Alan realizes that Duke and the gang are heading toward the caf, and he walks back there. There, Duke holds everyone hostage, including the returning Chisholms, during which time, Alan comes to an important decision about Gaby, himself, and what his life means.The film has two unusual aspects, the first being the surprising treatment of the black characters. One of the black men is part of Duke's gang and an equal member of it. When the chauffeur asks his boss if it's okay to have a drink, the gang member scoffs at his subservience. "Haven't you heard about the new liberation?" he asks him, shoving a drink in his hand. The second aspect is Mrs. Henderson's feminist counseling of Gaby. Mrs. Henderson urges Gaby not to suppress her dreams for someone else, in this case her grandfather, but to become an individual and know who she is and what she wants. She explains that she was in Europe and offered a stage role by the great Max Reinhardt, but acquiesced to her parents when they demanded she return to the states. She is now unhappily married to a selfish man and has no identity of her own. This is 1936, and acquiescing to what one's family expected of you and losing yourself in your husband's identity went on long, long after that.Unlike today's films, "The Petrified Forest" is rich in dialogue with only a few action scenes. Nevertheless, it holds one's interest due to acting and wonderful atmosphere of this broken-down caf with the wind whipping outside.With his finely drawn, handsome features and British accent, Leslie Howard excelled at playing dreamers and philosophers, culminating in his role as Ashley Wilkes in "Gone With the Wind." As Alan, he's above it all, speaking of poetry and art to the wide-eyed Gaby and throwing even Duke Mantee off-balance. Mantee was Bogart's breakout film role, and he's fantastic. He studied John Dillinger's mannerisms to prepare for his stage role. Here he's fierce and angry as a man who knows he hasn't got a chance in hell of making it to Mexico but he's going to go down fighting. As Gaby, Davis conveys the character's fantasies, hope for the future, naive ambition, and love for Alan. Neither one of them belong in the desert, but while Alan is through with life's struggles, and Duke knows he's about to be through, Gaby is looking forward to them. Like the gas jockey who's in love with her (Dick Foran) she's willing to take risks for what she wants. Mr. Chisholm, the fat cat, just hopes nothing upsets his status quo. Mrs. Chisholm is stuck but vicariously roots not only for Gaby but Duke and Alan.Allegorical in its themes, with no special effects, "The Petrified Forest," its title referring to the nearby dead forest where several characters are figuratively heading, is a real treat for lovers of classic film, classic actors, and our country's history of depression and classism. I treasured every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having *just* watched it I'm not sure if 'The Petrified Forest' is a crime thriller, a melodrama, or a comedy. I do know that I laughed all the way through it. The writing is sharp and oddly convincing despite an obvious written-for-the-stage sheen.Every line that Bogart spits out is a gem, he's virtually radioactive, you can feel his angst through your screen. Leslie Howard and Bette Davis are also very good. Especially hilarious is the interplay between Howard, the wordy, cynical, romantic, failed novelist, and Bogart's terse, mad-dog, killer.The DVD I saw comes with a news reel from 1936 that drives home the fact that this story was very much "ripped from the headlines" and most likely the contemporary audience didn't watch it with the same ear-to-ear grin that I wore, but it really is desperately funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Petrified Forest - what that title means, aside from its actual geographic location, I'm not sure. It's about a little bar on the outskirts of civilization (Arizona or New Mexico) where its run by an old man and his daughter or granddaughter (Bette Davis) who keeps getting courted by a football veteran. Enter Alan Squier (Leslie Howard) who has those "book-smarts" and has been around to places like Paris and wrote a book but is now at a crossroads in his life - just the moment to meet a very curious-minded girl like Gabrielle, who, as happens in movies of the period, gets smitten with the guy immediately.There's a snag when a notorious gangster, Duke Mantee (Bogart), has to hold up at the bar with his fellow gangsters and holds everybody hostage while they wait. This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.This is one of those "talky" movies- meaning very little in the way of action or for ways of Archie Mayo, the director, to try his hand at any special maneuvers with the lens- but it's a good one, and has some challenging little bits from the period. It turns into one of those interesting microcosms that we see sometimes in stage plays or in movies, where a group of people who usually would just say hello/goodbye and be on their way (if that) are thrown together: a smart guy like Alan who becomes heroic after imbibing a few dozen shots; a gruff gangster like Mantee who talks in a way (and by Bogart's performance) where you're not sure what's sarcastic or real; Gabrielle as the girl who two guys are pining for and is not sure what she'll do.Then there's the arrogant jock who ends up getting shot, and the rich couple who have their own sort of long-time-married camaraderie that's mildly amusing. There's even a moment I wasn't expecting where the black gangster in Mantee's group gives some lip to the rich couple's chauffeur for being so "yes, ma'am" and not standing up for himself. Black power in 1936, who knew?! This is not a great movie really by any stretch, and despite a strong climax it ends up getting deflated somewhat from a last-minute obvious note on the getaway of the gangsters that seems very Hayes-code inspired (ambiguity would've benefited, frankly). But the performances make it something of a must-see, with the three leads of Howard and Davis and especially Bogart a great trio to bounce off of one another.While it was another payday for Howard and Davis, both very charming here, this was Bogart's big break (albeit it would be a while before he could shake his bad-guy act in his roles) and he takes it on for all its worth. Just watch him in that scene where he finds out his other gangster pals and his girl have been arrested and his girl may have squealed and he's "gotta think." It's priceless. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Petrified Forest is Bogart's first credited screen performance,and was based on the infamous John Dillinger. Bogie's mannerisms and facial quirks were deliberately copied from watching footage of Dillinger for an uncanny, almost mesmerizing persona.Alan, played to perfection by the great English actor Leslie Howard, who is better remembered as 'The Scarlet Pimpernel", represents the disillusioned post WWI idealist who perceives the rise of evil forces in Europe and has decided to end his life in the Petrified forest. The complex interaction between Alan and Duke Mantee,with the love interest of Bette Davis as the innocent dreamer as a contrast to the calculating nature of the other players adds up to a first rate "existential" crime drama in a crisp 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worth watching--once--mainly because of the role that would typecast Bogie as a gangster for the next five years (though his performance, like the others, is merely adequate), this stage-play-on-film is otherwise a piece of pseudo-intellectual hackwork. The only character who displays physical courage is a fool, the only character who has managed to make something of himself is a scoundrel, and the only character who makes an effort to see that the laws are enforced is both. Maybe this is what passed for clever in the 1930s. Come to think of it, it would probably pass for clever today.But let's face it, the real problem is Alan Squier, a self-proclaimed "intellectual" who never says anything remotely intelligent. He goes into ecstasies over the supposed qualities of Bette Davis's character, yet at no point do we see anything to justify his raptures. I mean, she's a pretty girl and all, but I'm not sure why that qualifies her as "another Joan of Arc." Squier is a moony college sophomore stuck in the body of a middle-aged man. He's pathetic.Yet we're clearly supposed to admire the man--or at least find him interesting--which is sad and alarming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie - but with 3 Great Actors its worth the viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, the plot and silly dialogue of a lot of the movie was a little too sentimental and rambling. But I do still feel that the 3 principle players - Davis, Howard &amp; Bogart - all deliver fine performances in what they had to work with in this film adapted play.This is quite a different role than what Davis became known for, so it was nice to see her in a different light and I think she played it well and was believable. I find it odd, but Davis reminds me of Susan Sarandon here?! Maybe its just the eyes, but I've never noticed a resemblance before.Howard seems to play this very similar in mood to his Ashley Wilkes performance in Gone With the Wind (which comes 3 years after this movie in 1939). Both characters seem similar in that they are dreamers that don't seem to fit in well with the times in which they live. I haven't seen many other Howard films so I wonder is he always cast as the bumbling, dreamer-idiot? But again, I find him believable and honest in his emotions.Bogart is classic Bogie in this early role that finally gets him noticed. I think he does more than hold his own amongst the other 2 big stars.If you can get past all the romantic dribble between Howard and Davis, it is still a good movie to see all 3 of these stars fairly early (with the exception of Howard, perhaps)in their careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagy and dated, perhaps worth seeing for historical reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of this story takes place in a small caf in the middle of nowhere in Arizona. The caf is run by Gabrielle Maple (Bette Davis), Gabrielle's Father Jason (Porter Hall), and Boze Hertzlinger (Dick Foran). Gabrielle yearns to go to France where she can develop her artistic talent. Boze is an ex-footballer who is trying to put the moves on Gabrielle. Charley Grapewin plays Gabrielle's grandfather as an old coot whose inane shenanigans got on my nerves very early on. Into the caf comes Alan Squier (Leslie Howard), a penniless vagabond with a a philosophical bent. I suspected I was going to be in for some pretentious prattle when Squier makes the comment, "I belong to a vanishing race. I'm one of the intellectuals." I was right. Squier goes on and on mooning about fighting nature and how he cannot find anything to make life worth living, until he falls for Gabrielle.Into this mix comes Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart, in a role modeled after John Dillinger) and his gang. Duke is on the lam and has designated the caf as where he will meet up with others, including a love interest. I felt that Bette Davis was miscast as the naive young girl and she tries too hard to act the part. Bogart proves he can act the tough guy, mainly by sitting in a chair, looking menacing, and using his husky voice to maximal effect. He shows no sign of the subtle abilities on display in some of his latter films such as "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen."This is primarily the filming of a play, complete with painted backdrops.Improbabilities abound. For example, Squier shows up after having been walking ten miles in the Arizona sun wearing a heavy coat and tie--I think he would have been a little more disheveled than he was when he appears at the caf. Mantee is able to shoot the rifle out of Boze's hand only inflicting a minor wound? And so on.There are some interesting themes broached briefly. One of the gang members is black and mocks a black chauffeur (whom he calls a colored brother) when the chauffeur is being deferential to his employer. Gabrielle wants to escape her isolated existence and another woman admits to having been dominated and repressed by her husband and offers to leave with Mantee no less (did I mention improbabilities).Perhaps it is not fair to judge this film by modern standards, but there were movies made in 1936 that have stood the test of time, for example "Modern Times" and "Dodsworth." For me, "The Petrified Forest" is too dated and claustrophobic to appreciate more than as movie history.Yes, there was "Apache beer" brewed in Arizona in 1936.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half is interesting and well done, but halfway onwards the film gradually disintegrates; awfully na?ve-sounding 30s-style dialog and stereotyped characterizations pervade. The film is reduced to a collection of awkward exchanges between the characters. The dialog is rather crude for something that used to be a play, and it even sounds outright silly occasionally. The gangsters behave just like the way you'd expect them to in a 30s (B-) movie; they grimace, they posture, and they act like comic-book figures. Bogart so overdoes his bad-guy mugging (particularly in his first scenes) that he appears not as a gang-leader but as a caricature of one. Howard is easily the best cast member, but then again he is practically the only one who doesn't get silly dialog.Why don't Bogart and his gang immediately use their prisoners as hostages once they are attacked by police? Bogart not only doesn't do this - he actually tells all of them to lie down so that they won't get shot! For a hardcore gangster/mass murderer he sure seems to care a lot for the safety of his fellow man! The setting is good, but this entire endeavor should have been treated with more subtlety and less clichs. The film is totally dated. A little bit more staleness and it would have had unintentional humour in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blathering Leslie Howard avoids death (in this movie) - for too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How was it that 3 of the screen's greatest icons gathered together - for so comparatively little effect? The basic story - and one of the stars (Bogart) - was served up a second time to much greater effect in John Huston's "Key Largo" ten years or so later. And Leslie Howard was to essentially repeat the character and performance quite a few times (romantic dreamer, surprisingly adept and cool under fire). Other films though gave him other, indeed coherent sentences to speak. Here in the face of so much blather, stony-hearted villain (Bogart) turns out to be surprisingly humane in indulging the Howard character's lengthy and rather pointless (intended to appear deep and meaningful?), musings. Nearly 40 minutes of this passes before the arrival of the slightly pantomime villain Bogart - nevertheless a powerful and striking performance - only then does the action start. I'm not sure that if I had been present with a loaded weapon and listened to this amount of blather I could have exercised such self-control. Perhaps with hindsight (this was 1936) the much bigger events which were to soon after swamp people's attentions rendered such musings irrelevant and pointless. Then, at least, a dreamy daffy seemingly artistic-intellectual Englishman was cut an awful lot of slack by American audiences - God Bless 'Em for that. Guess that Hugh Grant is proof of an enduring soft spot for the sensitive intelligent self-deprecating English toff.Bette Davis did an excellent job but was not quite convincing playing a besotted and submissive young woman. Or perhaps, again with hindsight, we now know her too well to imagine her as such.I looked at my watch several times during the first 40 minutes. For some reason what might have been a rip-roaring stage play turned into a slow burning fuse with a disappointing pop at the end. What was the point to this otherwise melodramatic fandango? Not in the Howard character but in the heavily drawn portrayals of wealth vs poverty, also race especially the comic exchange between the two black characters finding themselves united in colour but utterly divided on their attitudes to privilege. Perhaps this is where its heart lay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gave Bogart his foot in the movies but Howard and Davis are center stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart's breakthrough performance has probably been mentioned in thousands of documentaries on film and he does a very good job although his part is somewhat limited. His main objective is to look weary and occasionally menacing while Leslie Howard recites lines that sounds exactly like written poems. To say that Leslie Howard looks like a drifter would be gross exaggeration and for that matter Bette Davis looks nothing like a waitress in a roadside diner. And that is exactly why we buy this worn out premise of "love at first sight" which is the main theme of this film. Had it been a guy who looked like one of the other male characters, Boze, it probably wouldn't have had the same impact.Besides this, the film itself is really not much more than the play it was developed from and that's okay. It was probably a big hit in the 30's because of the social subtext it contained and it covers pretty much all the bases here; the depression's impact, dividing the gap between rich vs. poor and how it turned a man like Bogie's character (modeled after John Dillinger) into a folk hero by many instead of the criminal he was.Like most 30's movies the pace of this movie is a little slow because of the infant sound medium in film and to say this is a thrilling experience is far from the truth. Still it stands as a moderately entertaining look back at a time when things weren't that great and when you get three actors like Howard, Bogie and Davis in the same movie, how can it be all bad. Davis does lay it on a little thick trying to be angelic (she did it again in Dark Victory) and Bogie was far from the powerhouse player he later became but all that aside, this is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, Pseudo-Intellectual Filmed Play Saved By Bogart's Presence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less a "gangster film" than a filmed play, THE PETRIFIED FOREST is a decent film with interesting performances, yet not a great film. Sherwood's play unfortunately has not stood the test of time very well, ans is severely hampered by the pompous, pretentious "intellectualism" of the male protagonist, Alan Squire (Leslie Howard).The film opens with Howard, dressed absurdly in a floppy hat and baggy trousers in a vague attempt to make him look like a true "drifter", landing in at a caf somewhere near the Sierra Nevada mountain range. There he meets Gabrielle Maple (Bette Davis), a dreamy young woman who weeps over poetry whilst serving up counter-meals and resisting the pawing of a tight-shirted, football-obsessed gas station attendant. The opening thirty-five minutes basically revolves around Howard musing about his life's struggle as an "intellectual" and Davis mooning over the contrived clap-trap that endlessly comes out of Howard's mouth. The first half-hour is achingly slow, with the film "rescued" (an oxymoron, indeed)by the arrival of Humphrey Bogart as Duke Mantee, the "famous killer", who is on the run from police.One could almost forgive the unbelievable premise (a caf situated in the desert that just happens to be always full of customers?), the wordiness of Sherwood's play and the limitations of the sound-stage set if only for Howard's character. Don't get me wrong, Howard was a wonderful actor who gave great performances in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, OF HUMAN BONDAGE and PYGMALION, and he does his best here, yet is character is so phony and repellent that you just really want Bogie to pump him full of lead. All we get from Alan Squire is silliness masquerading as poetry- the ending, in which Alan "sacrifices" himself for Davis' character, is meant to be full of poetic heroism. It's not. It's as awfully contrived as any of his (unintentionally hilarious) poignant speeches on the "human condition".Davis is saddled with exactly the sort of role she hated- subservient to the male lead, moony and teary-eyed. She had starred with Howard a year earlier in OF HUMAN BONDAGE, yet is a world away from her Cockney slut Mildred Rogers (Davis chooses to love Howard in this one instead of abuse the hell out of him). Davis, as always, is terrific to watch yet this is not among her best efforts. Sure, she gives it her all but her character, like Howard's, is just so repellent that you just want to slap some sense into her. Bette would move onto better things in a couple of years, with JEZEBEL winning her an Oscar and propelling her star into greatness.Bogart gives the best performance of the picture as Mantee. His gangster is obviously heavily based on John Dillinger (Bogart actually studied his movement and gestures when creating his character). Bogie looks as if he is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders as he slouches heavily into the caf. Bogart is far removed from the screen persona he would adopt in THE MALTESE FALCON and HIGH SIERRA- here he is heavy, unshaven, has little dialogue (spoken in either a bark or a long drawl) and is uneasy. Yet he is compelling in the role. His star presence is such that you really can't take your eyes off him. He steals the show as Mantee in THE PETRIFIED FOREST so much that at the end of the film you are rooting for Bogart, and cheering that Howard has been plugged.Unfortunately it would be a false dawn for Bogart-while THE PETRIFIED FOREST did indeed make him a star (and forever banished the tennis-playing,light image he previously had), he soon found himself playing supporting roles to Cagney and Robinson. Bogart became a guy good for a few tough moments and snappy lines in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES and THE ROARING TWENTIES, yet he would be killed off half-way through. That all changed in 1941 when he played sympathetic outlaw Roy Earle in HIGH SIERRA. Bogart was never second-billed after that film and he established a niche for himself in Hollywood with his distinct "Bogart persona". THE PETRIFIED FOREST is not without it's virtues. It offers a fascinating Bogart performance, two very good actors in Davis and Howard, a competent script (well, apart from all the dribble Howard recites) and direction, and that uniquely gritty Warner Brothers atmosphere that bespoke the hardness and bleakness of 1930's Depression-era America. It isn't a great of the cinema- yet it is an interesting watch.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wordy stage play translates poorly to the big screen . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . in a piece that looks ultra low-budget, and rings as false as an Enron stock prospectus. Ashley Wilkes, written up by Margaret Mitchell as the moving force behind the Red States war on the Blue ones, explains here why his side lost: "If I had a gun, I wouldn't know what to do with it." THE PETRIFIED FOREST also indicates WHAT HAPPENED TO BABY JANE: she took her share, and high-tailed it to France. This flick's true confessions drag on for so long we even learn why "Uncle Henry" was so fearful of Elvira Gulch: Billy the Kid once took a couple drunken pot shots at him, and he's been a weak-minded drunk ever since. Perhaps one of Filmdom's biggest questions is why "Rick" is so devil-may-care as he nonchalantly guns done Nazis in CASABLANCA. He joins in playing Truth or Dare here as well, revealing "I spent most of my life since I grew up in jail, and it looks like I'll spend the rest of it dead." While THE PETRIFIED FOREST proves to be a true "Mystery Spot" for solving some of history's greatest riddles, the one thing it cannot explicate is how such a Pretentious, Logorrheaic, Preposterous script got shot in the first place!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well-written play becomes adequate film drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 'The Petrified Forest' for the first time not long ago, and it wasn't at all what I expected. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of 'The Desperate Hours,' which it definitely isn't. It's a stagy, talky film, which shouldn't have been too surprising, as it's based on a stage play where people mainly sit around and talk. But it grows on you. The performances are fine and the dialogue is at times first rate. Films from this period almost inevitably seem a bit creaky, and 'Petrified Forest' is no exception. Another thing that struck me is how strongly this film is identified with Humphrey Bogart. True, it was his breakout role and thus paved the way for one of the greatest careers in Hollywood. But he is strictly a featured player here; his character, Duke Mantee, is talked about more than he is allowed to talk. What dialogue he has (and there's really not much) is mostly built around variations on the line, "Sit down and shut up." Bogart is somewhat menacing, but he plays Mantee as though he's in a fog, drunk or maybe even high. And he's not completely convincing when he has to repeatedly pronounce "think" as "tink." No, the real star of 'Petrified Forest' is Lesley Howard, and it is his performance really that carries the film and prevents it from being stilted and absurd. He plays a writer, hitchhiking his way across America, who winds up at a roadside cafe in the middle of nowhere (Arizona, actually, but close enough). Gabby (Bette Davis) and her father run the place; she befriends Howard's character, Alan Squire, and in fact falls in love with him. Doesn't take long either. It's easy to tell 'Petrified Forest' was a stage play as almost all of it takes place on one set. People sit around and talk about themselves and the world around them, make confessions, get angry with one another, express regret and so on. Howard has the lion's share of the dialogue, though everyone gets their two cents in. Bette Davis is, and I never thought I would use this word to describe her, adorable as the naive Gabby who longs to get away, to go to France and live out her dreams. Then there's Gabby's father, her grandfather, a guy who works at the cafe, a couple passing through, and a few minor characters. Then Duke Mantee and his gang show up, on the lam from the cops. There is a shootout at the end; Mantee escapes but we learn he is captured shortly thereafter (off camera). The most interesting thing to me about 'The Petrified Forest' is that it serves as a good example of what a big Broadway play must have been like in the '20's and '30's. I'm sure it's fairly representative of plays at the time; productions where cynical leading characters made (what were then) biting observations about the world condition and mankind, and audiences went home feeling they'd experienced an evening of high art and enlightenment of great depth. Today, I think, audiences miss those feelings to a large degree and instead focus on enjoying the performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this film is rather poorly done, with dialogue that is stale and too much concentration on the obvious love interest, however the second half, which is from about the time when Bogart arrives on set, is very powerful film-making, with a fierce performance from Bogie. In the second half, the lines become better, wittier and sharper, with some excellent exchanges in dialogue between Bogart and Howard. Throughout though, Howard is brilliant as a cool, calm intellectual on a search for something more in life. The film ends on a powerful note, with great scripting and acting towards the end, and because of that, it seems easy to forget the clumsy first half. However, when the whole first third of a film can easily be compressed to just five or ten minutes, something is not right. Definitely give this film a go: the action from when Bogie arrives is unforgettable, even if the rest of the film is forgettable. At least it ends potently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must have been a compelling stage play but the film is too stage bound...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always interesting to watch pros like LESLIE HOWARD, BETTE DAVIS and HUMPHREY BOGART in their salad days playing roles that the two male stars originated on the stage. Davis is lovelier than usual and photographs attractively as the waitress with dreams of a life beyond her narrow boundaries.But the dialog is pretentious stuff, particularly the lines given Leslie Howard, who finds the waitress a girl of great interest the moment he sets eyes on her and proceeds to spout the endless twaddle of a liberated intellectual while making no sense at all.DICK FORAN is effective as a football jock with feelings for Bette and CHARLEY GRAPEWIN is good as "pops," still living on his close encounter with Billy the Kid--or so he says. But it's HUMPHREY BOGART in his first screen role as a gangster who rivets the attention as Duke Mantee, escaped killer modeled after John Dillinger. Bogart plays the role in a style different from the kind of tight lipped killer he would play later on in a number of Warner Bros. films. There's a vulnerability that makes his killer not quite as cold blooded as you might expect.PAUL HARVEY and GENEVIEVE TOBIN do nice jobs as the wealthy husband and wife team who find themselves in a most unusual situation at a desert gas station/restaurant in the middle of nowhere.Chief drawback: The stilted dialog is very dated by today's standards and the whole film is obviously as stage bound as the two set play by Robert Sherwood was when it opened on Broadway in the '30s. Director Archie Mayo usually did lighter stuff during his stay at Warner Bros., so it's odd that he was assigned to this "heavy" project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really A 'Gangster' Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people who like the stage and enjoy a lot of "talk," this film is right up their alley, but it is not a "gangster movie" as we know it, and as advertised and put out as such as part of a DVD set in January of 2005. Yes, there is a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) involved in the story, but really this is just a play where all the action is in one room and it is talk, talk, talk with just a little action in the end.The best part of the film, to me, was Bette Davis, who I have found very alluring when she was young. After 1940, she lost her physical appeal and began playing a lot of ruthless characters. Anyway, she looked good and her character was interesting. I enjoyed watching her.The worst part of film was the star of the movie: Leslie Howard, whose character just rambled on and on and on about his Liberal viewpoints of the world on numerous subjects. Some of the stuff he was interesting but most of his statements were just plain annoying and idiotic.This was Bogart's first "starring role," if you want to call it, as some have. The truth is he didn't enter the film until over halfway through and even then didn't have many lines. He was so primitive looking I almost didn't recognize him. His voice, however, gave him away. As usual, "Bogie,"" was riveting when on screen.In all, a liberal-feminist gabfest. For those who enjoy this sort of thing: great; for those looking for "gangster" movie, skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very stagy and unbelievable but still a lot of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's standards, this is a pretty silly movie--particularly the character played by Leslie Howard--particularly as the movie concludes. The events are quite gripping and entertaining, but the viewer cannot possibly believe this a REAL in any way, as the performances and plot are pretty far-fetched. Plus, when watching this it is very easy to believe that this was first a stage production--as the action is mostly confined to the restaurant and it looks like it was filmed in a sound stage. However, this is NOT necessarily a horrible thing. There are lots of movies from this era that you KNOW couldn't possibly occur but they are still fun to watch. Humphrey Bogart's gangster, though unrealistic, is fun to watch and makes the movie worth watching. Bette Davis, also, does a fine job playing the wistful young lady who longs to see the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap, I don't care who is in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course I bought this on DVD (in the 'gangsters' set) because it is a classic starring my second fave actor (Bogie, second only to the great Cagney) and Leslie Howard, who I always liked very much. I haven't seen "Forest" in many years and remembered not liking it that much. Such a classic, with such great stars, and I didn't like it that much? Did I remember correctly? Upon watching this again, I sure did."The Petrified Forest" is an over-dramatic film of a play with some great stars. It reeks of the "self-importance" that so many plays convey, so much so that it just gets downright tiring to hear the silly dialogue from these lame characters (especially Howard's and Bette Davis' characters).Even besides all that, as far as the actual cinematography, this just sucks. It literally is just a filmed play, as the soundstage it is filmed on couldn't be more fake looking, despite some promising shots of Leslie on a real desert road at the film's start. Talk about early Tim Burton syndrome - I'm shocked none of the stage equipment snuck in on screen, unless I missed it.Now of course, Bogie is excellent but really, his part wasn't that difficult to play, as he doesn't really have much to do. But he looks and sounds the part, and you can see a glimmer of the huge star he would become afterwards. He's fun to watch even if he does just sit there for most of the time. Bogie's doofy-looking partner in crime with the shotgun is actually more fun to watch because he is more animated, especially when he is at odds with the football guy.Leslie Howard (his character of course) comes across as a whiny blowhard. He's a scam artist too - he actually took a meal knowing full well he couldn't pay for it because he had no money, so he was a liar right from the start. But all the crap he talks, you just want him to shut his mouth. Sure a young and naive girl from some desert is going to listen and worship everything he says. But he just never shuts up. It never occurs to Bette's character that despite all of Howard's wiseness and experience, he's a bum walking in the desert with nothing. Meanwile, she has a job, although not much of as future, but it still beats what he has. But she still thinks he's wise and intelligent. When he gets too dramatic with the whole "kill me" thing, you want Bogie to shoot him just to shut him up. While it can be fun to watch Leslie Howard play this role occasionally, the character is just so unlikable, it's hard not to cheer for his eventual demise.Bette Davis looks nice, but she is obviously trying way too hard. I know many think she's this great actress, and she is good, I like watching some of her films. But here, she's just a bit too exhaustive and manic. She's acting as if she is indeed in a play, and not a movie, which is the whole mistake of virtually everything and everyone in this film. You want to make a movie out of a play, then do that. But movies that are simply plays with a movie camera aimed at the stage, suck. Like this.There are some really dumb things here too, like Mrs. Chism asking Bogie if she could go with him when he leaves. I mean, c'mon. Play or no play, "message" or no message, you have to kidding me. It's crap like that that really makes a bad film worse. I will say one thing, she was pretty hot, better looking than Bette Davis.Probably the most interesting scene in the film was when the two black characters interact after the black member of Bogie's gang asks Chism's driver if he'd like a drink. Even though he's still a "lowly driver" the gang member refers to him as "colored brother," still a brother. But then he teases him after the driver has to ask Mr. Chism if he can have a drink.And of course the film is just loaded with over-dramatic scenes that reek of typical "playness." Again, you want to make a movie out of a play, fine, but movies that are just plays shot on film suck. So despite the great stars in this film, especially Bogie and Howard, really, this film sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Howard and Bogart shine; poor script and not one of Davis's best roles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leslie Howard delivers a shining, stunning performance in this film, so romantic you want to sweep him up into your arms. And Humphrey Bogart nails the part of the gritty outlaw in the old Southwest.But beyond that, the film is flawed, in my opinion. The script is poor -- full of holes and inconsistencies, and actions and choices from the various characters that are not believable. Just as one example: In the first half of the movie, the two protagonists very clearly tell each other (several times) that they love each other. Then in the second half of the movie (which occurs on the same day) each one apparently totally forgets that the other one has said this, although the movie gives no reason for this apparent idiocy/amnesia on their parts.That's just one script flaw; there are many more, but that is the most glaring and major one.Lastly, this is a very poor role for Bette Davis (who is my favorite actress), and a painful one to watch her play. In the early 30s, Bette fought against these lame "girlie" roles with no spunk or backbone, and then famously broke out of them in Of Human Bondage (1934), but she was still unfortunately shunted into them from time to time -- even though they were totally inappropriate for her. It is positively painful to watch her try to get a dramatic grip on a poorly written, incongruous, ineffectual part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and pompous movie. Perhaps worth seeing Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am extremely fond of old classic films, but "The petrified forest" was a major disappointment for me. To be honest, I found the movie unbelievably silly. Of course, "The petrified forest" has an historical interest, being the first important Humphrey Bogart's role. Indeed, Bogie is great and (almost) succeeds to save his awful lines. Unfortunately, his time on the screen is rather short. The script is really terrible: emphatic, pompous, completely out-of-place in the mouths of anybody, all the more of people living in the middle of nowhere.Bette Davis as Gabby is good, as always. However, she was never famous for her beauty. Nevertheless, all the characters compete in praising Gabby's stunning beauty and gorgeous looks. That becomes ridiculous after a short while.The drifter-poet Alan (Leslie Howard) is unbearable from the very beginning. And his behavior in the finale is so absurd that it turns the film into farce. The idea of the story could be good, but its treatment is awful. The number of implausibilities flaws and clumsy situations is enormous. The inn in the Arizona desert is crowded as a subway-train at rush hour, mostly by useless, annoying characters. An instance: the wanna-be-football-player, Gabby's suitor. I say: where the heck does he think to play football, remaining in the desert? People are hostages of the criminals, who even aim their weapons to them. Nonetheless they provoke, insult, even threaten the outlaws. Do you think it a likely behavior? The women get the situation very easy... No hint that the criminals could rape them, so, just for fun? And then there is the final sensational hit of Alan's idea... Come on!The script also contains a gaffe which is even tragic to our modern eyes. Clearly reflecting the author's thought, Gabby and Alan keep complaining about uncivilized, rough America, and dreaming about the wonderful, peaceful Europe, the land of learning, civilization, refinement... But those were the most shameful years of the history of Europe! The Nazis had got the power, started racial persecutions, and were fixing for the war. Meanwhile the Communists were exterminating millions of people in the Soviet Union (and preparing a war, as well). And all that with the coward acquiescence of European moderate politicians. Really a great idea to go to live in Europe! Another admirable intuition by the genius Alan!To crown a bad movie, we have the cardboard backdrops, very poor, although possibly par to the standards of the 1930s. But for the possible interest of seeing Bogart, I by no means recommend "The petrified forest".</fullReview>
