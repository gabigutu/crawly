		<shortDescription>An incredibly powerful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/Ever had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, "run the table now," he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.Memorable: I am still thinking about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further. The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.10/10. Best film of the decade.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension, tension, tension!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next "Yardbird" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of "Whiplash" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: "What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with "Whiplash" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss. I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They could have done better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this about 24 hours ago at the Best of Fest for Sundance, and this last 24 hours I have done little but think about and marvel at this film. I really had zero expectations going in, I heard the buzz surrounding it in town, but knew very little about it as the film began. I have yet to get the words that do my thoughts justice for this movie but I am going to try. First everything about this film was stellar; casting, writing, acting, directing, music and cinematography all came together to just tell an incredible story. I want to say a bit more about a couple of these aspects. Acting, first of all I don't know who impressed me more Miles Teller in the lead as Andrew Nieman or JK Simmons playing Band teacher Terence Fletcher. Both did so great that had either been a lesser actor they would have been out shined by the other. Simmons' performance really reminded me of Gunnery Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket, except rather than emotionally destroying and rebuilding marines he was doing it to 18 year old kids. His character could have easily been cartoony and 2 dimensional but Simmons gave him such depth that the whole film I felt compassion for and even understood his motives, even before he lays them out for Nieman in the third act. Two scenes bring you to the core of this character and the line that has intrigued me for 24 hours is "No words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job.'" (thus why I titled my review as such, sorry I couldn't resist). Then on to Teller's performance, for a younger actor who I haven't seen in much I must say he played his role like a seasoned actor. His performance just wrapped me up and to find out he did much of the drumming himself is insane. Whilst watching some of the intense scenes I felt like I was watching him be executed, and other times it feels like the fight in Rocky, you feel like you are just watching him get demolished, except all of this is emotional rather than the easier physical. Whether it is the discouragement, the socially awkwardness, the single parent household, the internal conflict, the hubris, the arrogance, and at times the mental torture that he put himself through, all just blew me away. Teller reminded me of a much much more talented John Cusack and had the charisma and electricity to connect to the audience. The one other thing I must commend is the writing, so often you kind of know where a movie is headed but this movie stayed very unpredictable and just when you think for certain how a scene or sequence of scenes will play out they take a hard left and keeps you off balance (in a good way). It was so refreshing, a few times I thought the bow was on the film but then something disrupts how "it should go or end". Sorry if I rambled, perhaps after thinking on it more I can get a more focused review, needless to say this film is a must-see when it gets a broad release. Great job to all involved and congrats on winning the award at Sundance, you certainly earned it. One last thing if this gets attention in wide release this could see a heightened interest in Jazz, this is certainly a film that can make even the not-so musically inclined want to throw on a Jazz record and just drown in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pay no attention to this review, because almost everybody loves this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good parts:The movie is very sensitively filmed. The camera relentlessly explores every bump on Teller's and Simmons's heads like a documentary about Greek sculpture. It adds a lot to the feel of the movie in a wonderfully subtle way.Simmons and Teller (as the "Studio" band director and the, I guess, protagonist young drummer) do a great job. Simmons in particular is really the nexus of energy for the entire movie, and owns that role with absolute precision.The music, when it's actually music, is well-chosen and well-performed.The terrible parts:Simmons ("Fletcher") and Teller ("Andrew") are essentially the only characters in the film. Andrew's dad and his not-really girlfriend are secondary characters that serve to remind the audience what actual humans are like. Andrew is an insufferable jerk, and Teller does an amazing job of maintaining (mostly) a stone-faced, blankly insensitive look throughout almost every tense moment of the film. Simmons's Fletcher is a superb sadistic maniac. He's not "intense" or "volatile" - he's a psychotic monster.I'm debilitated as a reviewer because my son is a talented young drummer, so I get to see good drumming all the time. The persistent trope in the film of Andrew drumming until his hands bleed is wildly unrealistic; that basically cannot happen if you're a drummer good enough to get into a prestigious music school in the first place. Everything else about Andrew at the fancy school, upon further examination, is completely unreal. He basically never talks to the other complete non-entities in the band. They're all like POWs, obeying the maniac director unflinchingly (except when they fail, when they're abused and ejected). My son (whose judgment I trust because he's also obsessed, but not a jerk) described the silly drum "competition" as "three people who can't drum doing shitty grind-core break beats". (To be fair, he liked the movie. What can you do.)So OK, the movie is an allegory, and not intended to be realistic. So it's an allegory about how a sadist can really help a self-absorbed jerk with some obsession get better at what they want to do? I can't find any way to sympathize with that. I mean, who is that speaking to?Finally, the actually appropriate and yet irritatingly obtrusive product placement (pristine cymbal labels, super-clean Zildjian logo on Andrew's stick bag, etc) got pretty hard to take by the (truly weird) ending.Go see this movie because everybody else thinks it's great, but if you feel funny afterwards maybe this review will offer some comfort that you're not alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, Inspiring, Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is an incredibly complex character study that has Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort. Whilst I was fixated by 'Birdman' and found 'Boyhood' a generally entertaining watch, 'Whiplash' is by far the most riveting and sensational drama I have viewed from 2014. J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. His performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement. The final drum solo ends the film on a high note and keep its audience lingering on the edge of their seats, it is powerful, it is intense, it is a near-masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in "Oz". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's "Caravan". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle "good job".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandomIt does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach) It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around.

		<shortDescription>A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand "Inside Llewyn Davis" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama "Whiplash." An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' "Captain Phillips," coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my "Oscar Isaac" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in "Rabbit Hole," and then helming "The Spectacular Now" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in "Whiplash." There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in "Amadeus," as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a "10," he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning "Inglourious Basterds," a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in "Juno," "Burn After Reading," and "Up in the Air," a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's "Men, Women &amp; Children," writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door.You can't credit "Whiplash" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut "Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year."Whiplash" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight."Whiplash" is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is played out as if the young musicians are in boot camp. the head teacher is more vicious drill sergeant than music teacher. anyone who has played an instrument will tell you, yes that practise is hard and you have to be committed, but it is always enjoyable and fulfilling. no one in this film seems to take pleasure in playing music. it is so ludicrous, over the top and ultimately just plain corny. they spell out what the film is about in very childish dialogue as if an audience cannot pick up on what the teacher is trying to do. scene after scene of bombastic emotional and physical brutality. any teacher teaching as this sadist does would not last a week, let alone manage to impart any kind of knowledge into his pupils. then we have the ending the kid races against time, survives a head on car collision and still makes it to the gig, (whereupon the teacher has change what they are going to play just for spite, this is the kind of character he has been throughout this one note film,) and then still manages that old cliché of killing them dead with his boring drum solo. drumming is not about speed its about making melody from skins. Overrated by critics who by now really don't know what makes a good film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it very sad that so many people - including so-called professional reviewers - have rated this crap so highly. I did not walk out (although I was greatly tempted to do so) but saw it to the end. A total waste of time.Here's what might spoil it for you, should you believe the BS that's being spread around this stinking pile of excrement: It could have actually been OK if it hadn't been so laughably impossibly ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in the fifties or the forties when people had much less developed consciousness of human rights? But even so... I suppose the moral/lesson we are supposed to learn is... if you can't warp your students enough by abuse to force them to become great musicians then it is perfectly alright to discard or destroy them in the attempt. This glorified tyrant and bully can himself only produce music at a grade one level and so because he cannot 'do' he 'teaches?'He does not teach, he does not inspire; he withholds approval, negatively reinforces and rules by fear, and is feared rather than respected. I would have a difficult time to point to a single (pedagogical) scene in the film that had any merit whatsoever or was worth watching for any reason. Maybe I should say that its evident popularity may be evidence that we are truly living in the end times... ha! See the film if you want to be current, but please decide for yourself from watching it and don't believe the hype about its 'genius' or 'brilliance.' It is not either of those things; it's a poorly written, sad joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure to be one of the best films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watching teenagers being abused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being.When it comes to music however it is impossible to achieve great results with these methods. It can only lead to a soul- and heartless disaster. A fitting result would have been an aggression build-up in the main character which would have prevented him from ever playing anything worth listening to again. This reaction has been seen in other movies where usually the people that are socially connected to the main character will have to suffer from the violent state of mind that this mistreatment is causing. The other possibility is a simple resignation, either by quitting music or by quitting life.But what is displayed here is wrong on many levels, because it tells you that this abuse leads to something beautiful. That it is all worth it because it pushes you to your limits and then you will be a great musician. Whoever made up this story is either suffering from a severe psychosis or has the intent to justify abusive methods in education by presenting them as effective.If you treat people with violence they will get violent too. Either towards others or towards themselves. This is the only result you will achieve. And in this case it would also completely destroy the main character's ability to be a musician. Music is not the military. You do need discipline and training, but this comes from mental strength. And you do not get stronger by being abused. It will only weaken you.It makes me sad seeing that apparently this movie is entertaining to people. This can only be the case if they do not see the utter failure in judgment that is presented here. And if they do not see it then they are blind in a way that is worrying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full Metal Fame Jacket...Or something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave it 28 minutes. That was generous, in that I knew it was going to be terrible within about 2.I've been to music school. It's not like this. The teachers aren't like this. No one's like this (obviously I'm referring to 'Hollywood idea of what a hard-ass music teacher might be like in some weird juvenile negative fantasy' Fletcher).I switched off when he threw a chair at Andrew the drum prodigy and then slapped him. SLAPPED him. Repeatedly. In front of a whole, cowed class of what, in legal terms, would be called witnesses to an assault, for playing slightly fast, the first time he's ever played to him in a band practice.I'm sorry, what?! Where does this/would this/has this ever happened? In a Charles Dickens novel about a jazz drum student, possibly. In anything even vaguely purporting to be based on real life now, um...No.I'm stunned. Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest that is so laughably bad, you have to check the page again to really believe it's got such high praise.Excruciating nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dynamic movie full of tensions and twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art." Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn't expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger. This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art"Beautiful" because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT. Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won't say "good job" but rather "thank you", to the promising Franco-American director Damien Chazelle&#xfeff; for sharing his vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood hogwash with good technique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My non-musician friends love this film and insisted I see it. I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, "I know, let's build a show to save the town!" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film. P.S. my drummer plays better than any of these guys. Hah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only neat music and cinematography make this tawdry, melodramatic tale of sadomasochistic relationship between jazz conservatory student and teacher, worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 70s, a new genre of films aimed at black audiences emerged entitled, 'Blaxploitation'. The genre primarily glorified stereotypical "criminal" behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction. Both white liberal film critics and martial arts enthusiasts alike, will enjoy this exercise in sado-masochistic shenanigans as evidenced by the plethora of rave reviews now gracing a multitude of web pages over the internet.Don't ask any of our critics who rave about the film to require Mr. Chazelle to provide even a modicum of verisimilitude. I'm talking, of course, about how Mr. Chazelle's antagonist, the martinet music instructor, Terence Fletcher, would even last five minutes at a prestigious music conservatory, given his vast repertoire of sociopathic behavior. Oh but wait?'Whiplash' really is supposed to be more like a fable, so Mr. Chazelle is given a pass?he no longer has to be beholden to 'conventional' narratives.But even fables should operate within a somewhat realistic world. And is it realistic to have Fletcher's co-worker shrink from him (are they all so afraid that they dare not assert themselves one bit?) Is it realistic not to see Fletcher's interactions with his supervisors (are they also completely browbeaten by him?) Would the administration allow such a person to continually humiliate his students, hurl ethnic and gay slurs, and actually throw things at the students, which could result in personal injury (possibly subjecting the school to a lawsuit?). Fletcher is clearly a caricature, who belongs in an army setting and not a music conservatory. Nonetheless, Chazelle needs the character to not only titillate us along the way but to illustrate his simplistic morality play, which entails a warning about the dangers of obsessive careerism.Now of course various naysayers will argue that there ARE people like Fletcher who seek to bring out the best in their students by utilizing 'tough love' but such pedagogues in real life must work within the 'system' and the 'pushing' is much more subtle than what is depicted here.The same goes for Chazelle's protagonist, Andrew Neyman, who plays the obsessed drummer student who seeks to get in the good graces of the ruthless Fletcher. Neyman is played by Miles Teller whom I liked very much in 'The Spectacular Now'. Since he plays drums in real life, Teller is pretty convincing playing the drums in the film. But Chazelle applies the same 'sledge hammer' approach toward the character 'Neyman' as he does with 'Fletcher'. Neyman wants to 'make it' at 'any cost'. He plays the drums so hard until his hands start bleeding (various drummers posting on the internet deny they've seen cases of this); and then on his way to a competition, Neyman gets in a bad car accident, but STILL drags himself to the performance and attempts to play (Chazelle seeks to prove the inane point that Neyman is so obsessed, that he'll do anything to win?even if it means playing seriously injured and jeopardizing his own life). No really, can you see anyone doing this? But again, since this is more like a melodramatic fable, Chazelle can have his characters do the most ridiculous things, and seemingly get away with it!Two thirds of the Whiplash plot concerns Fletcher's quest to supposedly bring out the best in his students (none of whom do we really get to know except Neyman). John Bleasdale writing in CineVue finds Fletcher's diatribes appealing: "His razor wit, sheer outrageousness, inventive taunting and vulgar insults are at once appalling and blackly funny." I agree that Fletcher's insults are appalling but "blackly funny"? Keep in mind that all the other characters who come in contact with Fletcher, have no ego, to the point that no one will oppose him. Therefore, Fletcher can get away with saying anything he feels like (some may call this 'wit', but in reality they're simply one note monologues--a set of variations on a theme).The second act crisis manifests itself when Neyman is kicked out of school after physically attacking Fletcher. The way back toward some kind of 'equilibrium' is when Neyman agrees to give a deposition in a lawsuit that eventually leads to Fletcher's dismissal from the conservatory.The Whiplash climax occurs after Neyman and Fletcher meet at a jazz club where Fletcher is now playing and Neyman agrees to play at a showcase. This turns out to be an ambush, since Fletcher arranges for Neyman to get up there without sheet music and he can only end up improvising (Fletcher is so demented that he's seemingly willing to sabotage the entire performance to get back at Neyman who he knows testified against him). Neyman runs off backstage into the arms of his good guy father but suddenly summons the courage to come back and play, where he dazzles, performing an extraordinary drum solo. Has Neyman triumphed after enduring the humiliating set-up? Not at all! He merely plays into Fletcher's stratagem to push him beyond his limits emotionally?even if it means that he must sacrifice his dignity and self-worth by allowing the mad sociopath to manipulate him over and over again.In order to accept Chazelle's tawdry tale, one must accept the conventions of melodrama. Clearly it's written as heightened reality to make a point about the sadomasochistic relationship between student and teacher. While Chazelle may ultimately view his characters at a distance with the correct moral upper hand, he mirrors Tarantino, by reveling in the violence that he is also attempting to disdain. The 'Whiplash' machinations end up more tawdry and sensationalistic than compellingly tragic.I would recommend 'Whiplash' for the excellent cinematography and of course all the neat jazz music. I'll pass on the story?due to its clear, unrealistic and melodramatic aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It amazes me that a movie that promotes such level of fascistic perfectionism gets so much praise. I say fascistic because the sick perfectionism of Nazis was one of the main reasons they thought it is OK to gas millions of people. If you are not perfect based on our standards you don't deserve to live. This movie tells us if you are not Charlie Parker I feel free to humiliate you, insult you, hurt you and abuse you, and it is all justified because if you are Charlie Parker you don't mind this level of sick manipulation. What a disgusting message. Yes, the actors did a good job playing these sick characters, and the movie was well made, which makes it even more dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, unrealistic Hollywood garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving Whiplash a one star rating to compensate for all the rave reviews it has gotten from people who obviously know nothing about about how music is made, and what goes into great performances.Almost the whole film is about the relationship between a talented teen drummer, played by Miles Teller and a teacher, played by JK Simmons, who directs jazz in a top music school. The JK Simmons role is a sick meld of an evil Nazi from WWII, a brutal drill sergeant and a father who is both physically and mentally abusive. His head is shaved, he wears a black "muscle" shirt almost continually in the movie, he screams at his students, uses language that makes George Carlin seem like Mr. Rogers, throws chairs, and finally slaps the Teller character in the face, repeatedly. I don't think there is a minority group he does not insult repeatedly, with just about the worst four-letter trash talk imaginable.The fact that the acting is impressive can't save this film. The script is terrible. And it does a disservice to music education in a time when support for the arts is already struggling.Worst of all, the film misrepresents everything that is real in both music and music education. Anyone seeing this film and thinking of going into a music program for the first time would be so turned-off The film is about mind-rape. It is about the worst kind of damage one human can inflict on another in the name of teaching without leaving a great deal of physical damage. It has nothing to do with music, or creativity, or teaching. It is Hollywood at its worse.There are some abusive musical directors who have way too much power, but this fictional character would not last one week in any music school. One student would simply turn on an I-pad, record what goes on, then pass it around.The teacher would be out of a job and most likely in jail.One reviewer called it a "steaming pile of excrement". Apt words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's only one thing worse than a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie, and that's a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie that everybody seems to adore.Whiplash wants to be about the love of great art, but is actually about the hate of great art. It has JK Simmons - a brilliant actor - playing a disgraceful character, stitched together from completely unrealistic, inconsistent motivations and actions, only conceived to bludgeon the viewer into thinking we're watching something profound. It casually tosses in assault, depression and suicide in a way that only a clueless, opportunistic director could. It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved - it doesn't.Even worse, the finale leaves us with this unmistakable message: sadistic leadership is the way to greatness. Don't take your kids to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, unrealistic portrayal of a beautiful art form (Jazz)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a terrible, unrealistic movie. First of all, of all the musical forms in popular culture, Jazz is one of the most relaxed and organic. The fact that the music director is characterized as disciplinarian is reminiscent of the "classical" genre of 60+ year ago (Toscanini, Bruno Walter, etc.), where musical directors ruled with an almost fascist like iron fist. This changed years ago in "classical" music and was NEVER the case in Jazz. I am a former professional Jazz and classical musician who studied at top music schools, and creating great Jazz is about relaxing and being in the moment, not being frightened to the point of crying because of an evil music director.Secondly, within the first 20 minutes of the movie, the music director throws a chair at the student and then slaps him!! This is called ASSAULT, and would NEVER happen (or more to the point, be tolerated), in any academic institution, minor or major! Certainly not in the US (or in New York City, as in this case.) This alone completely discredits this movie in my opinion. It's an unrealistic piece of crap that should not ever had been made!! This movie is a discredit to the beautiful art form that is Jazz and an insult to all who teach and play it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(biased but educated review from a jazz drummer student)I give 3 points because:-the movie is entertaining (wich for me is a major factor)i take seven because:-The plot is 100% unbelievable.-The idea portrayed here that to get better at jazz drumming (or for that matter any music genre and any musical instrument) you have to injure yourself, suffer psychologically and practice with tension in your hands/arms is exactly the opposite of what playing/practicing jazz drumming is.The only way to get better is practicing relaxed an being constant...improving in baby, but solid steps.-There is a special accent on playing fast as hell as a mean to be considered "the greatest", and also indirectly in the importance of reading musical scores, when in reality, jazz drumming is a lot more about feel and dynamics, , creativity, coordination and improvisation (without reading any musicl score at all but knowing the form of the song and listening to the other players to interact in the moment).So the movie is a fiction, but not tagged as if. The only thing that can relate with reality is that it can be considered a caricature of a very turbulent student-teacher relationship. Also can be considered a good way to show teachers and students WHAT NOT TO DO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, English is not my mother tongue. Excuse me for the mistake I made in this review.Every one seems to like this movie. It is weird that many people seems to avoid to talk about the message or don't think this movie have any massage at all. But for me the message is loud and clear: You must Insult, humiliate&#xff0c; mentally abuse and physically violate your student to make them good. That's the only way to encourage them to achieve greatness. As a student you must take any advantage you can, no matter what it is going to cause. Remove everything except the thing you want to master from your life FOREVER, otherwise you are not going to be successful. There are lots of things in the movie that state these message clearly. The most obvious one is the ending. Both Andrew and Fletcher achieve their goal. They achieve it beautifully. Andrew did a improvisation at the end and create his own music. Fletcher get his Charlie Parker. Detail like the poster in the school, says something about end up in a rock band. The fame of Fletcher's band in the movie. Every single effect that Fletcher occur to Andrew like in a scene, Andrew describe other drummer's performance as this s**t. Some information that state the disadvantage of Fletcher's way of teaching are blurred out. such as the Death of a student that I forget his name. Student that Fletcher send out the classroom are never seen again. Fletcher's impact to other student. Those information mentioned in the movie disappear immediately. People who find these message and buying them certainly never been through a teacher like Fletcher or at least doesn't been through for a long time. I jump to this conclusion because I did, and I know what kind of damage Fletcher's way of education will do to the student for a long period of time. When I was about 10 years old, I had not one but three teacher just like Fletcher for two years. I was in my primary school back in China. Violence is the most usual way of their punishment. we got beaten after we didn't do very well on homework, misbehave on class (usually talking and not paying attention), I once broke my arm during these days. At the time I actually like they use violence, because nothing come close when they decided not to use it. When they insult you they never run short of fancy words even we are just kids. I hope I translate them more correctly so you can understand them better. Ones I have a classmate that didn't do well on their homework about handwriting. The teacher says these word in front of 46 kid: From now on, your name is piece of s**t (my classmate's last name) because your handwriting is s**t. and your parents are big s**t. they should be regret about f**k 10 month before your birthday, because you are not worth it. That is one of the thing they said that I remember the most. and after that, little s**t become his nick name. he accept it and we make fun of it.And humiliation . that is for every one who didn't "do well" on their test. Every morning before class. A question well be asked to everyone in the class:"who is the one that get the lowest score?" after that the kid that get the lowest score will be forced to say:"I am a worthless piece of crap, everything I know is to eat and s**t."If any of these thing don't make you think about Fletcher, I don't know what will. In fact I fell Fletcher is a saint compare to them. because those kind of torture last 2 years long and I was a 10 year old kid.Here come the worst part.At first those insult works very well. After a long time I start to accept every word they say. Remember I said my classmate accept his nickname little s**t. I start to accept I am a idiot, I cant do anything right, I am worthless and pathetic. Those word don't make me fell I am willing to break the barrier any more. instead they become a relief. An excuse for not doing well. After over 10, I sometime still fell the same way. I find a psychological statement that describe it very well called Learned helplessness. I am no psychologist so someone please tell me if it's true or not.Back to the movie review. I don't think Andrew is making any sense according to my experience. And this movie is a training course for a**holes. 1/10 Good Job for harming the director the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Overrated - all-around horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a cheezy D-list sports movie script complete with the cliché bullying, demeaning coach with the tormented, misunderstood athlete (reality: narcissistic, self-righteous, arrogant, spoiled and immature child who needs to grow up) -- replace these 2 characters with a jazz music "teacher" and a drum student at an "elite" music academy. Neither character has ANY redeeming qualities - if the writers thought they were creating complex, intricate characters they failed miserably. The ending only shows how pathetic both truly are. I assume the writers (and anyone giving this film a positive review) felt they reached some great epiphany at the conclusion - they didn't. Only a tired out re-tread storyline completely out of proper context. A jazz drum student and music "teacher" are not soldiers in boot camp and learning to play drums is not a physically demanding, super- human endeavor as this film tries to lead you to believe.In reality the "teacher" is a glorified conductor who thinks he's something special but does nothing but destroy his students desire and passion. He is also an admitted complete failure at his misguided goal of creating another Charlie Parker. The "student" is equally self-absorbed and rude excuse for a human being. Only thing positive is he seems to be a pretty decent jazz drummer - but that's it. Character has absolutely ZERO going for him other than that. Other than that he's completely disrespectful and dismissive of everything and everyone else.This film (along with Birdman) sums up how pretentious Hollywood is and the excrement they promote at awards shows to convince themselves they have some higher "intellect" or "artistic genius." No one will remember Whiplash or Birdman other than as an embarrassing side note in Oscar history (remember Shakespeare in Love, didn't think so - Google it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can not understand how this movie does get so much acclaim. The whole movie is just so unrealistic. I have learned and practiced 2 instruments here in Europe and can only say when I watch how this Shaffer character treats musicians like football players, this would never work. In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is not how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not sports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound alike. People in music are sensitive. Teaching is a process of mutual understanding, respecting and elevating between teacher and student.Further, a good drum technique with speed is not achieved by such tensioned convulsion, it needs the right finger and hand control and swing.The acting is certainly admirable but the cuts are sometimes worse then just distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about bullying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe that this film has received so many good reviews. I cannot believe that this film was Oscar nominated for "Best Motion Picture of the Year". Here's IMDb's synopsis of the film: "A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential." This film, however, is about a bully music teacher who insults, assaults, slaps, degrades, and humiliates his students to death. Literally. This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people's well-being. Everything else in the film would simply not happen. Other reviewers, with music knowledge, have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible, nowadays. I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater. Peoples' potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying. Victims of bullying do not easily "overcome" or "harden up" to become better human beings. Moreover, victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves, later on in life. So, I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully.I am a big fan on violent films and I have felt emotionally exhilarated ? completely satisfied ? after watching films like Oldboy, and Sympathy for Mr &amp; Lady Vengeance. Whiplash left me feeling disgusted, wondering about what kind of people made it, watched it, and enjoyed it.</fullReview>

Do I really need to write more to express how wrong this movie is, despite all the good acting and amazing editing? Since when geniuses and talented artists have all been mentored by a sadistic psychotic maniac that should be locked up straight from the very first slap or insults? it is a SCHOOL. S-C-H-O-O-L.An insult to all worthy teachers and mentors more successful than this Fletcher as NONE of their trainees kill themselves and nevertheless do reach their best.Liking this movie with no restriction at all is being an accomplice of teen suicides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Glorification of Bullying in Film and Sanctioned by Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised to see this movie do so well at the Oscars. The movie in a nutshell, to me, is exactly how NOT to teach anyone anything. The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers. Dreadful, Hollywood should be ashamed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic, Predictable... Well Acted, Good Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not as boring as 50 Shades of Grey, but it's just about as simplistic. There are two characters, plus a couple of others are hinted (at with several seconds of screen time).I loved the music. The acting was good, but the roles were not especially nuanced.The main problem is that within the first couple of minutes of the film, you know Andrew's goal: to be an elite drummer. Great. You also realize that his instructor is complete jerk (or worse) and is going to "challenge" Andrew. So, for the rest of the movie, all we have to wonder about is whether he'll end up overcoming the challenge and being a good drummer, or whether he'll give up.It kept my attention, but I would never watch this movie a second time. There just wasn't enough substance to it. There was no nuance. There was nothing more to think about.The pseudo-philosophical, pop-psychological discussion in the movie about whether abusive treatment by a teacher is justifiable by the potential for producing greatness are just pathetic and empty.There are some shades of side-story. There's a paper-thin character of a girlfriend. She only exists to make us believe that Andrew might be giving something up by pursuing his goal, but since Andrew isn't likable at all, I didn't really care if he ended up with her.Anyway, the movie wasn't really a 1 star... I give it a solid 6.5, but since it's been voted so high here on IMDb, I'm just trying to bring it down into the realm of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems to me the only people who like this movie are people who know nothing about music. The film tries to get you to buy into some kind of polished, elite fantasy world that supports our belief that success comes at great sacrifice. Which it sometimes does.. but this movie is absolutely ridiculous.People become musicians out of LOVE for the art. They aren't pushed to "achieve greatness" by sadistic asshole teachers. Also, Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe. Jazz (and Blues) have always been about self-expression - play, spontaneity, colour, contrast &amp; emotion. Lots of great jazz players are self- taught and never even went to music school (see Django Reinhardt). Many can't even read music.This (American) movie completely fails to understand one of Americas own greatest cultural exports. As a Brit, I appreciate the irony - I can only conclude the writer must be a total dipshit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid and Improbable story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well acted? Sure. Decent directing and production values- yep! Plausible or realistic storyline? Not at all. There is no Shaffer Conservatory. Berklee College of Music in Boston used to be heavy on big-band jazz, but now the school has become far more vocational. None of the conservatory's I am aware of feature jazz as a curriculum, and if they did, it certainly would not be a major. No music professor in the USA would have a job if they behaved the way Fletcher does, and more to the point, no JAZZER would ever behave this way under any circumstances. Jazzers are not confrontational or competitive, that would contradict everything they stand for. The way the other musician behaved and talked in this film is not even remotely accurate AT ALL. Real musicians in REAL life, ESPECIALLY JAZZERS, are brotherly. A professor would never come into another professor's class and take over, would never physically abuse a student or yell at them this way ( with intense profanity, humiliation, and gender-insensitivity). A teacher wouldn't come in and insult the entire ensemble EVER. They would never audition them in the manner Fletcher does. They would never focus so much on the drummer, nor would they put so much emphasis on a stupid and pointless competition. The JVC Jazz festival, like any other jazz festival, does not have label-people attending to scout for new talent like baseball scouts. Labels are overrun with demo tapes and web links to downloads, and his remark that if you screw up they will remember you for the expressed purpose of denying you a deal is absolutely inane.I have NEVER seen a drummer get bloody hands just from playing fast: a stick only weighs about 2 ounces and is very smooth. Oh BTW, drummers never share sticks. Sticks are very personal, and ALL drummers, in a music program, carry a stick bag with them like a woman carries a purse. I have never seen "alternate" drummers in an ensemble or page turners for drummer. Big-band rehearsals at 9AM? Are they joking? You'd never get that many musicians to be at class that early and behave like soldiers in bootcamp, NO WAY! Are we to believe that Andrew get tossed from school, before Fletcher, because he messed up playing a song in a competition? Seriously? Even though he was bloody from a car accident? Maybe if this imaginary tale took place in hell, it would have slightly more credibility. Hollyweird NEVER portrays musicians accurately in a feature film. This is not a powerful movie, it doesn't make a point or carry any type of profound message and it doesn't portray musicians or music-schools with an accuracy at all. Im sure its fooled a lot of lay-people.</fullReview>

How important is for a drummer to play his drums fast? Not that important. I think this film was made more for the actors and music editors then for the music itself. What a disappointment! It is also disappointing to see that this film took more Oscars then Boyhood. It is sickening! I really would like to add that I really expected more about this film then it delivered to me.

I expected John Candy or Martin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie. Now I know why musicians and music students are making fun of this movie all over the US. I was a HS music teacher for more than 15 years, and a professional musician my entire life, and I've never seen a funnier movie about music in my entire life. The only one that came close to this was Ken Russell's version of "Tommy", but Whiplash took itself much more seriously than Tommy did. People are getting more and more brainless about music every day (especially jazz), so it didn't surprise me that many people thought this was a good movie. I guess I'm not as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the other people that gave it a bad review, because I waited for it to come out on DVD, and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater.

		<fullReview>Hard to rate this film because there's so much to like - the performances, the unusual story-line, and the fact that it's about jazz. Still what stays with me is what I liked the least about the movie - the fact that Fletcher's torturous and reprehensible methods seem to be validated in the end. I really wished the kid would have succeeded in spite of Fletcher and showed him that his methods only cause irreversible damage and sometimes even death. Abuse is not the way to make talent (artistic or otherwise) blossom - McCartney, Spielberg, Federer, Bach, Evert, Picasso, Da Vinci - there are countless examples of genius without without abuse. Maybe jazz is different? I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admired the cinematography and the acting, and at the start, thought this would be a great film. But then the bullying and violence started... The first episode was shocking but gripping, and I wanted to find out where the film was leading. It turned out to be leading up a blind alley. The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype, the bleeding hands were just plain unbelievable, and all the other members of the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling abuse. This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work; there is a big difference between pushing students to achieve more and violent bullying. And the idea that such violence and aggression could lead to students producing better music of all things, would be laughable if it wasn't so sick. I was tempted to walk out but watched till the end, hoping for some kind of balance or note of realism. Unfortunately, there wasn't one and the final triumphant performance merely seemed to validate the cruelty. Yes, the cinema audience clapped at the end, and that made my stomach turn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't "enjoy" this movie though I don't fault the fine acting. Movies successfully pitch an alternate reality when internal consistencies makes the unbelievable believable. In the movie The Matrix, as in many Sci-Fi flicks, the director establishes environmental rules and all the characters operate within that framework. My objections to Whiplash focus on its extreme examples of behavior which are so extreme as to make them conspicuously inconsistent with the movie's time and place. Those extremes strain the credulity of nearly every key player. I couldn't take the movie seriously despite its fervent desire to make a case about over-the-top efforts / sacrifices and what some people think it takes to win. There was little / no back story to convince me any of the characters would either act like that, be allowed to act like that, or be the recipient of those same actions. It's caricature upon caricature. The movie's conclusion provided some semblance of redemptive believable cohesion but by then it really was too late and I found the whole setup very contrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When did drumming become a BloodSport?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the hype all around, I went in to watch this movie with a lot of expectations. Especially because I haven't seen a movie on drumming, at least not a drummer as the protagonist. I have to admit, I am a little disappointed.Drumming is an art. One needs finesse to be a drummer. Here, in the movie, it seems all about 'speed': playing fast tempos. Double time and triple time. To the extent blood oozes out of your body. Is that the definition of good music? Haven't the makers of the film heard of 'rests' in music charts. What not to play and when not to play is more powerful than what you indeed play.And why is it that the Conductor Mr.Fletcher has his eyes set only on the drummer. Not once did we see him interact with the other musicians of the ensemble.With all that filth and anger from the Conductor, one really wonders if any good music would ever flow out from that band? It reminded me of the great movie 'An officer and a gentleman'. The Commanding Trainer in the movie was arrogant and ruthless for a good reason. But not so in 'Whiplash'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that people rate this movie so highly and I can't believe that this crap was nominated as Best Picture of the Year. All I can say is that I am so glad it didn't win. I'm not even sure I am glad that J.K. Simmons won an Oscar. This movie is bad from beginning to end and totally unbelievable. I'm not a musician and I don't even like Jazz, but I'm sure no music school would employ or tolerate a teacher like Fletcher. People would report him much sooner than it is portrayed in the movie. There are other scenes that discredit this film. For instance, when Andrew, the student, has the auto accident, he walks away from it with hardly any injury (although the car overturned) and makes it just in time to the music hall for the concert. Yeah, give me a break! Fletcher is a sadistic prick, but we are supposed to believe he is moved to tears when he talks about a former student who killed himself? Total nonsense! What really irritated me is that the Fletcher character is so surreal and disgusting, and that Andrew, the student, is so obsessed. Any normal person would have quit or at least reported the teacher, but no, we have to endure this "drama" until the "glorious" end. I found the solo so boring, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I only went to see this horrible film because it was nominated as best picture. I praise all the brave people who wrote a bad review... this movie deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finishes on a high 'note', but it's heavily flawed and almost intolerable to sit through for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways this was quite a strange film as it has virtually no build-up; we start with Andrew (Miles Teiler) playing the drums for a few minutes before his eventual mentor Terrence Fletcher (J.K Simmons) walks in and observes Andrew playing the drums. After liking what he hears, Terrence offers Andrew a place in his band....Not only do the problems start for Andrew at this point, but it's at the point where the band first assemble that I started to have problems with this film...For the next 80 minutes all we have here is Terrence Fletcher - man of mystery; so what do we know about him? Well he's a man that seems to be sponsored by Accurist, he's a combination of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket and Simon Cowell or Nasty Nigel Lythgoe. The majority of the film shows the band playing music (admittedly I initially liked this aspect of the film, but it was repetitive and wore thin after a while) then we have Fletcher shouting at his students, putting them down etc. The only thing that was moderately entertaining about the first 80 minutes was hearing Fletcher's put downs, but after 80 minutes of it I was losing the will to live. Think about hearing some of Simon Cowell's put downs on the X Factor; it's fun for about 5 minutes, but hearing an 80 minute omnibus edition on You Tube would drive me insane.The film even fails for me at a very basic level; it isn't entertaining enough to make it fun to watch, it isn't fleshed out enough to make it a good character study or social commentary and for the most part it isn't interesting enough to keep you involved in the story.There are some other things that had me puzzled such as; what was the point of Fletcher asking Andrew to be there at 6am only for Andrew to turn up late and then Fletcher not be there? This thread was opened up without purpose. I also loved the fact that Fletcher claimed he knew that Andrew made him lose his job at the Schaeffer conservatory of music, but given the fact that he mistreated almost every student he taught how could he possibly know that it was Andrew that dropped him in it? This isn't a total shambles and it is, at least, fairly well made and Simmons is very good in his respective role and did at least not render the film totally unwatchable. Where Whiplash really comes good is in the final 15 minutes and in these 15 minutes we get more revelations here than we did throughout the 90 minutes or so that proceeded it. It was rather unexpected to watch Fletcher be prepared to sabotage his own big night just to show Andrew as being incompetent. To then see Andrew come back and show us some of his best drumming was absolutely fantastic. It's a pity that the earlier parts of this film did not have the same passion and intensity as the last 15 minutes.Ultimately, this is meant to show the pressure of show business and it's also about how being too self-absorbed can affect not only your own life, but the lives of others around you. It's just a shame that for the majority of its running time Whiplash tackles this in a repetitive and dull manner that offers little insight, commentary or entertainment. It does all three aspects to an extent in the last 15-20 minutes, but for me it was a case of too little too late.</fullReview>

Yes, JK Simmons is fantastic, but I want to know who the producer convinced that Simmons should have been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category rather than Best Actor in this movie. He's in plenty of the picture. Of course, he couldn't have won Best Actor, but he'd be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, which he won in spades.Towards the middle and continuing to the end, the plot became ridiculous. Getting smacked by an oncoming truck where your car flips over, and then running to make your concert? Physically attacking your teacher? Going back to play drums for the instructor that you despise, and then how does he not know a certain song will be played, when everyone else does? Didn't he have to practice with them...like ever?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a young drummer who us accepted into the most prestigious music school in New York. The teacher there is very strict, even abusive physically and psychologically. The story then tells how the enmeshed relationship between the two evolve.The music in "Whiplash" is great. It's like going to a jazz concert, especially the finale performance at the end. For the plot itself, however, I did not like it at all. The teacher is very abusive, and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students. The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse. Abuse is not right, and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong. That really angers me. Coupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse, it evoked a lot of anger in me.</fullReview>

No. It was unclear what JK Simmons' character really was after. Was it perfection? Is the only way to achieve perfection by humiliating students with verbal and physical abuse? The drumming was excellent. I'm a musician and I've never heard of students bleeding all over their drums. It's ridiculous. The only thing JK Simmons' character cared about was tempo. Talk about unidimensional. He crucified students only if they couldn't determine his tempo after a few beats. What about dynamics? What about interacting with the band? The script was superficial and lacking. People probably like this film because Simmons was an interesting character and the drumming was interesting. You'd think such a brilliant teacher would be a more impressive jazz pianist - another boring scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off the bat, you'll want to know this isn't a typical Hollywood story. The writer must have skipped day one of Screen writing 101, as he forgot to include a likable main character. From the first moment the teacher is introduced, you'll quickly develop zero sympathy for him. Less than zero, perhaps. He is, after all, the antagonist. So far, so good. In my ignorant and ill-informed opinion, the main problem with the movie is the student's character. We've already got a clearly defined villain, so how about somebody to root for? He seems to start out that way, but slowly he morphs into a borderline bad guy, as if under the spell of his mentor. After a while, one's only interest in the student is to hope for him to break free of his psychotic teacher. A day after seeing this movie, it's hard to believe it was nominated for an Oscar. From a technical standpoint, it was well made and featured good acting, but the story itself was somewhat off-putting. I'm a big fan of J. K. Simmons, but his character was so abrasive, I actually started looking forward to the scenes without him. Maybe it was the screenwriter's intent to make us feel uncomfortable. If so, he succeeded. Sadly, though, I can't say my life is any richer having seen this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's got no soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not just in the music, but the characters as well. There's no soul in the main character's musical drive--he doesn't do it for his love of music, but more for his desire for fame. When he gets rejected, he goes home and takes down all the posters of his drumming idols and disassembles his drum kit. Now, I might just be a novice drummer, but if I got let go from this asshole teacher's band, I would be much happier for it and continue drumming for fun, on my own accord. The kid doesn't seem to listen to much except the technical side of drumming (Buddy Rich), and focuses more on how fast he can hit the drum rather than how to incorporate the drums into the rest of the music. This movie makes it seem like the drummer is supposed to hog the show, or at least it celebrates it at the end. Sure, the kid was "pushing his boundaries", but it doesn't necessarily make for good music or make a good musician.This is without mentioning the parts that detract from the realism, such as his constantly bleeding hands (I don't think Charlie Parker or Buddy Rich lost a gallon of blood each session) or his incredible one-hit KO through the snare (I've tried this before, and am slightly less scrawny than this kid--no dice). There are only two characters in this movie. The rest are so flat I can hardly notice them. His love interest might as well have been left out because there isn't enough of her to make you care about their relationship, and what we do see is that he's kind of an arrogant douche boyfriend. Hard to relate to this type. There are good performances by the two characters, but that's the only thing carrying this movie. The writing is packed full with homophobic slurs that quickly tire out, and unconvincing dialogue abounds.I like drumming, I like jazz, and I respect musicians who work their asses off. But I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters. I found only superficial lessons (if "'Good job' kills artists" is even a lesson), and couldn't feel any heart in the music. I think most people were impressed with the well-acted shouting and fast drumming and "artistic insight". This is not how creative music is made, and, despite my hopes and wishes, this is not a creative movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmakers have paid for positive reviews for decades before IMDb, and I can't think of a way for IMDb to protect against false or paid input.Consider with WHIPLASH, this film proved nothing but limp at the box office, not to be found anywhere in the top 100 for 2014, yet there are 176,500 votes for it on IMDb and most are for 10, 9, or 8.Then consider this is unoriginal, badly acted, boring film.The hero wants to be the World's #1 musician. Fine! So he gets J V Simmons to scream obscene language in his face and plays his drums until his hands bleed (Ridiculous!) Let me tell you about course language. Any idiot can excel at it. King size fools like the J V Simmons character have nothing else to offer; else-wise they could communicate without it.The boy still goes to the movies with his Dad. Sweet! At the movies they distinguish themselves by adding Milk Duds to the large tub of popcorn and blabbing through the show, making other people move away.Later, he masters the courage to date the pop corn girl and takes her for pizza. Wow! This adds substance to the later scene when he dumps her because he needs the time for his music.There is just nothing original or interesting going on here.Whiplash is one of the very worst films of 2014. IMDb would be so much better if it was kept honest and clean. I hope the producers enjoyed the $1.60 we paid to rent the DVD, but next time I'll think twice before choosing anything from Sundance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reminded me of my high school band instructor who brutalized a number of students. Some had to be hospitalized and developed symptoms that debilitated them for life. One of the trombone players lost his front teeth when the instructor threw a metal chair at him, complaining that he wasn't in tune. Later, he told us he was only kidding, and that if the trombonist didn't know he wasn't in tune then he deserved it. Nobody ever thought they were out of tune again because they didn't want their teeth knocked out. One day he threw a cymbal at one of the alto sax players and cut into his thigh, severing an artery. He was later hospitalized and still has a limp. The instructor said he did it because he heard Charlie Parker was named "Bird" because he had a cymbal thrown at him, which makes no sense to me but what do you expect from a psychotic band instructor? He swore like a sailor too. I later found out he was in rehab for methamphetamine abuse. I'm so glad I gave up the trumpet. The heck with a music career, those people are crazy.</fullReview>

What surprises me is critical acclaim - it seems that critics aren't gotten far ahead from the public for which they write.As for the movie, it is grotesque, stupid sado-masochistic fiction, indulging bad taste and low inclinations of its viewers.Most sad thing is that someone not to bright might decide that this degenerative movie is actually depicting reality and will try to bring such kind of decay into the real life. From the other side, actual maniacs and degenerates might see this movie as an indulgence to their actions. Well, now I probably understood who those critics with positive reviews on this movie are :)3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all this time I've finally watched this. And yes, it reminded me of Full metal jacket, part one. I guess that Mr. Chazelle drew his inspiration from Kubrick and boy, did he make it right! Direction is perfect (including editing), fantastic performances by two main characters and fine choice of music. Beautiful photography also. This movie has everything to make it perfect, however Mr. Chazelle is not Mr. Kubrick but may probably be one day. If he tries hard enough to develop his own style. Do not give up now that you set the bar so high. All my compliments to the crew of this movie. Truly a gem. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture nominee, features a young college drummer with ambitions of greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with a drummer in action in a band room at the end of a long, dark hallway. It is the first encounter between student Miles Teller as Andrew and teacher J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Andrew is a student of great drummers, in a pizza joint with a girl he names the 1930s song playing and the drummer in the band. Attending this prestigious private music school in NYC is to be his springboard to greatness.But while he knew of Fletcher he didn't know what a wild man Fletcher was. Seemingly out of control in his over-the-top criticism of musicians who may be off just a little. And using ethnic and gender slurs to berate them. Such behavior probably would never be tolerated in a real school but it is necessary for the resolution of this story.Paul Reiser is good as the dad, Jim Neimann and cute Melissa Benoist (of Glee and the next Supergirl on TV) is Nicole, a girl Andrew starts dating but stops because he says it will not be compatible with his drive to be the best.JK Simmons won the Oscar for Best Supporting actor and the movie itself was in the running for Best Picture. Many fans think it should have won over "Birdman." The movie is hard to watch at times but it all pays off in the final couple of scenes. SPOILERS: After weeks of on-again, off-again verbal abuse Andrew snaps after failing to perform well after an automobile accident right before the performance. He rushes Fletcher on stage, tackles him, both are bloody, Andrew is kicked out of school. But a family representative of a former student who hanged himself convinced Andrew to witness to Fletcher's behavior, and he was terminated. But in an accidental meeting Fletcher asks Andrew to play drums for a gig, actually setting him up for failure by opening with a number Andrew did not know and didn't have the music for. However next Andrew began to play a hot number, stood up to Fletcher, had the other musicians come in, maybe Fletcher finally had his star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is already diminishing in my estimation minutes after watching, it's because it's about subjects that are dear to me, music, concentration, meaning in life and placement of ourselves in the larger music, but it has no insights to impart, or none that I have any use for.The whole is about ego pummeling away in the effort to be someone in the eyes others rather than the joy of the craft itself, about clinging on to achievement than flowing on the creativity of the moment, about perfecting technique than cultivating soul, what Spanish musicians know as duende; the deep urge that rises from the body and cries to express itself as music.Now I'm not a fanatic jazzist who thinks the music should be portrayed in some original light, the film may well be seen after all to be about confused individuals who miss the point, a bad teacher. But the bad teacher who only hammers home a trivial point is the filmmaker.We see how this clinging is more or less disastrous for everyone and derails them, it's also what puts them back on the stage. But I miss the deeper and softer insight here, for which jazz is a model, that we should indeed strive to perfect our craft, but that's so we can be able to use it freely and without obstruction, so that we can pierce through the sheet, the notation, to the real hum of music that spontaneously unfolds in the room where we play with others, become the instrument for music that plays itself.The film is in the end as small as what it shows, unable to pierce from merely polished technique to wonder or let go of fixation with accomplishment to begin immersion in fulfillment. It ends just as it would have to do that. It all builds up to a last scene of dueling between master and student for room in the stage that finally perhaps sublimates all the ego and hardship in music that sweeps both. In that scene we have a frantic display of ego as determination, but look at it this way and it becomes indirect revelation about ego; is his drum solo great music or only an elaborate flourish apart from the music that the music has to stop for?And this extends in a cinematic way, the scene is adroitly edited but is it anything more than a piece of mastered technique, mechanical? (I wrote last year about a film called A Spell to Ward off the Darkness which has a much more spacious swimming of the cinematic eye, also incidentally between instruments on a stage, but faced the same conundrum, soul wasn't there, duende. This is bar none the most striking limit in expression with a camera since the beginning of cinema, one that every great maker strives to push back and many have.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of its widespread critical acclaim and multiple award nominations and wins, I found Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' to be a rather thin and clichéd regurgitation of the tired "Driven artist, intense student/mentor relationship" trope with absolutely nothing fresh to say or offer up.I believe its reputation is primarily built upon the strong performances of its two leads, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Though both characters are paper thin, each actor absolutely inhabits them in a way that adds a dimension that isn't on the page. Their impressive performances only make me wish that much more that the material were up to their level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyped up melodrama / Offensive to the meaning of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash" on the surface is a tense, complex study of artistic struggle, obsession, and megalomania. I hated it. Not because it wasn't well constructed; not because it wasn't well acted; not because it wasn't well directed, it was all these things and more. No, I hated it for it's heart, its misguided insight into what art and beauty are truly about. It is not lost on me that any discussion or criticism about art could be argued to be completely subjective; I would still say that this movie does not reflect the beauty of art or do credit to the struggle of the artist. Thats not just my opinion either, to me that is a fact. I am not trying to argue an opinion here, I am actually commenting on something that I truly believe. It has been said that "Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty". I believe in Truth and truth can not be an opinion. "Whiplash" takes a swing at what it believes is necessary to reach that truth and fails completely at capturing what it means to be an artist. This movie would have one believe that suffering, obsession, sacrifice and ugliness are the building blocks that "great art/artist" are founded on. I couldn't disagree more. As an artist myself I understand how all these "negative" motivators can drive an artist to produce art, even to produce great art, yet I feel this movie celebrates them as a necessary right of passage. That in order to be great one has to work harder; it implies that those who are successful are those who have suffered and sacrificed the most, and those who aren't just didn't try hard enough.(How many great artist has history ignored only later to discover their beauty?) Perhaps most disturbingly It implies that one's self worth is dependent upon the reception of their art by an audience or someone outside themselves. Enter the "evil" music/art instructor who's job it is (by this movies logic) to push someone past what they think is possible to open up new untapped potentials hidden away by psychological blocks of complacency and self-pity by employing the tools of cruelty, manipulation and terror. All this hidden behind some BS ideal that their is some great nobility inherent in not depriving the world of a great artist no matter what the cost. GAG!! What overblown melodramatic tripe. I don't argue that we all couldn't use a swift kick in the pants occasionally in order to rise to our potential,or that honest criticism can be crucial to progressing as an artist but to ruthlessly and doggedly bully and torture someone in the hopes of achieving said effect is where i take offense. Who the hell gave him that cross to bare anyway!? There is a line. This movie even mentions this "line" at one point and comes really close to reaching a redemptive conclusion....then misses the mark entirely and descends into the abyss. At this point the movie could have had some valid commentary on the consequence of tyranny and obsession and lifted itself to having a message worth sitting through. I had a glimmer of hope that the movie"s heart was true and had been enact all along. Unfortunately this was not to be. The scene that twists the knife comes when; after being set up and sabotaged by Fletcher, Andrew rises to the occasion against all odds and puts on the performance of a lifetime. Had he done this despite the villainy of Fletcher and the movie just ended, then one could have left the movie with a certain ambiguity, open to contemplating the various themes and questions the movie raises about art and the artistic process. However the damning evidence of the movie's actual message comes during Andrew's fevered solo when despite everything Fletcher has done to Andrew there is a nod of acknowledgment from Fletcher that conveys the approval that Andrew has been so desperately seeking and the movie ends as if something triumphant and beautiful has been brought into the world. Uunnghhh! Never mind that Andrew is an obsessive with no sense of self (or self worth), never mind that Fletcher is a maniacal, narcissistic power drunk bigot (who may have even played a hand in pushing a young mind to suicide), never mind that there seems to be no consequences for any of these characters in their pursuit of greatness. No at this point the movie decided to celebrate this twisted moment as a triumph of art and truth. As if tormenting a person is how great art is born. No I don't think it is cool to celebrate this message nor do i think it is healthy to celebrate Fletcher's and Andrew's relationship as justified and productive. As an artist it offends me with its clichés, I feel it lacks insight, responsibility and any awareness as to the very purpose of art. Art doesn't have to be beautiful, art can be dark. It is both and it is neither. Art is truth and that is all I would ever ask of any form of expression. In "Whiplash" I got pandering, "Top Gun"-esque melodrama and a self indulgent study in cruelty that pretentiously masquerades as if it knows what it means to be an artist. (2 stars for the undeniably fine craftsmanship and performances, but on those alone does not a good movie make.) -Sizer</fullReview>

They way the bald bastard teacher physically and verbally abuses his students is plain disgusting. A clear example of exaggeration to give the story line a greater climax. A F#$%ING TRUCK crashes right into his car as he puts his phone down in the car. He shakes of the injuries (bloody arm, head, and face) and runs to his class to join Fletcher's performance. The acting can't be taken seriously, instead of being pulled into the movie, the Fletcher's bad acting and "over exaggerated" teaching style made me close the movie 30 minutes in.

		<shortDescription>Well acted, written and directed - but not infallible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a story about an extremely abusive music teacher (played by JK Simmons) who "pushes his students beyond expectations"; his student, in this case, is played by Miles Teller. Director Damien Chazelle based this film on this own life experience as a student jazz drummer in the thrall of an Alpha task-master. Understandably then, this is a very human story - yet slightly absurd at times. JK Simmons' character feels like he was ripped straight out of a comic book, and is incredibly intense to say the least. Miles Teller's character on the other hand is much more relatable, and generally a more human character. The narrative focuses on the latter character, who serves as an effective view-point for the story. One of the best parts of this film is the acting. The performances from both Miles Teller and JK Simmons are of the highest quality (JK Simmons won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 2015). Damien Chazelle effectively succeeded with both writing and directing - both of which made this one of the most intense films I have seen in a very long time. The place in which the movie falls down slightly is the ending. It feels very unlikely and also forced, and at the same time is clearly trying very hard to tie up all the jagged drama of the movie in one final swoop. In the end this is a very intense, well-acted movie that you are sure to remember for a long time, even if it's not quite the masterpiece it tries to be.</fullReview>

We aspire to be like the role models that we look up to and attach ourselves to. Not knowing that at times we are just as good as them. However, a lot of times our accomplishments are never enough to fill our satisfaction. This movie is a great reference to this. It is a good reminder that you have to be proud of yourself. One must acknowledge what one has accomplished in order to protect one's passion and sanity for the arts. Andrew takes us through his journey of this same experience. We are able to observe his determination turned to obsession, and hopefully learn from his story in creating our own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that rocked me to my core!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash was for sure one of the greatest movies in 2014.The things that are most outstanding is firstly the acting, including Miles Teller's performance of an promising drummer who also visits, as he says, the greatest music-institute in America and on the other hand J.K. Simmons who maybe offered the moviegoer of 2014 one of the best performances seen in a long period of time ( it's still a riddle why he was nominated as an supporting-actor).Secondly I would like to mention the sensationally effective way of how the editing was used to appeal to the viewer in a certain way, namely that camera and sound-editing work perfectly together and brought the movie on a exhilarating level. The story is thrilling, just the thought of having a (music-)teacher like Fletcher (J.K.Simmons) is simply a comparsion of yourself going through hell. Andrew (Miles Teller) has to do it. Does he enjoy it? Probably, well, pretty sure not...but he follows his plan of becoming one of the greatest drummers of all time although the pain for him is inconceivable. The "relationship" of these two definitely stands out and saying, that Fletchers' methods are near to rape (physically and psychologically) is not very understated. By giving Andrew a few "opponents" drumming his way through the studio-band makes the movie even more interesting and shows how deep and on point Miles Teller's acting can be. The movie is from the very beginning with the nice overture (after a few minutes) and other musically supports till the end with again some great acting amazing. It could be said more about this masterpiece but I would like to leave it right here as it is my first review. Go and watch it...NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An enthralling thrill ride of a movie about jazz. Yep, that's right. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a promising jazz drummer who has ambitions to be the very best. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is the cantankerous, exacting, conductor whom Andrew needs to impress if he is to fulfil his dream.The two leads perform brilliantly. Simmons launches into Fletcher's virulent tirades with savage gusto, his frightening demeanour and victimisation of the promising pupil creating the initial drama and tension. We feel for Andrew as he suffers the verbal and physical abuse meted out by his potential mentor. A battle of wills develops with Andrew determined not to simply accept every degradation heaped upon him.In the interests of tension and drama, it's overdone. Whilst immersed in the events taking place before you, you may not notice. The film is that powerful. But afterwards, you are likely to think how improbable it all was. Scenes between Andrew and both his father and girlfriend feel superfluous, interrupting the savage narrative of the battle between Fletcher and Andrew.It's this battle that results in events taking a different turn. We are made to see both sides. There is no goodie or baddie, it's the tale of two obsessions in conflict and the ensuing sparks that fly. Then we reach the dramatic finale (no spoilers here) and watch it unfold before us like the drawing back of a taught bowstring, wondering where the arrow will fly.Excellent, gut wrenching, roller-coaster movie. Prepare yourself accordingly!</fullReview>

So single-minded is he in this pursuit that he largely ignores other aspects of a normal, well-adjusted life, including personal relationships. The other primary character (J.K. Simmons in a career-defining role) is the most hard-ass music instructor ever. He curses, cajoles, intimidates and physically assaults his students, buffered by the philosophy that if he does not, they will never achieve greatness. Neither lead character will yield, and from that premise and tension flows the drama and some incredible jazz music.</fullReview>

He would revenge. Fletcher is like a male version of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada, only severer. Can't imagine if someone suddenly throws hard object at me.Having watched this movie got me thinking that I haven't done enough for my dreams. I feel so small. Somehow I feel Andrew is too obsessed.

		<fullReview>I like when Hollywood dares to cast a young actor that doesn't fit their standards of beauty. The lead worked extremely well with his character and quite frankly, I think that's what kept me riveted. Adversity fuels him, exhaustion is merely an obstacle in his path. The actor's nervousness and receptivity is mesmerizing and will entrap you in his world. The camera could have pulled a Lars Von Trier, standing just behind his shoulder and it would have felt the same.While the audience isn't courted so much into caring for the characters, the story does bring its emotional content with themes that appeal to everyone. The desire to make something out of your life, the sacrifices, the labour. But who knows how it will end? It's different for each of us.JK Simmons was remarkable and his chemistry with the lead could have been better but it was sufficient. It was just enough to hold the movie together.Now the bleeding hands were great at first but that quickly wore down. Everyone one of us who's ever played an instrument (which is everyone), knows the hardship isn't in the playing but in the accuracy. I get that his main struggle was to keep up the fast beat but as I said, the bleeding hands metaphor quickly wore down. If it had been a trombone, would they have made his lips bleed? The fingers of a piano player? It was just too much. Sweat would have sufficed.Ups and downs - not the greatest movie I've seen this year, but good. Pretty good. It's an 8/10 for me; would recommend it to a specific crowd only.</fullReview>

I knew the general idea of the story and of its reputation, but it's hard to be prepared for the actual level of intensity and visceral emotion put into the performance. This is the kind of movie that deserves a close watch and attention to detail; it's by no means light watching or something to "turn on in the background." This is completely uncompromising and gripping drama that may also hold additional interest for drummers, jazz aficionados, or anyone who works at a craft that requires copious amounts of practice. The basic synopsis for this story is that Andrew is an aspiring jazz drummer at a music conservatory who will stop at nothing to achieve greatness, and his teacher Fletcher is a jazz band director who will stop at nothing to unlock greatness. One might think that this combination of goals should allow for a fruitful and cooperative partnership, but the way that the two go about pushing themselves to find this greatness is as destructive socially as it is constructive musically. This space isn't meant to give deep film analysis, so suffice it to say that this is one of several interesting ironies found within this story. Without getting into any finer plot points or spoilers, the meat of this film lies in watching Andrew fall into complete social isolation and obsessive/unhealthy practice habits to improve, while Fletcher pushes him in some less than conventional (and often illegal) methods that would make R. Lee Ermey or Louis Gossett Jr. blush. The contrasting notions of respect, conflict and hatred between the characters are extremely compelling throughout.Your mileage may vary, but this movie was a solid 10/10 for me. As long as you aren't overly sensitive or have a short attention span, I think the film brings a lot to the table. First of all, the acting is absolutely superb. JK Simmons is always good, but he's never been better than in this film. He plays Fletcher to the point where he draws so much contempt from the audience that it can be easy to forget he is just playing a role at times... and yet, there is this slightest twinkle of humanity that he manages to hold onto and instill somewhere deep within the character that leads you to wonder whether or not there is any actual goodness present and the nature of his true motives. The sights and sounds of the movie are top notch. The cinematography is a very strong point for the film. While the film sets aren't particularly interesting, and don't need to be for this film, the frenetic action drumming shots from various perspectives really feed the emotion and intensity of this film. The audience can feel Andrew's pain and his triumph as he physically and mentally pushes himself through these performances. There are a lot of great perspective shots off of the cymbals and drum heads. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a drummer in real life, and did perform these parts to a certain extent, but a ton of expert editing went into this movie to make the performances look 100% accurate and legitimate to actual musician viewers. Aurally, there's a good selection of well-mixed jazz numbers in this movie that really bring it to life.This movie is not for everyone, some people will always only feel comfortable with lighter fare and a more conventional plot sequence. However, in my eyes, this does not detract from the rating. Art doesn't need to make compromises. Greatness doesn't need to make compromises. This is a main theme of the film. Realize this: this film's very existence and earned success in modern mainstream cinema is almost an exact mirror of the struggle that Andrew and Fletcher face in their quest to create something legendary and lasting. Uncompromising and goal-oriented, unwilling to bend or show any leniency for social awareness... and yet the movie was able to garner an 8+ IMDb rating and 90%+ on other critic aggregate sites. There is no doubt in my mind: if this film reined it in a bit and adopted a more conventional and digestible story, it would have not received the same amount of critical or audience acclaim. The film is absolutely relentless from start to finish in the best way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to give credit where it is due. Everything about this film from a film making perspective was spot on. J.K. might have done a bit of an overacting job but still good film making. Now in reality. It would be nice if a musician, any musician could watch this and connect with it in any way possible. It was absolutely ridiculous. This is not the dynamic of any conservatory anywhere. The most backwards scene in the film is in the beginning. But I would say it would be hilarious if they played out what would happen if you actually hit a drummer. If makes me wonder if the film makers have actually befriended a drummer in their entire lives. Of course they're not all the same but I've never met one in any genre of music that would tolerate that for a second. I literally thought it was going like a dark comedy route at that point but alas they played it off as if that's how things really work. It was really a silly movie when it comes to the real life conservatory, Jazz or otherwise. Some teachers might be a bit tough, but the whole full metal jacket routine was nonsense. They'd be laughed out of the classroom. Great musicians have huge egos. This BS would just not be tolerated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critique from a drummer and a human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Only mild, generalized spoilers ahead, do not worry.) I have played the drums in a Big Band for over 15 years, from my teenage years until well into adulthood. 90% of the time with another drummer, sharing duties. Which is exactly the scenario here, so naturally, i was intrigued by this movie. And it started off promising. A young drummer is eventually invited to practice with a prestigious Big Band. Many of the little details depicted here are pretty much on point.But i cannot begin to describe my disappointment in what unfolded on the screen. The drummer and the band leader (and even the other band members) display such sorry behavior that it becomes tough to endure. You want to raise your voice to the band leader, in place of the drummer and other band members, who fail miserably to stand up for themselves. Instead, you have to endure scenes of bullying and manipulation, and people taking it lying down, like prison inmates going through a boot camp.Only the behavior shown here is worse. The people in this movie are not desperately trying to reduce the length of their prison sentence. Instead, they are desperate for acceptance, for approval, for prestige, for fame. They accept humiliation, they accept being put down, and they do not stand up for themselves. On the contrary. They think that this is alright. They have embodied the whole twisted concept of it all. A society where striving for fame and for outside approval beats any sort of moral values. But shouldn't these values be the most important? To think for yourself and to stand up for yourself, to have values and to defend your values, when people try to coerce you, manipulate you or attack you? But we see people that were brainwashed enough to play along with this farce. Worse, to even support it in a way.If this wasn't troubling enough, what also puzzles me is the overwhelming praise this movie gets by critics and viewers alike. Have we really become so morally degenerated and cynical that this sort of story is now worthy of the IMDb Top 100 Greatest movies of all time? Let me clarify, my objection is not about the production values, the actors (well, a bit), the camera-work or anything like that. It's about the story that's being told, which is the most important part by far, after all.Another thing: This is supposed to depict the act of playing music together, which should be a joyful thing. Playing in a band is a celebration, a give-and-take between the players, an almost sacred and highly social interaction. And a band leader is good when he gives advice, not critique. When he develops people instead of using people. When he motivates instead of manipulating. When he inspires enthusiasm instead of fear. When he is leading, not bossing around. In this movie, they get everything wrong.Overall, i'm thoroughly disappointed with this movie on several levels. I reluctantly have to give this Top 100 movie the lowest score, simply due to the overwhelming urge it gave me to stop watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing glorification of sadism and masochism using excellence as an excuse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie delivers a truly disturbing and sick message to impressionable young people. The carrot that it dangles is "excellence:" and "immortality", but the ugly reality is that this movie is about a sadist, sociopath music teacher who enjoys mentally, verbally and to a lesser extent, physically, torturing his students. The supposed drive for excellence is only the rationalization that the douche bag uses to get away with it. Excellence can and has been achieved without resorting to this sort of mental violence.Even more disturbing than Fletcher is Andrew, his student. Only someone with extreme low self esteem would subject themselves to the level of abuse he accepts. Andrew obviously has some serious psychological issues because he sabotages himself at critical moments so that Fletcher can have more reasons to insult and demean him. He seems unable to set an alarm clock, pay attention when he is driving and even more preposterously for a person supposedly obsessed with becoming the greatest drummer the world has ever seen, he forgets his drumsticks at a critical moment. The only conclusion you can draw is that he is a masochist.This movie is really about homoerotic sadomasochism, complete with jealousy fits. It's not about music or the drive for excellence. Make no mistake about it.</fullReview>

The only redeeming part was the great orchestral jazz, but the characters, story and, well everything really, means this movie should not be getting the positive reviews it has. Where in the world would anyone be able to get away with treating students like this? It's utterly ridiculous cr** and I cannot believe this was even given approval be made in these days of human rights and anti bullying. What a disgrace. In addition, we found the story so predictable - it was sort of like a REALLY bad Rocky but based on music, except Rocky had heart, soul and a relatable endearing underdog story. All the characters in this were totally unlikeable, unrelatable and awful, who cares what happens to any of them? All in all this is an over-hyped horrible sad attempt at movie making and a great opportunity totally missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A misguided, erroneous, fallacious, manufactured, pseudo depiction, of Americas most beloved crown jewel, and most eminent, and revered art form...Jazz. It is upsetting, sad, and disappointing, that this movie will be someone's introduction to jazz, and insults those who support it. I am not a music authority, or historian., but know of the power of music., and that great art, has been sparked and composed from strong emotions, and adversity., i.e. "the desire to escape suffering leads us to think, create, and strive, thereby fulfilling our potential---suffering was not created for its own sake, but only to spur us on to new heights through dissatisfaction with the status quo"., not by bullying. I believe in artistic license, and a good yarn, but feel jazz should be painted with genuine hues of authenticity. This film, for me, was a missed opportunity, of something much greater, than what it was attempting, and ultimately failing to portray. A few of my personal favorite Jazz movies are...'Round Midnight (1986), endorsed by Clint Eastwood, from the Monterey Jazz Festival, Thank You Clint! and the documentary, Icons Among Us, Jazz in the Present Tense (2009)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fake, fake, fake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My contrary reaction to the phony film WHIPLASH:1. Fake jazz: Jazz is the vehicle to tell this story, but what we get is not jazz but rather the academic teaching of big band/orchestral music, emphasizing arrangements and perfecting the technique of one's instrument. Same film could have been better scripted about a classical symphony orchestra at a university. Jazz is about improvisation and the interplay between musicians, as seen in a small group context. Big bands as seen here are more evident nowadays at sporting events. The only solo was the hero's mediocre drum solo at film's end.2. Fake theme/ending: Theme of the movie is the importance of motivation &amp; rigor to promote excellence, in the context of a student, and the pitfalls of the martinet. In movies, for audience manipulation and dramatic purposes a theme is often betrayed at the end, most famous case being Alec Guinness's sudden reversal at the climax of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, because an audience expects the damn bridge to be blown up, even though his character spent the previous 2 hours with every fiber of his being symbolically building it. In WHIPLASH the finale contradicts everything previously in the script, not to be even-handed but to falsely convey a message that "maybe" true artistry and achievement stems from the horrible inspiration we've witnessed. Totally bogus and phony.3. Fake characters: Given jazz's history, the two major characters - protagonist and antagonist, should have been Black. The filmmakers have every right to make them whatever they want, perhaps a female teacher and a girl drummer would have been interesting, but that also would not have fit the use of jazz as movie's central core. My reaction to the whitened-up story was the same reaction as I would have to a '50s movie biography of Fats Domino played by Pat Boone, whose early career was essentially spurred by the industry (and specifically his record label) customarily ripping of a Black artist (Fats) with a white artist (Pat) singing his songs for a general audience. Same crappy approach here.4. Fake gimmicks: Many gimmick scenes in WHIPLASH would have been blue-penciled and not made it into the final script had this been a TV episode rather than an independent ("anything goes") feature film -the writers' room would not have permitted them to slip through. Most notable is the hero's car accident and arriving late and bloody to unsuccessfully try and perform at the big concert contest, when the band's other drummer was perfectly capable of going on in his stead. Not merely unbelievable but farcical as directed here. Final reel of him conned into appearing with no charts for songs he had never seen or heard before was an asinine gimmick, almost as stupid as him returning to suddenly lead the orchestra himself, all for fake-dramatic purposes. And maybe even worse the scene that made me want to leave the screening: his blow-off of his girl friend telling her his need to practice and succeed would not leave enough time for their relationship to continue. That must have looked bad on the page and it didn't play at all on the screen.5. Fake performance: I have praised J.K. Simmons many times, and you can read my rave review for him on IMDb for his role in the obscure comedy NEW IN TOWN. But his facile, surface performance here is just the kind that wins awards (it surely did), but pales into comparison to many others playing essentially the same role. I will merely cite Robert Duvall in THE GREAT SANTINI or Lou Gossett Jr. in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN as the most vivid in recent memory. I found his playing closer to the psychotic of Humphrey Bogart in THE CAINE MUTINY than to what the role called for.6. Fake icon: Buddy Rich is elevated to god-like status in WHIPLASH, a reactionary and outdated concept that I reject entirely. In show biz history I would nominate Rich for iconic status as a jerk, not a musical artist. In jazz history, the logical icon and role model here would be Art Blakey, since not only is his importance in modern (post-WWII) jazz secure but more to the point he became the archetypal leader and inspiration to hundreds of musicians who graduated from his band, ranging from formative stints for Wayne Shorter and the Marsalis Bros. to little-known connections with artists as varied as Chick Corea and Chuck Mangione, both of whom I saw appear with Blakey's Jazz Messengers in Boston in 1966.. Unlike the teacher posited in WHIPLASH as a Dick Cheney-like nut, Blakey motivated rather than tortured his young acolytes. Buddy Rich and his mediocre '60s big bands yielded nothing, and as a drummer he was all technique and zero jazz.7. Fake porn: Categorically WHIPLASH (the title is perhaps the key hint) is a type of soft-core pornography, among other things. It's another movie example of the trends in recent years to substitute sadomasochism for traditional sexual porn - namely the thousands of horror films about torture and sadism appealing to the audience to alternately identify with and then hiss the sadist as protagonist, or more recently the oncoming trend that will be inspired by the success of 50 SHADES OF GREY. The movie's domination theme is obvious, but the submission aspect is way more subtle -masked by the hero's natural rebelliousness. Looking beyond him we have a score of submissives -his fellow band mates who are humiliated (a key element of BDSM cinema) throughout the film. This as entertainment is the definition of pseudo-porn, acceptable to the masses because it does not involve "money shots" and explicit penetration making it soft-core rather than hardcore. The absence of sex in WHIPLASH is no different than the absence of actual sex in most BDSM exercises.8. Fake setting: L.A. substituting for NYC = zero atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to strictly avoid using expressions with musical terms, or that's what I would say if I knew several. Whiplash left me puzzled. It was maybe a labor of love, being a pet project of writer-director Damien Chazelle, of whom I've never heard of before. The movie seems to be an indie film with a staple of an action movie thrown in for good measure. A car accident, viscerally shown. Lately since the noughties it has been easier to show car crashes. So I'm assuming this one was thrown in to appeal to a wider range of fans.There are a few things I don't understand about the movie. Like the drum kit is one of the loudest and least quiet instruments of all. So how can the father (Paul Reiser), be so surprised about Andrew's virtuosity? Also The kid, the trumpet player, who 'supposedly' was playing false, really WAS playing false! All these little surprises didn't gel with me, because a) They were stupid b) They would work only if the hero was less smart than a comatose monkey, which in the movie, he was c) they shouldn't have mentioned Casey hanged himself because it's a distraction and you think he should have been the subject of the film d) the twists prevented us from knowing more about Andrew.The regrettable thing about Whiplash is that there is only one person who got the perfect amount of limelight, treatment, and attention, and that was J.K Simmons. The others got the same level of detail, which was wrong. Andrew is shown as a boy playing drums, and before that at a family dinner. He also dates a girl briefly. He is a very quiet lad with his band and with his girlfriend but surprisingly smart-Aleck and runs his mouth like a machine gun when the story asks for it. Not my tempo. That's all I had to say, hope you found the review helpful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is an astounding piece of modern day cinema. Its a film that leaves you physically shaking even after the second watch and with a complete sensory overload as you try to reconcile every element of that film that seems to have been seamlessly and passionately crafted. All that I hope is that Whiplash is not too overpraised in the sense that future audiences may meet it with harsh expectations and come away underwhelmed. Part of what made the first experience so special was that I had no expectations, I saw a short trailer and it was at a convenient showing time.Its excitement may dwindle, like sussing out a roller coaster, following its turns and loops from the ground before you even hit the queue. Whiplash is adrenaline cinema and is best met head on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the acting by JK Simmons was very good, and yes the storyline was compelling regarding greatness, and how greatness is found and nurtured, or in this case abused.The idea is our society is too friendly and politically correct to be able to develop great musicians. The interesting concept of the film is that the mentor is as important as the mentee, which of course we already knew, but the idea was that the mentor must be willing to push the mentee in ways or manners the mentee would not do otherwise. Very interesting concept that could yield hours of interesting debate over a bottle of wine and a cigar.However, the movie does not behave like an Indy film, but like a Hollywood picture. There is far too much drama. The primary character (Andrew Nieman) bleeds no less than three times during the movie on his trap set! Seriously, bleeding! He gets in a car accident, rolls his car over, and runs to the recital he was late for while bleeding and unable to control his limbs from the trauma.Then there's the complete lack of character development of ANY of the characters in the movie. Why is Andrew Nieman so obsessed with music that he breaks-up with his girlfriend because he thinks she will eventually get in the way? JK Simmons is good, but sorry, I don't know why he behaves the way he does, nor would his style ever be effective, or accepted at any college, private or public.The idea that Charlie Parker became great because he had a symbol thrown at him is extremely trite and irrelevant to greatness. Again, this is not an accurate representation of the truth. The reason we don't have any modern Charlie Parker's is because our society doesn't care about Jazz music any longer, in fact it's the butt of many jokes. Jazz was played everywhere in Parker's day. You could buy a saxophone at JC Penny's for Pete's sake. Today, you can barely buy a saxophone at a music store. The fact of the matter is that people become great in areas that the people care about; football, basketball, baseball, and in the arts symphony orchestra. Yo-Yo Ma is one of the greatest cello players of all time. So did he become great because he had some dude yelling profanities in his ear? NO! How about 50,000 hrs of practice, and prospect of getting rich and being adored.So much hype and very little substance behind it I'm afraid, unless of course your used to watching Marvel superhero movies, so you've become abundantly inept at recognizing a good film unless it slapped you in the face. Which of course, JK Simmons does slap Peter Parker, I mean Andrew Nieman :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is high on my Top 10 Most Over-rated Movies in recent years list.Posh school authority can act like mafia lord and cause great psychological/ physical/ property damage - and students of the free-est nation on earth had no guts to give him a third finger, or laugh out loud, or throw it back at the abuser, change school, make police report...etc etc? Instead the "good guy" bleed on to get....approval? Or pay high price to get...tiny little revenge victory? Seriously? The moral(s) of this story: there WILL NOT BE justice - and that is why good people (like poor little me) resign to cowering and performing tedious soul-destroying grunt work to get breadcrumb of approval. But the actors are good and emotionally convincing despite the absurdity of it all, and the production value is high quality. So I'm not going to mock the general audience for buying into "OMG getting a music degree is even harder than qualifying to be a dental surgeon!".I do fault Hollywood for scaring off potential big dollar music school customers especially from overseas. Even the most militant tiger moms would think twice now sending their children to American music college now! Oh no. lol.Musicians - music school or self-taught, classical or pop, will find the two leads sado-masochistic professor-student interaction utterly ridiculous at first, and then resigned to just laughing at the writer/director's desperate attempts at "creating conflict and dramatic tension" where there is, well, little. Musical craft is just boring, sustained repetition. The rest, talent/ greatness, is individual.What shocks me the most are not even pro critics high praise - these are cynics by nature. Why shocks me is how people seem to be okay with being abused and shamed and scapegoated in the open, in supposedly civilized places, work or academia. In more conservative modern Asia, yes I can understand high rating for this movie, people resonate with a "good guy" who "endure" absurd level of undeserved abuse. But the West? Really?Integrity is not just a nice virtue on paper. It is a survival necessity. Financial survival, and artistic survival. I need a lead I can respect, and root for. I can't root for this one. Not even at the end when he attempted to fix the situation. Some may find that heroic. To me it was too little, and too late - for him. The favorable rating of this movie is probably saying... 1. Unreported criminal abuses by authorities in USA academic institutions are under-reported2. There are more Stockholm Syndrome sufferers among educated adults of the world than I thought.Watch it for the good acting performance, mediocre musical craft. Brace yourself for unnecessary cartoon brutality.</fullReview>

What his film try to communicate about practicing and being the best musician is absurd. I stopped half way through the film, I just couldn't watch this non-sense anymore.

		<fullReview>Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew, a young expert drummer who joins a jazz band at a local music conservatory. The band is conducted by no one other than Terence Fletcher (played by J.K Simmons), a ruthless and ill-tempered band teacher, who has a reputation of ridiculing his students and abuses them whenever a mistake is made. As Andrew competes in the band, he learns that Fletcher demands not for effort, but for excellence.This is one of the most powerful films I have recently. Miles Teller and J.K Simmons show off their best performances of their careers. While the film was outstanding, it was very tough to watch at times. J.K Simmons fiercely tackles the role of the band teacher who has an extremely bad temper towards his students and pushes them intensely to make sure they perform flawless during the upcoming concerts. Simmons does not play around with his role. His character was someone who would be a good fit for a drill sergeant. When his students mess up by just slightly getting off tempo, he would curse consistently, throw chairs, and even slap them in the face. Simmons excels his performance so well that you can almost literally feel his anger. In several scenes, I felt my heart pounding due to authenticity of his character's emotions.Miles Teller exhibited a great performance as well. I loved how his character was constantly struggling through his band teacher's abuse, yet he does not want to quit because he knows that his teacher believes he has the skills to succeed. The drumming scenes were amazing and very electrifying to the point where you will want to cheer at the end.Director Damien Chazelle did a fantastic job as a director, and the movie was amazing, even when it got little intense.</fullReview>

I could have predicted the ending in the first 10 minutes.At various points it just descends into comical farce, but not in a good way.It also sends the damaging message to everyone that abuse between teacher and student ends up being beneficial, so in the end the film defends and supports that abuse.How this film can ever be considered to be in the top 100 movies ever made is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abuse, Envy, Betrayal and "Jazz?" Oh, my!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential..." or so the description goes. In reality, though, the only thing Fletcher - the "band leader" - wants to do is destroy anyone with more talent than he, which includes about everyone else after hearing his attempt to "play jazz"near the end of the film. (Truly awful, mediocre and banal. And, NOT jazz!) Fletcher is a one-dimensional combination of Mo'Nique's character in Precious and Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) from Amadeus. His intent is to destroy talent, not nurture it, especially when he runs across what he considers real talent. His motivation is pure envy. His character is not only a complete fraud and liar - Charlie Parker's nickname "Bird" came from his childhood, long before he picked up his first sax and had nothing to do with a "cut session" later in life - he's a psycho-sadist who has no business "teaching" anyone anything.Those of us who truly love jazz gag at every reference to Buddy Rich. Rich, while a remarkably talented drummer technique-wise, was no jazz drummer. He simply didn't have the soul and he knew it, which goes a long way in explaining his recording studio antics. He, too, was a jealous, egotistical jazz wannabe, much like Fletcher.The editing of this film reminds me of "film school 101" where the first assignment in editing class is to cut a piece of film to music. It's amateur at best. End of story.But rarely have I seen a film where one scene was so completely out of place that, in retrospect, it completely undermines any positive intention the film may be attempting. I'm talking about the dinner table scene, where Andrew's father humiliates him in front of family and friends gathered for a meal. The dad's later declaration that he "would do anything" to protect his son from abuse rings as hollow as the film itself. That entire scene should have been left of the cutting room floor. It did nothing for the film except destroy the narrative, the characters truthfulness, and the overall "theme" of the film itself, although I'm not quite sure the director, writers, actors, etc, were actually aware of what they were attempting to achieve.One glaring "oops:" Fletcher is hired to conduct a JVC gig at Carnage Hall - probably by bullying someone. He invites Andrew to play the drums (seems he needs a drummer on short notice). But honestly, would someone in this position actually organize such a prestigious event without having a back-up drummer just in case Andrew fails to show? I think not. But, that's what happens. And, it's a mess.Thankfully, this "film" has an antidote in The Theory of Everything, a great film about a true genius and what it takes to nurture one to fruition. Whiplash cannot fall into the abyss of obscurity soon enough as far as I'm concerned. Oh, and the soundtrack sucks, big time. Jazz? Not even close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Consequence of Ambition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chazelle delicately directs the film to have that sense of crisp and sound ? one that's quite hard to find nowadays. He magically transforms violent and abusive scenes into something extremely watchable without dismissing pity. There is never a camera angle that is out of place, no wasted detail in its frames. This is one film that can teach LES MISERABLES (2012) Director, Tom Hooper, how to effectively use extreme close ups, without having to waste pure emotions and sheer talent.WHIPLASH presents a decent, yet violent argument that exalts the student and polarizes the discipline. This is a story where the teacher simply becomes the tool to the artist's journey to becoming what he really is. Or may be not. At some point, the teacher becomes a separate entity in the learning experience. At some point, the teacher has ambitions of his own, far detached from what his own learners think and dream. At some point, the teacher finds his learners as his competitors in the race to greatness.It's an absurd tragedy, though still arguably triumphant on its own.What WHIPLASH argues is that beyond learning lies a greater and more painful path to ambition, and to get there, one does not need anyone but himself. It is a story that challenges the collaborative norm in education. It is an anti-social thesis on refinement and discipline, yet it is still something worth looking into. It does not give you that moral lesson that you are waiting for. Amidst the loud, energetic sounds of Andrew's sweaty, bloody, jazz drum set, it whispers to you that the road to glory is made of brimstones from hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Clean's alter ego meets Little Drummer Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never realized Mr Clean has an alter ego or maybe it's an evil twin found in Fletcher. And poor Little drummer boy Andrew - what a glutton for punishment or was it just his need for approval? Either way the black shirted Nazi drill Sargent Fletcher got his jollies dehumanizing pitiful little Andrew in class with some of the most low-brow inflamed language of hate.The plot is simple. Little drummer boy Andrew wants to be a famous drummer in jazz (a music style nobody really listens to in the 21st Century) so off to a fancy music school he goes. The Nazi black shirted drill Sargent Fletcher pegs Andrew quickly as 'easy pick-ins' for his bubbling wrathful personality. This is most of the movie - Andrew covered in blood, sweat, and tears while Fletcher barks at him like a angry rottweiler. Finally Andrew has enough and has Nazi drill Sargent Fletcher ejected from the school. Little drummer boy gives up drumming.Then little drummer boy Andrew hooks up with angry Nazi drill Sargent to play at Carnegie Hall. (At this point I was just laughing) The barking Fletcher uses this moment to humiliate Andrew again only this time in front of an audience! Little drummer boy wins Fletcher's affection by playing his drums so ferociously he's once again (for about the tenth time) covered in blood, sweat &amp; tears. Fletcher smiles! The end.This is a hopelessly boring movie - I felt sorry for Teller as he through himself into this no dimensional role of Andrew. As for Simmons - please stop with the cranial closeup shots - yuk!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In fairness, I probably shouldn't write a review or give a rating as I walked out after an hour. After all of the many positive reviews of this film I couldn't wait to see it. This movie is like a twilight version of Glee. The teacher throws a chair at the main character, the drummer... thank God the drummer ducked otherwise he'd be dead. The teacher both physically and mentally abuses Andrew. This teacher would never be allowed to teach in the best music school in the country and he has no passion for the music, he's a robot.It seems to me that a lot of viewers are equating yelling, swearing and violence with intensity and great movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story doesn't convince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On 13 November Whiplash ? directed by Damien Chazelle starring Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons ? will premier at the Netherlands cinema. This movie about an ambitious and talented drum player and his dominant, relentless teacher, is expected to do well, based on the positive reception it had in many countries and at several festivals. Even before its release the movie opened the Leiden International Film Festival, and won the LIFF Indie Competition. General appreciation is also shown at IMDb, where the film scores 87/100 with about 4400 votes.The story that the movie brings forward is not new. Andrew, a young drum player, enrolls at the high-class, well-reputed Shaffer Conservatory, where he meets Fletcher, an infamous teacher working with high standards and non-compromising methods. Andrew attracts his attention and a struggle between the two characters begins when Andrew secures the position of first drum in the school band practicing for the national school competition. The movie focuses on the two main characters, and the way in which they interrelate with the aim to realize the best drum performance for the school's honor, but more so for their own prestige and ego.Although the movie excels in cinematography, acting and music ? provided you at least like some level of jazz music ? the story doesn't seem to convince. The strict focus on the two men and their sole purpose leads to repetition in the narrative, following the cycle of insult and pressure from the teacher, hard work and pain by the student, and short-term victory for both when a performance succeeds. Even at the end of the movie, when things seem to turn around, the teacher again tries to push the student into a great performance, which he indeed delivers.Additional characters, such as the student's father, girl friend or other musicians at the school, are just there to support the main story. They never get any depth or backgrounds, and their role is minimal; they are there to underline how determined and ambitious Andrew really is. The school functions as decor, with musicians as extra's and no sign of a board, other teachers or school infrastructure.Focusing on one aspect of a human relationship can produce interesting and compelling movies, but Whiplash is not a good example. Besides the elimination of all surrounding factors, there is another possible reason why the story doesn't convince me. The general idea underlying the story is that real talent blossoms with hardship and pain. Consequently, the message is delivered that it is good to bully and mistreat a student with talent, so that he or she gets to full development. To my mind this message is not true, at least not always, and needs more justification than a flat, straight story about two egocentric men struggling for power and recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleeding Passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People may quickly picture Whiplash as the Full Metal Jacket of jazz band: there's Fletcher militarily pushing his student, Andrew, to get his task right. The hatred towards the mentor becomes the character's motivation of achieving his orders perfectly; and the similarities could end there. Although this is a very different context; the harsh, shout-y discipline and sometimes its negative human effects are quite reminiscent. But without any grim twists, this movie just sticks directly to one's determination of being successful to his job, either for the instructor or for himself. This is one rough environment that takes you to a relentless study of intense rehearsals and intense discipline until it reaches to the point where their goals lose out of control. And just like those sequences, Whiplash keeps most of the viewers from their comfort zone, and leads them to rewarding results.Movies like this, specifically relationship between a student and a mean teacher, conventionally ends with a heart changing sentiment, possibly leading the two to an unexpected life-long friendship, but Whiplash takes it stone-cold; hardly showing any sign of friendliness in their bond. The only way for the young drummer to gain his own light is to roll with the punches and learn exactly what the band want him to do, even if it costs much of what he has in life. This is supposed to be an image of inspiration, but the film mostly portrays the nightmares of this "never give up" ambition; which transforms the dreamer into a mad man who is few steps away of breaking down. Nonetheless, this unending pressure brings real impact to what lesson this movie is trying to show.The filmmaking is spectacular all in all, each of its musical scenes makes for a truly grandeur show, but the core here are the ones that is mainly about the drums. They are impressively played with relentless intensity, while the camera strikingly displays the flowing literal sweat and blood of the drummer; indicating his committed exhaustion. The performances are the spotlight, especially J.K. Simmons who has done perfect to his character. It might have been easy for an overacted performance, but Simmons finds the sense of humanity beneath what it's written, making Fletcher reasonable to furiously shout at any intolerable flaw of his students. Miles Teller also killed it, recognizably for the drumming parts, but aside of that, he convincingly follows through the character's obsession, until he turns closer to insanity.Whiplash often feels cruel, but there is an important reason for that. It depicts a serious way of motivation, you can feel that in every beat of his terrifyingly breathtaking drum performances; this is mostly the reality of being unstoppable to what you are desperately aiming for, plus driven by fear and hate. But eventually, the film makes a clear point why their world of music have to be this bitter. Overall, it all works by choosing clever directions, staging magnificent musical set pieces, and remarkable acting from its two leads. Even if the story is quite simple, its heart tends to overwhelm you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathtaking, intense and exciting are all words to the describe the recent whiplash. A movie about what it takes to become the best is a masterclass of storytelling and a REVELATION on editing. The editing in this movie during the music scenes is flashy and it works extremely well. This allows the movie to extremely exciting to the point where you feel like standing up.Miles Teller does his job and JK Simmons steals it. His character had multiple layers and on re watches you can really see how despicable he is, even though it doesn't explicitly show us.The soundtrack is enough to get any common citizen into jazz, it's that catchy and great.

		<shortDescription>Fletcher's method is completely wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story mainly focuses on the relationship between a gifted music student, Andrew and his master, Fletcher. It turns out that this master uses an absolutely wrong method to deal with his students. Fletcher behaves more as a sergeant whose role in barracks is to form brute soldiers using violence, intimidation and humiliation, instead of behaving as an educator whose mission is to encourage his students to strive for excellence. I believe that values as love, friendship, solidarity, cooperation, team spirit, respect, stimulation of the self-confidence are more important to stimulate someone to focus on the search of excellence than threats and humiliating critics which undermine the self- confidence. Who is humiliated use to have one of these two reactions: he becomes traumatized and flees the challenges, or develops e great hatred against who has humiliated him. I believe much more in the approach of Andrzej Kijowski in the story The Orchestra Conductor, directed by Andrzei Wajda, where the conductor succeeds to improve the quality of the musicians of the orchestra that he conducts, by improving their self-confidence and not their hatred.</fullReview>

This is the way story telling should be done, not with one dimensional characters or feuds driven by murder but real emotions like jealousy, pride and respect. It is refreshingly original to walk through a characters experiences of hate and disdain, only to arrive at the same feeling of validation and respect at the end of the film, making Whiplash a truly cathartic experience. rightfully referred to as a thriller because it draws on the excitement of the mundane modern life and puts the audience through an emotional roller-coaster that is heightened by the use of sound and lighting that creates this visually aesthetic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Neiman is a first-year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. He has been playing drums from a young age and aspires to become one of the greats like Buddy Rich. Famed conductor Terence Fletcher discovers Andrew practicing in the music room late one night and eventually invites him into his studio band as the alternative for core drummer Carl Tanner. Fletcher is abusive toward his students, mocking and insulting them; when the band rehearses the Hank Levy piece "Whiplash" and Andrew struggles to keep the tempo, Fletcher hurls a chair at him, slaps him, and berates him in front of the class.At a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Carl's sheet music. Since Carl cannot play without it, Andrew steps in, telling Fletcher that he can perform "Whiplash" from memory. After a successful performance, Fletcher promotes him to core drummer. Soon after, Fletcher recruits Ryan Connolly, the core drummer from Andrew's former lower-level class. Andrew believes Connolly is the less talented drummer, and is infuriated when Fletcher promotes him to core. Determined to impress Fletcher, Andrew practices until his hands bleed and breaks up with his girlfriend Nicole, believing she will hold him back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A music themed sports movie that dissolves like toilet paper with a little thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plucky young drummer heads to the big time and cracks under the pressure of a dictatorial band director, pushing him to come back to greater heights. As a sports movie, Whiplash is very effective. Unfortunately, it doesn't really have anything to do with music (or reality), and its vision of artistic achievement comes with some very unsavory undertones. Let's consider for a second the ludicrousness of its melodrama. No music director would slap his players, use abusive language, or trash instruments in the way portrayed in the film. The film falls apart if you question its equation of jazz and big band, or question whether becoming a player with Jazz at Lincoln Center is the pinnacle of achievement. The film also never addresses the racial context of jazz, which is a nearly unforgivable sin. But it's the whole mythos that holds that art is effort and effort is abuse and therefore any abuse is justified in the pursuit of greatness that is the most offensive to me. Anybody that's ever tried to get good at anything has met teachers like Fletcher, and they suck. If the movie stopped at being a portrait of toxic masculinity and the danger that comes from bad boundaries, then it would have done its job well. But it seems like the filmmakers and many of the people that are praising this movie fundamentally admire Nieman for enduring through his trials, and that's very disheartening to me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard great things about the movie and was very interested in watching it. But when I was half through it - I thought: "Really, that's it?" Don't get me wrong - it was good, the acting is fabulous, but everything is a bit stereotypical and predictable when you know what the movie is about. I was disappointed that people would praise a movie that highly just because it dealt with emotional stress. Also the progression of Andrew from a normal, likable guy into an obsessed egocentric proceeded too quickly for my taste and even though he was drilled, it wasn't in a way it would justify such a drastic change in him. I just couldn't buy it fully.But yeah, then this last scene came up. There aren't many movies that leave you barely enough entertained you don't shut them off and then surprise you with such an majestic, intense ending. And suddenly you realize that the whole story line builds up to this last scene. My whole body was literary shaking from the tension. The music, the pictures and then this last shot. Wow. My body still hasn't relaxed half an hour after I've seen the end. It is brave to write a movie like this and I think it has been rewarded with good reviews because of it's last scene.

		<shortDescription>Art over humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew (Miles Teller) is a smug young guy who thinks he can become a great drummer. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is an instructor whose eye Andrew catches and who decides to give him a chance."Whiplash" is not specially original. The plot could be your TV- movie of the weekend. Young guy raises against his weaknesses through mean but great instructor. And that is one of the problems with "Whiplash", as one or twice takes decisions that are basically not very original or interesting and are just there to raise the stakes against Andrew. Because of that, the movie's greatness depends on the package. And here the movie offers a mixed bag.That the two principal characters are quite annoying doesn't help. Andrew is a spoiled child who thinks too high of himself; of Fletcher, on the other hand, we're supposed to believe that he is bossing and abusing, pushing Andrew around, but he actually comes out more as an insecure bad-mouthed fellow. It's not that J.K. Simmons does a bad job, is that his character is supposed to shout and swear a lot. And that doesn't make an instructor. Or a mean and harsh one.The idea of the movie, of course, is that you have to be pushed (or push yourself) to become great at art. There's once that Andrew asks Fletcher if that is right, and Fletcher says yes. The movie does it too. Because of that, the short-comings are more easily spotted, as the view on the subject is poorly balanced. To make a great artist (writer, drummer, painter...) the artist doesn't have to go through an ordeal or suffer or become aloof and detached. For some it may help to be focused. For others, maybe another option is better.But in the end all revolves around Fletcher and Andrew's relationship. And here it all becomes a childish game, as both become little brats more than once, and just shout at each other, as if shouting makes your argument better. Of course, that's the point of the movie. But also the point of the movie is that one should belief that this interplay has an effect on both of them. And here's where "Whiplash" fails and the movie just becomes a story about two selfish child-men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a musician, just like to listen to good music. I understand that being a good musician takes talent and lots and lots of practice. We watched this film because of good rating. But after watching it, I do not get it. Why is this supposedly a masterpiece? Nothing really happens in this film, but a young man practicing drums and a old man using ridicule, insult, yelling, lies and deliberate manipulation to create great musicians as he states himself. While this all sounds romantic at first sight, the whole plot is ridiculous at second sight: It is not clear why the main character and especially other musicians allow the teacher to yell and insult them, just because he is supposed to be the best. While he is supposed to be the best, he HIMSELF admits (while being an old man, who supposedly has had lots of time already) that he still did not find or create the next great musician. In addition to that we learn that one of his fellow students committed suicide. Because he considered he was not good enough? It is not clear what story the main characters have that makes them what they are. Except for the teacher, there is not much acting from other protagonists. There is not much drama to show, except for the blood in the hands. And that has been shown a lot, I got an impression that drumming is a very bloody music.I also felt that the film was low budget. There is only one good actor, the teacher. The set is simply a room or two in some university. Even the audience in the epic final performance looked fake.In this sense, well done: No budget, no story, no acting. An ineffective and dangerous teaching strategy sold like the path for a great musician, gets lots of positive critics and awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excessively success-driven story...so little about feel and art...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of the few who found this movie captivating, but terribly WRONG in terms of concept, approach and, let's say, philosophy...and, by the way, I am a drummer myself. In Whiplash, it's all about success, about ambition, about manic ambition, and very little about feel and art. I hate the fact that music is stripped down to the almighty American cliché of "working hard in order to succeed", the "no pain no gain thing", in a excessive and inappropriate hardcore manner, I would say. My friends, music is art and art is about feel! When I see Whiplash, I tend to see no difference between succeeding as a lawyer, as an economist or whatever, and succeeding as a musician, namely a drummer. I fear that young drummers who see Whiplash will understand that if your hands are not full of blood after you exercise, then you're not doing it right... The terrible drive to succeed creates a young drummer who is not an artist, but a maniac and near-monster. He rarely speaks with other musicians, he rarely improvises, he rarely "lets loose" of his feel, he just has to play "faster, faster, faster" and identically like in famous jazz numbers like "Caravan". When his pathway to success is cut down by his violent conflict with his teacher, a conflict that turns physical, he even denies his passion for drumming and takes his Buddy Rich poster down...something I would describe as a "sacrilege", as a treason to art and a slavery to success. He doesn't find peace and pleasure in just drumming on his own, in developing his own "thing", whether it be slower or clumsier than Buddy Rich's...he exercises to bleed, to be faster, to correspond to other people's criteria and value systems, so TO SUCCEED, which is a thing that has to do with the outside world, with some artificial things, with ego, with stardom. The boy has little feel, he is so small as an artist and so big as a fighter, and he has a very weak artistic conscience: he has to be pushed by his teacher in order to get better, he has to be motivated in a hardcore way...The teacher himself dismisses the self-motivating artistic ego, because his philosophy is to force the boy to do better, even if the ways are brutal. And we are talking about JAZZ, a musical genre where people find grace, elegance, generosity, improvisation and pure love of music (in terms of sound). There is no grace in Whiplash, just manic drive for becoming a better "drumming robot", and a successful drummer, of course...The boy becomes "motivation beast" when, at the end of the movie, he finds out that a guy from Lincoln Center will be in the crowd, giving him exposure for a possible job in Wynton Marsalis' Big Band Orchestra. He unleashes a terrific drum solo but destroys the band's performance, so he can be noticed...it's all about him and his drive to succeed...music is always in the background. This approach would be better suited for, I don't know, more visceral genres of music such as punk or heavy metal but, in my humble opinion, is not suitable to jazz. In fact, I see it as a disgrace to the values of jazz music. On the other hand, I am not a jazz musician but just a music enthusiast and free-time drummer, and I fear that the reality may actually be close to what can be seen in Whiplash...and that would be very sad for music. I myself value more personal, artistically- driven and feel-based music, a display of the artist's sensibility and ability to improvise...ahead of the showoff in terms of pure technical skill, and the endless chase for more beats and actions per minute. Steve Gadd is a great example (in drumming) for what I'm saying here. Whereas in guitar, I think that Whiplash would create another Steve Vai, whereas David Gilmour, Eric Clapton or Mark Knopfler would have probably quit teacher Flether's "military service".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Job are the key words for Whiplash. J K Simmons psycho jazz teacher, Terence Fletcher recounts a story about Charlie Parker and how doing a good job was not enough to uncover a genius. There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job' according to Fletcher.The trouble is Fletcher would not recognise a genius if it crashed into him head on. Simmons creates a monster of a teacher which to be truthful is not unknown in coaching circles in sports and the arts. However a good educator he is not something his prestigious school seems not to have noticed.Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Eager to impress Fletcher and confounded that nothing he does can satisfy Fletcher. Neiman literally is driven to the edge.However there is only ever going to be one winner, Fletcher does not give an inch. J K Simmons won a best supporting actor Oscar for his mean and blustering performance. Their was very little shade to his performance and even in his subdued moments his character was calculating. A man with little ethical core.It is left to Teller to bring soul to the film. The young student whose zest and passion for learning and improvement is fast fading away as he becomes the victim of intense bullying.The film never addresses the bullying as it happens. There is a sub plot about this later in the movie but notice how the other students just stay quiet and let the abuse unfurl. Given that cooperating with each other in music is so important, these students hardly talked to each other. A most dysfunctional band who certainly did not give a shoulder to lean on which certainly looked unrealistic. Surely the students would mutter to each other in the canteen as to how horrible Fletcher was?As to the competition which causes Neiman problems as he has trouble getting there. Again you would have thought the Conservatory would had provided transport rather than rely on the students to make their own way.I did not think the film succeeded. The performances were intense but the screenplay had problems because the I never could buy into the band members as functioning students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was HIGHLY recommended by a very good friend of mine, Miles Teller and JK Simmons are good actors so I thought, why not give it a shot? I kinda regret it now...Pro's: Teller and Simmons really did a "GOOD JOB" on playing their parts, the music (when played in longer sequences) was well-formed, the camera team did an awesome job in capturing the very intense sequences.Con's: the amount of swearing....SO unrealistic, WHO talks like that? Simmon's Flatcher was SOOOO over the top, WHAT school even pays such a teacher!? Also, almost NO plot, two side characters (Teller's almost-gf, his dad) that were absolutely unnecessary to both character development and plot. Additionally, Fletcher seemed like a total psychopath with severe schizophrenia to me who even got what he wanted in the end by being the biggest dick.My Verdict: I had A lot of wtaf-moments, was entertained by the intense drum playing and Miles's acting but I absolutely don't understand the overall hype and a rating of 8,5 on IMDb. I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite my tempo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musicans and teachers alike will probably shy away from the methods which Terence Fletcher employ in Whiplash in the search for the next Charlie Parker. But it's fiction, and in that vein every single moment of the film is of course exaggerated for heightened tension. Oscar winner JK Simmons gives the performance of a lifetime as the brutal, cruel and authoritative jazz instructor who pushes his students to the limit and then some. It's a truly chilling character who gets equal parts of assistance and obstruction from the screenplay. Fletcher's frightful tirades are punctuated with moments of genuine kindness and humanity: playful anecdotes, saying hello to a little girl, playing soft jazz piano. Even more important is his reaction to one of his star pupil's deaths; a chilling realisation at the twist of the cause paints him in a very different light. But this stop start characterisation just sets up the audience for the inevitable foul-mouthed blow-up as contrivance after contrivance sees Andrew fail. Andrew, played by the ever impressive Miles Teller is at first a meek first year percussion student with big aspirations and even bigger dreams. He looks up to drumming legends and hopes to emulate their success; thus scoffing at his extended families' bragging of small time football achievements. While others are dismissive and his father ever supportive, Fletcher shares his goal. It's not the inspiring tale that some make it out to be; Fletcher is as petty as he is sadistic, pulling a fast one on Andrew in the final scene and getting his revenge for being fired from Schaffer. Andrew is just the first person to ever join him in his madness, to ever go beyond that limit and achieve true greatness at any cost. There's hurried montages of frenzied drumming which result in a bloodied and bandaged plunged into ice water - these are played out like aggressive training montages from a sports movie. It's a film which is intensely focused on the central two. Most secondary characters are given less significance; a symptom of Andrew's increasing desire and drive. One of these casualties is Nicole, the remarkably normal crush who gets swept aside when practice becomes more important. Melissa Benoist plays the part with touches of nervousness, awkward mannerisms and authenticity but it's suggestively a binary opposite just to show how motivated and obsessed Andrew is. This is very evident in his performance and the minimal costume and make-up which give him the withered, exhausted and bloodied look. Nicole enters and leaves his life like a shallow plot device used only to further push him into Fletcher territory. Another casualty is his father (Reiser), the supportive and kind single parent. The crux of Andrew's desire is to rise above the sympathetic hug with his father after his initial humiliation in the final scene. His father will always be there to say "good enough" or "good job", which is truly the bane of people like Fletcher and Andrew. For a moment he is humiliated and distraught, the steadicam switched for a shaky hand-held until he decides to walk back onto stage. The hand-held is not seen again. Whiplash's message is of course not for everyone. The bloody perseverance and alienation which comes at the cost of Andrew's musical greatness is not something many would be able to stomach. And beneath the passion of Terence Fletcher is a abusive and manipulative man who drives students to the brink. The final scene lavishes in their communal madness. There's a stark difference between the harsh and cold lighting of the very first drumming scene to here as he is bathed in warm light and a dizzy and shallow-focus close up shows every bead of sweat and every drop of blood that is the result of his work. He mouths a silent "f*ck you" at Fletcher and launches into the intro for Caravan while each significant beat of the snare equates to a cut to another perspective of Carnegie Hall. Tom Cross deserves every amount of praise for his editing. It's contempt that slowly grows into approval as the camera swings rapidly from conductor to drummer, building momentum. There are truly only two people on the stage even as a series of rapid cuts shows various instruments. But Andrew goes beyond into a drum solo which stretches the limits of both him and Fletcher. If there were only two people on stage before, now there are only two people in the entire world. The audience is not seen again in the film. There's a fervid moment where Chazelle chooses silence over the intense beats of the drum; everything is slowed down, we get extreme close ups of ears, drums, sticks and of Andrew's face, clenched in concentration. Andrew smashes his cymbal so hard that Fletcher has to hurriedly fix it, nodding his head in admiration. They work together, they slow down, then they build. Silence is used again right before the end. Andrew looks up for that final nod, and we get a cut-off shot of half of Fletcher's face as he crinkles up in a smile. And with a last fanfare the film abruptly cuts to an end. Whiplash conjures a storm of desire, passion and tension between teacher and student. Other characters are left in the dust both metaphorically and literally in the frame as they finally combine to achieve greatness in the jazz world. Chazelle shoots with great emotion and frenzy which combines with the diegetic sound to produce one of the most dizzying and potent endings of recent times. Neither man cares about half measures or secondary prizes. It's paradoxically inspiring and downbeat at the same time yet never encourages the regime which the pair endure, or even lust for. Most will not shrug off real life consequences and physical barriers like a car crash. Most are just another Sean Casey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown Melodrama: Offensive to Art and the Artistic Process</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash" on the surface is a tense, complex study of artistic struggle, obsession, and megalomania. I hated it. Not because it wasn't well constructed; not because it wasn't well acted; not because it wasn't well directed, it was all these things and more. No, I hated it for it's heart, its misguided insight into what art and beauty are truly about. It is not lost on me that any discussion or criticism about art could be argued to be completely subjective; I would argue that this movie does not reflect the Truth of art or do credit to the struggle of the artist. Thats not just my opinion either, to me that is a fact. I am not trying to argue an opinion here, I am actually commenting on something that I truly believe. It has been said that "Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty". I believe in Truth and Truth can not be an opinion. "Whiplash" takes a swing at what it believes is necessary to reach that truth and fails completely at capturing what it means to be an artist. This movie would have one believe that suffering, obsession, sacrifice and ugliness are the building blocks that great art/artist are founded on. I couldn't disagree more. As an artist myself I understand how all these "negative" motivators can drive an artist to produce art, even to produce great art, yet I feel this movie celebrates them as a necessary right of passage. That in order to be great one has to work harder no matter the cost; it implies that those who are successful are those who have suffered and sacrificed the most, and those who aren't just didn't try hard enough or suffer enough. (How many of histories great artist were ignored only later to to be appreciated?) Perhaps most disturbingly It implies that one's self worth or the "value" of art is dependent upon its reception by an audience or external factors. Enter the "evil" music/art instructor who's job it is (by this movies logic) to push someone past what they think is possible to open up new untapped potentials hidden away by psychological blocks of complacency and self-pity by employing the tools of cruelty, manipulation and terror. All this hidden behind some BS ideal that their is a great nobility inherent in "not depriving the world of a great artist" no matter what the cost. GAG!! What grandiose melodramatic tripe. I don't argue that we all couldn't use a swift kick in the pants occasionally in order to rise to our potential, or that honest criticism can be crucial to progressing as an artist but to ruthlessly and manipulatively bully and torture someone in the hopes of achieving said effect is where i take offense. Who the hell gave him that cross to bare anyway!? There is a line. This movie even mentions this "line" at one point and comes really close to reaching a redemptive conclusion....then misses the mark entirely and descends into the abyss. At this point the movie could have had some valid commentary on the consequence of tyranny and obsession and lifted itself to having a message worth sitting through. I had a glimmer of hope that the movie"s heart was true and had been enact all along. Unfortunately this was not to be. The scene that twists the knife comes when; after being set up and sabotaged by Fletcher, Andrew rises to the occasion against all odds and puts on the performance of a lifetime. Had he done this despite the villainy of Fletcher and the movie just ended, then one could have left the movie with a certain ambiguity, open to contemplating the various themes and questions the movie raises about art and the artistic process. However the damning evidence of the movie's actual message comes during Andrew's fevered solo when despite everything Fletcher has done to Andrew (including trying to completely ruin him) there is a nod of acknowledgment from Fletcher that conveys the approval that Andrew has been so desperately seeking and the movie ends as if something triumphant and beautiful has been brought into the world, as if the "Master" has finally found a worthy pupil. Uunnghhh! Never mind that Andrew is an obsessive with no sense of self (or self worth), never mind that Fletcher is a maniacal, narcissistic power drunk bigot (who may have even played a hand in pushing a young mind to suicide), never mind that there seems to be no consequences for any of these characters in their pursuit of greatness. Never mind that neither character have hardly any redeeming qualities. No at this point the movie decided to celebrate this twisted moment as if it were a triumph of art and truth. As if tormenting a person is how great art is born. No I don't think it is cool to celebrate this message nor do i think it is healthy to celebrate Fletcher's and Andrew's relationship as justified and productive. As an artist it offends me with its clichés, it lacks insight, responsibility and any awareness as to the very purpose of art. Art doesn't have to be beautiful, art can be ugly. It is both and it is neither. The only thing that is required of art is that it reflects Truth. "Whiplash" explored beauty and it explored ugliness and I am fine with that, but in the final act when it tried to explore the impetus of what makes great art in rang FALSE. Instead of enlightenment we got pandering, melodrama and a self indulgent study in cruelty that pretentiously masquerades as if it knows what it means to be an artist. -Sizer</fullReview>

How does a musician - any musician, actually - become the best that he can be? Practice, right? Obvious stuff. Well, that's kind of the theme of this movie. J. K. Simmons is a perfectionists band teacher dedicated to getting the best he can out of his college age jazz students. He 'is a DI' in the real sense of the term - totally reminded me of Drill Instructor I suffered under in the Marine Corps. His chosen student, Miles Teller, will become 'the greatest' jazz drummer ever or die trying. And that is JK's mission and the story. Add lots of foul language and physical abuse and way too much solo drumming and you've got this movie. Not fun too watch, not fun too listen too. Not much of an Academy Award worthy movie, really. And, the ending is not believable either...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolutely riveting movie. Terence Fletcher (the crazy good J.K. Simmons) and Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) were both amazing in this, although really, Fletcher took the cake. His character embodies that fierce (and sometimes violent) drive in each of us, or perhaps some person in our lives that tries to push ourselves to the limit, which is what makes this movie so personal as this connects with the audience. While on the other hand, Andrew represents the dreamer in all of us, but is sometimes faced with the limbo between attempting to push harder or to give up. This is what makes this movie so engaging. The music in the movie, coupled with the drumming also adds to the tension in this roller coaster of a movie.The finale was also spectacular and epic. There's basically nothing to criticize this movie for. It elevates the simple idea of diligence and success to a whole new level and engages the audience throughout. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music is never a competition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main argument of this film is that music is like a sport. You have to put yourself to the limit to be a top player. And this is not true for music. Music is all about feeling and soul and touch audience with the performance, not to be able to play at 400 BPM. Being a musician is an inner path to lead to a self discover. Virtuousness come with the practice and talent, but not being assaulted physical and emotionally. Music is an art, not a competition, so is subject to be interpreted in many ways, so being a best musician is not matter of math or time clock. Jazz is a language, not a race. Photography and editing are superb in the film, that's the only thing I liked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very VERY dangerous message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think that bullying, shouting and verbally abusing people who look up to you, hang on your every word and depend on you for their career is the best way to motivate them, you will love this film. Whiplash comprises scenes of Fletcher yelling incessantly at students, sometimes causing them to cry. But he doesn't just raise his voice at people who have committed atrocities (unless you think that playing 2bpm too slow or too fast is tantamount to a war crime). His abuse knows no bounds, including homophobic slurs, familial insults and long strings of pathetic adjectives. And he just does not stop. Why does he do this? Apparently it's to get young impressionable and desperate musicians to be the very best that they could be, and without which the world would be deprived of another genius. He claims the same motivation that spurred Charlie Parker to greatness would work for anyone. Of course, the story he quoted was largely false and grossly exaggerated to make his own point. (Parker had a cymbal thrown at his feet, NOT at his head "nearly decapitating him").At no point in the film is Fletcher reprimanded for his behaviour, despite it being cited as an underlying cause of a student's suicide. Even at the very end, Andrew's smile is seen as condoning the treatment because the end justified the means. This is a very dangerous message.Since the verbal abuse is the main point of the film, you have to accept it to enjoy the film at any level. The very idea that abuse is encouraging in any way or brings out the best of anyone at any time and in any profession, let alone in the arts, is absolutely ludicrous. As a musician for many years, I have yet to come across anyone who has been thankful for being abused by their mentor or teacher. If this film was made sixty years ago, when people were less sensitive to these issues, I could understand the flawed plot. But in 2014, the idea that the abuser could get away with his crimes at such length is ludicrous. The message this film contains is abhorrent and the handling of it in poor taste. If you want to watch a film about up and coming artists and the creative spirit, look elsewhere. Anywhere but at Whiplash. By the way, I bought the DVD to watch this, which will go straight in the bin. (1 out of 10? That's far too generous).</fullReview>

I anticipated how the characters would react to one another, not how the story unfolds. The sheer brutality is both refreshing and terrifying. Coming from all characters.

		<shortDescription>Music makes revenge into synergic Triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie I just knew that this one will be a story of a music enthusiast trying to make his way up. I had no idea what 'Jazz' music was and I was unaware of all the jargon used in the band. I won't give much of the storyline in this write-up, but it is surely one of the best movies I was ever watched, ever! I was clentching my fist all the while, when the 'perfect' music was demanded by the bald headed music aficionado from his team. This movie has three stages: The guts to fight it out, the payback time and the ultimate synergic win! I just loved how this movie transpired to be so real yet so alluring at the same time. The acting was as good as it can be. The movie builds up a tempo and never for a minute bogs down. 106 minutes of pure, exhilarating entertainment. It has emotions, anger, despair, revenge and yet, it all ends in a supposedly triumphant journey.Long story short, Whiplash will blow your mind off! Phew ... genuine legend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfectly timed film from Damien Chazelle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' is the story of Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), a promising young jazz drummer who is under the brutal tutelage of Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) at New York's fictional Shaffer Conservatory.'Whiplash' is essentially a battle of wills between Neyman and Fletcher, an unhealthy student/mentor relationship that frequently teeters on the brink of collapse. Fletcher uses harsh and disciplined teaching methods, and everyone is scared to death in his presence. His military-style methods work, as his school's concert band regularly wins competitions and breaks students into successful careers.Fletcher justifies his behaviour with repeated references to a long-repeated anecdote about the young Jazz legend Charlie Parker, who was playing a solo at a jam session with professionals which included the great drummer Jo Jones. Parker played so badly that Jones threw a cymbal at his head, nearly decapitating him. After that humiliation and intimidation, Parker practiced so long and so hard that he came back a year later and made Jazz history with his solo.'Whiplash' is a simplistic film about the Jazz world, Neyman plays a lot but you never see him in any other band such as his own, he doesn't jam with his fellow students, which seems odd when a drummer can't function in a jazz band without others. Chazelle is more interested in the lonely and singular ambition Neyman has, and the exposure he will get.The abuse of power is central to this film, Fletcher wants to teach Neyman to take responsibility and to prove himself. But where is the line between motivation and abuse? Fletcher is looking for his own Charlie Parker, the question is whether Neyman will cut it.For all its flaws, 'Whiplash' is a film worth watching. It's snappy pacing is as sharp as Neyman's drumming, and equally well executed. Both Fletcher and Neyman have questionable motives who are as bad as each other, and their relentless battle keeps you riveted and often amused. Teller and Simmons are both perfectly suited in their roles, and the latter steals most of the scenes with his barrage of verbal abuse at his students. A perfectly timed debut from Damien Chazelle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would need to like Jazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't like Jazz, then this is not for you. As there is loads of Jazz in this and I am not a fan.J.K. Simmons as Fletcher is brilliant as the half man obsessive tyrant and Miles Teller as the lead character matches him in being equally as obsessive in pushing himself to the very limits in a win at all costs mentality to succeed at his chosen profession.I have no idea how true to life this would be in the modern age but maybe in the 60s and before.But the way they treat the students here would make Sociologists have a nightmare in the management of human behaviour performance.The film plot scope is quite light as at the end I thought there wasn't much of a story, and not an original story either so you need to love Jazz. I am not sure if people could be this obsessive over Jazz. Main plus in the film (if you don't like Jazz) is the performance of the two leads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the poor little ambitious drummer bloodied his precious hands - practicing JAZZ drum!! Hahahaha.....People buy into that? Seriously??? Hahahahahaha.... And I'm not even a drummer, just love all kind of music like most people. JAZZ....causes bleeding callous fingers, and reading music notes to improvise...LOL... This student has serious issue....There is not excuse to give this film anything more than 5 for research laziness and technical fails alone!But brutality sells! The moral of the story is, criminal level of abuse is justified, as long as the victim (sort of) survived it.I read a few "Loved it" reviews out of curiosity. Found 2 schools of people who praise this nonsense to high heaven:1. FUTURE BULLIES ---- this school believes in the power of hate and brutality. In the name of whipping the hidden greatness out of young geniuses, they damage the children soul so the child will grow up perfect like a murderous sadist with hidden explosive piles who would in turn mental-torture and bleed future children to suicidal edge. 2. The Devil's Minions ---- this class does not see abuses even if it happens to their own baby infant. Their (narcissistic) narrative is people are always doing it for MY benefit, even if it hurts real bad. It is my fault or my children fault, to not transcend the pain or swallow the excrement of hate wrapped in a politically correct 'toughen up you wimp', which is what this film is apparently about, in all seriousness too.I'm trying, I am, to find redeeming value. Like, maybe, "talented kids" these days have become too coddled and soft and cry and whine at little insults? Opposite is true. Kids these days endure unprecedented amount of verbal abuses in school AND online. Skins have become too thick if anything.Okay, maybe... Kids have become too disrespectful of the craft side of art and need to be reminded HOW HARD IT USED TO BE to be qualified as a real music genius? Maybe, if jazz or drumming is supposed to define musical greatness. LOL, seriously. Keep your children away from any teachers or coaches who "love" this film with all seriousness.Watch it for good laugh. Very funny the more seriously brutal it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two harmful words in the English language are "good job"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geniuses. There are only a handful of them in the universe. They live life on a completely different planet than everyone else. In the process, they make sacrifices that most people wouldn't be willing to make. Sacrifices in relationships, social interaction, in any possibility of living a "normal life." Whether that's Einstein, or Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, Mozart, Michael Jordan, Lennon-McCartney, etc, these people lived a life that wasn't normal. In all honesty, normal to them, like Andrew Neimann and Terrence Fletcher in Whiplash, is insufferable and for the weak. Andrew Neimann doesn't just want to be a good jazz drummer, he wants to be the best. His idol is Buddy Rich, one of the best jazz drummers in history. Andrew doesn't have friends and outside of a short lived relationship, doesn't date. He finds people who live the "average life" like his extended family boring and of little interest. Drumming is what he lives and dies for. He looks at his father and sees what he doesn't want to be: a man, who wanted to be a writer, but let distractions never let him reach his potential. Neimann meets his match in Terrence Fletcher, played masterfully by JK Simmons, Fletcher is an abusive, sadistic teacher who pushes his students far beyond the line of appropriateness. Andrew sees in Fletcher a little of Rich: Rich was known as a temperamental perfection. The tension in this movie is thick and gripping. Miles Teller to many is the next John Cusack, but I see talent in him that is far more promising than even Cusack, and I like John Cusack. JK Simmons has always been one of my favorite actors. This role is far from his appearances as the Yellow M&amp;M and the Farmer's spokesperson. I'm happy he was finally recognized this year for his skills by the Academy. The story of decisions and sacrifice have been told before in movies like "It's a Wonderful Life," but the message here isn't as clear cut or one sided. It's very open to interpretation. If I have to knock a star off, it's some of the actions of Fletcher. At times, it was like "Karate Kid", "All that Jazz" and "Full Metal Jacket" thrown in a blender. A music school in NYC would never let an instructor do what Fletcher did (physical abuse). Some of the actions were just slightly over the top and unbelievable. However, I did go to school in the arts and can tell ya, there are some perfectionists who demand greatness. It's not all laid back and easy going like some posters believe arts programs are.Overall, this isn't the easiest movie to watch, but the way it make you think about how geniuses operate makes it a truly unique cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you know who I am ? " asks the film's protagonist as the audience are introduced to him Yeah you're that Nazi dude who enjoys raping all the new arrivals at the Oswald State penitentiary . Yes JK Simmons is back playing an Oscar winning role which isn't all that different from the role OZ fans know him for . It's nice to see that this years Oscar nominations were heavily in favour of indie cinema . It's even nicer to know that this is the film my fellow members of this site was the pick of the crop from 2014 film releases so sat back hoping to get blown away by itSo is it any good ? Yes but I should quickly qualify this by stating it's not really the masterwork some people might claim it to be . One criticism THE HURT LOCKER received was that you could easily rework the story as someone who has become addicted to adrenaline . Instead of a bomb disposal man you could have the story involve a fireman who takes more and more risks and so it's the same with WHIPLASH . How about a brutal drill instructor trying to turn weak civvies in to efficient killing machines ? That's already been done a hundred times before and so here we've a reworking of a familiar story in a slightly unfamiliar setting of a music school . It's a slightly predictable story and in order for it not to be so predictable there's a few plot turns involving situations that become rather contrived and unlikely to say the least What stops it all falling apart is director Damien Chazelle using all the tools at his disposal involving editing , sound mix and cinematography to disguise the flaws in the story telling . Certainly many directors nowadays think editing revolves around taking as much cocaine as possible while mutilating any coherent on screen action . The editing style of WHIPLASH is some what showy but is genuinely admirable at the same time . It's nice to actually watch a film and notice the editing while never being irritated by it WHIPLASH is one of the better films of 2014 but it's probably a film that's easier to admire than to like . I did like it but didn't love it and I'm not in a great hurray to watch it again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of best movies of 2014 ! It has emotion, passion and tragic moments of breathtaking. It basically tells the story of one teenager that doesn't look at the means to achieve the purposes, he wants to became the best drummer on earth and to do that he will work very hard to reach his dream. I found the story very well entangled with a constant tension that captivates the audience. Although I have to recognize that this tension led sometimes to moments of overstatement (like the moment when Andrew started bleeding while drumming) and this is why I gave it 8 stars and not 9. The movie transmites a very strong message that I think everyone who saw (or will see) this movie, without taking into account whether liked or not, received and thought about it for a couple days. When the movie ended it was almost 3 am and I was very tired but this didn't stopped me from search for the original "Whiplash" song by Hank Levy. I truly recommend for those who haven't seen this movie yet to run to the cinema and buy a ticket for "Whiplash".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one compelling drama about the relentless pursuit of perfection. You can't beat that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you know why I just hurled a chair at you? It's because you haven't, saw this movie, yet! Watch it, and then come back here. Written &amp; directed by Damien Chazelle, and based on his 2013 short film, 'Whiplash', which in return based off, Damien's experiences in the Princeton High School Studio Band. The movie tells the story between an ambitious jazz student, Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) and his abusive, yet driven- instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), as both work together, to see if Andrew, has the guts to be the next big drummer. Without spoiling too much of the film, I found it to be, a very gripping competitive movie. The theme dealing surrounding the cost of perfection is extensive and relatable. I never knew that, trying to be in a top Jazz orchestra was going to be so tough! Both, Miles Teller &amp; J.K Simmons's acting, was top of their game. I'm pretty glad, that both, got a lot of praise from critics. I know, a lot of people would love to see Johnny Simmons reprise his role, from the short film, Whiplash, but Miles Teller does a good job, showing how driven, the character is. Some of the bloody hands scenes were really his own blood, due to him, playing too fast. I'm also, pretty happy to see that J.K Simmons got awarded, for his work in this film. He wasn't injury, free, too. He got two cracked ribs when Miles Teller tackled him during the last two days of shooting. Simmons managed to continue working despite his injury. He deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars in 2014, just for that. Fletcher saying "Not my tempo." very frequently, was very sinister. The only criticize, that I can find, about J.K Simmons's performance is how basic, it was. In, a way, it felt like, any other J.K Simmons's performance, just more grounded, and not, over the top angry in a cartoony way, like his role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman films (2002-2007). Other than that, it's hard to pinpoint, anything wrong with their performances. I know, a lot of people have accused the film of distorting jazz history and promoting a misleading idea of wunderkind. I found, those critics to be a bit nitpicking. I do, agree with them, that the movie doesn't put Jazz in a good light. None of the music, they used, didn't stand out. I was hoping for more. One thing that the movie could have, work on, is, getting a better supporting cast. I found, both Paul Reiser &amp; Melissa Benoist co-starring as the student's father and love interest respectively kinda disappointing and forgettable. I know, the movie doesn't give, them, too much time and focus, but they should have, stood out, more, with the little time, they got. I really found both of them, jarring in how overacting, they were, in the small amount of scenes with Andrew. I guess, it was there to flesh out Andrew's character, but was any of their scenes, really that necessary? I found it, a bit unbelievable for Melissa Benoist's character to be, that upset with Miles Teller's character, after only one date. Both, didn't have that much of a connection, in the first place and Andrew didn't really treat her, right. Despite that shortcoming, the movie pacing is pretty well-rounded. I really didn't get bored with any of the sequences. It had really good film editing. I know that no words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job, but I think, Damien Chazelle did a good job. I found it, very interesting, that Chazelle continue to work, after being involved in a serious car accident in the third week of film shooting. I give him, mad props on completing this film. I love the close shots of the blood, sweat and tears of the drummers. It makes the movie so much, more intense, than it should be. Very memorable scenes. The language is harsh and offensive. Lots of gay bashing and racist quotes. I don't recommended, watching this film, if you are a person that easily gets offended. It's remind me of two films, 1987's Full Metal Jacket mixed with 2010's Black Swan, in the way, Whiplash's story delivers. Whiplash challenges it's viewers to think, with its social commentary. Whiplash criticize, the soften approach to education, where the beliefs states that students deserve acknowledgement. It doesn't want that fantasy cult of mediocrity. It wants to bring back the harsh realistic of competitive, where one success, and the others, don't. The argument that the movie brings about coddling several generations of young people, to the point, that they're ill-prepared for the harsh workplace has its merit. In a way, while, Terence Fletcher might seem like the villain. It's very unclear if Fletcher, truly is. Many of his scenes are very inspiring, and many of his other scenes are just borderline, bullying. He's not clear-cut, and that's what I love, about this movie. The conclusion of the film, might be a bit, bittersweet. Some people might hate it, because it's seem like the Fletcher's extreme effective won out in the end and the glorification of Bullying seem right; while other might believe that Andrew out-best him out and challenge himself to fight against bullying. It's really very much open debate. Overall: Whiplash is a refreshing, heart-pounding, highly engaging film of obsession and art. I do recommended watching. It's in my tempo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning character study that acts as a white knuckle thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knew jazz and drumming could be so ripe for heart stopping narrative drive? Culminating in one of the more tension riddled finales of recent memories and featuring some of the most brutal ego tearing scripting this side of Full Metal Jacket, up and coming filmmaker Damian Chazelle's searing drama is against all odds, a drama cume thriller of the highest order.Featuring some of last years most outstounding performances from both the ever growing Miles Teller and the always good yet never before so commanding J.K Simmons, Whiplash will have you constantly on the edge of your seat, frequently forgetting to breathe and riveted every step of it's running time due to an all round package that has rightfully become a player and often winner in this awards season. It's stunning to consider this is one of Chazelle's first features and for a man perhaps best known for scripting the Elijah Wood thriller Grand Piano, this is a sure fire heralding in of a major new filmmaking talent. Chazelle handles proceedings like a true professional, the editing, the pacing, the direction of actors and the award calibre scripting is all of he highest order and it's evident throughout that Chazelle is a naturally gifted filmmaker. Whiplash truly is an exciting mix of dramatic tension and thrilling interplay between budding musician Andrew and egotistical conductor Terrence Fletcher that sees Chazelle draw out a pair of rivals that will live long in the lore of cinema history.Since his arrival on the film scene in films such as Rabbit Hole and more recently The Spectacular Now, Miles Teller has threatened to break out at any moment and if The Spectacular Now was not proof enough, there is little remaining doubt after this effort that Teller is one of the finest examples of young talent in the industry today. Teller's character of Andrew is a multilayered one and one that doesn't necessarily win over our affections completely. His a complicated young boy, driven to the point of arrogance and not overly warm, yet his a figure we want to see succeed, if not only to spite the evil incarnate that is J.K Simmons's Fletcher.A recognisable face over many years of supporting work in Hollywood, it's a true joy to see Simmons unleash in a stunning portrayal of a man driven to drive others to the point of no return. Whether spouting out some of the most vile abuse possible or talking calmly to potential future musicians that he can use in his band, Terrence Fletcher is a force to be reckoned with, a tornado of aggression and pent up rage. It's one of 2014's stand out performances and a role that saw Simmons collect a thoroughly deserved Oscar at the Academy Awards, it's a win that is wholeheartedly earned and deserved.While Whiplash has a few narrative missteps and a handful of questionable scenarios (particularly one scene involving a car accident) it's not enough to sully a film that you suspect will be living a long life in years to come, being studied by start out filmmakers, budding actors and lovers of all things good cinema. Just don't go showing anyone considering a potential sojourn in a music school, as Terrence Fletcher may just be enough to scare them away for good.4 and a half bloodied drum kits out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beat a path to the cinema to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is simply astonishing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a gifted and highly ambitious drummer in his first year at an elite New York music academy. There his talents are spotted by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an equally ambitious coach and mentor who is always looking for the "next big thing" but has never found it. However, there is a very thin line between being an "ambitious coach" and a terrifying bully, and Fletcher constantly crosses that line sometimes inflicting a terrible impact on his young students.In an almost uniformly male environment, love interest is served from the cinema concessionary stand by Nicole (the charming Melissa Benoist) who the shy and uncertain Andrew finally plucks up the courage to ask out on a high-point in his emotional roller-coaster. Spot the female, featuring Melissa Benoist The 'school for protégés' theme has perhaps been trodden before by movies like Alan Parker's "Fame", and some of the emotional and creative jostling of elite musicians has appeared in films such as 2012's "A Late Quartet". But none of these deliver the degree of passion and intensity metered out in Damien Chazelle's movie.Miles Teller ("Divergent") is superbly credible as the aspiring jazz drummer Andrew, and it is almost unbelievable that he was not a professional drummer-turned-actor for this film. In fact, the more accomplished jazz drummer (very different to rock drumming apparently) is Nate Lang who plays Carl, his key competitor for the "percussion 1" role. The two were apparently locked away in a drumming 'boot camp' for 2 months prior to the movie being filmed.But the starring role in the film goes to J.K. Simmons, probably best known in the supporting role of J. Jonah Jameson, the cranky editor of the Daily Bugle in the Spiderman films (and a number of other Marvel spin-offs). Simmons is quite simply astonishing, channelling the sort of Oscar-winning performance of Louis Gossett Jnr ("An Officer and a Gentleman") into his vicious drill-sergeant-style performance. He has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor role for both Golden Globe and BAFTA awards, and I would fully expect him to feature in the Oscar shortlist when they are announced on January 15th. Personally speaking, he will be the one I will be cheering for in the awards themselves.Cinematography by Sharone Meir is outstanding, with every drop of blood, sweat and tears glistening on forehead and cymbal. The editing by Tom Cross is also extremely tight, winding up the tension during key encounters. The combination of the two together with Chazelle's tight script effectively spears the audience in the gut. The feature is based on Chazelle's short film of the same name, and on this basis he is a name to watch for the future.Gut-wrenching and enthralling, this film will spit you out the other end feeling emotionally drained. This is simply a film you MUST see. Let me drum it into you again. GO SEE THIS FILM! (If you liked this review please see others at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to receive future posts).

		<shortDescription>An interesting film with some suspense but lacking overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theater to watch Whiplash with very little knowledge of the film other than it's about a drummer.I enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so of the movie and wondered which direction it was going to go. Obviously something was going to happen between the music instructor and the drum student but what?The movie ended up being primarily based around their relationship, which basically focused on excessive practice and verbal abuse. The movie failed to capitalize on other relationships such as with the drummer's girlfriend, or relationship with his dad or fellow students. Two other student drummers suffered through the same abuse and you'd think that even though they were competing for the same spot, they'd bond on their hatred for the instructor.The only interesting scene dialog wise was really the family dinner which was funny yet short. Almost all of the other dialog in the film was the instructor yelling.The final 30 minutes of the movie didn't sit well with me at all. The student and instructor meeting in the bar and talking over drinks was unlikely seeing how the student had hate the man. I don't believe the student would've given him the time of day after what transpired.Then the instructor, who for the entire film was 100% set on protecting his reputation, intentionally tried to embarrass the drummer in front of a huge theater that also had people with connections to the industry. I don't believe the instructor suddenly would've been OK with potentially negatively affecting his already tarnished reputation just to ruin the drummer's chances after the student had already made the decision to give up his dream.The final scene where the drummer and instructor/conductor seemed to come to terms also seemed unlikely.In the end there wasn't enough dialog and the relationship with most of the characters didn't go deep enough to make it a great movie in my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching Whiplash i had a certain disdain for musicals and music films; films such as Dirty Dancing have programmed me to make a certain sound when my friends say they want to watch this new musical in town (I'll give you a hint: it sounds like ughhhh). But this film isn't just a musical. It's a fully blown character thriller. I must say I'm a huge fan of the actors involved; Miles Teller is a spectacular actor (his spectacularity shown in The Spectacular Now) and J.K. Simmons is one of those supporting actors who shine in small parts in films, and leave a lasting impression in your head. Now that he has a more leading role his incredible acting shines as the abusive music teacher. Simmons is well deserving of that Oscar because he has created the best villain since Darth Vader; I'm aware of how big that statement is and I'm more than prepared to stand by it. I thoroughly recommend this film, it will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the runtime and is definitely one of my favourite movies of 2014 and one of my favourite movies of my lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody has something in his life which makes you want to push yourself to your limits. With Andrew (Miles Teller) , it's jazz music. He has an almost irrational drive to get better at being the best jazz drummer in history. When he gets the chance to come to the class of Terrence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons), a well known teacher at the most prestigious music School in the USA, Andrew sees his future brighten up. Only he doesn't know the severity and seriousness with what Mr. Fletcher teaches his classes?Whiplash is a terrifyingly beautiful film about the things a person is capable of doing for greatness. Or as the Joker might say: "This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object." From the first scene of the movie we the perfect impression of what you're going to get throughout the movie, great jazz music and even greater performances by Miles Teller and especially by J.K Simmons. Every scene Simmons is in he draws all eyes to him, and he draws every breathe out of you, anxiously awaiting his reaction. In terms of villain factor, Simmons is right up there with Darth Vader, Voldemort etc. With the only difference that Simmons' character is much more realistic.The movie does a great job setting up the character of Andrew, making you understand where he is coming from and what drives him into the decisions he takes throughout the movie. The scenes with his dad are especially powerful. Apart from the dynamic performances by the two head roles, the other factor that elevates this movie is the beautiful soundtrack! Never has a soundtrack impacted me this much, from being a jazz enthusiast to an absolute jazz guru. Immediately after the movie I went to search for the soundtrack along with some extra jazz songs to make myself my own personal jazz playlist. The great thing about the soundtrack of Whiplash is it's necessity to the story: every track brings it's own factor to the movie.All in all, Whiplash succeeds in making a very fundamentantelly impactful film about success, desire and motivation, and the dangers it brings with it. It also succeeds at being the best movie of 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle directed this story of a talented young drummer (Miles Teller) at an elite music school in New York who is browbeaten mercilessly by his instructor (Dr. Emil Skoda, I mean J. K. Simmons). As unpromising as the material sounds, and as autobiographical, it's better than I'd expected.In the third act, Hamlet has this to say: "So again good night. I must be cruel only to be kind. Thus bad begins and worse remains behind."It applies, not just here but in all training camp films, whether it's the Marine Corps, the Army, the Coast Guard, Navy Flight School, or Harvard Law School. It answers the question: What torture did you go through in order to be successful. It's not often we see a drummer boy put through the wringer. And, man, does Simmons put Teller through the wringer, one organ at a time. Teller practices until he bleeds over the snare drum. And THAT'S not good enough.The typical arc of a story like this has the resentful tyro becoming more mature, tempered like steel, proud and manly, winding up with both the admiration of his mentor and the pretty girl he's been diddling on the side. Sometimes the mentor must die, as John Wayne did in "Sands of Iwo Jima." Not here, though. It's the Big Night, the finale, at Carnegie Hall or the Hippodrome or La Scale or someplace. Teller proves his worth -- MORE than proves it -- and Simmons finally gives him the okay, a big French kiss on the lips. No, no, just kidding. Simmons only smiles at Teller after the drummer's stunning performance.One of the best things about the movie is Teller's relationship with his girl, the earnest and sweet Melissa Benoist, a student at Fordham. They get along quite well, but then Teller calls it off because in his pursuit of perfection there is no room in his life for a woman's demands. What an ass. Yet it's an original touch, because when he's achieved success (or given up) he calls her to renew the relationship but she has to check with her boyfriend. Teller's default position is "put upon." He looks doubtful, sad, mournful even, without a real ability to project anger -- and the script gives him plenty of opportunity. J. K. Simmons makes the picture. He seems to have taken lessons from R. Lee Ermey in "Full Metal Jacket." He's abrasive throughout, foul mouthed and in your face. Nothing you do satisfied him. "That's not my tempo!" After he's booted out of Julliard or whatever it's called here, he bumps into Teller and explains why he was so nasty. He claims he was always looking for the next Charlie Parker, a legendary alto saxophonist, somebody who could absorb insults and humiliation and keep on charging ahead, just like Bird did when he started out. You can be pushed beyond your limits and become a genius or you can settle for having done satisfactory work, says Simmons over drinks. "The worst words in the world are 'Good job.'" The climax proves him right.Yet, what a dumb perspective, a hubristic paean to Narcissus. As the proverb says, the perfect is the enemy of the good enough. How much should be sacrificed in the search for perfection? Charlie Parker died of drink and drugs at an early age, and for every Charlie Parker there are one hundred thousand guys who are good enough at their jobs.The music we hear isn't classical or pop. Otherwise we'd constantly be hearing "O, Fortuna" (Ka-boom). Since drums are the featured instrument it must be jazz. And the jazz isn't really inspired either, I hate to say. It's certainly fast and LOUD enough but it's as if every member of the school band were aiming for Maynard Ferguson's excess. I don't claim to know much about music. I'm less familiar with diminished sevenths than I am with diminished fifths, but I know what I like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both exhilarating and exhausting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film with mass appeal - there are no super-heroes or car chases or special effects - but the discerning viewer will find it a cinematic treat. The title alludes to a piece of jazz music but it might as well describe the tongue of Mr Fletcher (J K Simmons), teacher and conductor at a top New York music academy, whose lacerating comments on the efforts of his charges literally result in blood and tears. The prime focus of his teaching - or torture - is 19 year old Andrew (Miles Teller), a drummer in Fletcher's elite band. Teller gives a fine performance but Simmons is simply stunning in a career-best showing in a lifetime of acting mainly in television (it deservedly won him an Academy Award).The movie was both written and directed by Damien Chazelle, who at school wanted to be a jazz drummer and had a tough music teacher, and it is a feature length version of an award-winning short film of the same name. The plotting is quite thin but this is not a slow work - the rehearsal sequences, which are the core of the story, are sharply cut and well shot. What gives the narrative some complexity is that Mr Fletcher's appalling behaviour is a consequence of his own failure and could be seen as well-intentioned, while Andrew's willingness to take so much abuse and punishment is the result of his all-consuming passion to be the best. A prolonged drum solo at the end is a tour de force that seems to make it all worth while - but you'll end up feeling exhausted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of credibility mars otherwise great music film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a music school drama about a bunch of spineless kids who cower in fear for their music teacher, who routinely pours verbal abuse on them. Not a single one of them has the courage to look him in the eye while he is doing so. Yet the teacher is hoping that one of these personality-deprived wimps will be the next Charlie Parker. This premise just didn't make sense to me, and as it was presented early in the movie, I watched the whole thing with disbelief. Other than this this movie does everything right though. The music is a joy to hear throughout, though jazz isn't my thing. Watching it being taught and practiced is interesting. The main actors do a terrific job and are perfectly credible. I just couldn't buy into the idea that a music teacher would expect any of the personality required to be a genius musician from kids who can't even look him into the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad it was not about Metal instead of Jazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the kind of ratings Whiplash got I had high expectations for this movie but at the end I'm disappointed. I expected much more from this movie. Maybe it's because of my natural distaste for Jazz music. It's really a genre of music I almost never enjoy. In Whiplash you get repetitive parts of songs that I particularly don't like at all. And then to have to listen to them over and over again is a bit too much for me. On the other hand the acting was good. The battle between student Miles Teller and teacher J.K. Simmons is interesting to watch. I can understand that sometimes you have to push somebody to let him reach his best level but in this case it's just bullying. So maybe if it was an other genre of music (like Metal or so) that I would have liked Whiplash. But it isn't so to me it's just a movie you watch once and then forget about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incoherent, psychotic rehash of Drumline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would I call this movie incoherent? Because there is little consistency. The characters emotions are scattered and tumultuous, cast in a surrealist setting where among a school of promising musicians, a tenured instructor ritualistically destroys the dreams of the most promising students, in the hope one will reach the brink of despair and rise above where those have fallen. So he ruins peoples' lives for years in the psychotic belief that he'll create a master somehow.Through the dinner scene with the two main characters (I did not take the time to remember their names, this movie is forgettable), the music instructor attempts to provide some reason behind his madness, but again, the epitaph is incoherent. So you're a music instructor . . . who is jealous of the world, and believes he has the answer for everything he observes is wrong with the world. So he's a psychopath. And yet he is gratified in the final moments of the movie? And finally, this is just a rip off of Drumline. This movie had little to nothing original to add to the story, just extra character development, that once again is incoherent. So the instructor lets one of the trombone players go because he doesn't know whether or not he's out of tune, but the player next to him that was out of tune . . . is allowed to stay. So yeah, the instructor is trying to set an example to the others, I get that, and perhaps he's trying to flush out the few who aren't actually passionate about music, but then he physically assaults the main character in front of the other students, until he cries, then mocks his suffering? I would have walked out of this movie if I saw it in theaters. What a pile of crap. They did get me interested with the teacher's gruff, hard attitude, but he never lets up, stays a jerk until the end of the movie, and yet gets to create the 'master' he's always been looking for. I withdrew only enough frustration from this film to write a negative review. I can see why some people like this film, but it is a superficial pile of garbage if you look at it with any deeper scrutiny than a mindless, berating comedy that showcases the humiliation of people with true talent and dreams. What a soulless film, and a general waste of my time. I feel ashamed of writing a bad review on a critically a acclaimed film only because I wasted the time to acknowledge the movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific &amp; Moving Music Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash" was a movie I had the experience viewing when I was 14 years old. However, I only watched around 10 or 20 minutes of it because my parents were watching it on the TV downstairs. Even then, the 10 or 20 minutes I did see, I loved. Whiplash could often be described as a music movie. It is a music movie, but there is much more to it than just music.Whiplash's story was very unique and moving. Miles Teller is a student and drummer for J.K. Simmons character, and I thought that was a good start. J.K. Simmons insults in "Whiplash" are some of the funniest insults I've heard in a movie for a very long time, and it was nice to see refreshingly unique characters.Throughout this entire runtime, I was never bored. I was always interested in every scene, whether it was Miles Teller drumming, or J.K. Simmons yelling insults.Whiplash has one of the best last 10 minutes of a movie I've seen in my entire life. During this scene, I was literally on the edge of my seat, because I was so into these last minutes of this film. I was actually sweating because I wasn't sure what was going to happen next.Rating: A+ (10/10 Stars - Masterpiece)Caillou Pettis Movie Reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard-hitting, yes, but lacks impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the Hollywood blockbusters to hit the silver screen, it's often refreshing to discover something that has received so little attention but deserves so much more. One such film is Whiplash, a disturbing, gritty drama about student drummer Andrew (Miles Teller), and his abusive tutor Fletcher (J K Simmons). Andrew plays until his hands bleed, and continues regardless of the obstacles precluding him from achieving greatness, including his on-off girlfriend Nicole (Melissa Benoist). A story of passion, obsession and determination, Whiplash pushes the boundaries of modern drama and presents us with a harrowing tale of emotional abuse. Whiplash is a bizarre little film. The cinematography is great, and the acting flawless. Director Alejandro González I?árritu does an excellent job at conveying what is essentially a gritty, brutal tale of verbal and emotional abuse. But that's about as good as it gets. The pacing is fine, and the characters are well-developed, so what's the problem? The issue lies in the fact that not one of the central characters is remotely likable. I have to admit, by the film's conclusion I was somewhat taken aback, due to the fact that, apart from its being rather abrupt, it appeared to have taken a completely different direction to what I was expecting. The tutor never gets his comeuppance, and the protagonist never really learns a lesson besides 'keep practising, no matter how much abuse you receive, and you'll do well', which poses something of a problematic discourse. Put simply, the film's moral standpoint is dubious at best. Teller's character is entirely self-absorbed, and yet by the film's conclusion it's implied we, the audience, are expected to empathise with him ? but we can't. He's a complete lunatic! That said, the part is extremely well-acted. J K Simmons as the tutor is also extremely convincing in his role. Despite the film's flaws, it is gripping, and manages to hold your attention until its explosive finale, but it could have had more of an impact had the protagonist been a little more three-dimensional. It's evident that the plot is supposed to be allegorical, though the message it appears to condone is questionable. It seems to convey the concept that greatness is only ever truly realised when adversity is overcome rather than avoided. But the hardships presented in the film are not only vastly unrealistic, but disturbing and just plain wrong. The film's conclusion seems to imply that the tutor's actions are in some way justified, which is a horrific outcome. Ultimately it's hard to summarise my thoughts on this feature. The acting and cinematography are simply genius, but the message it conveys is a little muddled, to the point at which the film's finale leaves you questioning whether or not it finished on a positive note. In any case, it's definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHIPLASH (2014)Director: Damien ChazelleStarring: J.K. Simmons, Miles Teller, Melissa BenoistA harsh reality which everybody has to face at some point of time, when they actually want to achieve something big in their lives. This movie tells a story of a passionate jazz drummer Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) who wants to become perfect on drums. The dedication that he has for his goal in the movie is what makes you watch it again and again. Damien Chazelle adds a masterpiece to the immortal chain of classics in Hollywood. He pens down the story-line which leaves a robust impression on the viewers. Chazelle has not only shown the struggle of the drummers in the movie but also, how much dedicated and devoted they are for their profession. No matter what they have to stay away from all worldly possession and personal relationships. Andrew, an ambitious young jazz drummer, studies at one of the most prestigious music school of New York named Shaffer. He is striving for greatness and finding a way to become a core drummer of one of the best bands of his school. J.K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher and Neiman's mentor at Shaffer acts exceptionally well. The way he insults and abuses his students to bring out the artistic perfection from them freezes out your mind at times. The aggression on his face makes the scenes so realistic and mind-numbing that it scares the hell out of you. The student ?mentor relationship between Andrew and Fletcher is the main element which makes it stand aside from other movies. You cannot imagine for once what Fletcher has in his mind. He can do every possible thing to make a student realize his true potential by thrashing him up to the core. Neiman has done an equal justice to his role. The way he practices day and night to become great like Buddy Rich can't take your eyes off from him. Even if you are not familiar with jazz music, you can build that instant love for it through this movie. Non-stop drumming and double swing on the drums will make your head go crazy. A scene from the movie where Fletcher slaps Neiman again and again for testing his patience out and correcting his tempo is terrific. At the end of the movie you will be in love with the musical note, "Whiplash" which has a sound of immense hard work and happiness into it that Neiman has done by pouring his blood day and night. All jazz music lovers must watch this movie to become a part of the musicians' struggle and feel it in real life. Even if you don't know about the music much you can watch it because by the time you will be able to judge Neiman's drumming with the help of his mentor. The thirst of perfection in the movie made it best and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "Good Job" :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll explain my title further on, this is also going to be a shorter review, because it has been a couple of days since I saw the movie.Whiplash is about Andrew Neiman. He is very driven to become the best jazz drummer in the world, but not just in the world, he wants to be remembered for his drumming. He starts his first year in the best jazz school in America. In the class he is in he gets discovered by Fletcher. Fletcher asks him if he wants to join the jazz band of his. In this band Andrew is capable of entering competitions. Fletcher is willen to push every member of his band to become better, but maybe he is pushing them to hard."Whiplash" is directed by Damien Chazelle. He did a nice job at directing the movie. The cinematography was also handled nicely, there were some nice shots. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the color pallet. It fitted the theme of the movie, but because there was a lot of black in it, you couldn't always see what was going on. The editing was flawless. Especially in the last fifteen to twenty minutes when he is drumming. What brings me to the next subject. The music. The music is so, so good. I loved the music, and normally I am not a fan of Jazz music. It was nice to look at how Miles Teller played on his drums. The realistic theme of the movie was also something I liked. The blood on the drum sticks, the sweat on the drum itself, and on Miles Teller. The movie was surprisingly tense full as well. You didn't want Andrew to fail. The acting was superb. Miles Teller was perfectly cast as Andrew. Andrew is the main character of the movie. You cared about him. He is driven to his absolute breaking point, to then rise and become better then before. But now why Miles Teller was the best casting choice. Teller started playing on the drums since the age of fifteen. Which gives the drumming a more realistic feel. I've also read somewhere that the blood on his drum stick, his own blood was. I love when an actor dedicates himself that much to a role. He was very good as Andrew. J.K. Simmons played Tarrence Fletcher. He trains Andrew (Teller) in a very violent way, e.g by throwing chairs at his head. He was absolutely amazing. This is his best performance yet. He was so good and so intimidating as Fletcher. He really deserved his Oscar, and it is such a shame that they gave him such a small role in "Terminator: Genisys". They could have made this movie a lot better than it is now. Melissa Benoist plays Nicole. She is the love interest for Andrew. She was willing to support him in his decisions, but Andres thinks it is better that they break up, so he can focus more on the drums. She was also very good, better than in the new cbs show "Supergirl". The rest of the supporting cast was good as well. The writing was brilliant. How they wrote the characters was very good. The curse words Fletcher used were creative, but what I think was very powerful, was when the car of Andrew got hit, by a truck. This was powerful, because it showed how afraid Andrew was to lose his part, that he even ran after a accident and just drummed on a stage. This was definitely something that defined his character. With Fletcher there is also a character defining moment. When he tells to his band that an old student of his is pasted away. He tells his band that the person died due to a car crash, but later we find out that the person committed suicide. The characters were all fleshed out very well.Now I'll explain my title. At a certain point in the movie Andrew and Fletcher are talking to each other. Fletcher says to Andrew: "In the English language there is nothing more harmful than "good job!". So the title is actually a joke.The movie was an amazing time, it is for sure a got to movie for music lovers, or just for people who like a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is a simple idea stretched out to become an epic character study. Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a jazz student at Schaffer Music School who meets teacher Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) an abusive tyrant known for his terrifying methods of conducting. As Andrew tries harder and harder to please Fletcher he closes off everything else that mattered to him and turns his desire to be the greatest into an obsession. It's an exhilarating story that doesn't let up from beginning to it's incredible final act. The acting from Simmons is great and it's really no wonder that he was given an Oscar for his role as Fletcher. Teller is also great as Andrew and we really see his change through the movie. Whiplash is epic.</fullReview>

Simmons deservedly picked up the Oscar and 'Whiplash' was robbed of Best Picture also. The intensity of this film was maintained throughout and the immense tension felt by Miles Teller was superbly portrayed. One thing I loved about this film is that it is so difficult to dislike. Even if you have no interest in music or anything like that, you still won't be able to stop thinking about this film. Another great thing about 'Whiplash' is the fact that it did not drag on at all. It was short, snappy, intense and near-perfectly executed with quality insults from J.K. Simmons throughout. The best film of the year. 8.5-9.0/10</fullReview>

Cry because it was all his life which he lost many times and found back only once. Cry because I could have never done that. Cry because I would never had made it so far. Cry because in my point of view it was not worth it. Applaud because nevertheless he made it.When his instructor caught him in the trap, he fell but stood up. He lost the battle but he won the war.

		<shortDescription>Do we accept mental abuse?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I was fascinated by this inspirational story for all who strive for greatness. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that what this actually is; a really sad story of the young, narcissistic and self-centered guy Andrew, who will literally sell out on everything to get a shot at pro-drumming.Andrew has no friends and apparently no interest in his family. He lays off Nicole, a girl he dates; so she could not limit him in his search for greatness &amp; he moves his mattress to the basement, so he can do nothing but eat, sleep &amp; practice. All this is because; as Andrew explains at dinner "I would rather die at the age of 30 and have everybody talking about me, than die at the age of 90 and nobody knowing who I was".If that is not narcissism, I don't believe I know the meaning of the word.To push Andrew even further, we are introduced to Fletcher: a ruthless music-teacher whit the emotional span of your average psychopath: One moment he is kind and caring, and the next he is throwing chairs at your head while shouting and threatening to cut you from the band. He publicly plays students out against each other, and whenever a "weak" student breaks down in tears, the stronger student is congratulated not by his own success, but by the failure of others. Fletcher is obviously a man who will not deviate from any kind of psychological terror or abuse. In my opinion, Fletcher is truly a despicable man.Combining these two characters in Whiplash; the young mentally unstable boy Andrew, and this manipulative teacher: the movie somehow glorifies the mental abuse going on here ? and I am not okay with that!Besides my obvious opposition to the story content of the movie, I still enjoyed watching it; and even though I'm not much of a jazz fan, I still think the music where chosen really well. Miles Teller plays the role of Andrew a bit too emotionless, but casting J.K.Simmons as Fletcher ? Wow, that was a perfect choice!</fullReview>

What at first appears to be a standard story of a talented but difficult pupil being taken under the wing of an uncompromising and unconventional mentor soon moves into darker territory.J.K. Simmons is brutal as Fletcher, the band leader who terrorises his students to breaking point in order to achieve perfection. The physical and verbal abuse he dishes out is shocking and it's hard not to feel anxious for the the young musicians as they perform under unbearable pressure.Miles Teller plays the talented student Andrew Neiman, who initially comes across as an awkward and endearing loner but soon displays his own antisocial behaviours. Although some of the treatment he receives is hard to watch at times, the fact he is not a wholly sympathetic character makes it difficult to completely empathise with him and condemn Fletcher.The performances of the two main actors are excellent and as the film progresses a psychological battle develops as Fletcher's intense ambition to discover genius by essentially shattering and manipulating his students resolve clashes with Andrew's determination to prove his talent at all costs.This comes to a crescendo in the thrilling finale as the two main characters make their final moves, in a theatre packed with powerful music industry figures, to discover if Andrew really does have what it takes to become a jazz great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Drama, but Not Something Worth Recommending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been written about Damien Chazelle's film with its powerful portrayal of a learner-educator relationship where the educator Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) goes to extreme lengths to establish mastery over his talented drummer learner Andrew (Miles Teller).In terms of dramatic effect, the film communicates extraordinary power through the use of close-ups that show Fletcher's intensity, which becomes so intense that we might expect that he has some kind of masochistic sexual attraction towards his learner. This might be true; but the director's attitude towards the material remains frustratingly ambivalent. Are we meant to view Fletcher's behavior with a critical eye as an example of what happens when an educator becomes jealous of the talent of his learners and vents his frustration through conscious sadism? Or does the director have a kind of perverse attraction towards his central character - which helped J. K. Simmons win an award for his performance?Whatever the rights and wrongs of the film's morality, I have to say that I found it offensive. Perhaps I am allowing too much of myself to permeate this review; but as someone involved in training educators of all disciplines, I think that the content offers a highly negative representation of educator power and how it can be so readily abused. Director Chazelle might defend his film using the famous Hitchcock dictum ("It's only a moooovie"), but the fact that it generated so much worldwide publicity attests to its power to generate viewer reaction.</fullReview>

So he loves what he is doing in a twisted way. He is competitive and so upset of being recognized as the best that nothing else really matters... at all.So the different view of that story is that the hero is an anti-hero, (a true psychopath), but this is the beauty of that film. You don't necessarily have to be a strong or good person to be a great artist.Good script, not boring, not predictable, in general it was a nice entertainment time for myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here was a movie that snapped me to attention and kept me transfixed from the first second it began. I watched this movie on my computer and had only turned it on to check the quality of the file. I had my hand on the keyboard, ready to close the movie and go back to what I had been doing before my download finished. I sat like that for the whole movie, ready to stop watching after the current sequence ended, but drawn further into the story. I watched it later into the night than I meant to, knowing that I wouldn't get enough sleep for how early I needed to get up. Whiplash is certainly one of the tightest movies ever made, in terms of both writing and editing, but those elements work in tandem with the performances. Miles Teller pushing himself beyond his limits, sweating and bleeding, give the movie an urgency that fits the technical austerity. And of course JK Simmons, who won every award a supporting actor possibly could, for one of the most intense acting jobs ever put on film. Are the characters likable? Is the instructor's theory flawed? Was the journey worth what they put each other through? Go to the boards to discuss, but recognize that this movie will squeeze you like a ball of playdough between its fingers and you will not walk away unaffected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genius is often attained at the cost of sanity, and/or dignity. Tough love is an outdated concept, but its necessity still lingers for some. In Whiplash, an ambitious, driven young man thinks he has found the mentor to take him to the top, but the teacher's methods become increasingly unhinged. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons give outstanding performances that fuel this high-octane piece. Standards of sanity are never relevant here; it is all about how far you can go, how much you can take. Two strong personalities knock hard against each other with no give expected, till a conciliation, or symbiosis, emerges in the end. For me, the only plothole was the fact that Fletcher's violence came as a surprise. In every school there is a teacher who is fearsome and that earns them a reputation. Fletcher's 'methods' would have been the talk of the campus - for Andrew to finally gain entry to that classroom having heard nothing of Fletcher's violence and vitriol was a beat that badly deflated the narrative. That one gaping wound aside, this is a gripping, visceral ride of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This amazing movie has rightfully moved up to number 41 on the IMDb top 250. J.K. Simmons is acting at his best in this movie, definitely his most impressive role to date. Deserving of it,he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this role. Miles Teller as well delivered a memorable role, possibly being the jump start to a successful acting career. Other elements of the film also made the movie a work of art, such as the sound mixing, cinematography, and the impressive editing. The story shows the struggle of dedication and its reward. Miles Teller plays a kid unlike others, that has his heart and hands set on drumming. I won't spoil this movie, mostly because it deserves to be watched by all. In all seriousness, this is a MUST watch movie, one to remember as one of the best films of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is about Andrew Naimen, a young drummer and his relationship with his abusive instructor, Terence Fletcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash revolves around Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a 19-year old first-year student of Shaffer Conservatory (a music university). Drumming is his talent and passion. He has a dream of becoming a great drummer, a drummer who will be remembered forever. Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is an instructor who conducts the Studio Band, a top jazz orchestra at the conservatory. He is known for his brutal and abusive, yet inspirational teaching style. Andrew believes that Fletcher is someone who can lead him to the greatness he had always dreamed of. Since Fletcher has a certain pedagogy, Andrew is of the opinion that if he impressed Fletcher, then the greatness he is looking for could definitely be accomplished. So impressing an arrogant, abusive, and self-obsessed Fletcher becomes Andrew's goal in place of enjoying his passion for drumming. But things don't go right way when you are actually on the wrong path. Fletcher's pedagogy of pushing-people-beyond-what's-expected-of-them turns Andrew's dream of becoming great into a nightmare full of frustration. Though Andrew does every effort to become Fletcher's favorite, it is clearly seen that he doesn't enjoy his drumming any more. Though he practices hard till his hands bleed, his initial mentor-student bond with Fletcher slowly becomes somewhat like a psychological warfare. Andrew eventually gives up and, at the urging of his father, anonymously gets Fletcher fired for abuse. The ending is the most electrifying climax you'll ever see in a movie. In the final scene, just before the performance starts, Fletcher tells Andrew that he knows the truth about who spoke against him. Andrew has to play a song he knows nothing about, and is deeply embarrassed. He walks away from the stage where his father hugs him, probably saying "GOOD JOB". But what Fletcher told Andrew about "the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged" has been at the back of Andrew's mind. He goes back to the stage and turns the tables. He leads Fletcher's band to play the song he was prepared to play, the one he has practiced innumerable times. Since he had Nothing to lose, he delivers a classic performance. Fletcher, who was annoyed with Andrew in the beginning, decides to enjoy his talent. Probably he found his Charlie Parker at last. Personally, I hate Fletcher's arrogant teaching methodology. But I wholeheartedly appreciated his idea "to push people beyond what's expected of them is the absolute necessity". At the scene with the lawyer when Andrew's father said, "You think I was going to let him put my son through hell and walk off Scot-free?", I deeply felt that it wasn't hell at all but actually the ultimate level of training and practice. As a wise man once said "The finest steel has to go through the hottest fire", those sores in Andrew's hand were actually a symbol of his drumming talent turning into skill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movie in 2014. i've seen. The movie is unexpected,uptight and looking in one breath.Great acting by J.K.Simmons, he deservedly won Oscar. On the other side is Miles Teller who show us again how he can become a great actor if he continue to work in this way. Great reference to the story of Charlie Parker, i love that guy too. I recommend this movie for all movie maniacs like me, and others who understand what's the quality, and for music lovers. Whiplash and Caravan are wonderful compositions, love them too. That's another deservedly won Oscar. Soun mixing is awesome. If you ever dream to be the best this movie gave the great inspiration for that, and that means you can't avoid this movie. Really magnificent drama for 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most impactful, inspiring and humanistic film I have seen in a long time. From the start to finish, it was breathtaking and emotional to sit through. Because of the cinematography that builds tension and the direction that brings about that captivating and compelling feeling. You can almost literally feel the emotions poring out of the characters. This movie revolves around the human ambition for greatness and how not everyone is how they seem. This is just simply a sensation film making from start to finish and it really had my attention all the way through. Certain people need that kick in the rear to focus and get started, but the question is how much pushing can some people take. I guess if they want it enough they can handle it, because the end justify the means for them. Watching this film was sort of like a more artistic and powerful portrayal of how Gordon Ramsay treats his chefs on television. Except Ramsay is probably doing it for rating and publicity stunt. Although certain portion of him makes him do that, it's mostly for the ratings. Overall, this is a film that really hits the core with it's emotions and intensity. I highly recommend it. The techinical aspect of this film when it comes to the music, instruments, direction and cinematography with some fantastic acting trutly brings this film to life.9.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. I did not expect to enjoy it, since I went into it without an appreciation for Jazz music or how passionate musicians can be. However, Andrew's journey was both emotional and psychological, and I was very intrigued by how his relationship with Fletcher formed. By the time the film had ended, I had developed an interest in the Jazz music scene and I had so much more appreciation for the intensity of performance art and the work that goes into it. I see the pressure that is put on musicians and other artists to be perfect, and that even though music is supposed to be a means of expression, sometimes there is no room for error.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely incredible. I love everything about this movie. It manages to turn jazz music into some kind of monster, something that brings fear to mind at the mention of its name. The acting in this movie is amazing. The lead Miles Teller shows an extremely believable portrayal of the young and ambitious drummer Andrew and manages to remain realistic throughout the entire film, even in some of the more demanding scenes. However, nothing can hold a candle to the year's Best Supporting Actor Oscar Winner J.K. Simmons, whose performance is absolutely terrifying and scarring. He steals the show with his extreme bursts of anger and intense methods of teaching. In fact, every single actor on this film manages to be outstanding. They all show a great, realistic enactment for each of their characters respectively. Most of the film is extremely intense and hard to watch and is not for the faint hearted as it shows in full detail the many tortures the characters endure that will leave viewers either on the edge of their seats or hiding behind their hands in horror. Overall, the film is traumatising yet beautiful and, in my own opinion, more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than any of the other films up for nomination that year because of how disturbing yet wonderful the film shows the more torturous side of the music industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blistering, intensely gratifying study on what it takes to succeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My head is still spinning from the whirlwind of what I just experienced. WHIPLASH isn't just a film. It has to be seen to be believed. The plot, although it probably won't do it justice, is about a young drummer (Miles Teller) who is accepted into a conservatory jazz band led by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Miles Teller's character wants to be one of the greats, and Fletcher uses what some would consider questionable methods to push him in that direction. That's really all you need to know going in. I should say that this is the absolute best I've seen out of Miles Teller, having graduated from teen fare like THE SPECTACULAR NOW. And J.K. Simmons? Wow! He brought such an intensity to his role that I wasn't prepared for. He's probably the best antagonist I've seen since R. Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET, and pretty much as creative. However, it's not just the performances that make this such a compelling watch. This film has some of the best editing I've ever seen, and it fit so well with the jazz score. The various production elements were tightly woven and integrated in a way that pulls you into the story and never lets you go until the final frame. Unlike, say BIRDMAN, this completely lived up to the hype in my opinion. As a character study on what it takes to succeed, WHIPLASH is second to none. This feels like something that will be studied in years to come, and it's definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

Although some things in this movie you might not get as well if you don't play an instrument, the intensity is still incredible.

		<fullReview>Totally engrossing from frame one! Whiplash grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end. And we are talking about a movie focused on playing the drums. No murder plots, explosions, sex scenes, etc... simply a tight, well-told story. Fast cuts help move the plot along and it never drags. Surprises and twists make this a phenomenal movie that forces you to go back and analyze everything that happened. The music is great. I think that is really important because the sound becomes a character that helps tell the story. The greatest part is this movie is not a niche movie, it's not limited to "band geeks". I'd say it is identifiable to anyone who has worked in any way to be the best at something. Whiplash tells the story of a man who wants to be the best and shows the cost and torture he will endure to seek that goal. The language is vulgar, but even this serves a purpose; is our teacher abusive or tough with good intentions?</fullReview>

The movie give you a whole new appreciation for Jazz and the (not so) dying art of live band.The characters are fantastic. But what really sets this movie apart from the others, is that it dosen't care about the 'everything turning out just right' that other movies constantly barrage us with. But that dosen't mean it ends badly. There are little tones and scenes that anyone who has ever thought about giving it all up can relate to. Whether it be work or passion, you can feel it.Give it a go, I'm glad I did.* if you're still not sure, look up the trailer, there's a scene between Fletcher (the teacher/conductor) and the drummer (protagonist). It sums up the feeling of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having decided to watch this on a whim, it turned out to be a fantastic way to spend just under two hours. I often found myself surprised at the amount of tension and anticipation that was created from a story that was essentially about drumming. It doesn't take a musical background to tap into the sheer passion that all characters exhibit throughout the whole film. The chemistry between the teacher-student duo of Teller and Simmons was incredible and I found both characters surprisingly insightful, with great depth and complexity. In saying that, all of the characters seemed to have some level that it was possible to understand, even the parents and girlfriend. It had my attention right from the start and it was definitely the best movie I've seen in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is hands down by far the best movie in recent years which really did J.K Simmons justice of his badass voice and talent. So this movie is basically about a kid Miles Teller who is a drummer who wanted to get into Simmons's music class since he knew for a FACT that if he gets in that class his life can reach new heights. But what he didn't knew is that J.k Simmons is actually the antagonist of the movie in which he is a strong sturdy character that doesn't take sh*t he just straight up mean business. Harsh business since J.K Simmons in the movie is hands down the most hardcore douche in cinema history. Simmons started out as a guy who seem tough but "seems" to have a soft heart but that was only through Miles's eyes. Once Teller has experience Simmons' hardcore factor he'd realize that Simmons is just hell. Simmons is giving this kid everything he had ordered from Satan's Burger, a big burger with extra rage cheese and bloody beef. I really like that fact that this movie addresses a character like Simmons because we ALL had experienced this kind of feeling in life, each and every single one of us had a boss or teacher like that who are willing to shut our dreams and spirits down like blowing out a candle because what is a hobby if we don't enjoy it? A hard worker is a person who turns his hobby into a job but what if you can't do that? what if there's a douche constantly telling you that you're not good enough for the job and you're not good enough for your hobby. This movie's tension is built so perfectly that I have not bit my nails as hard ever since. I honestly bit off my entire whole hand why I watch the tension built in on stage. The moment when the tension was at its highest is definitely the moment when Teller is hit by a truck symbolizing the fact that Teller is slowly turning out to be a guy that doesn't feel pain or feel anything anymore, eventually he'd be drumming without emotions which was really tense. In conclusion the movie is absolutely amazing with simple but great plot that relates to the audiences and great character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You need a whiplash to achieve greatness. A scar of triumph every once in a while. You need to bleed here and there to feel alive!! This. This masterpiece that summarises every single meaning of passion; of commitment; of goal settings. Frustration. A word, so strong and powerful that you can sense its impact by just hearing it. What happens when you push yourself to the limits? Okay, what happens when you push everybody around you to the limits? How about pushing the limits itself to the point where you end up being the bad person and the villain in everybody's story? "There are no two words, in the English language, more harmful than 'Good Job'." Fletcher managed to put such simple words together to create the most accurate description of what it takes to build sth real! All you do is keep pushing. You keep pushing yourself; you keep pushing those around you; you even keep pushing chances and opportunities to the limits! Diamonds become diamonds when put under pressure... That must count as sth! And no greater scene you could sink in its details as the finale of this masterpiece! How accurate the cinematography was. How beautiful Miles played the role. How graceful Simmons managed to be the vengeful, most passionate maestro! The final scene of this film summarises the whole idea of the story. Andrew is scared at first, but he keeps trying. Fletcher gets to him as he always does. Andrew decides to quit. But wait? What? After all that? Quitting? Really? Hold on! No! He's not quitting! What's he doing? He's whiplashing the drums! He's playing the Caravan; he's playing the Caravan as if he originally wrote it! He's leading the orchestra? The plot thickens! The heat starts to radiate! The whiplashing results in blood! THE MASTER SURRENDERS AND FOLLOWS THE STUDENT! A smile of acceptance is finally unleashed from the mentor! They're harmonious! They're synching... That moment! That very exact moment! To have your dream come true right in front of your eyes! One can live and die waiting for such one. Frustration isn't the enemy of hope. Frustration is the pressure that results in the diamond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply electrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>19-year-old Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller) is an ambitious jazz drummer who wants to be one of the greats like Buddy Rich. He's a first-year student at New York's prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. Shaffer's most respected and most feared instructor, Terence Fletcher (played by the excellent J.K. Simmons), discovers Andrew and transfers him to his studio band. But Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as Fletcher constantly abuses and berates him, pushing him beyond what's expected of him and to the brink of his ability and sanity.Written and directed by Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, Grand Piano) and produced by Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air) and Jason Blum (The Purge, Sinister), Whiplash is a prime example of truly electrifying, explosive, and powerful filmmaking that moves at a vicious breakneck pace and never fails to keep you on the edge. It's a tense, hyper-kinetic, and simply dazzling cinematic experience that's definitely worthy of repeat viewings.As Andrew Neiman, Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now, Divergent) gives a spectacular performance as the character. Andrew, while in a relatable situation, is an unlikeable character who aspires to be one of the great jazz drummers and has a great passion for what he does. In fact, there's a scene where Andrew breaks up with his love interest Nicole (played by the lovely Melissa Benoist) because he "knows" that their relationship will run its course, and how he'll become a great drummer and she'll start to resent him. The crux of Andrew is that he's a gifted jazz drummer without any friends. He drums until his hands start to bleed badly, he punches through a drum snare, and he shouts profanities while playing. We, as an audience, are disgusted rather than pleased at Andrew's dedication.Normally, if a film has unlikable characters that I can't stand watching, I wouldn't exactly be pleased. But here, Neiman and Fletcher are both fascinating to watch. Speaking of Fletcher, J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man, Juno) gives the performance of his career as Fletcher. Not only is he intimidating, not only do the interactions between the clashing characters of Neiman and Fletcher work extremely well, but what works so well about Fletcher is that he can switch from incredibly calm to stark-raving mad within the blink of an eye. His dialogue is extremely quotable and meme-worthy, and it just works unbelievably well. Simmons truly deserved his Oscar for this role. Supporting players such as Paul Reiser (Beverly Hills Cop, Aliens) and Melissa Benoist (Supergirl, Glee) fare well in their roles, as do the rest of the cast, but Simmons and Teller are simply a revelation on-screen.On a technical level, Whiplash is an absolute marvel. Damien Chazelle's top-notch writing and hyper-kinetic direction are just flawless. You can tell from Chazelle's strong direction that he truly cared about making the best possible film he can, and he succeeds triumphantly. Chazelle keeps every element in the film in rhythm with each other perfectly and controls the film's tension and atmosphere with transcendent attention to detail, and the results are just glorious to behold. The gorgeous cinematography and excellent camera-work by Sharone Meir (The Last House on the Left, Coach Carter) gives the film a slick look and the film is just beautiful to look at. The production designs by Melanie Paizis-Jones (The Purge, The Lazarus Effect) are very impressive, the razor-sharp editing by Tom Cross (Time Lapse) is high-octane and cutthroat, and the soundtrack is purely and simply amazing. I also can't say enough good things about the truly exhilarating finale.In summary, Whiplash is one of the most entertaining and emotionally devastating films to come out in quite some time, with excellent performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, breathtaking editing and cinematography, strong writing and direction from Damien Chazelle, and brilliant interactions between Simmons' and Teller's clashing characters. A truly spectacular viewing experience. Final rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

As you might guess, Andrew is determined to do the latter, no matter how tough it gets.WhiplashAndrew seems like the kind of character Tom Cruise may have played in the '80s; flawed, insular, but confident in his abilities. He has a past that is hinted at, and is a character that bleeds - literally and figuratively - for even a slim chance of being great, and Teller plays him perfectly. A flawed character that you don't need to relate to, he is fascinating and deeply layered.JK Simmons is one of those actors that is simply never bad. Whether he's playing Juno's dad or an outlandish character in a comic book movie, he brings something human and real to his roles. Here, he's an absolute bastard with questionable-at-best reasons for acting the way he does. But there's something within Fletcher that commands respect and approval, and Simmons hints at a light just beyond the tunnel.It's worth pointing out also that writer/director Damien Chazelle is a mere 29 years old. His work here shows a helmer embodying not with potential, but incredible assurance for one so young. Watch him soar.The kind of film that takes a while to fully digest and appreciate, Whiplash will stand up well to multiple viewings.Genuinely magnificent stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must - watch movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on my boyfriend's recommendation. He told me how it's one of those films who are a bit hard to watch but are still full of motivation and full of desire for success. Today I finally took some time and decided to watch it. I'm not sure what to say, because a movie like this can confuse you. On the one hand, you can see it as motivation but then if you look on the other hand, maybe even as a revenge or as a will to win. I really admire those two characters, Fletcher and Andrew. And even though I don't approve Fletcher's behavior as a teacher I'm glad that he gave a chance to some "lost cases", to the players who no one saw although they were always there, hiding in the corner of a room, silent, but with a great talent. I think that Fletcher probably only wanted to see their best. To push them to their limits, to make them fearless because in the end, music will stay on them, and in that moment of courage I think they only can be the heroes of the world. Heroes of the music just like Andrew. He didn't give up. He proved everybody that he truly deserved to play drums. He proved that he really was there for a reason. This movie will show you that no matter what people say, if you want to succeed you have to try, to work really hard and mostly to believe in yourself. One day you will be at the top, you will be listed as one of the greatest people. Greatest musicians. This movie will give you motivation to pick up your instrument again or to finish something you never did. Maybe you didn't have enough courage or maybe you didn't want to end up alone, but I'm gonna tell you that you should get up, do things that you love and believe in yourself. Only thing that you need is a few minutes of bravery and trust me, one day you will find yourself with the greatest people walking besides you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say the least, Whiplash is definitely one of my personal favorites. As a jazz drummer myself, this movie brings the extreme into play and it does a very good job doing so. Needless to say, Miles Teller did an amazing job playing the role of Andrew, a jazz drummer in the school's top orchestra. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) made sure to push the most out of his students and his unfortunate downfall led him to the end of the movie. In this, Andrew &amp; Fletcher work more or less together to create an amazing drum solo that brings this movie out and about to top off the cake that this movie was. Truly an incredible show.10/10 - Amazing to See.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash hit a high note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With nearly no soundtrack, Whiplash still manages to accelerate with tension so brilliantly executed it could not have been done better. The film projects an interesting message? one that questions the very theory of teaching. By pushing your students beyond the boundaries, will they be able to make it out as a star? Or will they end up overwhelmed, exhausted and afraid to embark further? Whiplash portrays this controversial message through the life a young drummer, Andrew, (a surprisingly talented Miles Teller), who begins to question his talent when he is coached by the ruthless and abusive Fletcher (a well- deserving Oscar winner J.K Simmons). Chazelle directs the heartbreaking picture with heart and soul? delivering an outstanding opening sequence in which the camera slowly gets closer while the loud drum beats hit. The constant thrill of Andrew and Fletcher standing in the same room ignites the suspense and excellence of the film? proving the point and message it gave out. Teller's performance was truly excellent, and it was sad to see his amount of nominations at the Oscars (zero). Simmons was perfect and precise. He perfectly fit the role of Fletcher, the toughest character to judge. Fletcher is portrayed throughout most of the film to be the main antagonist of Andrew. But throughout the film we receive little glimpses of human feelings and emotion? making you question whether he is a villain or just a coach who takes teaching to the extreme. Andrew did not have to be in his class. It was a choice that he made to go into this class with this teacher? and it was his choice to say. The film magnificently illustrates these small breakthroughs of each character perfectly. With a brilliant setup, a thrilling middle section and the most satisfying ending one could ask for, Whiplash hit a high note. A. Ryan Farrell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your adrenaline starts to flowYour blood is rushingYour hands are bleedingYou make it good, you make it bleedWHIPLASH!Andrew Neiman, a freshman at Shaffer Conservatory, is determined to become the perfect jazz drummer. Andrew meets a terrifying instructor at school, his name is Terence Fletcher. Fletcher runs the school's best jazz ensemble. After finding Andrew alone practicing his drumming, he is determined that he wants Andrew in his band. Once on board, Andrew is treated with offensive behavior and insults. Fletcher himself is a stubborn middle-aged man that will sacrifice his own career just to find the next CharlieParker.But Andrew believes that gaining Fletcher's respect and approval is the key to achieving his one desire, so puts everything he has into it, including his personal life and even sanity. While music is the central theme of this movie, it is about so much more than that. Whiplash is essentially a film about a student who is willing to go further than any other human being to accomplish his goals.The film brilliantly combines drama and psychological terror, creating an atmosphere with feelings of fear, love and hate. None of the above would be possible without the great cinematographer Sharone Meir. Sharone's stunning photography catches every bit of sweat and blood, turning everything into an exhilarating art-house full of lightning bolts-hammering the audience with striking emotion! Damien Chazelle's script is marvelously written with excellent pacing and furious dramatic elements.The stars of the film are of course our leads, J.K. Simmons as Fletcher and Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman. Teller is absolutely amazing as Andrew Neiman. Whiplash is where he gets his opportunity to show his acting skills and his subtle turn as a very important character and ambitious student in the heart of the film.J.K. Simmons is really the ace in the sleeve, his thrilling and mesmerizing performance just gives me an urge to jump out of happiness on the edge of my seat. Never in my life have I seen such a good adaption to a character before. How can they create a character like that? How can they make the character feel so human? That is beyond my imagination.A good edit is something that you don't notice, but I think it can be the other way around. An amazing edit like the one in Whiplash is something you definitely won't miss.Breaking down the various aspects of this film, the thing that stands out the most is the performances by the two leads. Miles Teller driving the enthusiasm and energy into the character of a highly motivated drummer really is inspiring. J.K. Simmons' absolutely perfect portrayal of the furiously scary teacher was raw and brutal. Even if the character was unforgettable and cruel, I myself could relate to him somehow. Their characters kind of represent the good and the bad in life. One can't be anything without the other. The whole film was shot in 19 days. I'm very thankful towards the creator and the crew behind this, one can't make a masterpiece single- handedly.Thanks for the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One big question for one big film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is the best film I've seen in the last two years. It's a story about a guy, a teacher and a drum-set, or more simply it's a story about human soul and its perpetual oscillation between touching the sky and lying on the ground. At the very end of the day, what the entire film tries to do is to put a Hamlet-like question to the audience: it's better to live a simple life without pain, free from troubles, being an average man, or is better to devote every single breathe of your existence to the dream of becoming the best man in the world at doing something (no matter what, from the pusher to the musician). To be or not to be the best one, that is the question. There are no easy answers to this query, the film itself is opened to interpretation, but one thing is to say, Whiplash gives the best non-answer EVER to the questioning. The way the film deals with the issue is somewhat awe-inspiring. So simple, so powerful. In many ways is possible to say that the film's style is minimal. One big topic. Two main characters. Few locations. No special effects. Another reason for love it. So clear, so accurate. A surgery operation to the heart of one of the most intricate dilemma of the history of human beings. Does the film move a big criticism to the American Dream, to the constitutional (and maybe childish) right to the pursuit of happiness? Who knows. Anyway, one thing is made crystal clear: Epicureanism is not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness the makers of this film denouncing mediocrity did not produce a mediocre film! I watched Whiplash twice, in part because the music component appealed to me greatly, having been trained as a classical pianist who enjoyed the mentorship of a teacher who forced me to play the Bach Inventions backwards until I burst into tears. I was in the third grade when I quit taking lessons from him. Anyway, quite a bit later on, I ended up deciding that performance was not for me, in part for some of the very reasons highlighted in this film: that excellence in this realm requires obsessive compulsive concern with audience reception, aka: fame. This is a very different aspiration than the quest to produce something beautiful or great, which is its own reward, whether or not anyone ever finds out that it has been done.Whiplash echoes some of the themes touched on in Black Swan, another story about a performance artist driven to the edge. Here it's a fellow with bloody fingers; there it's a neurotic young woman with bloody toes. Both films exalt the strive for "greatness" while simultaneously highlighting that performance artists are in some ways incredibly insecure, even pathetic, always seeking to gain the favor of their mentors--whoever they are, and no matter how vicious they may be.Performing musicians and dancers may be closer to athletes than to composers or writers, though in some cases they, too, become obsessed with critical reception. The mentors of some performance artists are tantamount to sadistic coaches or military commanders who impel their pupils to be better through the use of fear, shame and humiliation. Performers, like athletes, seek to push their bodies to their physical limits, as is well illustrated in both Whiplash and Black Swan. Is it great to be considered great by throngs of (mediocre) concert goers or sports enthusiasts? In a relative sense, yes. But the noblest quest would seem to be the desire to produce something perfect, which the makers of Whiplash certainly aspired to, with close attention to every detail. The acting of the two principal players, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller, was superlative. No surprise that this film garnered three Oscars. The use of color was gorgeous, and the cinematography more generally excellent. I am wondering why Simmons was considered a supporting actor, not a lead. In any case, he was perfect for the role, having spent years practicing the fine art of anger expression while acting as a neo-Nazi white supremacist in the television series Oz. Very convincing performance indeed, of a person driven by ideals which in one case are considered misguided and in the other laudable, but pursued ruthlessly, with no concern for the bodies left in his wake.All in all, this film offers a very compelling and thought-provoking examination of how the petty and in some ways ignoble desire to become remembered as "great" may drive performers to excel--if it does not kill them first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who said that really good movies these days have to be big budget and star-studded?Whiplash, put simply, is the story of a young music student hopelessly enamored with ambitions of becoming a great jazz drummer. Andrew, wonderfully underplayed by Miles Teller, is the anti-hero of the film. Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons, is his teacher/nemesis at the conservatory.There are basically two main sets in this movie: a dark concert hall and a dark rehearsal room at the conservatory. Sound boring and mono-dimensional? Think again! As Shakespeare has proved timelessly, the epitome of a good play is something that can still be riveting without car chases, fight scenes, exploding buildings, etc. by virtue of its plot and dialogue alone. This movie simply doesn't need any of this irrelevant eye candy to carry along what is fundamentally a simple premise, masterfully acted.The cinematography is dark and brooding and augurs well for the character of Fletcher -- a complex and nasty man. Intermingled with his rages and browbeating, we see glimpses of a tender man who suffers for his craft. He is a perfectionist and demands nothing less in his students. When he spies Andrew and invites him to an audition with the main band, we are left wondering if he is just messing with Andrew's mind or genuinely interested in seeking the best talent for the conservatory. The question is not resolved until the end of the movie and its resolution is, indeed, one of the pillars of the plot.Andrew is so driven and passionate about his craft that he is willing to sacrifice friendships and love interests. Neither pain nor serious injury can stand in the way of taking his rightful place -- in his mind anyway -- as principal drummer. He wonders if anybody at all really understands him -- including his sports-minded family -- but the answer soon becomes clear.This movie rests on the strength of its characters. Paul Reiser plays a very minor role as Andrew's father but the supporting cast becomes almost invisible to the audience as the film progresses.It would be nitpicking to say the resolution of Andrew's love interest left something to be desired, but that is my only criticism; the rest if virtually faultless. That being said, by the end of the movie we feel that we know a lot about the two main protagonists: their frailties, their shortcomings, their pride. There is military-grade cursing in this movie, but, strangely, it doesn't seem at all out of place.Whether they are mortal enemies or admiring friends is a leitmotif that hangs in the air like a suspended note throughout the entire film. There are so many twists and turns in their relationship that we are left wondering until the denouement.There is nothing predictable in this movie. The pacing is good: the 107 minutes just fly by. The surprisingly yet satisfyingly abrupt ending has no need for an epilogue. A few simple gestures and glances say more than an additional superfluous scene ever could. The final scene is both thrilling and inspiring.If you want a break from unbelievable car chase sequences and the epic disaster movies that have recently been flooding the silver screen, this movie will be food for the soul and a source of wonderful refreshment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possible Spoiler: Acceptable of difference in perspective is pivotal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the abusive teaching style (which I thought was laid on a LITTLE thick) I still feel that this movie deserves high ratings. I felt that the editing style aided the stress, tension and ambition for Andrew (Miles Teller's character) to show that he really was working as hard as he could ( I could see why it won for best editing for the Oscars). The quick fast cuts of when Andrew was practicing in his room, hands bleeding, etc expresses his motivation and determination for the ending goal he's working towards.The feel and atmosphere of the film was also aided by the color and somewhat lack of lighting contrast in the film. It came off to me almost like noir-ish due to the low-key lighting. I felt that this style helped create the feeling that while this movie was about inspiration and shooting for your dreams, the road there was a harsh uphill climb. As for character development, Andrew's character when through not only development, but also a change. When we first saw his character, he was interested in becoming "the next Buddy rich" but throughout the movie he found that he had to show Fletcher that he was worth it. During that transition, he went into and then destroyed an intimate relationship, cut off ties with family, all to show that his focus and attention was towards proving his worth to Fletcher. As for Fletcher's character development, you saw both sides of his persona .You find that he wants to push his students to the max and unfortunately through that, he because a somewhat of an abusive teacher. I don't feel from how I viewed his character, that his abusive characteristics were solely stemmed from a history but from a teaching style (maybe previously acquired from a teacher of his own). I think this is proved when Andrew meets him after an absence at the Jazz club they sit down and talk and Fletcher says "There are no two words worse in the English language than "Good Job"". This dialogue in itself I feel proves that while his style is somewhat abusive, it shoves that there's a somewhat "Method to his madness". While he was abusive and I not one to condone such behavior, through some of Fletcher's dialogue he shows that his unorthodox teaching style promoted persistence, ambition and self confidence in his students.The subject matter of abuse while hard to watch is a point of interest/trend for movies nowadays, Tarantino being the leader in this. I remember watching an interview with Tarintino once and the interviewer asked "why are your films so dark and abusive. Don't you want to show what you think the world is like?" and his answer was "I am showing what my view of the world is". It was the same thing with Hitchcock when an interviewer asked, "Why don't you ever do comedies?" and he replied, "All my films are comedies". This shows that filmmakers are showing their view and perception of the world. I've noticed that a lot of comments on this movie and their final thoughts and decision seemed to be based on solely one aspect of the film, the abusive behavior of Fletcher's character. Basing a movie solely on one aspect dilutes the appreciation for art.</fullReview>

Mostly the worst part of this movie is trying to get past the angry angst of a perfectionist with a temper. This review does not employ tactics that require extraordinary talents to appreciate verbosity so I say again clean the blood off my drum kit. If you hated your teacher in grade 4, 3, 7. Well you will hate the teacher in this movie. The point is no matter how you hated him/her did you come out the other end better off anyway? Only you can answer that.

This film honestly made me a fan of teller and i don't think anybody else could have played the role better because he really captures that "i can do it" attitude that keeps you locked into the film. The film really does have this build to it that is almost too brilliant and the personalities show within the actors so very well that it inspires you to really examine yourself and your goals and think "what drives me?" and "what is my purpose?".

But if you are committed, you will make it - if you have what it takes. Who should have an idea of what it takes - why, someone who has the qualifications.Except for one thing of my personal taste, which you will know after watching this movie, I say to one and all - WATCH IT, it is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding, breathtaking, heart-racing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, in a word, phenomenal. The actors do an amazing job to bring the emotions to life. I felt rage one moment, and sadness the next. Culminated by a sense of pure awe. The relationship between characters rides a line between pure hatred and admiration. One of the most fantastic and breathtaking movies in years. I could re-watch this movie a dozen times and still be utterly blown away. This film is an absolute must see for anyone who is a fan of high strung, emotional films, or really just a movie lover in general. A roller coaster of emotions with a main character you can never stop cheering for.Quite an experience, and one I would highly recommend to anyone who asked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a musician for the past 10 or so years, I was easily intrigued by and reeled into this film. My interest level also increased upon finding out that this was about a jazz band. So, I applaud them for doing something that was different than usual. The acting in the movie was phenomenal and close to perfection. J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller both played their roles with precision, with J.K. being the old, intimidating director who demanded perfection no matter the cost, and Miles portraying a young, raw-talented musician who would do anything to please this director and become successful. J.K.'s performance in particular really impressed me. His lines, his intimidation factor, his profanity, his bizarre actions. Simmons owned it. I also enjoyed the cinematography as well as the soundtrack. Both being pieces of art in my humble opinion.Now, about the ending. To be honest, I was very upset at the ending after my first viewing. I wanted more. What happens after the performance? Did he earn J.K.'s respect? Was his ex girlfriend there/impressed? Does he get signed by someone like the Blue Note? I wanted answers. However; after watching again and thinking about it, I realized that this movie was aimed to show what this kid would do just to be perfect. And in the end, after he nails that epic solo, and once he hits that last cymbal crash, perfection is resembled. He had done it. He had accomplished it. It was perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Whiplash' is an outstanding piece of art highlighted by Teller and Simmons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been very excited to see Whiplash for a long time. Reviewers that I follow and watch had praised the movie a lot, and from the trailers and things I knew about the film, it looked like a fantastic film. So, when I finally saw that it was on Starz on Demand, I immediately sat down and watched the full 106-minute picture. Boy, am I glad that I did. Because, in my personal opinion, Whiplash is one of my favorite films of all time. Let's get into why.Whiplash follows a first year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York, named Andrew Neiman, who catches the attention of a famed conductor, and the jazz teacher at the Conservatory, named Terence Fletcher. What follows this is a psychological battle of wits between a hardass teacher and a student who just wants to please his teacher.This movie seriously is fantastic. Let's start with the obvious: the acting. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons together are probably the best movie pair I've seen in a long while. They play off of each other so well. I honestly believe that if Teller or Simmons hadn't been in the movie, it wouldn't have worked so well.Simmons brings a whole new level to the character of Fletcher. Fletcher is constantly spewing out insults and such, and what makes it work is that Simmons is so dedicated to his role. I read that on set, Simmons would always be in the character of Fletcher during takes, but during the breaks, he'd be the nicest guy ever, which made the filming sessions easier. That's some damn dedication right there. And we can't forget about Miles Teller, who truly plays the character of Andrew well. Teller hits the right balance between a scared student who wants to please a teacher, and a student who just wants people to understand how his music affects him. It's a joy to watch his scenes with others, like his father or his girlfriend, and how he tries to convey to them what the drumming truly means to him. The other main actors, Paul Reiser, Austin Stowell, and Melissa Benoist all do well in their roles as well.The music featured in the film (including the pieces Whiplash and Caravan) all sounds fantastic. I was honestly surprised at how cool the music sounded. I wasn't expecting jazz music (because going into the film, I actually didn't know how big of a part jazz played), and it worked so well for me, probably because of that. The cinematography and the film editing really bring this film up another notch, if that's even possible. The editing during Teller's drumming scenes really puts you in Andrew Neiman's shoes as he tries his hardest to please a teacher who can't be pleased. The cinematography works as well, showing off the band and Neiman equally, which gives greater perspective to what Teller's character is trying to accomplish.The overarching plot and script to the film are fantastic. As I said, the dialogue is actually really great, and I do see why people really enjoyed the screenplay and why it was on the Hollywood Black List in 2012. It's really fantastic, and some of the exchanges between Fletcher and Neiman are just exhilarating to watch.Whiplash is definitely one of my favorite films. The acting, music, editing, script, and just everything about the film is fantastic. If you want to see some Oscar bait, a prime example of it is definitely this film. If you haven't seen this glorious piece of art, please go see it. You'll thank me when you did.10/10 | Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How a movie can just grab you and take you on a ride you weren't expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that it's the first ever time i've wanted to watch a movie twice in a row. At the end of Whiplash, I was so excited and tense at the same time that I had no idea what to do with myself. The only thing I wanted to do, was watch it a second time...Whiplash is by far one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I was captured from the start, almost hypnotized by the intensity in this movie. It wasn't even the story that was so captivating, because any movie could have the same plot and turn it into a will-he-won't- he-underdog-becomes-greatest movie. No, this movie had so much more to it, a depth that you rarely see nowadays. It's all about the psychology of the two main characters. They are both painfully difficult to understand, and are both completely messed up in their own way. As soon as they meet, something happens. Something profoundly exciting but scary at the same time, and it's almost mesmerizing... I'd seen J.K. Simons play some pretty good parts. But with this movie, I was praying for him to win an Oscar. The level of sophistication he brought to his character is just unreal. You completely forget that it's the same guy playing the nice dad in Juno. I kept on wondering what the f I would to if I was the one in front of him. He inspires fear, self- consciousness, rage and a thirst to do better... By the time this movie was finished, I was clinging on to my sofa unable to think of anything else than this movie. I had so many questions in my head, and the kind of questions you have when a movie doesn't make sense. I was basically struggling to figure out exactly what had just happened, because there were so many different possibilities and ideas going through my head, and I wasn't able to stop thinking about it for days.Plus, the music is pretty awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' (2014) left me suspended in a void of tension and suspense throughout the entirety of the film. This was thanks to the intelligent construction and development of Andrew, an aspiring drum student (Miles Teller) and Fletcher (J. K. Simmons, who took the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a supporting role), his demanding and overbearing mentor.To merely call this film a film would be a mistake. Once the curtains closed, I was left thinking about this masterpiece and the impact it had on me emotionally. When a film can have this impact, transcending the medium of mere visual entertainment to enter the realms of emotional enlightenment, that is something special. You know how an Italian chef kisses his fingers and says something in Italian that translates to "A Masterpiece" after tasting their own dish? That's how I feel about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I seen the trailers for this I wasn't very excited, actually I didn't have any intentions to watch it until it maybe appeared on Netflix or maybe normal television. After being beatdown by my brother for months and my twitter followers constantly recommending it. I gave in last week. Here are my thoughts on it.Where else to start with this film but the acting, I mean WOW! This was my first time seeing Miles Teller act, and I was blown away by such a performance from somebody I always assumed was going to be another member of the 20s comedy crop, very happy I was wrong. As student Andrew Neiman, Teller was able to showcase a complete range of his ability, be it giddy and flirty with the incredible Nicole (Melissa Benoist) to gut wrenchingly fighting for his place the band. Then we have a performance by everybody's favourite Spider-Man character J Jonah Jameson, J K Simmons who played Jazz instructor Terence Fletcher, I say "played" he really became him, another unfathomable performance, very easy to see why he won the Academy Award plus about 40 others for it. For me Fletcher is one of the scariest movie villains of all time, some of the scenes are so intense by Simmons you find yourself exhaling like you're on the receiving end of his tirades of mental and verbal abuse.The use of cinematography in this film was superb, it really gives the viewer a look into the gritty world of music schools, really showcases the battle students go through to become the best they can be.You may be like me and struggle to comprehend how a film about drumming can really be that entertaining, because personally it was my main struggle with the film I have zero investment in the playing of drums (or any instrument for that matter). That being said you will you still hopefully thoroughly enjoy the film like I did, while at times the drumming can seem repetitive you are still drawn in by the majesty of the talent it takes to play that way and to have the ability to play that long without your hands falling off ha. The movie gave me a new appreciation of the dedication music students have to becoming the very best in their given field, if they are a tenth as dedicated as Andrew comes across then they will go far banging those drums maybe, heck what do I know I'm a movie blogger! This is the first I have finished a film and felt physically drained and emotionally beaten and I have seen 1,500+ films. The film beat me down so much after it I had to sleep off the after effects, it was more than just an emotional thrill ride it was incredibly relatable if you look at it as a boy trying to make his Dad proud and show him what he can do (Fletcher also being used as the Dad in this analogy). After the film ended I spent a good few hours just thinking about how near perfect this film was, I thought it was post film high, so I gave it a few days to let it sink in before writing my review. However, allowing the time to pass, didn't change my view of this film is a modern masterpiece, well not just a modern masterpiece, it is just a masterpiece itself. Easily in my top 5 of this year, will take a lot to knock it anywhere near out of that list.After just speaking about the emotional beatdown this film laid on me, I knew I had to touch on the pacing. This is one of the most wonderfully paced films I have watched in a long time, people say "emotional roller-coaster" a lot when it comes to these kinds of films. This time it is the most appropriate use of the phrasing I could think of, from the ultimate strain on you not to break like Andrew, to laughs given by director Damien Chazelle, you will be left with just an unbelievable feeling afterwards.Overall, I was completely blown away by this movie, it was countless times better than I could ever expect. Damien Chazelle has thrown his name into the big leagues with this movie, I am not usually a lover of the medium of films about musicians, this may have made me do a complete 180 and will be looking back on such films I may have missed, not that ANY could ever compare I do not imagine. From the get go the film is entertaining, filled with all turns and twists on the emotional roller coaster, this film really is with an ending that will have you tenser than you could ever believe a movie would make you feel. The ONLY reason I didn't give this film a 10 was the ending, while amazing was a bit abrupt, I would have liked to have seen a little more from it, I understand the reasoning behind it, I just personally would have liked to see Andrew get the plaudits he truly deserved. I find it a little heartbreaking I didn't get to see this masterpiece on the big screen with like minded individuals, hopefully I will get to one day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a lot reviews and comments on the musical and artistic integrity of the film that I am not qualified to comment on. I can only take it for its face value and go from there as I am not a musician or a jazz expert.This movie has a very simplistic plot and story to tell but the acting, direction and camera work was excellent and really drew me into the movie with superb undertones and mood. Plot wise it's a story about a boy with a dream and what he does to achieve that dream with possibly no understanding or is possibly being mislead into believing what is necessary to obtain that dream. Truth is probably somewhere in-between.The acting is great. The scenes between Andrew and Nicole I felt were stiff but the ones between Andrew and Fletcher more than made up for it with raw intensity and tension. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Intense Drummer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller) an aspiring drummer is enrolled at Shaffer, a high-end music conservatory, and is tutored by Terrance Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) who demands perfection and who has a tendency to push (read push too far) students he thinks can be great.I was kind of tentative about seeing this movie because all the promos had J.K. Simmons yelling and shouting crude sexual insults at his students. Did I want that to continue? No, not exactly, but decided to go ahead anyway. And hey, I have always liked J.K. Simmons and always thought he deserved better than what he got (awards wise). Also I almost bought some Farmers Insurance because of him. Okay, the real reason: I like drums. Whiplash is a musical piece and it also can be considered a physical neck whiplash as Fletcher starts and stops the music at breakneck speed. I cannot say enough about the editing in here. Wow!Miles Teller is a new comer and yes, his looks, at times, can remind us of Elvis (hey, you said the same thing about Robert Pattinson) and his acting performance is very good. All the cast were very good, but this was a contest um battle between Andrew who would probably kill himself to be a great drummer and Fletcher an wanna-be mean Drill Sergeant. Fletcher keeps saying he wants to push a student so the student can achieve greatness, but we see him as that mean drill Sergeant on a never-ending ego trip. However, both Teller and Simmons give amazingly great performances that would be hard pressed to forget. Kudos. The break-up scene between Andrew and girl friend Nicole (Melissa Benoist) was something we have rarely - if ever - witnessed. At the time it made sense to Andrew. No, not to us.We do get to hear some arguments regarding musical greatness, crossing lines and does the end justify the means. There is a twist in here and the very last scenes make this movie all the more worthwhile. They are some great really great scenes.I read that Miles Teller did perform all the drumming you see. Wow !The music was simply great even though we only got snippets for the most part due to Fletcher's starting and stopping at unbelievable speeds. But on the whole the musicians were probably some of the best we shall ever hear. Kudos. J.K. Simmons won the Best Supporting Actor Award and deservedly so. The Academy should install a new Oscar, the J.K. Simmons Oscar to those actors who we see all the time and are exceptionally good, but they never achieve any kind of elite status. Otherwise those actors will have to wait for an Oscar Worthy role as J.K. Simmons did in here and that role may never come. It's time for this new award. Just so you know this movie was nominated for Best Picture and did win Oscars for Editing and for Sound Mixing and deservedly so. (9/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Sexual insults Yes and quite crude too.Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but a bit one dimensional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally watched Whiplash. It was really really good, J. K. Simmons was an absolute terror, well deserved Oscar win and the music was great as well. However I think the film would have benefited if it was a bit longer, the story is compelling but it never dwells enough on the pain of the protagonist. 107 minutes is a tad bit less if complex emotions are to be shown, in the immortal words of J.K. Simmons, it's rushing and not quite my tempo. Almost all films this season handled the drama aspect better than Whiplash, The Theory of Everything and Foxcatcher both showed the pain and moral dilemma better albeit both being inferior movies to Whiplash. At the same time Birdman and The Imitation Game not only showed better drama but in my opinion are better films because it just felt more appealing to a person of my age compared to Whiplash which seems to aim at younger college going audience, also it's a bit one dimensional even if that one dimension is excellent. I would like to mention the climax was phenomenal, it rose a couple of notches in my books even if I have never respected or connected with overtly strict/harsh teachers in my life.</fullReview>

There ya go. That's the film. Unreal that this is getting such attention, even nominated for an Academy Award. Just goes to show how visceral elements such as cinematography and over-the-top acting can trick people into thinking something more is going on than actually is. Final Note: Practice makes the master, having an escaped lunatic screaming in your ear while practicing drums will only prolong your attempt to get into 'the zone'.</fullReview>

I do believe that his performance wasn't entirely his fault and that it was a hard role to play but you don't really notice when J.K Simmons is on screen. The story was much better than I thought it would be. when J.K Simmons was on the screen he stole the whole show and I believe that without his performance the film wouldn't have stood up with Teller's performance.

		<fullReview>Whiplash certainly lives up to its name, pumping out a high octane plot of male anger and obsession that positively pummels your senses throughout. Musically, it hits the mark generally, and if you're lucky enough to see it somewhere with a decent sound system, then the title track in particular will blow you (and roll you) away. The 2 leads are opposites and equals, sparking and bleeding off some unspoken tension and unrestrained anger.Yet that's where I felt uncomfortable watching this, as a significant number of fellow audience members laughed uproariously at the racist and homophobic bullying of Fletcher. There's a claustrophobic tension that can be physically uncomfortable in this film, yet it can be exhilarating. I accept they're probably the same people who laugh at the Kevin Bacon adverts but hey ho....As I mentioned before, its a macho movie and the one female character given any lines also has a mainly inconsequential story line and on reflection, I think this has less depth than could have been achieved with a bit more back story than a flunked family dinner and an accidental date in a bar.It was slightly weird watching something that seemed to want to wring some empathy for a bully, however talented he may have felt himself to be, or however that may or may not relate to the birth of a genius in a completely different time and place. Whether that was supposed to be the overarching point remains moot in my opinion. High octane, high impact, hinrg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music, the shots, the way the scenes were conducted, are all fueled by great performances. It all adds up to a great and potential food for thought movie, especially to those that love music.Through out the movie, I wasn't quite sure what to expect in the end. The complexity of Fletcher is fascinating, provided by the fact that we know little about his personal life. At a certain point, we get pushed to be sympathetic towards Andrew, who is striving for success and doesn't back away from his goal, even tho Fletcher is such an evasive person.The true morals and feelings from which Fletcher lives by still bug me. He's a very manipulative person and is blind from his own 'dream' of finding the 'one', not caring for those who are not, and get crushed along the way. Even tho he strives for perfection, I don't think the true passion for music was there. He is very ego oriented, something that isn't plausible in the long run, and in my opinion he will always be this kind of person, you know, this 'mean' guy Fletcher. Andrew, even tho he acts by his dream and passion, showed that he does have some issues conciliating them with this normal social life that so many swear to be the right way to live by. He's young and if he takes time to reevaluate his own mistakes that he makes along the way, he will eventually succeed (whatever one might think is succeeding in life, music should be his).I do think the movie has it's flaws.They become overshadowed by the the compelling performances, but somewhat ruined the dynamic of the movie at some point.The final scene, is an intense and eye gluing one. The twists and turns that happen are very important to the overall judgment of the movie. We see something that may not be replicated by words. It leaves a lot to wonder in the end, and one could wish to see and know more, but that's probably why it's so intriguing.Miles Teller and J.K Simmons (deserved Oscar nomination) provide great performances that should make one reflect on the morals of teaching and learning, and how one can strive to achieve greatness.</fullReview>

And JK Simmons probably has his one hand on Oscar already. Can't really question anything about this films. It's a very good entertainment. One of the few films of 2014 I've honestly enjoyed watching. It's plain, it's clever, it's entertaining. It's hard to criticize something this good. But one thing is for sure, it's not "the best". Whiplash lacks two things. Number one, a real purpose in the story. Number two, sufficient subplots. I'm not criticizing anything. I'm just saying it's not up to the same class with the greatest evers.Final Verdict: 8.5/10. This is one of those films that not many people will find boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only does Whiplash take a great look at motivation and ambition, but its is also one of the most tense films you can see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Driven by outstanding performances by both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, Whiplash tells the story of an aspiring drummer, Andrew, at the Schaefer Conservatory of Music and his conductor and mentor Terence Fletcher. The movie mainly details the relationship between Andrew and the abusive Fletcher. Andrew is willing to do almost anything to become a successful drummer, saying that he "never saw the point of friends" and he also breaks off the only meaningful relationship he has had, because it would only hold him back. His determination to succeed is encapsulated when he is a victim of a vicious car accident, but still insists on playing. His bloodied determination stems from his fear of not amounting to anything, as he says to his family he would rather die young and be remembered than live a long life and be forgotten. What this movie does best is avoid clichés. From the outset Fletcher seems like the prototypical hard teacher who just wants his students to reach their potential. He even shows his own side of vulnerability and humanity when he hears of the death of one of his students who, as we learn later, was driven to suicide by Fletcher. However, Fletcher does not push his students for their own sake, he does it for himself. He just wants to be credited for their development. In Fletcher's eyes he needs a Charlie Parker to throw a cymbal at. Above all, Whiplash is simply an enjoyable film to watch. The drill instructor-like insults that Fletcher throws out are nothing short of hilarious and the tension throughout the film, culminating in the final scene, is nothing short of brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie just because it was an Oscar nominated movie that i had to watch prior to February 22. I was so wrong. This movie was wonderful, it was thrilling, exciting and inspiring. To be blunt i did not have any expectations coming in and watching this movie. Did not know much about director Damien Chazelle, with the exception that he made the screenplay for Last Exorcism Part II. Therefore it is evident that i was not expecting much, but i needed to know what all the fuzz was about. The fuzz is real, trust me Chazelle did a fantastic job with this film.Everything is spot on, casting, directing cinematography, music, acting. First of all, Miles Teller was a huge surprise. A young actor that fitted perfectly in his role and actually made it his own. His performance was outstanding, i could actually feel the struggle that he was going through. I did not see this coming from Miles in Project X, even though he performed fairly in the Spectacular Now. Now i expect great things from this actor and he has a bright road up ahead. J.K. Simmons acting was fantastic, he outdone himself. He had me in a roller coaster of hate and understanding for his character actions and behavior. He gave his character a vast depth. Both of them did an exceptionally good display of acting and their talent mesmerized me in this beautiful movie. I recommend this to all movie goers as well as music enthusiasts to watch and enjoy this powerful film, full of emotions and struggle to achieve much more than a 'good job'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All it takes is two, Teller and Simmons lead the way in Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations going into to this movie the other day and I must say it delivered. Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman, a promising young drummer who enrolls at the Shaffer Conservatory which is one of the best music schools in the US and he wants to be the best he can be and one of the greats. Enter Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a ruthless conductor who happens to be looking for a new drum alternate. One of the great qualities of this film is the relationship between Andrew and Fletcher as it plays a bit like a two man show and how the relationship between the two changes as the film progresses as it is them two that carry the film on their back. This film is great as it also proves you don't need a well known cast to have a beautifully made film. One weakness is the lack of character development between the other band members as they're in the periphery for most of the film although the supporting roles from Paul Reiser as Andrew's father and Melissa Benoist as Andrew's girlfriend Nicole add just a little bit of sparkle. Positives for this movie are the performances of the two leads in Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, the storytelling as it takes you for a ride with the use of the music played throughout the practice scenes and the cinematography is superb. I had only previously seen Miles Teller in Divergent but boy is he a young star on the rise as he has talent to burn and I have seen J.K. Simmons in a few Coen Brothers movies and Spiderman but this is the first time in his career as a successful character actor that he completely steals the show with his tirade of insults towards his student accompanied with acerbic wit and the like and when is yelling at the class, I could feel my pulse racing as if he was also yelling at the audience which makes it play out like a thriller even though this film is technically not a thriller. Truly a great manipulative villain here in Fletcher as he made me despise him. I don't normally say this but in my opinion, Simmons is so great here that he must win the Oscar as he gives one of the best supporting performances of the last decade and anything less would feel like a tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too ill-natured and rough for a movie about jazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yelling and foul-mouthed superiors/teachers are still seen here and there, but I can hardly imagine them "flourish" in the field of "mild" arts; I myself have collaborated in several choirs and bands, my close relative worked for decades in a theater, so I know that artistic people are very thin-skinned and soft-hearted, certainly not ready to tolerate crudity for years, even by someone with contacts and talents. This sort of person we saw in Terence Fletcher is more fitting to sports or war-zone.True, the dramatics was skillfully created, there were several twists paving the way for witty, yet odd ending. The performances of two protagonists - Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman and J. K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher - were thrilling to watch particularly thanks to pace and dynamism, but sidelines and background were relatively empty, especially regarding Fletcher. After all, the viewers obtained some information about Neiman's background and life outside music.All in all, a vigorous drama with multiple strong and opposite feelings present, but it is difficult to me to envisage how (jazz) musicians would experience this movie plot-wise. And how the people far away from music or hating jazz are willing to watch this to the end at all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping performances - Whiplash is an outstanding piece of modern-day cinema....truly spectacular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is one of the most incredible films you'll see this year! The film revolves around a 19-Year-Old Jazz Drummer named Andrew Neiman who's very determined to succeed no matter what, and a somewhat harsh, manipulative and abusive conductor named Terence Fletcher. Whiplash is undeniably one of the most incredible, most original, most innovative films I have ever seen. The film was so gripping and it certainly evokes the viewer. It's very promising. The film has been released to absolute critical acclaim and I honestly can understand why. Whiplash is a modern-day masterpiece. The acting is fantastic, from J.K Simmons and Miles Teller. Their roles were certainly spot-on, and I can't think of anyone else who could have portrayed the characters more effectively and/or better. They were the perfect choices for the film. Also, the directing is somewhat brilliant from upcoming director, Damien Chazelle. That guy has a lot to come his way, too! Be sure to see Whiplash - it's without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever seen. So inspiring and interesting to watch! And it's one of the best, if not the best music-related films ever made, too! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done Finale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the movie. First of all, I would say that it is a movie about two excessive people instead of jazz which is not bad.At one side there is Andrew Neyman, a 19 year old jazz drummer who is willing to be the greatest -or maybe one of the greatest- and working all day in the small room with his drum till his hands bleeding. On the other side, there is Fletcher who is band leader of school and so of Neyman. His teaching method is unique and quite harsh. He has no doubt about yelling, insulting or even slapping in the face while leading his band which makes me think about whether is a good teaching method or not. I asked myself ''In the end, does this attitude of Fletcher end with success story of both character or not?'' Through practices, Neyman strugglin with other drummers to be core player and in this sense, he is back and forth till the end of the movie. He's working and working till his hands bleeding. In order to reach the position in the band, he can break up his girlfriend. In time, he may become kind of annoying person due to of these attitudes to his girlfriend and at dinner table with his family. The best part of the movie is the final scene which makes us understood that battle never ended and it is starting right now actually. And in the end we can see Fletcher's appreciation to his undefeated student. Well done finish! Before I watched the movie, I heard about its nominations and I was looking for watching it. It fulfills my expectations. It is absolutely must watch movie and I may argue that JK Simmons will take the Oscar for his supporting role (I did not watch other nominees except Ethan Hawke)To conclude, I want to add that in some sense Fletcher's method is quite working regardless of Tanner's career decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film. J.K. Simmons does an outstanding job as Fletcher.The story is well done and acted and is reminiscent of the story line of An Officer and a Gentleman.The question for me is whether Fletcher is a sadist, or if he is really that passionate about instilling excellence in his students. I think that the truth lies somewhere in between as he could have achieved his goals in a more humane way.The language in this film is extreme and may seem shocking and unnecessary to some audiences, but it is necessary to convey the realism of the characters. I don't know if life in world class music schools is this intense, but I am certain that teachers like Fletcher do exist.See it, but don't take the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Greatness Achievable Without Adversity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That J.K Simmons is a versatile character actor is a given. Simmons, as a kind of "second banana" comedic foil has elevated just about everything he has been used in this guise for. But, Simmons is also an exceptional dramatic actor too when given the right part. Whiplash gives Simmons the part that should remove any doubt about him being able to bring a character you love to hate to a kind of artistic visceral reality. Simply put, Whiplash couldn't rise to the rare air the story aspires for without such a performance.No man is an island and though, the screenplay and the direction by Damien Chazelle is succinct in totally building a great story without anything superfluous. This is a movie with a powerful statement about humanity never veering into the maudlin. The seriousness of this straightforwardly told story is brilliant and never fails to entertain. It's anything but boring no matter if you give a whit about jazz music which is really not central at all. It's about the intersection of beliefs, self-doubt, and will to overcome whatever may come finding something held deep and dear. Collateral damage is often painful, raising questions of social morality which is to say; it's complicated just like the real life it portrays.Whiplash poses a big question: are some of history's greatest men and women destined to be all they become or are they ripe for something that pushes, changes, them to achieve it? If one is a student of history it seems it is very much the combination of certain events placed before a person, inherent brilliance not withstanding, that molds the final result. Along the way, many times, the great person must reclaim their humanity as the price they've paid may have stripped them of so much. Only by finally espousing internal peace can the person have the combination of immortal-like greatness and a well lived life. Even fewer achieve this than greatness itself. Whiplash intrigues the viewer, while being extremely entertaining and moving, to ponder this. Saving this for last, newcomer Miles Teller is not only utterly fantastic in his role of Andrew Neiman, the protagonist, but is one hell of drummer, apparently, too. He nails the role all around. A great movie, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, chilling, and intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about Music, you dive right in, no character introduction or setting of any kind, just Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) and his set of drums. Music is the lead, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are just supporting, at least that's how I saw the film. You get to know who Andrew &amp; Terrence Fletcher (Simmons) are along the way, but Music is front and center stage. Of course, the actors are important because their characters give life to the music. The drums are once again a noble instrument in the film. Having the camera focused on the drummer's perspective is what gives intensity. Drumming looks, how it should, difficult to master. It requires motivation, dedication, and passion. Andrew Neiman (Teller) works really hard to try to achieve greatness. The investment, the sweat and pain needed for this instrument is tangible. Andrew lives and breathes drumming, it's in is blood.Damien Chazelle achieved greatness, delivering a powerful movie, in which the drums and music transpire. He got the best out of his actors and not only showed but made us feel &#xfeff;Whiplash. &#xfeff;The film depicts this complex, thrilling and emotional S&amp;M relationship between mentor and student. It shows how far it can go when sacrifices are made and limits are not set.The cast is beyond brilliant, the eager Miles Teller and the impressive J.K. Simmons impersonate to perfection the student and his teacher. Whiplash is raw, intense and beautiful. I got chills, I got uncomfortable, angry, and pleased. If I hadn't already I would understand passion, determination and dedication look like watching this film.&#xfeff;Whiplash is a must see.@wornoutspines</fullReview>

Exactly what Whiplash is. The story is engaging and inspiring, the direction is superb and the actors are over the edge with their acting! In my opinion, a "great movie" needs -except other things- to motivate you. To inspire you. To be better in your life, in your dreams, in anything has to do with your world. To think more spherical.

		<shortDescription>Magnetic, radical and profound.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film about music. It is a film about pure ambition, hard work, perseverance and raw determination. It is magnetic, radical and profound. And thousands of people are delirious about it. I don't blame them. Let's start from scratch. This is the story of Andrew, a 19-year-old ambitious drummer attending one of the most prestigious music schools in the country. He is talented and smart and he knows it. But Andrew has no idea how to socialize. He spends his free time practicing with his drums or watching films with his dad. His only worry is to become the greatest of the greatest. Fletcher is the most infamous teacher of the school, tough and constantly angry, he coordinates a band where only the best enter. Everyone is scared to death for him, he pushes students physically and mentally to the edge, he is fearless but most of all he is necessary for anyone who dreams a career in music. He is the connection, the one who can make it happen. Andrew knows about Fletcher and knows that endless possibilities unfold when it comes to his band. He would do anything in order to enter. And he does. But the pressure is too much. Fletcher follows humiliating practices towards anyone who either disobeys him or makes one mistake during practice. His methods can be described as at least barbaric. But somehow this works. Especially with the band. They keep on participating in big contests and working as hard as ever. Maybe it is the fear of the students that keeps them going without complaining or probably the fact that he pushes a person till he gets the best out of him. Either way they are aware of his power on them. One word and their possible career is over. They only obey. And the worst? He knows it more than anyone. And he abuses this power. Andrew creates a unique relationship with Fletcher. He is submissive to his remarks and abuse but soon he will start resisting. He will stop obeying. Till the guy finally notices him. Till Fletcher finally recognizes his worth. This seemingly endless kind of game has its ups and downs. When you think it is going good between them, something happens and f***s up your brain and everything turns to the raw fragility of the beginning."Whiplash" opens a constant and very intense conversation about surpassing any kind of obstacles or difficulties but mostly yourself and your limits in order to accomplish your goals. It is full with competitive attitude, the one necessary for achieving. It is testing your limits like Fletcher is testing his students'. Even though it is Damien Chazelle's debut, he has already shown a craft and ambition that I personally salute. The rigorous rhythm of the film focuses on Andrew and Fletcher's relationship, cutting out all the others, revealing through tight close-ups extraordinary performances by both of his leading actors. J.K. Simmons has just won the Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his supreme performance and along with Miles Teller they are marching towards this year's Oscars. Andrew and Fletcher's relationship is purely poisonous and stimulating at the same time. Andrew is craving for Fletcher's recognition, he wants to be the next great jazz drummer and this is his greatest motivation; he desperately needs Fletcher's acceptance. Fletcher sees Andrew's potential and helps him, but with his perverted methods he only play games with him, aiming exclusively to push him harder to the very edge, to his own best. Through constant drumming, a tempo fury and unexpected events rising up to a pure catharsis, "Whiplash" does make the difference. It winks violently at you proving how a big dream is never big enough and no matter the mistakes and disappointments, the delays and drawbacks, if you share this flaming perseverance and determination anything - ANYTHING - is possible. Thank you, Damien Chazelle, for reminding us that. http://mycinematographies.blogspot.nl/2015/01/whiplash-2014.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute realization of someone's real potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, the best 2014 movie I've seen. At first, the movie looks like a typical story of an inspired student who wanted to do great with the help of his teacher. But as it progresses, the film takes you to something new, something more beautiful than it already is. Its little twist and turn will make your heart cry, laugh and shout for joy all at the same time.Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons were equally great and gave life to their characters. I only remember Simmons as a funny guy in Spider-Man movies and Juno, so seeing him in this film is a 360-degrees turn of his usual role showing the actor's real potential. As for Teller, he was over- shadowed with romantic comedies. He had serious role once with Nicole Kidman in "Rabbit Hole" but this film should get him to wide-range of roles in the future (hopefully). There are a lot of takeaways in Whiplash but perhaps, the strongest of all is that you don't limit yourself. Pushing someone beyond their capability is an absolute necessity, as Fletcher(Simmons' character) said in the film. And that must have what writer- director applied in making this film as it transpired to every take, scene by scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One flaw: overly dramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this one, but they were not fully met. Aside from the great acting, I found the movie overly dramatic. I completely understand the general idea of drama and intensity that drives this movie, and I find it true and applicable to various aspects of life. I also agree with the concept of being ultra- demanding with students if the goal is to form a master musician, one who "would never be discouraged". But still, saying this movie is "overly dramatic" would be an understatement. It's dramatic to a point that it's often annoying and occasionally beyond what is believable. The teacher himself was great but went too many times over the top. The director should have managed better these "peaks": with less over-the-top-peaks the movie would have had a smoother, more believable narration, and those very peaks would have had even more impact.I also don't like the idea of "success" continuously pictured here: it's like having success in life is only about how famous and established in your work you are. What a load of effin bullshit. I still give this film a very good rating of 7,5/10 because of acting and some cinematography, good twists towards the ending, and for the core of the story too. AND the great final drum solo. But I was hoping for more. Or maybe it's correct to say I was hoping for less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first movie review ever :) Whiplash is one of the best inspiring movies ever made. With Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons's amazing performance, the unique cinematography and sound editing and mixing, Damien Chazelle's astonishing directing and breathtaking script. Whiplash took three Oscars smoothly, and it is for sure the best movie of the year.We all once had a dream of becoming something, only a few of us achieved that goal of ours. Most of the people didn't try hard enough or just simply gave up. Andrew, the protagonist in the movie had a dream of becoming a drummer that will be remembered forever.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a 19-year old college student who studies music in New York. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a professor with a brutal teaching style that drives every student insane. He pushed Andrew to his limits, so Andrew could unlock his full potential.Greatness comes with great sacrifice. Andrew gave up his normal life just to achieve his goal. He gave up the relationship with his girlfriend and his family. He practiced until his hands bleed, but he didn't stop, he just kept practicing. Under the heavy pressure and intense humiliation from professor Fletcher, he snapped, and stopped playing drums. Months later, he returned to the stage, but again humiliated by his formal professor. With anger, he performed the best drumming of the decade, and reached his goals.Success doesn't come easily. All people see is the fruit, they don't see the effort and hard work behind the achievement. The cost of success is blood and sweat.This movie is great for any kinds of viewers, whether you are a cinema lover or a confused teenager, everyone should enjoy this movie. One of the best movie I have seen in a while, met all my expectations 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe I am slightly biased, being a fan of this style of music, but my God was it well executed. JK Simmons gave quite possibly the most intense performance of the year, and in almost all of his scenes I was watching him, not as an actor, but as his character. He was utterly convincing and in many ways stole the show away from Miles Teller, not to say Teller was bad at all, but that Simmons was just better.However, there are a few scenes in the film that make it drag substantially, compared to other very well made scenes. One scene in particular (spoilers ahead) where Teller and his family have a dinner together felt slightly cliché. I won't spoil too much in the hopes that you'll see why yourself; but the film lagged a tad here.Other than that, no complaints. The sound mixing was phenomenal, the acting was great, the pacing was good. Overall, it was an outstanding film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie depicted how the musical process is usually made, I am a musician myself and I have a band director who acts quite similar to the director in this movie (minus the chair throwing and the constant flow of curse words) but this movie brings good memories to me and I am sure it brings good memories with other musicians as well. The cast was stellar! the plot was amazing! and the music was just wonderful! To me The movie was so relatable and easier to connect with the character because I knew what he was going through in his times of trials. A good example is when Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) keeps nagging and pestering Andrew (Miles Teller) about how his tempo is "rushing" and then when Andrew tries to fix it, he is then "dragging" the tempo, then it just goes back and forth until Fletcher hurls a chair at Andrew's head. Now, my director never went as far as to throw a chair at a drummers head for rushing then dragging, but we have come to the problem and it can be frustrating! This movie really does justice to what the expectation to being a musician is like for most and I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whiplash" is no more nor less than a movie worthy of at least one Oscar award. If not for best Sound Mixing, than at least (and especially this one) for best actor in a supporting role. I rate the movie as a "8 out of 10", and no, it's not because of its argument, that is not (AT ALL) original, or even the great role Miles Teller plays. It's definitely because of the great, the one and only, J.K. Simmons. The whole point of the movie, and the reason why it is getting such good ratings, is the adrenaline that it makes the audience feel. The viewers feel what the main character feels, and are excited about his musical journey with his teacher, and that only happens, due to the role of Simmons. He makes us fear him, and that is a great thing in a movie like this. After seeing this masterpiece I looked for information on this actor, and it surprised me a lot, seeing that the "monster" he has shown to us in "Whiplash", is in fact a very nice and interesting person. Congratulations to the production, and to all the present actors, but the merit this movie deserves is due to him. It is also to mention the great sound mixing and absolutely outstanding role played by Teller. The only weak aspect is the ending. Although it left me thinking a while about what his future could look like, it's a but empty, and a movie like this deserves an ending that people would remember for a long time, which wasn't totally managed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is worth watching for the jazz music alone - pity about the drum solos!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I reviewed "Birdman" recently, I said that I am not a fan of drums solos. I have nothing against drums or drummers, and I understand that they are an integral, essential element of any popular band or group, but solos that last for more than about 10 seconds drive me ? and many others ? to distraction. Sorry, but I fail to see anything in a drum solo which can be considered musically stimulating, or inspirational, and the only thing I like about them is when I realise, with relief, that they are about to end?.Sure, I understand very well that the likes of Buddy Rich, Ginger Baker and Keith Moon were talented geniuses and as long as they stuck to providing the background rhythm for the music, and playing together with the rest of the musicians, I enjoyed their drumming as much as the next man.But long drum solos are a load of old codswallop as far as I'm concerned.In one of my many former incarnations, I used to be a pop concert promoter and I still recall that just about every 'name' pop group when performing a live concert, would include a long drum solo in its set. It was only included so that the rest of the musos could go off stage to have a break, down a quick beer, drag on a joint or sniff a line of coke. The solo would last as long as it took for all these guys to return to their positions on stage, and it had little to do with musical prowess. It was just a time- filler. Later in the set, there would be the obligatory acoustic guitar/vocal duet to allow the drummer to disappear and partake of his own, personal adrenaline boosts.So Whiplash, which is about a budding drummer being knocked into shape (in more ways than one) by a teacher in a prestigious music school, was never going to be that well received by this reviewer.I'm probably going to invite open warfare by stating that in many respects, Whiplash is simply a superior remake of the cheesy 'Fame' movie franchise; albeit with a lot more gritty violence, some outstanding acting and some great jazz music.Indeed, in spite of the darkness of the plot, there were still some sentimental, cheesy moments, especially when the teacher went off the rails when one of his former students committed suicide. To me it was a bit corny - seen it all before - nothing like the off-screen death of somebody not in the movie to evoke a few tears and sympathy.As for the student walking away unscathed from a terrible car crash that would have killed most and ? covered in blood ? makes it to his drum stool, just in time to perform, only to find he forgot his drumsticks. Such machinations belong more in a cliff-hanger novel by Dan Brown than in an Oscar contender for best movie.But having said all that, I have to fess up and say that it was a pretty good movie and I quite enjoyed it ? only glancing at my mobile phone a couple of times, when those bloody drum solos went on too long.It is the story of a young drummer-prodigy who is put through his paces at a respected music academy by a sadistic music teacher, who thinks nothing of slapping his student hard across his face or throwing things at him if his drumming tempo is too slow or too fast ? neither of which is discernible by the naked ear.The underlying message, or question, is just how far anyone should go in the pursuit of greatness or perfection. We are regaled more than once with the story about the saxophone genius, Charlie Parker, who at the age of 16, was brought down to earth with a crash as he lost his way while improvising "I Got Rhythm". The drummer, Jo Jones, lobbed a cymbal at him in frustration, and the audience laughed and jeered. Parker stalked out of the venue and after a year of intensive practice, he returned and performed ? as a character in Whiplash puts it ? "the best f?in' solo anyone in the room ever heard."Whiplash is the story about what happens when a teaching mentor and his student prodigy are determined to go to any lengths, no matter how painful, to achieve success.(Sounds familiar? Fame, anyone?)You can guess what happens in the end, but along the way, there is some truly great acting by JK Simmons as the teacher, (what a voice ! Where's he been all my life?), and the student, Miles Teller.Whiplash is worth watching for the jazz music alone, but it might have been even better if it was about a saxophonist or a trumpet player or maybe a clarinetist ? and not about a bloody drummer and his bloody drum solos?</fullReview>

The acting by the two were great but J.K. Simmons stole the whole show for me. He was so intense in the film that there were times that I was terrified of him. Miles Teller did great job portraying a young man who was trying to be one of the best drummer and at the same time try to impress his instructor. The strongest point of this film was the adversarial relationship between the two. The ending was also fantastic. The only issue I had was Melissa Benoist acting, it was pretty meh to be honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it worth it? In my opinion, this is the major question of Whiplash. How much would you sacrifice to achieve your goals? How much are you willing to pay for success? How far would you go? These questions are the reasons why Whiplash is more like a sport movie. A guy wants to be the best at something, in the beginning he fails a lot, but in the end he achieves his goals and everybody leaves the theater with a smile on the face. A well-know sample, but NOT this time!The real brilliance of Whiplash roots from being relentlessly honest. In the end Andrew gets the acknowledgment what he so desperately wanted, and Fletcher finally finds his Charlie Parker, but both of them got damaged on the path to glory and the aftermath of their actions will be demanded later. As the credits start to roll, the viewer feels that despite his talent and dedication Andrew will end up like Fletcher's previous student. It's not like a typical happy ending and the final shot foreshadows tragedy. It's such a refreshment to see honesty and objectivity.Drumming sequences are intense, powerful and masterfully assembled. Every shot, every second, every hit on those drums makes your heart beat faster and takes you to a level where you've never been before. The final scene - where everything culminated - earned it's place in cinematic history and showed that even a ridiculously low budget film is capable of creating breathtaking scenes.Performances of the two major characters were outstanding. J.K. Simmons got the recognition what he rightfully deserved (in form of an Oscar) and Miles Teller easily caught up with his movie partner. The chemistry between them was well-written and flawlessly presented.I've had only one minor problem with Whiplash: the length of the movie didn't grant enough time for it's characters to completely unfold. It should have spared more time on it's character's development. Yes, we see the motivations on each side, but a little more depth - to understand their actions - would have been great.It can't be denied, that Whiplash is a very unique film that genuinely presents how much does it cost to be the best at something. The path of success is made of blood, sweat, tears and self-destruction, so Damien Chazelle leaves the decision to the audience: "70 Years As A Lamb Or 30 Years As A Lion?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong feeling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those that inspire and leaves memorable many amassing quotes. I think that Whiplash is an example of how a movie should be, with low budget and strong feelings. J.K. Simmons did a excellent performance and finally shows to all what he is capable of. Good job by all cast and crew. I don't know what to say about this movie, Whiplash really leave me wordless. This kind of movies are very difficult to do, because it's "melt" with art and when the movie melts with art the product is not something good, this is my opinion but Whiplash make an exception, I really enjoyed the music on this movie. To finish my review, I think this is the best movie of 2014 one of the best of all times so if you haven't see it go watch it I highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Whiplash.The best part of this movie, by far, is the acting. Miles Teller had a major breakthrough performance. Melissa Benoist had a decent performance in the few minutes of screen time. JK Simmons had one of the best performances of the 21st century with his role. He definitely deserved the 47-51 awards that he won for this movie.Damien Chazelle did a wonderful job writing and directing the film. He wrote many clever insults for Simmons' character. His direction was wonderful, especially since this was only the second movie that he has directed.I am not going to spoil anything (or else I would get blacklisted), but the ending of this movie was one of the most intense endings to any movie I have seen. When the movie ended, I was wanting more.This is one of my favorite movies. It is an amazing film that deserved to make way more money than just under $14 million.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Whiplash' is A Whip-Smart Entertainer that Doesn't Miss A Beat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Whiplash, JK Simmons plays Terence Fletcher - the tyrannical conductor of a prestigious music conservatory who believes in pushing them to breaking point and beyond in his own insatiable quest to unearth the new Charlie Parker. But while imposing impossible standards on everyone, it is talented drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) who finds himself singled out for the maestro's ferocious attention. So when Fletcher tells the promising percussionist to "have fun", you know he means the opposite. Unless your idea of fun is being bullied, humiliated, and played off against your hapless band-mates. But Andrew is determined to shed all the blood, sweat and tears it takes to become the band's lynch-pin. What follows is a sadomasochistic battle of wills between teacher and pupil, as Fletcher terrorizes, torments and humiliates the young recruit, pushing him ever harder to see whether he snaps to the rhythm, or breaks in two. The ensuing film is a tour-de-force that defies easy stereotyping. Shot in 19 days on a shoe-string budget, Whiplash moves at a whip-crack pace that takes its rhythmic cues from drumming. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle and partly inspired by his own experiences as a jazz drummer in high school, the film offers dark, rip-snorting fun that inspires a whirlwind of emotions before leaving you on an exhilarated high. His script is adept at dropping explosive one-liners but it is also fiercely intelligent in the way that it poses questions while also serving up characters who are worth hanging out with. His direction, meanwhile, is pretty much pace- perfect in the way that it hits all the right beats yet is savvy enough and confident enough to toss in some curve-balls. The kinetic editing cuts with finger-snapping dexterity making the film pop with a rim-shot twang and adding a visual flourish.At its racing heart beats a performance of splenetic majesty from JK Simmons as the fearsome Fletcher, a despot in F-major who conducts the music school like it's the Marine Corps, only with harsher language. He is a sinewy symphony of physicality, his poised fingers waving the drama onward apace, his endlessly expressive eyes alert and ablaze, and his razor-sharp mouth playing the paper-cut dialogue like a demonic fiddle. Teller is terrific too as the young gun bleeding for his art, wholly convincing as the raw talent in whom even the most poisonous taskmaster can hear the distant drums of greatness.Damien Chazelles' greatest achievement lies in the fact that even when the drama descends into parodist para-diddles and melodramatic car-crashes, there's a splashy, impressionist energy which keeps us locked into its insistent rhythm. Come the last beat, you'll probably be exhausted. But you'll also feel entertained, inspired and wonderfully alive. For all its overripe contrivance, you'll leave the cinema with a spring in your step and a thump in your chest. The ovation starts here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, Overpraised, and Over the Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every one seems to like this film. It has received so many awards, earned 3 Oscars, and large amounts of near perfect reviews and praise from critics and moviegoers alike. While I agree that the film, without a doubt, has good performances and cinematography, I can't say that I enjoyed it overall. The film is about a young inspiring drummer named Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) who enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a brutal jazz conductor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential. The synopsis alone is a red flag. The plot is unbelievable. If it took place in the military or high school football, it would be more believable. Unoriginal, but believable. The messages throughout Whiplash are bipolar, and very manipulative. We, the audience, are expected to believe that physical and emotional abuse at the hands of a tyrannical authority figure (in this case, Fletcher) are justified as long as it creates great music, somehow. Andrew doesn't love music, he is obsessive. His ultimate goal is to become "one of the greats" even if it costs him his happiness, family, and humanity in the process. He becomes an empty shell, dependent only on approval, no thanks to Fletcher who constantly abuses him over the course of the film. He goes through his band conductor's obedience training from hell, enduring a series of chair throwing, homophobic and ethnic slurs, and competing against other students. During this whole ordeal, Andrew slowly transforms into a broken human being who later cut ties with his family and girlfriend to pursue his self-destructive path to greatness. He doesn't learn anything new or useful, he just practices until his hands bleed--which no drummer in existence would ever do this to themselves, no matter how mad they are. There is a moment in the film where Fletcher tells a story about Charlie Parker and how he got a cymbal thrown at his head because he screwed up a performance. Of course, this story isn't true, but the film tries to make you, the ignorant viewer, believe it is. Anyway, Fletcher uses this fictional story to justify his sadistic, over-the-top methods that he inflicts on students, especially on Andrew. He operates the band like a hard-ass drill sergeant more than a band conductor. He is not there to inspire and teach, but to put fear into the hearts of young students in hopes of molding them into better sold...uh, I mean, musicians. This character is by no means forgivable, rather a repugnant and unpleasant caricature that dishes out violent abuse. While the film tries--oh dear lord, does it try--to portray Fletcher in a sympathetic light when he mourns for the loss of his former student in one scene, I couldn't help but shake my head and say, "Really? Am I supposed to feel sorry for this bastard?!" That scene felt manipulative and forced, leaving me insulted when I saw it.Whiplash is clearly made for people who have no interest in music, particularly jazz, and it shows. The film sacrifices realism and the love of music for the sake of melodrama, which is a darn shame because I went in with high expectations and this film did not deliver. Instead, I got a bleak and downright disturbing Hollywood film that is overrated, overpraised, and over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent reflection of conservatory extreme anxiety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a conservatory-trained violinist, and having played for more than 20 years, I can say that this movie, apart from being great in other aspects such as directing, acting and photography, perfectly reflects the extreme anxiety that a musical student can experience. Of course not all the cases are like that, and this is kind of a parody, but it is closer to reality than one could (unfortunately) believe: how teachers project their frustration and complexes on their students, under the excuse of "getting the best out of them". Other than that, both main characters' performance is outstanding, as well as the script. One can follow the uprising tension alongside the film, until it is almost unbearable. Your toes and fingers will be twitched until the very last scene. Also, if you are a fan of jazz, it is a wonder to watch and listen to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw the poster of whiplash and realized that it was a movie about music, i expected it to be just sufficiently good to fill a music lover's heart for the day. However, as many can agree, it was a big understatement. Right from the first drum beat, this film has you hooked and emotional right till the end. Even if you try not to enjoy it, you will be met with failure as you immerse yourself in the sheer brilliance of the simple plot. I applauded for the movie once it was over and 3 Oscars tell the same story- this movie is amazing. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons define real acting in this movie and make this an epic experience. It might come out as too aggressive to some but for me aggression was an important plot in this movie. I have rated this movie a perfect score and undeniably love it.

When the movie finished I didn't say anything I just got up and drank a glass of water and called all my friends and family to ask them to watch it so i can talk to them about it. Whiplash completes all our expectations of an amazing movie that is not only good, but also memorable and in a crazy way amazingly good.

		<shortDescription>One of the best acted movies I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a drama film starring Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. It was fantastic. Along with Birdman, I'd say it's one of the best acted movies I've ever seen.Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a young man who aspires to be one of the greatest drummers of all time. Being the only musically inclined member of his family, Andrew feels he has a lot to prove to both himself and the rest of the world. After enrolling at one of the most difficult music conservatories in the country, Andrew ends up being mentored by the harsh, abusive, yet well respected Terrance Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who is determined to make sure that his students will stop at nothing to reach their potential. Over time, Fletcher's unorthodox teaching methods start to take their toll on both Andrew's physical and mental health but he realises that it may actually be benefitting him.The film was so well acted it almost felt like I was watching a documentary. J.K. Simmons gives a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance as Terrance Fletcher and Miles Teller was great as well. I don't usually care much for Jazz music but after seeing this movie, I have a new found respect for both the genre and its musicians. You can really see the blood, sweat and tears (literally!) that goes into some Jazz performances on stage.I rate it a solid 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens up with a student Andrew Neiman of shaffer conservatory (a music school) drumming and suddenly conductor Terence Fletcher appears and takes a good look at him.The kid has high regard for Mr,Fletcher and in all his abilities wants to win his validation as a drummer.This strive for his validation is the dark undertone in this movie.The trials and tribulations that Neiman undergoes due to Fletcher's hard training standards and ruthless scolding is what you will get to see.Also the wicked play by Fletcher to bring out the best in his student is heart wrenching but yet beautiful at the end.Fletcher played excellently by Mr.J K Simmons is a character who is very passionate about his art and leaves no stone unturned to bring out the best in a student,even if it required to mentally harass the student.One has to earn his part to remain in his band. Neiman finally gets a chance to play in the practice session in the band only then to be whipped verbally about not playing to Fletcher's tempo.Fletcher is stern to the core and does so because he thinks the students will get complacent and would not push themselves to the extreme."There are no two words in the English language than good job",says Fletcher which is the quote of the movie.Neiman played by Miles Teller is spot on.The anguish and the drive of the character was best portrayed by Teller,The scenes with Nicole (played by Melissa Benoist) were very realistic.All in all the movie was a treat to watch and someone who loves music or plays an instrument would love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!!! That is the first thing that came to my mind when I finished watching this film. A great film is one which still leaves you thinking about it after it is over, and that is exactly what this film did for me. The film is about a student (Miles Teller) in a musical boarding school who gets a chance to play in the school's best conductor's (J.K. Simmons) band. The problem though lies with the instructor as he is very abusive towards his students. How the student plays in the band is what forms the plot of the film. Miles Teller is great as Andrew, the student who gets a chance to play in the band. He showcases in this movie why he is one actor we should pay attention to in the future as he has the potential to be one of the best actors of his time. The director Chazelle has done a fantastic job in keeping the audience glued to their seats and keeps us guessing what the next move by one of the character's will be. But at the end of the day, the film belongs to one person and one person only: J.K. Simmons. Simmons plays Terrence Fletcher, the abusive music conductor in the band. His intense performance leaves you in awe just by the intensity of his character. It is no surprise he got the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It almost seemed he was destined to play this role. In the end of the day, Whiplash is an excellent movie and one in which no one should ignore. Watch it for the story as well as the performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Whiplash' is the BEST film of 2014.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big sacrifices and the desire to be the best in the world with your skill and art form is both questioned and put to the test in writer/director Damien Chazelle's phenomenal jazz-infused film 'Whiplash'. This movie is focused on jazz music, but closes in on what one individual will go through to be the best in the world with the difficult question being, "Is it worth it?"This is Chazelle's second film, and if his sophomore effort tells you anything, it says that he is destined to be one of the greats. The background of 'Whiplash' is quite impressive. Chazelle entered it in as a short film at Sundance in 2013 where it won the Best Short Jury Prize. A year later, we have a a feature length film, which is bold, refreshing, and flawless. If you've ever been a part of a school band, theatre troop, choir coral, or debate team, I'm sure you've had a teacher whose style was to bully or engineer their student's lives in a negative manner to get their talent the best it can be, as well as to separate the winners from the quitters.It will surely bring up memories, good or bad while watching this film as the Shaffer Conservatory of Music University's (ranked No. 1 in the U.S.) top music professor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) more than just instructs his students to play some of the best jazz compositions around for competition. In fact, Simmons pulls the soul out of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) from Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' to mess and manipulate his students to give him perfect performances.Andrew Nyman (Miles Teller), a 19 year old freshman is a very devoted drummer who is on scholarship at Shaffer in hopes of making a career in music. Instead of posters of naked women or John Belushi on his college dorm room walls, he has posters of Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker, giving you the idea that Nyman is indeed serious and passionate about his studies. You can add to this a very traumatic experience for him that happened a year ago that urged him to spend every waking minute practicing, which leaves him not only inclined, but even enthusiastic to endure whatever Fletcher throws his way, figuratively and literally.Fletcher's jazz ensemble of students are very talented, however are tossed in and out at Fletcher's chaotic demeanor no matter how light the mistake. Fletcher always demands the impossible on every minute detail and is not afraid to use very course language to intimidate his students to get them to play something to his liking. Nyman must sacrifice having a genuine relationship with a new girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) and spending time with his father (Paul Reiser) in order to appease Fletcher. As Fletcher pushes, terrorizes, and pressures Nyman to get a good performance, Nyman's emotions come to the front, crying, punching walls, and even destroying his drum kit to the point where his hands bleed profusely. But again, the central message of this story is what are you willing to sacrifice and go through to be the best at your skill and art form.This is not a puff piece about jazz music or attaining your dream, but rather a raw and intimate look of how truly heartbreaking and tormenting it can be to play music at the most prestigious school in the nation. Chazelle has perfectly orchestrated a flawless flow with a superb payoff as we climb that treacherous ladder to attain that beautiful view. His editing skills are top notch here with cuts set to the sweet jazz soundtrack that should earn this film an Oscar nomination not only for acting, directing, and writing, but also for editing.Miles Teller is is brilliant and raw in this role, and continues to amaze and entertain throughout every performance he gives. And Simmons plays this part very two- faced, in the fact that he can downright scare the innards out of you and make you run the other way, while on the other hand, make you fall in love with his brilliance in a flash. These are two performances that won't be soon forgotten. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard this year, making 'Whiplash' in my Top 3 films this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could have never thought that a movie about music can be so breath taking and thrilling, throughout the movie i just felt intense, there wasn't a point where it lost its intensity. A fantastic journey of a young and extremely determined drummer who goes through trial and error with his obsessive mentor. The way Fletcher taught his students maybe seems a bit too harsh etc., but that is the journey of being truly the best and the greatest in something, you need to completely devote your life to it. Andrew completely devoted his life to being the best drummer he could be and despite Fletcher treating him like a complete thrash, he went back to being in Fletcher's band and eventually showing him how great he really is.I love how this movie solely focuses on Fletcher and Andrew, it is all about Andrew being the best drummer possible. The viewers do not get distracted with other people's stories and problems. An excellent part of the movie was Andrew's decision to break up with his newly acquired girlfriend Nicole, just to pursue his drumming carrier, many people, especially, feminists are probably going to dislike this, but it was there just for the purpose of showing that you have to sacrifice a lot to get to the highest point, in my opinion, it fitted really well into the movie. For a second, when Andrew started to have interest in this girl, i was worried that the great plot would get over-taken by a laughable and dull relationship, which you can see in every other movie out there. Thank god none of that happened and they didn't spend a lot of the screen time on that.Definitely an awesome watch! I recommend it to everybody, even those like myself who think movies about music are boring, i was wrong in this case for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most inspiring, moving, and tension filled movies I've ever seen.It's about a boy whose training in college to be a drummer. His instructor Terrence Fletcher is really hard on him and his constant insults drive him to borderline insanity.Seeing Terrence Fletcher yell at Andrew Neyman and watching him get increasingly more upset calls for a very entertaining plot point. I think that it's so important to the film and shapes it a lot. I make the argument that Terrence Fletcher and Andrew Neyman's on screen battles did for us what Randle McMurphy and Nurse Ratched did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.At first people dislike Fletcher but near the end, we get to find out why he teaches the way he does and it makes a lot of sense. The scene when we find out his motivations is really moving and it makes some great character development.The ending is fantastic. It is very tense and shocking. It contains one of the best drum performances I've ever seen put to screen. It is breathtaking from start to finish. It does an excellent job concluding everything we've seen and experienced in the movie and it does a perfect job wrapping it all together.This movie is a masterpiece. It is also one of the best movies I've seen. It contains original and thought provoking themes and it displays them in an excellent way. Everything about this movie is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. K. Simmons has played a number of stern, demanding characters during his career. But he gets the role of a lifetime in Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash". He plays the brutal instructor of a college jazz band. This man resorts to methods that lapse into abuse. In showing these overly aggressive teaching methods, the movie poses the question of what is the right thing to do when encouraging students to succeed. Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone, but when teaching college students how to play jazz? Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance. Although it was for Best Supporting Actor, the movie belongs to him. Miles Teller's performance as the student is truly secondary to Simmons. His character is one of only a few movie characters in history who made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer of Whiplash and all the praising reviews it was getting, I knew we were onto something really good and something different. I'm even more so excited when it's an awards season movie that was written, directed and based on a short film of the same name and concept by a fresh young director (Damien Chazelle, 29 yrs old when he was directing it), one of the youngest best picture nominee director for a matter of fact, which shows that he's a keeper with loads of potential and that this movie is very personal to him so he won't let the Producer's Hollywood edit process cliché ruin his vision.What makes Whiplash stand out as such a breath of fresh air is that it could've been one of those 'loosely based on a crazy true story of week' Oscar bait movie with the protagonist, antagonist, rise, fall and rise with the Hollywood moral driven happy ending, but there was no true protagonist, antagonist and happy or sad ending, it was all contextual to the viewer's opinion but that's not what mattered to me in Whiplash, it was all about: will Andrew (Miles Teller) perform one of the greatest percussion performance of all time and be the next great Buddy Rich no matter how much sweat, tears and blood he must shed but that was the whole visual pleasure of this movie: to see how far and how much pain a person will go through to achieve what he wants.The beginning of the movie does set up Andrew as the good guy who just want to achieve his dream and Fletcher (J.K. Simons) as the bad guy who is nothing more than a rude and sadistic music teacher who lashes out on his students probably out of bitterness for ending as a music teacher instead of the greatest Jazz maestro in the world, but you later on loose sympathy for Andrew as you realize that his pursue for his dream turns him into an anti-social and a snob who will cut off a bond for a girl who cares for him and likes him in exchange for his masochistic journey to be the greatest drummer in the world. And that's where you realize Fletcher isn't a sadist just to be a sadist; he's a harsh teacher who believes and is still searching for the greatest drummer in the world which you know he sees in Andrew. Fletcher knows Andrew is ready to give everything up and take everything in and he will push him to the limit which achieves in a way the happiest movie ending as both of these painful and tragic individuals have achieved their ultimate goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is a powerful film that tests the boundaries of how to treat adolescents. Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is an instructor of the at a conservatory and is notorious for being one of the most hated teachers. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a student who aims to be one of the best jazz drummers and to one day play at Carnegie Hall.Fletcher takes the complete opposite view of Robin Williams character in Good Will Hunting and pushes his students well past the breaking point. Andrew is determined to prove himself and tests himself again and again past the breaking point as the film goes on. Director and Writer Damien Chazelle made a short film by the same name and was given the backing to make it in to this feature length film. It is a good thing too, because from the script to the editing this is a film that gets it right. And the music is absolutely superb.I say "good job" in spite of Fletcher's position on this term to everyone involved in this production. This is a film to remember and definitely one not to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash (2014)Wow, the best of this is intense and disturbing and invigorating. It's about never never never cutting corners. It's about pushing and being your best until you break, and then keeping going. Who can't get revved up about that?The scene is a mythical music school, something like Julliard and Berkeley combined? intense and serious, with an element of jazz built in. And the competition, expected as it is, pushed students beyond their comfort zone to absurd and inspiring degrees. The scenes where the music leader (teacher and bandleader played by J.K. Simmons) goes apeshit over the bumbling of his students are quite shocking. I'm an art teacher, and I tried it out one day, even warning the student I was going to do it and showing the preview to the movie first, and it went very badly.The student in the movie who anchors the plot is the unknown Miles Teller, who is just fine in the role. He pushes and struggles and suffers?and eventually comes through, though with some serious convolutions.So, on the surface, this will thrill and wow most viewers. And I liked all of this a lot. But the plot is mostly just what I've described. There are two additions to it, one dismissible (the love life of the student) an the other the one socially probing aspect, which you'll have to wait to see. Excellent and needed.But not enough. If you love jazz, or have played jazz (I've done both in my limited way), you might balk at the music here. Yes. Surprise! Because this is all written out band music with jazz inflections. Until the last scene, which is critical, there is no improvisational jazz at all?none! In fact, the music struck me so cold I almost stopped watching. I hope you won't have the same problem, but it's there.I also found the overall plot so narrow I couldn't quite get past its linearity. Even the psychology of the two leads is mostly left to rants and bleeding fingers and disgust. It's oddly superficial, even if it strikes you at first as completely about psychological depth.Still, it's remarkable in its own way, and I totally recommend seeing it. The shocks will be wonderfully shocking, and the idea of doing your best, which is something most of us shamefully avoid, is a great reminder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and thoroughly entertaining! 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I was really looking forward to watching this film because I have been drumming since I was a little boy and I know that jazz drumming is one of the hardest methods to master. The movie is about an inspiring drummer who tries his utmost to impress the top instructor in his school. After showing him his determination and dedication to his art, he gets promoted to be the head drummer in his orchestra but the teachers ruthless methods and constant search for perfection, takes his toll. The movie is original and entertaining from beginning to end. The drumming from Miles Teller is superb but it's J.K. Simmons nasty methods that impressed me. The storyline is quite basic and it seemed really short, for some unknown reason but it's very entertaining and I'm glad that it got the recognition that it deserved. If your not into drumming or jazz music, the relationship between the teacher and student is worth a watch because it shows how far a person will go to achieve perfection. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This is the first major film from Damien Chazelle who also wrote the strange Grand Piano starring Elijah Wood. With such a small budget, he really did get the most out of actors which got J.K. Simmons an Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe for Best Supporting role. That just proves that audiences always like a good baddie! Anyway, Miles Teller who also starred in Divergent, 21 and Over and Rabbit Hole, hasn't done to bad since he came on the big screen 2010 and he has a major role as Mr. Fantastic in the new Fantastic Four franchise. J.K. Simmons has starred in over 100 movies but he's mostly known for playing J. Jonah Jameson in the Spiderman movies. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I hope that more people will get to watch it, now that it's on DVD.Budget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $14millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about an inspiring drummer who gets pushed to the limit by his ruthless teacher. 8/10</fullReview>

This movie is all about his up's and down's.The plot of this movie proves that with proper inspiration, fear and with a good motivator, one can reach to it's peak. I wish I had an instructor like J.K. Simmons. Passionate learning and proper motivation, I say.This movie is also an example for a high quality low budget movie.Looking to watch?

		<shortDescription>Where does Greatness come from ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Define Greatness ? almost everyone has a idea of who the "Greats " Are. In fact almost every body knows the back story of their great and who they are and how they came to be. But What is it what does it meant to be truly great ?Whiplash is a movie that struggles with that Very question. as it tells the story of Andrew a young man with a love and a driving passion for the drums. his idol is Buddy Rich and he lives for jazz. he studied Charlie Parker and simply lives to play.The most telling part takes place at a dinner party where Andrew is belittled by his family, for having a lack of friends. And Andrew Retorts that he would much rather live and die like Charlie Parker then to live Like them. When Andrew is reminded that Charlie Parker died alone and friendless with a arm full of heroin He relies that at least Charlie Parker is Remembered. And not only is Parker remembered but he is now a immortal legend. And that would be fine for him. Andrew is driven to be one of the greats .then he is selected by his university's leading music teacher a jazz musician named Terrence Fletcher.. Fletcher is as driven as Andrew is. Fletcher lives and dreams in terms of music and his one driving goal is to discover the next Charlie Parker the next Buddy Rich. And in doing so he will push Andrew to the breaking point. he will drive him to limits he never knew he possessed. and both of them will end up on a collision course with madness.Whiplash is a study in passion and the drive to be great. And what it takes to be great. Its also a study in fear. the fear of what would happen if yo failed achieving what you wanted to be great at.I was first made aware of Whiplash during the Oscars and saw the stunning footage of J.K. Simmons and I thought to myself I must see this movie . Simmons alone makes it great. the story is engaging and makes you think and its easily one of the best films to come along in a long long time that did not depend on explosions or super heroes like the Imitation game this films greatness lies in its very humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie not for the simple minded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie not for the simple minded, Whiplash is a film which revolves around the lives of a passionate 19 year old musician Andrew (Miles Teller) and his perfectionist professor Fletcher (JK Simmons). The intense story begins when Andrew enrols into the 'Shaffer Conservatory of Music-a prestigious music college' as a drummer and almost immediately 'impresses' Fletcher enough for him to be selected as a member of the sound team under him. From there on starts the clash of two musical egos; one of Andrew who with all his hard work and dedication does his best to impress Fletcher and Fletcher himself who holds no bar when it comes to pushing his students at all length to get the best out of them and to help him win every music competition. If you think from there on movie moves to a typical storyline where a student becomes a musical prodigy or the professors mends his ways and becomes a less harsh and better tutor, then you are so wrong and this is exactly where Whiplash differs from any other music related movie. The movie in turn sticks with much more believable reality and showcases pure raw emotions of revenge, loathing and pure determination to prove oneself. Both Teller and Simmons have done justice to their respective roles and have carried the movie with their brilliant performance and Damien Chazelle as a writer and a director has kept the story simple while bringing a new prospective of looking at a story. Chazelle also needs to be credited for paying special attention to visual details and getting into the mind of a musician, but the place where he lacks and yet differs from everyone else is not going into too much detail and not trying to justify a character in any way. The pure brilliance of this makes the viewer engrossed as to why a character is certain way and yet makes him also wonder why certain people in the movie even existed. In the end I would say watch the movie for its pure raw brilliance and if for nothing else for Teller's and Simmon's brilliant acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash: A Great Example of How Good Cinema Can Be Made From Anything. Even a Drum Set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>+ JK Simmons: What a brilliant performance from him. He plays the ever-threatening Fletcher with the ease of an actor who has owned the character and made it his own.+ Miles Teller: While there are no words to describe his amazing performance behind the drums, he has also managed to break his mould as a sidekick in sci-fi movies otherwise.Whiplash will forever be remembered for being a film that has built so much around the humble drum set. Miles Teller plays Andrew, a teen enrolled as a drummer in a prestigious school called The Shaffer Convservatory of Music. He encounters Terrence Fletcher (JK Simmons) who is a teacher at the conservatory with a brutal and abusive teaching style. Things start looking up for Andrew when he gets picked up by Fletcher to play for the school band with the exception that he has to deal with the ruthlessness of Fletcher's teaching methods.Whiplash is intense. The sheer chemistry between Teller and Simmons is something that takes the film experience to a whole new level.The last drum solo is a scene that is much talked and for obvious reasons. Sellers delivers a stellar performance. The transformation of Simmons during that scene is also something to watch out for. There is also a difference of opinion going around the same last scene. People who are criticizing the scene for being vague and confusing need to understand the emotional aspect of the two characters in it.JK Simmons delivers his career best. His on screen presence is something that is rarely seen in cinema these days. Miles Teller surprises everybody with his unassuming personality which goes haywire when pushed to the limits.Whiplash makes one believe that good cinema can be made from anything, even a drummer and his drum set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is enthralling from the first frames to the final curtain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow..wow wow wow Truly humbled and awed on seeing this film. Soo here goes the review:A devoted Buddy Rich fan with stellar ambitions, Andrew is relentless like no drummer Fletcher has ever taught and the bullet-headed Fletcher is distinctly evocative of Full Metal Jacket's foul-mouthed, bullying and merciless drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman. Fletcher eschews jazz improvisation for impossibly strict cadences and tempos. And when he asks the band to meet for practice at 9 am, he will enter the room at that very second. Andrew is no slouch in the determination department - he dumps his sweet girlfriend (Benoist) to focus on playing and play he does, till his hands bleed.It's a battle played out with hatred and respect. It's no surprise that Fletcher sees talent in Andrew and wants to coax it out, and Andrew's obsession with being the best makes his conductor's approval his solitary aim.Whiplash is never about anything other than its two leads however, and the pay-off is extraordinary, a final scene more exciting than any offered up by any big budget blockbuster in recent memory.There are very few good movies about music. By that, I don't mean musicals nor do I mean films with musicians as actors playing their own work (The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night). I mean films with musicians as serious dramatic subjects, dealing with their passion for art and the pressures of performance. Movies that deal with why people dedicate their lives to music, despite the uncertainty of career expectations, the constant expectations of performance and the demands it makes on their family and love lives. Whiplash does evoke this theme and dramatize it well despite all its regrettable missteps in narrative and characterization.The casting of the film is also a key to its success. Miles Teller is a gem of a find ? his desperation, sweat and blood are all hyper realistic. Every time he struggles to hit the drums you feel lucky you don't have to be in his place. Simmons certainly deserves Oscar for best supporting actor. Seldom do we see characters in cinema that are so powerful. His bald headed black-attired mere presence is threatening, thanks to those condescending eyes and deep voice. Every time he looks at you it feels like he is going to hit you, and yet you feel like you have to live up to his expectations.Young filmmaker Damien Chazelle has set himself a very high standard here by trying to create the atmospherics of the military school in Full Metal Jacket in a music school of all places. Before Whiplash, a music school in our heads would have triggered images of peace-loving harmless musicians gently punching out tunes out of a piano or bespectacled geeks lost in their violins. Chazelle succeeds admirably in reflecting the tension between students and teacher. The subtext also underlines the importance of being kind rather than abusive. Slick editing with quick cuts and intense montage lead to the final concert at the Carnegie Hall where Andrew plays an extended powerhouse drum solo. Never mind the jazz standards, what makes WHIPLASH worth the watch is the excellent editing, camera-work and above all, the acting.Whiplash is enthralling from the first frames to the final curtain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly tense movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash" is a brilliantly tense movie. It has a nice 90's feeling to it. The mental and physical battle between the ruthless instructor and the talented young drummer was so well written. It reminded me a little bit of Ari Gold &amp; Llyod's relationship in "Entourage". JK simmons's performance as the instructor is very good but a lil overrated. I personally think Miles Teller was better as the Drummer, because his character had more layers to it. Whilst the instructor is straight up unlikeable. The drummer skips around from likable to unlikeable throughout the whole movie. I also like how it asks the question "Where is the line between motivation and abuse?" It is edited to perfection. Not a dull or false moment throughout. A Must See! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is like a time-bomb ticking to a point of explosion and that comes in the form of the movie's climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash turns the conventional teacher-student relationship on its head. There are two words that come to my mind that wholly define the movie: BLOODY INTENSE and ELECTRIFYING. Easily, Whiplash is one of the most thrilling dramas that you will ever come across. The movie rightly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture as it captures the various human emotions like passion, determination, perseverance and dedication to superior effect. One can actually feel the emotions like currents flowing through the veins of the actors: Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons and both of them carry the movie together with utmost brilliance.So, Whiplash is about a music teacher, Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) and his student, Andrew ( Miles Teller) and their struggle to master the art of drumming. The film talks about the extents to which one can or should go to survive in the current scenario of cutthroat competition. One may surely not relate to Fletcher's teaching methods but J.K. Simmons plays the role with such authority that he makes it very difficult not to love his character as he walks on fine lines of an anti-hero. The power packed performances make the movie what it is and a tight screenplay adds on to its thrilling quotient as the movie deals with the teacher-student relationship in the most reckless way imaginable.Coming to the cast, J.K SImmons as Fletcher is a music teacher with highly unconventional teaching methods that mostly involve barking orders, cursing like a sailor because according to him, everything is fair in teaching as it helps him bringing out the best in his students. There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'GOOD JOB' , this particular quote can be called as Fletcher's teaching ideologies in a nutshell and explains his psychology quite perfectly. He gives the performance of his lifetime in Whiplash as the movie derives most of its intensity from him and in my opinion, he surely deserves an Oscar for this. Miles Teller as Andrew plays the role of a determined student who is an apprehensive lad, pressurized to his saturation point by his music teacher, Fletcher, but at the same time he is very optimistic about his career as a drummer. Miles Teller brings in the much required, vulnerability as well as realism to his role and he completely wins your heart in the third act of the movie.The film kick starts right from the word go and once it gets the momentum, there's no looking back. That's the beauty of Whiplash. It has some brilliantly crafted scenes that are so intense and snappy that you might need a moment or two to catch your breath again.Whiplash is like a time-bomb ticking to a point of explosion and that comes in the form of the movie's climax. The drum solo of 'Whiplash' played by Andrew in the live concert with Fletcher finally acknowledging Andrew gives the movie a perfect finish as the chemistry of both the actors on-stage reaches a state of euphoria. That's the point when Fletcher discovers that the true potential of his student has been finally realized and the relief on his face says it all. It's like the whole movie was desperately trying to reach there and the immense satisfaction that the movie leaves you with is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsessive and Vigorous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers) "Whiplash", directed by Damien Chazelle, is another movie about a character with an obsession. It begs for comparisons to "Black Swan" from a few years ago. Where Black Swan was a hallucinatory, depressive, and obsessed trip into misfortune, Whiplash plays it mostly straight with the main character more in control, and a decidedly positive and redemptive ending. Whiplash then doesn't carry the punch as strongly perhaps, though it does have the same drive. It is a great watch, with Miles Teller character unable to stop his drive and obsession until flirting with near death and a car accident brought upon by misfortune and bad luck. You can identify his drive and feel the ferocity of it fanned by J K Simmons character, a legendary drummer and "drill sergeant" crossing the line into abusiveness. The obsession to succeed and exceed here becomes a drug, intoxicating and addicting, much like in Black Swan. Simmons rightly wins supporting actor award in this movie; he is a reminiscent of Louis Gosset Jr's Emil Foley in "An Officer and a Gentleman" in performance level. He is feared as he is respected, and he is a bully with a purpose such that the means justifies the ends. I enjoyed this strong movie. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No room for imperfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last week and Im still thinking about it. Unrelenting, overbearing, narcissistic- for both characters, the student drummer and his insecure , driven instructor. It reminds me of the days I spent at boarding school, where some of the masters there were just as unforgiving for any mistake and took you down as far as you could go. As far as the story carries, it is also a supremely done allegory. The protégé, in this case a young man, gaining experience in the face of continual criticism by the teacher.The teacher, though, is way beyond normal- he seeks to destroy any confidence that he may have- even if the student knows he's good enough. But its not enough to be just good enough. The young student, knowing that he can outperform if given the chance while his unbalanced instructor is determined to somehow bring out the excellence demanded by the medium of music- in this case-Jazz. There are no words of encouragement- only extreme criticism, and denigration. What purpose it serves to do that kind of instruction can only make you or break you to the point of self despising.The movie is very well played, well acted and will keep you thinking about it for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle both wrote and directed WHIPLASH and his film won three Oscars and a lot of fans. It is s difficult film to watch on DVD - the small screen acts life a loaded rifle timed at your head and blasting your eardrums with both jazz and the raunchiest dialogue around. It I basically a two actor show (with some incidental and rather meaningless bit parts tossed in to try to offer a bit of emotional resting during this madhouse of a film.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a young and talented drummer attending a prestigious cut-throat music academy in New York who comes under the wing of the most respected professor at the school, one Fletcher (J.K.Simmons) who does not hold back on abuse towards his students. The two form an odd relationship as Andrew drams of greatness and Fletcher (we finally discover at the end of the film) will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.Both actors offer top performance (as do the bit part player Paul Reiser as Andrew's father and Melissa Benoist as Nicole- Andrew's minor infatuation), but the film for the most part is a barrage of gross desultory and demeaning filth that pours out of J.K. Simmons' Shar Pei face and mouth. Vicious, cruel, demeaning he finally gets his due in part because Andrew is talked into reporting Fletcher's behavior when an incident happens with a fellow student. The last moments of the film make the first long one note song payoff ? Fletcher's drive is intrinsically a desire to make his students be the best they can be. But oh, before that, it gets old rather quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is an entertaining look at obsession in the arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash Changes TempoWhiplash is a film above all about struggle, the struggle within ourselves and the struggle we have with the influences in our life: our family, our mentors and our artistic challengers. Andrew, played by the talented Miles Teller, is a young drumming prodigy, or is he? Is he the next Buddy Rich or Max Roach? Andrew admires his mentor, Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. Simmons won an Oscar for the playing the megalomaniacal band leader who thinks he has the power to beat greatness into his students through abuse, name-calling, manipulation, lies, whatever it takes to be great. One big question left standing at the end of the movie is whether abusive teaching works for the most talented of artists, if it can make them that much greater.Whiplash is a more dramatic and less smarmy look at the entertainment industry than Birdman. Whiplash doesn't beg for us to notice how clever it is at every turn, it's not predictable, and while we are not clear where the protagonists will go at the end of the film, it doesn't need to invoke magical realism and mysticism to be a mystery. Other than both being compound nouns and about the entertainment industry, the two films are world's apart.Whiplash is not your typical film about an artist climbing to the top. Few films give so much time to the importance of mentorship in the artists' lives. Few films explore the obsession of the the art itself that leads one to desire to be "one of the greats." And the film isn't talking about the obsession of drugs and alcohol or some abusive family that leads artists to greatness. Like many artist we consider great, his obsession stems from his inner demons of not knowing what else he would do with his life without it and his insecurities in a world where the next guy on drums might be better. If he can't play like Elvin Jones, than what's the point? Unlike most of us who either aren't willing to do what it takes to be great or are content with what talent we do have, artists (athletes, scientists, writers ) who become the best have a different mindset. Whiplash lays that out for us to see in an entertaining form. And when you think you caught the beat of Whiplash, it turns on us like modern jazz and ups the tempo. But it never plays down to us. Whiplash surprises with the plot twists and just when you think it goes to far, that it has played out, the key changes and leaves us wondering. Rating: Pay full PricePeace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical thriller. Intense,vicious and cruel. But with damn lot of rhythm in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The truth is, Andrew I never really had a Charlie Parker. But I tried. I actually f*cking tried.""Whiplash". You could think that this film tells the story of a drummer (the movie poster is a bit of a spoiler when it comes to this) who has suffered this injury by violently playing his instrument. Or he lost control of his car while drumming rhythmically on the steering wheel and crashed into the car driving in front of him. You could link the movie title to these assumptions, because the arrangements that Andrew (Miles Teller) has to play in this masterful and highly rhythmic film may result in a neck injury. And when it comes to losing that control ... well ... then you should go and watch the movie to find out yourself. Anyway, the film title refers to a song written by the American jazz composer Hank Levy. The central theme of the film is about the influence you can have on someone and drive that person to exceed certain inhuman limits of his own ability. Now, for me you're already a top musician when you know the complete arrangement of "Whiplash" and "Caravan" (written by Duke Ellington) by heart. Even if there's a little mistake here and there or you are little bit offbeat, eventually I will have a boundless admiration for the musician after completing such a superhuman performance.I've never had such a desire to pull someone through the screen and then smack a huge cymbal against his face as now with the presumably extremely talented music teacher Fletcher, brilliantly played by JK Simmons. A man who lives for his music and has a huge passion for it. It's a bit exaggerated that passion though. Exaggerated to such extent that it exceeds the limit of human dignity and by his passion for creating a perfect musician, his way of teaching tends to be sadomasochistic. A kind of militaristic attitude towards his traumatized and frightened students who are wary of any unexpected outburst. A disrespectful howler, suitable as "drill sergeant" in the US Army, and first-class bully, who suddenly swings around music stands, slaps his students in the face and throws out a member of his orchestra, just because he plays a bit out of tune . Afterwards, the accused doesn't appear to be the culprit, but he's just thrown out of the classroom because he didn't know he wasn't the one playing out of tune. A worse stain on the reputation of a professional musician, according to Fletcher.That's also what Andrew, an ordinary American teenager who studies at the Shaffer conservatory and whose only envisioned aim is to be the best jazz drummer ever, undergoes. The moment he's being asked to join Fletcher's school orchestra, which only consists of a select group of musicians, it becomes the best day of his life. His confidence gets such a boost that he even overcomes his shyness and dares to ask a girl, who works at the cinema, on a date. That it's subsequently leading to a veritable psychological warfare, goes beyond his wildest dream. Gradually the terror policy of Fletcher drives him to the utmost to meet Fletcher's expectations. Even his relationship with Nicole (Melissa Benoist) is terminated abruptly by him. The love for music is displaced by a bloody battle for a wanted spot in the orchestra. The obsessional takes the upper hand, tending towards self-destruction.I'm not exactly an expert myself when it's about jazz. And I've read reviews where it's suggested that the essence of jazz is completely misrepresented here : "The idea about jazz in this movie is brought in a grotesque way and looks like a ridiculous caricature". The whole history about Charlie Parker and the anecdote Fletcher tells every time, apparently isn't exactly true at all. Could be, but for me the jazz section wasn't of essence in the story. It's the emotional and physical brutality that Fletcher uses to bring students to a higher level. In this way Fletcher tries to create "HIS Charlie Parker". The whole movie does follow the rhythm of the used music: uplifting, rhythmic and intense. Only the end was predictable and presented us of course the well known rule that the oppressed kicks the oppressor's ass again. Actually I hoped Andrew would put his drumsticks there where the sun doesn't shine at Fletcher.The performances of Teller and Simmons are obviously extremely stunning. It took me a while before I realized that I've seen Teller in "That awkward moment". A movie I wanted to forget about as soon as possible. Here, however, I thought he was brilliant. And apparently he's an avid drummer and he did all the drumming himself. Hats off and respect ! But the most brilliant achievement was undoubtedly that of Simmons. What a great character sketch with lots of charisma. A character that scares you. Someone you start to hate thoroughly after a while. But in the end I understood a bit what drove him to this behavior. He won an Oscar for this role and in my opinion well deserved. An energetic musical thriller, with a fairly predictable outcome and which is so extremely rhythmic you can't sit still. Highly recommended!More reviews at opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Oscar movie with a Princeton connection. Director Damien Chazelle was "inspired by" his musical experience at Princeton High School to explore how the drive to excel can become all-consuming. Not that the character Fletcher, superbly played by Oscar-winner J. K. Simmons, the tightly wound and sadistic studio band leader, mirrored Chazelle's own band leader ("fear inspires greatness"), he is at pains to say, but still . . . Chazelle wanted the film to explore the line between a healthy passion and an obsession, and, boy, did he do that, garnering five Oscar nominations in the process. Miles Teller is terrific as the young drummer pushed to the limits of his skills and endurance?and beyond?by teacher Fletcher, "sworn enemy of the merely O.K.," says Anthony Lane in The New Yorker. Characteristically, Fletcher says, "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'" The Hank Levy tune "Whiplash" is the rack of a tune upon which the drummers in Fletcher's jazz band are broken. Here's a movie where I really felt the tension?it made me clench my fists to the point where my hands, too, were almost bleeding. The playing of the drums enters your skull, and your heart must keep time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot from this movie. With all the Oscar nominations and positive reviews from audiences and critics alike I had some pretty high standards. Who knew that this film was going to blow those standards out of the water? This film was absolutely brilliant. It's about jazz drumming and its probably one of the most intense films I've ever seen. Go figure. Both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons delivered incredible performances. I don't know how much of Miles Teller's drumming was real, but from what I saw, it was mostly real and ridiculously impressive at that. I really felt like he was the next Buddy Rich at some points. J.K. Simmons outdoes himself here. He even beats his performance as J. Jonah Jameson from the original Spiderman movies. He plays a seriously hardcore jazz teacher who really reminded me of that drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket. Every second he's on screen, you can't look away. Probably a career best for him. The music is amazing as well. The level of effort that appeared to have gone into the soundtrack is highly respectable. The highlight comes at the very end, which I won't spoil, so watch this film for yourself to find out. I cannot recommend this film more. Seek it out immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) is a first year student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. His father Jim (Paul Reiser) is a sweet high school teacher. He gets picked by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) to be the backup drummer in his winning Studio band. He gets enough confidence to ask out Nicole (Melissa Benoist). Fletcher is a cruel manipulative dictatorial teacher.J.K. Simmons gets a great juicy part to show his skills that he has shown all these years. He fully deserves his Oscar win and it's not a surprise. He's certainly done great work in many TV and movie roles before over the years. Miles Teller take a great step up. He has done good work but this is something much more. It's a compelling character who develops and changes. He's able to play through it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a joy to watch (and is definitely worth rewatching).In the end of it there are a lot of twists which is very good.I was wondering whether to give it a 9 or 8 but ultimately feel that 8 is the right mark for it.Both the main actor and the supporting actor make fantastic appearances. The supporting actor absolutely deserves his Oscar (I still haven't watched The theory of things, so I can not say the same with conviction about the leading actor).The message of the movie is very powerful and I am very glad that titles like this get the recognition they deserve. I am also glad that other titles that don't deserve this recognition (albeit getting it by being nominated for an Oscar) (I am directly talking about American Sniper) are getting low grades in IMDb.If you like movies about fighting, student/teacher relationships you are in for great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a musician i find this movie just brilliant. JK Simmons is simply the best supporting actor ever in a film (Well, second one, there's Heath Ledger, of course), and then there's Milles Teller. Miles went from playing a teenager in movies like Project X or 21 &amp; over, to being an excellent actor in a "Drama" like this movie.The job that the Film Editor and the Sound Mixer did is excellent, Miles Teller does play drums in real life but not as good as he looks like in the movie. That, is the achievement that the Film Editor and Sound Mixer have.Also, the script is just amazing, i can't believe the Academy marked it as an Adapted Screenplay just because Chazelle made a Short Film to raise funds to actually make the movie, but, rules are rules. The lines that JK deliver are epic and perfect ("Not quite my tempo", "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than "good job"", "I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity") also, the scene where Andrew discusses with his Uncle Frank and his two cousins is brilliant, the acting, the script, all of it.I only have one complain about the movie. Melissa Benoist has less than 15 or 10 minutes of screen time and she is listed, THIRD?!. Okay, she adds something to the story, actually, Miles does when he says they can't continue dating because he will always be thinking about drumming. I mean, come on, third? Nevertheless, she did a pretty good acting.If you are a musician or really dig music (If you love jazz, what are you waiting for?) I think this movie would be great for you.It is, indeed, a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best achievement in Sound Editing of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking and totally unmissable! Who thought J.K Simmons would have been offered a role eligible for an Oscar win? Nobody - but that's not the point; the movie is mesmerising to its own extent and outweighs the boundaries of sound editing to a unique and powerhouse level. With so much pleasure to keep the audience glued to their seats, Whiplash is a fascinating tale about a passionate drummer called Andrew (played by Miles Teller) - who's undying dream is to become a musician as a drummer, even if he has to go off the deep end by severely injuring himself, in practise, which he, ultimately, does, when music professor, Fletcher, abusively doubts his talents. It's a careers best for J.K Simmons, whom delivers a masterful performance as Fletcher, as he horribly abuses the students in his music class, in order to make them successful and talented musicians - but Fletcher is not to be messed with. Miles Teller also delivers a mesmerising performance as the young master drummer, Andrew, whom will stop at nothing and will cross boundaries, even with Fletcher, to achieve his dream. It's one of my favourite movies of the year and of all time - and an extraordinary new achievement in filmmaking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that I enjoyed the movie and in a entertainment popcorn kind of way. It has great music, nice cinematography and the actors were good taking into consideration of what was asked them to do. But this is about it, which sometimes is plenty taking into consideration the amount of crap movies that are out there. The problem resides on this film being pretentious and flat with not possible depth of it's message in an artistic sense and let's not even go for morale. The film's plot is unrealistic in the way the The teacher (Fletcher) behaves in this particular set up, being incoherent in the way he reacts at certain points of the movie. Also the way the students react to him, or not react in this case being mere puppets. That said, there is no way in the slightest possible way, that this story could be convincing. I wont get into details not to create any spoilers. One might argue that it is an allegory of reality, but that needs to be presented with some real start point, which is completely non existent and it would serve a purpose to convey a strong message, which does not exists and if it intended to exist, it is confusing as hell: being a prick pays off or doesn't? Does talent only flourishes under extreme and sadistic situations, or not? Is being professional and always have the music as the main core the answer, or your own macho ego should prevail? The secondary characters are completely non existing and should not be there to begin with. I found this movie no different from a 80s Reagan movie, Van Dame and alike, only more eye brow and full of nasty clichés.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than it appears, thanks to an entertainingly over-the-top performance from J.K. Simmons, writer-director Damien Chazelle's feature is about a first year student (Miles Teller) studying jazz drumming at a prestigious music conservatory who's terrorized by Simmons' sadistic instructor. It sounds from afar like "An Officer And A Gentleman" and, yes, personal breakthroughs are ultimately at stake, but it's precisely here where Chazelle trips up: the film's last third is filled with incredulous incidents that subvert the characters' motivations, especially at the conclusion, where a meeting of the minds effectively undercuts all that went before. And Chazelle's main character is a confusing mess: portrayed as a friendless, defensive loner, he still has no problem approaching the pretty girl (Melissa Benoist) working the concession stand at the local movie house and sparking her interest; he also has no problem dropping her shortly afterwords, rendering the subplot unnecessary. As a director, Chazelle is competent, but he seems to want to let the drumming relentlessly dictate Tom Cross' editing and it gets irritating after a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jk Simmons gives a haunting performance as Terence Fletcher. You question his motives during the film and his manipulative manner makes you actually feel sympathy towards him at points. A character this complex could be played to such a degree that it becomes unbelievable, Simmons touches the boundaries of this but doesn't go overboard and reach this point. Flawless.Teller's frustration as Andrew can be seen growing and growing as the film progresses, almost like a drum solo reaching it's climax, until he finally snaps. The frustration shows him almost morph into a less developed version of Fletcher. Andrews internal struggle with his desire to be 'one of the greats' and his emotional distress is one of the key components of this film - he starts off as an average kid with aspirations and transforms into someone who will do anything to reach his goal.The only problem I found with the film (a minor detail) is that the foreshadowing was very obvious. Fletcher tells the class about Casey, a former student of his who made it professionally and recently died in a car crash. Later in the film, Andrew gets in a car crash. Then, Fletcher tells Andrew how the next Charlie Parker wouldn't be discouraged by anything - later in the film, we know there's going to be a scene when Andrew is pushed to his limits by Fletcher, and isn't discouraged. This happens in the last scene. As I mentioned, this is a bit of a picky point as the foreshadowing itself was effective. I was very impressed with this film and think it deserves it's Oscar recognition and acclaim. For a low budget film it exceeds expectations and outdoes itself. One of my favourite films of the last few years and I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I now have a new addition to my top 10 favorite movies of all time. I actually had to make an IMDb account so I could rate this film because to not rate this film would be considered, in my eyes, utter sacrilege. It's lunacy to classify this movie as merely a Drama and a Musical but I understand, it fits well into those neat little boxes; it's got music and it's got drama. But the experience of watching this movie... the raw, visceral emotions this movie unwittingly rips out of you... the undeniable fact that it will land you right on the edge of your seat, filled to the brim with hope and fear and anxiety and hatred and wishing it will never end right up until the very second it does... this film not only demands to be categorized as a thriller, but a thriller that deserves a 10 star rating!To not experience this movie is to proclaim oneself cinematically ignorant and forever unworthy of any seat in the theater.

		<shortDescription>Like my old gym school teacher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bullying nature of the bandmaster had me reliving those horrible days at school where a gym teacher had much the same approach to bringing out the best in his charges. Fifty five years on and I have grudging respect for the tactics of achievement by fear, but I still recall him as a rectal aperture who could have used more tender methods. J.K. Simmons plays the "rear exit" role to perfection, totally uncompromising in his almost unattainable standards (and a person who would be doing jail time under today's parameters). It's a real debate as to whether a genius needs to be pushed or whether their natural talents will emerge from some internal drive. My old gym teacher certainly brought out some qualities in me that would still be latent if it hadn't been for the fear and humiliation factor. Miles Teller plays a wonderful part as a driven/obsessed youth, it seems that all of the great musicians excluded everything else from their lives until they became masters. After that most of them make up for lost time by piling headlong into booze drugs and women.. but that wasn't part of this story. I enjoyed the pace and tension of the movie , all of the parts were well cast and the dinner table scene was a wonderful display of the contrast between hero worship of Football Jocks and the dismissal of musical talent. But that's America , at least until the musician gets famous. I would have given the movie a 10 if it wasn't for the actual music itself ; Jazz to me is like a cinder caught under a door, I'm sure they're all magic musicians but I'd sooner hear three cats howling on the back fence at night than spend any time listening to this tuneless crap. Go ahead and hang me if you can find me, it should be easy, I'll be at any country/rock concert. Enjoy the movie in Cmajor7b5 cheers Billc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The extreme interaction between the teacher and his pupil was thrilling to watch. Absolutely amazed by the two guys performance. Thanks! With all the music in the movie it was hard to sit still. The movie was built like the song whiplash itself. It started out nicely with miles being a drum-student at a fortunate music school. On the way it got more and more intense. The real 'forte' started with him putting his drumming way above his relationship, but came to an ultra height when he got hit by the truck. Still keep on trying to make it he forced himself. Then prepping for the final hits he came back stronger and more deliberate than anything I've ever seen before. With an outstanding performance at the end I am sure he will make it at the top. The movie showed the two sides of success as kids have to fight these days to compete. A study in medicine, music, business, to make it to the top there is no taking it easy. But is it worth it?? That question is portrayed quite well in the movie to my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . as the Achilles Heel of any musical group. Subject to inattention, reckless behavior, and mutiny, percussionists can be considered a "necessary evil" at best. At worst, their Sociopathic behavior gets others maimed and killed. Throughout human history, drummers have been tapped to march soldiers to their deaths. The executioner's cue always has been the drum roll. "Andrew," the main character of WHIPLASH, is habitually late to his band practices. WHIPLASH shows Andrew on one such occasion speeding 80 mph in a 25 mph school zone, causing a horrific multi-vehicle crash. Fortunately, "Nicole"--Andrew's short-term girlfriend--wises up and ditches him for a normal guy. I've personally hung out with marching band types all my life (as they make better conversation than the rest of the people around here, who've suffered countless concussions playing with their pigskins). Band folks are great pals, except drummers. The only drummer 99% of Americans can name is Ringo Starr, who is considered the "black sheep" of the Beatles. No one has even heard of "the greats" Andrew tries to emulate in WHIPLASH, since most of them died broke, as Andrew himself admits here. Bang the drum slowly, and give me baseball any day!</fullReview>

As a musical person who has had the privilege of being conducted and taught by great teachers who achieved and inspired great things.

		<shortDescription>Shallow and Perverse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shallow and perverse movie. The characters are paper thin, lacking both humanity and spirit, which of itself would guarantee their being useless musicians, let alone jazz musicians, one of the most spontaneous, warm and free spirited of all musical genres (contrary to how the film portrays it as being all about razor sharp precision).This film must appeal to non musicians who think that corporate fascism and bullying techniques of fear based mind control apply to making good music, not just turning people into corporate slave workers. Well they're wrong. What's disturbing is that the film pulls no punches as to the abuse of the Nazi in all but name played by J.K. Simmons (in what has to be a vastly overrated performance, not helped by a very weak script) yet the moral seems to be that bullying and instilling fear in people brings out the best in them.Well that is a false message if ever there was one. Moreover, the characters, both 'teacher' and 'student' as well as the side musicians are totally cold and uninspiring and New York feels like a depressed ghetto. Andrew's family dinner scene is very revealing of the sad, conformist, death-like mindset of some people ensconced in the social control system without an iota of imagination, creativity or spirit. This movie is depressing. It shows very well what is wrong with the world (namely, power abuse) without any attempt at critiquing it artistically. Instead, the film justifies and promotes it, all in the name of 'art' (what cheek!). That pathetic critics and movie goers rate this film so highly just pinpoints how tasteless and morally challenged the vast majority of the population actually are. And I agree with another reviewer that it is sad to see all these music students start to hate on each other just to be on Fletcher's good cards - just how power works in real life. Stand up for yourselves you cowardly losers!As I said, this film is shallow and perverse. People who like this movie must have no experience of suffering at the hands of people in positions of power. Nor can they possibly have the slightest understanding of what learning to play an instrument well entails. Their primitive minds are probably still trapped in the cliché that military 'discipline' (or rather psychological rape) is the way to treat people and 'get the most out of them'.Pathetic.One star.</fullReview>

I wouldn't say I'm a big jazz fan overall not that I dislike it at all but Whiplash truly blew me away. I've seen the film 3 full times and for me it never gets old. I really loved the acting in this film. Whoever casted J.K. Simmons deserves a medal. Simmons' performance is flawless, truly breathless with a terrifying presence. He makes the film as intense as it can get especially in the "Were you rushing or were you dragging" scene. The chemistry between Simmons and Teller is just great they're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship. Highly recommended to whether you're a jazz fan or not.</fullReview>

To see Oscar winner J.K. Simmons giving his all in this role is just an extraordinary pleasure. Miles Teller himself is pushing himself both as an musician and an actor; very well done, indeed!I play the drums and would have appreciated a more neutral aspect of the music, plus that there are elements about the educational part that is toned down to let the clear message take part in this one.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : very high quality and solid work all around. Oscar winner tells it all. - The actors : Amazing... just wonderful and emotional! J.K. Simmons took the Academy Award. - The story : Important about the almost persecution for the success in music... and about how far are a human being ready to get pushed... and is the "pushing human being" right at all times? - Entertainment : High score. The chemistry between the student and teacher is electrifying. - Age : Strong language and couple of "bullying" screen plays. Maybe from 11 and up...?8,4 out of 10 (Short elucidation for the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent and a solid production)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that really surpassed my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot express how much this movie surprised me. For some reason the plot just did not seem that interesting to me and if I hadn't seen all of the great reviews I probably would have never gotten around to watching it. I thought to myself: "How good can a movie about some kid wanting to be a drummer really be?" After watching it the answer is pretty simple. Whiplash truly was an amazing film.Whiplash follows young Schaffer Conservatory student Robert Neiman (Miles Teller) who aspires to be one of the greatest drummers in history, and his relentless instructor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Both deliver great performances, but Simmons is the one who really stands out. His performance really makes you question the motives of Fletcher. Sometimes you get the feeling that he uses his rough teaching tactics to better his students and push them to their limits, while other times you feel that he is really just a sociopath who enjoys insulting his students. At many times during his barrage of insults I couldn't help but think of R Lee Ermey's performance in Full Metal Jacket.The story is compelling with many ups and downs that keep you hooked throughout. This is not just a movie about an aspiring drummer, but about how an obsession can take over one's life. Neiman is obsessed with becoming one of the greats while Fletcher is obsessed with teaching his students to become some of the greats. Both of them let this obsession take over and control their lives. It is also very inspiring in the way that Neiman will stop at nothing to achieve his dreams, and Fletcher will do the same to get Neiman to his dreams. Fletcher believes in pushing people beyond what they think they are capable of in order to truly become the greatest they can be. As he says to Neiman at one point: "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than "good job"."Even if this movie doesn't seem like it would be your type of movie, I highly recommend it. There really is nothing that I disliked about this movie. The story is great, and many of the scenes will have you on the edge of your seat. This is one of those movies that will stick with you long after you finish watching it. For me this was a perfect film and it earned a 10/10.</fullReview>

As a academic who has worked in three universities I have seen aggressive and bullying teachers who bully and Terrence fletcher, who lies, screeches and physically assaults his students repeatedly within the first 30 minutes of the movie, would have been fired within a few months of his first contract. This movie is a child of our times where in American (and British) television and Cinema, antihero adoration has become the established norm (see "House" and "breaking bad"), yet presentation of role models or sympathetic lead roles is considered cliché. Movies are considered art as long as they make the audience feel something ANYTHING even if it's profound discomfort. When I watched this movie I felt like turning it off. So does this make it art?

		<fullReview>Note that Erskine lauds equal measures of love and enthusiasm, discipline and toughness. Innumerable cultural think pieces over the last decade have rightly criticized the millennial-parental mindset of "everybody gets a trophy." And Simmons' Terence Fletcher deftly skewers the kind of thinking that leads only to universal mediocrity: "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'"In the end, though, Fletcher/Simmons produces a drum machine, not a musician, an artist, or a better human being. Virtuosity and technical excellence devoid of personality and self-expression?that ineffable quality we call "soul"?is meaningless. And because of that, Whiplash, a 106-minute look at the act of making music, ultimately is one of the most anti-music, anti-art films I've ever seen. So no, "hate" is not too strong a word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things make this movie worth watching: the great acting by J.K. Simmons, and the nice visuals and editing. These, not surprisingly, received Oscar awards.But I believe the movie fails entirely at its core: music. The story mixes Full Metal Jacket with Shine to represent a bullying music teacher mistreating young students in some supposedly reputable jazz music academy. The whole focus is on the brilliant leading character who becomes obsessed with perfection, and on his lunatic teacher pushing him harder and harder.The big problem for me is the total lack of credibility. Music, as it is represented in this movie, works like gymnastics where there exists some ideal perfect execution to be obtained by exercising more and more. I think, on the contrary, that (good) music is more like dance, where there is no "perfect execution" but rather it involves taste, sensibility, and different points of view.An example of this is the song Caravan that is played multiple times throughout the movie. As a fan of good ol' jazz, I have to say I never listened to a worse execution! If you do not know what I am talking about please just search "Duke Ellington Caravan" on Youtube and then compare with this movie: Caravan is NOT about super-speed and perfect timing, it is about mood, swing and atmosphere, all things that seem totally unknown to whoever run the music department for Whiplash.If you are looking for a good movie about obsession for music I would definitely suggest Shine. If you look for a movie about music as a way to obtain freedom and elevation of spirit (and also some good laugh) there's The Concert. Or try Kieslowski's Trois couleurs Bleu, Mo' Better Blues, or maybe the TV series Mozart in the Jungle. Whiplash does not add anything interesting to the long list of films about music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good: Teller and Simmons commit like mad and sell the heck out of their characters -- basically, as many have pointed out, the only two real characters in the film -- enough to make their work together suspenseful and interesting to watch... no matter how silly the underlying premises.The bad: Neither character is all that likable, but moreover the cartoon levels of abuse that "Fletcher" dishes out to his students and especially to the protagonist would get him arrested and drummed out of the Marine Corps, let alone a music school. In the course of the movie, Fletcher doesn't just play head games and dish out deeply personal verbal abuse which on its own should be enough to get him disciplined; he throws chairs, kicks stuff over, humiliates and *slaps* the protagonist, forces him (in hilariously over-the-top fashion) to play until his hands bleed in order to "earn" a part, and makes him take the stage at a competition having obviously just climbed out of a car wreck... then boots him from the band when he can't keep playing. This character isn't an educator. He's an abuser. This is even made obvious by the suicide of one of his former students as a (minor) plot point. Fletcher is himself a (clearly mediocre) musician dealing with his own demons by desperately trying to become at least a footnote in jazz history, the man who threw a cymbal at the head of the next Charlie Parker. And yet...The silly: ... we're treated to an end sequence where a "meeting of the minds" occurs that makes no sense for everyone involved and seems effectively to make excuses for and reward Fletcher's abuse. The disposable and irrelevant subplots meant to sell the rest of the people in the protagonist's life as representing mediocrity don't come off, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I feared I couldn't relate to the world of elite jazz musicians at one of America's top music schools. But through the psychopathic teacher Fletcher (JK Simmons) and his protégé, manic young drummer Neiman (Miles Teller) this movie explores issues such as the role of mentors, how far talented and gifted student should be pushed, and push themselves, and just the painful life of a young musician who is quite lost, and who believes that becoming the next Charlie Parker - being someone - is the answer to his problems. When it's pointed out that Parker had a short life of addiction and pain, Neiman says that maybe it's better to have fame and die young than live a long life and be forgotten. It's one of the many nutty but interesting things in this film, which has a great script, tight direction and great acting. It isn't afraid to go over the top, and interestingly, the story continues well after the film's climax, but it works. You get the feeling that many real-life elite artists and their teachers have some sort of mental condition, in pursuing perfection to an extraordinary degree while ignoring their own health and welfare. The scene where Neiman breaks up with his lovely girlfriend, because having a relationship would affect his drumming, is priceless. Ironically music is for pleasure but in the world of Whiplash it's soaked with pain and sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disturbing Film--And a Masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the front end of this review, let me note that as a rule I try to never write spoilers, and this review certainly will not be that--but as the review goes on I will be commenting on where the film goes, in a general sense, at its conclusion. You've been warned.That said, "Whiplash" is one of the more challenging films that I've written about since I started the practice of writing a review here each time I watch a movie. It's hard to put into words how I feel about this film. It's disturbing, hard to watch, and puts its audience through a type of mental stress that eclipses most horror movies or suspense films. It's a story that is almost impossible to like, and as such it's very hard to say that I "liked" this film. And yet by the same token, it was an amazing piece of art. The movie is thoroughly well made, well produced, well acted, and well scripted. It's essentially a brilliant train wreck of movie--it hurts to look, but it's nevertheless captivating. In that regard the movie is well worth the watch.Now, let's talk about the plot itself. It's no spoiler at all to say that the movie revolves around an abusive student-teacher relationship, and more to the point it features an abusive college professor who has let authority go to his head--that much you can get just from watching the film's trailer. The film features a young drummer (Miles Teller) who has enrolled as a freshman at a well to do music school who then sets out to join the school's "studio band". We quickly learn that the band leader, "Terrence Fletcher", played by J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson from the "Spider-Man" movies), is an egomaniac who likes to scream at students, curse profusely, and even throw things in the middle of rehearsal. Fletcher takes on the young drummer, and sets out to "motivate" him through the most inhumane of mentally abusive instruction conceivable.I might note that Simmons earned the 2015 Academy Ward for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and that award was well deserved. Simmons truly makes the movie, which is a strange thing to applaud someone for given that you can't watch this film without coming to hate his character. Nevertheless, the performance deserves strong praise, and its easy to see how and why the Oscar came his way for this movie.Still, the film is a bizarre amalgam of emotional abuse--both of its characters and of its audience (at one point my girlfriend wanted to turn the movie off altogether, but we made it through)--and brilliant film making. Dr. Fletcher becomes every much as devilish as any villain in any horror or suspense film, all while the movie makes the viewer empathetic and invested in its characters.Now for the slight spoiler which is unavoidable if I'm to offer my biggest criticism of the film. The big problem with this movie is that its conclusion leaves the audience wondering if Dr. Fletcher's instructional tactics were perhaps well founded, inasmuch as the film ends with its main character (Teller) accomplishing a tremendous musical feat that appears to be the product of his being pushed so hard by his tormentor. This being the case, one cannot watch the film without wondering what the message is supposed to be. Is this a movie that is promoting emotional abuse? Is it promoting bullying? Does the film essentially endorse the bizarre abuse of power that its main antagonist personifies throughout the film? While any of these criticisms may be slightly overdone, it's nevertheless true that the awkward ending to the film is troubling.And yet in spite of all of the above, the film nevertheless is powerful, if for no other reason than that it leaves such a powerful impression on its audience. What exactly is being communicated in this film is sure to be a topic of much discussion, but what's for sure is that the movie will captivate you, even if that captivation may prove to be uncomfortable.That said, I wrestled with whether to rate this movie an 8 or a 9. It's extremely well made and powerful....yet its also a film that's just hard to "enjoy" in spite of itself. Thus my 8. Still, I can see how many will watch this film and immediately label it a classic, if not a masterpiece. It's great cinema--just be prepared to be uneasy during and after the movie. Thus my 8 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely amazing film. Expect no pandering to the audience with run of the mill scenes of joyfulness and positive reinforcement which is so common in the modern film. Instead expect real grit and emotive acting in this dramatic, real and slightly psychotic film. Very good performances by the two main actors, portraying the student and teacher respectively, by Miles Teller and J.K Simmons. Even though this film is about playing an instrument essentially, you will be both eyes glued to the screen in anticipation of what happens next as it could be a great thing or a negative thing, acknowledging that not everything in real life is sunshine and lollipops if you're not willing to work at it. But there is also the opposite end of the spectrum...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining in a Rocky kind of way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie on Wednesday and loved it. I find myself still thinking about it two days later. JK Simmons played a character who was the last of a dying breed; someone who isn't afraid to use intimidation (both physical and mental) to get the most out of kids. Everyone ends up hating him, but everyone is better at what they do because of him.I think the reason I liked this movie so much was I remember teachers like this. In fact, I remember a band director like this when I was in middle-school. He threw a music stand at a student and once drove his vehicle onto the playground during recess to target and follow one of the students he was mad at. I don't condone that and wouldn't accept that behavior from a teacher that was directed at my kids, but I also can't deny that we were all on the top of our game when it came to band time.Today's educators are more approachable and have more coach-able moments, but most kids also don't take the teachers or their work seriously, and there are few consequences for poor work. Somewhere between the JK Simmons character and today's PC environment around kids is the right person and attitude for the job. Someone who can both inspire the kids to do their best, and also be approachable.Great movie, drumming, and music that went along well with some great performances by JK Simmons and Miles Teller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie more about pursuit of mastery than drums and music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know little about music and less about drumming, but this movie is not about the craft, it's about the pursuit for mastery (or even perfection). If you go into it knowing nothing about jazz, I'm sure your interest will be peaked.In this movie you follow Teller's character Andrew and Fletcher, the character played by Simmons. Both deliver fantastic performances, and considering they are both supposed to be practicing a craft on a high level, it's very impressive that they manage to do so convincingly.The entire movie follows Andrew around, and by doing so you understand what kind of life he chose to live, and while we don't see anything, what we see is sufficient to fill in the rest. The girl he dates is only seen in a couple of scenes, but you completely understand the relationship and Andrew's thoughts on it from them. The same when it comes to his position on friends and family. Simmons portrayal of Fletcher is very successful, in that he is a beast, but you find yourself rooting for him despite it.And to end with the ending: I am still having a bit of a hard time saying if it's a happy or ending or not, but I really did enjoy it.</fullReview>

The film also has a witty and funny aspect to it. I definitely saw and heard some humour. And I won't lie, there are a lot of tense scenes, too.It's quite the debut from Chazelle, and in my opinion, he can and will go down as one of the greats in the film industry, and yes.

		<shortDescription>Music can change the world because it can change people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle presented this picture at a film festival in the Sundance in 2014. After several of failed paintings, the director has received numerous awards for one of the best films of the previous year. Film "Whiplash" was discovery in 2014. This movie shows us the story of a young boy who is a freshman of the Conservatory of Music. He came under the influence of the great and famous, but at the same time terrible and despotic mastermind. Music is always in first place for our protagonist. Miles tries to do everything not to repeat the fate of his father, who long ago gave up writing craft. Therefore, the young drummer uses every chance to improve their skills in order to achieve this goal. Huge persistence of freshman attracts mastermind Terence Fletcher, who works with renowned orchestra. Trapped in Fletcher, Miles tries to do everything possible to hear some good reviews, but the only constant words of discontent and humiliation become a mandatory part of all rehearsals. This is the method of Fletcher. No words like "good job" or "well done". Only criticism. Ruthless mentor pushes musician beyond human capabilities. This approach makes the musicians become obsessed. They live only music. They breathe music. This constant struggle of a young and talented drummer, not only with the despotic conductor, but also with itself can not break away from the watching the film. Of course, do not forget about the beautiful and exciting music. From the beginning of the movie you get into the rhythm, which persists throughout the film. "Whiplash" is a wonderful movie with great music and no less beautiful game actors. This picture can not leave anyone indifferent. It inspires every viewer and remains in the memory. After the movie you can not immediately return to reality. You're still in rhythm with the music, with the young drummer. I can confidently say that this film was for me a truly discovery and best music film I've ever watched.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portrait of the Artist as a Crazy Young Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I work with a guy who studied music in school and had friends who went the music conservatory route, and according to him "Whiplash" is authentic. To which I say...Oh my God! Because this film is a nightmare.Miles Teller gives an under-appreciated performance as a drummer following his passion who is lucky enough (if lucky is the right word) to be chosen by a psycho jazz teacher (J.K. Simmons) to join his class. What follows is a battle of wills, as Simmons tries to grind his students to stumps of their former selves while Teller proves that he won't be so easily dominated. "Whiplash" goes in a very dark direction and completely defies expectations, which is what I liked most about it. I was expecting a kind of "Devil Wears Prada" set in a music school, where the eager pupil first wants to give up, then rises to the challenge, earns the respect of a tough teacher but ultimately decides his worth doesn't depend on proving himself to anybody. But that is most decidedly NOT the direction this film goes, instead turning into a contest to see how much crazier and more obsessed one maestro can be over another. Simmons shouts and blusters his way through a one-note role. He's good in context of what he's asked to do, but it's the kind of showy performance that wins Oscars, not a subtle and complex characterization. Teller is the heart and soul of the film, and he's tremendous. The film is like watching a car accident in slow motion and being unable to do anything to prevent it, and just as unable to look away.Winner of three Academy Awards (Supporting Actor for Simmons, Film Editing and Sound Mixing) and nominated for two others, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly - I've been thinking that the age of great movies was over. I'd still venture that it is very likely still true. TV has really entered its golden age and I can hardly be bothered to actually go to a movie theater and pay full price to see a show any more. If I am going to watch a movie, I'll wait till is available for rent and then I won't feel so bad that I've wasted my money if it turns out to be bad.Guess what - Whiplash has restored my faith in the motion picture! This movie is beyond exemplary. I cannot understand how it didn't capture Best Picture at every single awards show this season. Miles Teller and JK Simmons are absolutely incredible in this film and create the most intense and electric movie experience I've encountered in a very long time. The very last scene had my heart pounding and I could hardly breathe. The performances, direction, editing...everything was stellar. I had to watch it twice, back to back, it was that good.Do yourself a favor - ignore the naysayers that are too preoccupied with the bullying. They won't ever get this film, so don't pay them any mind. Watch this and I assure you that you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching the performance was OK but what about the script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes the music was good, and it was lovely to watch how it is made. I love jazz, I used to play jazz drums, so for me I subjectively loved the drum scenes. However, there is something odd about it. Nothing has come to conclusion as it should be. I would expect more from the personal details of the main character. I do not even remember his name right now. I can watch many videos on you tube on excellent jazz drummers. What does this movie add to that? Nothing. I could not even watch the applause which I was expecting at the end, or a contract, or some words from the father, or a nice closure from the ex- girlfriend. I give it a 6 for the sake of performance, but not the sake of script or directing. The characters could go much deeper on their lives. Maybe this movie could be a little longer to go into those details which make it a movie more than a drum performance video.Very forgettable, when compared to Fame as an example...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is doing neither. The story itself is pretty simple and even lame, but somehow it didn't bother me and that is probably due to the fact you can't stay indifferent for any of the characters. The actors put down a pretty strong performance there. They move you and you start wondering at their motives. What drives them? And each beat on the drums brings you closer in answering this question, without rushing, without dragging.There is no CGI in this movie and no action, but the visuals are still, in their own way, breath taking. The atmosphere brought together with the spotlights and the close ups of the instruments is awesome. It makes you want play yourself.Sound wise this movie is, for a lack of a better word. Perfect.

		<fullReview>This movie maybe one of the most intense movies I have ever seen! The film gets extremely dramatic in places and has some incredibly powerful scenes especially between Miles Tellers and J.K. Simmons who both delivers exceptionally good performances in this movie. Whiplash is basically about a teacher and a student who both strives for greatness in the art of music and are willing to go to extremes to get there. The result is an exciting, entertaining and thrilling motion picture with one breathtaking, electrifying and blood-tingling (use of that last word intended) final scene which ranks among my favorites. I definitely recommend this film to everybody that enjoys great performances by two lead actors and a gripping drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand some of the reviews on here. So what if you're a jazz player of 30 years or attend the 'best jazz school in the country', what has that got to do with film-making?This is a FICTIONAL film. If this were done to the letter of the law and J.K. Simmons played a character mirroring a real-life music school instructor then it would be the most boring film ever. It's called creative license. It's what makes a film worth while going to see. People expect way too much its almost embarrassing. If a perfect jazz band is what you're after log onto itunes and buy one.For Miles Teller, although drumming from a young age, to spend hours a day preparing for this movie, and play this well as an amateur player it should be commended not criticized! J.K. Simmons' performance as 'Fletcher' is Oscar worthy. The editing and sound is phenomenal, and credit to all other members of the band.It might not be perfect musically (although not being a professional like some reviewers on here I cannot comment it seems), but to my ears its a masterpiece and as this is a film and not a jazz album I am judging it on how it plays as a film. Which to me is sensational. I have watched the final scene about 15 times and am still mesmerized by it.A huge thumbs up from me, and credit to Damien Chazelle on persevering to get this made into a feature form a short. 10/10 from me</fullReview>

You must see this in a theater to get the benefit of the sound - which is key - and the immersion of being in a room where the story is the only thing going on without distractions. Simmons and Miles "inhabited" their roles. The tension in this story began in the first five minutes, and did not relent until the credits rolled. As the lights came up, we three viewers turned to each other and said "WOW" simultaneously. We went to this film with no expectations, but had read other reviews that were glowing. Based on them alone, we took a chance. SO MUST YOU.The acting is so fierce at one moment, and then so subtle in the next. These characters are extreme studies of what is takes to be "one of the greatest". You will be thinking about it for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worlds best puppeteer revels in being a puppet in the end...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash I saw Whiplash the other day and I loved it, but on second viewing I felt I had to write something about it because I loved it even more.On first viewing I was mostly convinced that Simmons played a villain. A soulless, malicious serpent and I found humour in his character which was vital as it would have lost understanding from a modern audience without an obvious likability in his character, even if it was through his sudden outbursts, mocking tones, and his hilarious flip from humouring a little girl to entering the room of musicians with 'Alright c***suckers! Listen up'. The second viewing Fletcher became more of a hero, who only shared this egotistical sense of satisfaction in the end with Andrew and us the audience. To everyone else they are both equally as mad as each other. They come from the same cloth, similar to a Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday in There Will Be Blood? or a Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix in the Master? in fact is Paul Thomas Anderson sure he didn't write this screenplay?? There is so much life in this film, the music, camera work, story is all fantastic. But I felt so drawn in by its main protagonist, Miles Teller, who (to put it bluntly) smashed it! I feel for the young man not being nominated for more awards but if this is anything to go by, he was an incredible future ahead of him. Teller played a closed but driven individual whom the audience could gain sympathy for. He reminded me a little of Jesse Eisenberg in the Social Network. Both fuelled by a desire that went borderline 'God Syndrome'. The parallels between both girlfriend 'break up' scenes in those movies were clear, but in no way felt like plagiarism. They both highlighted one key fact for young men driven only by success? Relationships MUST come second. Or at least that's what people are led to believe if they want to achieve the greatest success. On second viewing you can see the cogs in motion in Fletcher's mind. He becomes less a villain in my view and more a dedicated practitioner, a master in his craft. Fletcher pulls every manipulative trick out of his arsenal to find the individuals that possess the potential to become a great. If it means cutting the ones he doubts, so be it. He even tugs at the heartstrings when he tells the students about his past prodigy who had tragically died in a car crash. The crocodile tears fell and it's hard to know if the tear was from his guilt or to manipulate the musicians. When we later find out the student died from a suicide.. questions start to enter your head. Did he lie because he feared losing reputation or his job, or did he lie just to push Andrew? Or... was it because the closest he has been to having his Charlie Parker is over and he is sad for his own ego and sense of personal achievement. The latter is probably the best bet. The story used throughout the film about Charlie Parker having a symbol thrown at his head was a catalyst for the on screen action. Fletcher says:'Imagine if he didn't throw the symbol at him that night.. he just said...don't worry.. good job... would he have worked as hard as he did? Or would he have just thought.. I did a good job.. and that be the end of it... there are no words more damaging in the English language as 'good job'' Is he right? Is the acceptance of mediocrity crippling the world's future for creating TRUE masters in craft? Maybe...The constant reference to this story not only gave support to the way Fletcher conducted his business, but it came into full fruition in the final scene when Fletcher threw his own metaphorical 'symbol' by putting Andrew in a nightmare situation. Alone on stage in a venue that could launch him into stardom and Fletcher appears to set him up to fail by making him improvise a new track. Andrew tries in vain to keep up with the up and down tempo of the song. It was almost like this song was written just for this moment. It's as if Fletcher planned it, maybe he knew Andrew was going to walk past the club that night... I wouldn't put it past his mastery. 'I guess you don't have it.' Some of the final lines spoken by the hero/villain of the film (depending how you look at it), leading to Andrew stepping up and creating his moment in history.In the end, it was Andrew who would be the conductor, taking control and making Fletcher dance to his rhythm and work to his tempo. Fletcher abode. Of course he did. Even though this moment may trick the audience into thinking it was Andrews's moment of redemption against the evil wizard, it was actually the moment Fletcher had been waiting his entire life for. He was part of that moment and could finally say it was all worth it. This was powerful cinema! And the Oscar goes to....Lastly, The eye contact and the glimpse of a smile from Fletcher spoke volumes at the films climax. The subtext read 'You get it, you did it, we did it, you are my Charlie Parker'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young director Damien Chazelle's second feature, about a talented and ambitious young jazz drummer, takes us into the cutthroat, struggling and hardworking world of top-notch jazz musicians. The story is linear and simple, but offers so much insight into that world. The two actors selected to portray the main characters, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, are perfect; they were meant for the roles. They get into the shoes of the characters with such ease. Even the few scenes with side characters, like Andrew's dad, girlfriend and fellow drummers, are quite interesting.The story is mainly about passion, ambition, and desperation to achieve one's goal. It also sheds light on the things one decide to sacrifice in order to achieve their goal.Positive reinforcement vs negative criticism, which is more effective? This is a debate that has been going on for ages. The former might work for some, while the latter might work for others. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and his/her upbringing; everyone responds to different things.The story is packed with humour and inspiring moments. Simmons' dialogues are just fantastic; it might seem vulgar to some, but they're just hilarious. Other than the actual instruments being played, no background score is used at all; this works quite well for the movie. Nothing seems staged, everything takes place with such natural ease.And all this leads up to a foottappingly mesmerising climax. The open-ended approach was good. And the film's topics beg to be discussed and debated among groups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to aim for a little perspective here. If you click on my user name you'll see that this, when posted, will be the 2650 th film that I've reviewed on IMDb; a little over two and a half thousand movies may seem a fair amount but it's really a drop in the ocean. I joined IMDb in 2003 and became active more or less immediately so now we can factor in another figure, two and a half thousand films in eleven years. but we're still miles off because I was already an adult when I joined IMDb. I was probably carried into my first cinema by one or both of my parents around the age of three and by age five I was able to distinguish genres, actors, etc. By ten I had - for a layman - a pretty good working knowledge of how the things worked. I watched most stuff and good distinguish between Warners, Fox, Metro, Columbia, Paramount, RKO etc, with the best of them. I had little taste for horror, sci-fi. didn't mind the occasional Western but was more at home with mellers, straight drama, comedies, musicals, bio-pics if they dealt with songwriters (Night And Day), performers, (The Jolson Story) or , peripherally, jazz (The Benny Goodman Story, High Society). By the time I penned my first review for IMDb in 2003 I had seen, conservatively, some 5,000 films; and yet I've still only reviewed barely half that number. That's because of a self-imposed rule: I don't trust my memory so any and all films I say PRIOR to 2003 are off limits UNLESS they turn up on television, on DVD, or at a Revival House. Here's where perspective comes in: Whiplash is, no contest, the BEST film with Jazz as a background I have ever seen! Immediately, I sense, I am in trouble with some of you; you, in the second row, the lady with the green scarf. You are, I feel, itching to set me straight and cry "But Whiplash isn't about Jazz, it' s about Power, it's about Control, it's about Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter ... Stop right there, did I actually say that Whiplash was ABOUT Jazz? No, I did not. I was careful NOT to say so: What I said was 'the best film with jazz as a background'. And I'm happy to stand by that. What we have here are two exceptional acting performances, one merely brilliant and one - in the words of Duke Ellington - beyond excellence, praise, category, any and ev'rything (Okay, Duke, you didn't actually say that back in the day, but you WOULDDA if you'd see Mr. J.K. Simmons, you wouldda, believe me. See, what we have here is a young, sullen-looking Elvis lookalike locking horns with a Col Tom Parker mentor/controller and all we have to do is stand well back. Seems those naysayers were right after all, it's not about jazz.</fullReview>

J.K Simmons was fantastic, taking on a psychotic temper-mental music instructor who comes off beyond intimidating and all the more blood- curdling. Miles Teller delivers a surprising career flipping performance and handles the role perfectly, as he is driven to succeed and dedicated to excel at his admission, the intensity put into his character is overwhelming. The film takes many unexpected twists and turns, and overall comes off a very powerful and intriguing experience, all thanks to the unique style of direction and striking cinematography. The film offers moving characters and hidden life values throughout, despite its fairly basic plot you will be surprised with what this film is capable of. Whiplash was sharply written and precisely acted. No characters were miscast, no scenes bored me. It's easily one of the best 2014 movies so far, and without a doubt an Oscar nomination is well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' asks, "How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect?". The answer lies in you, clearly on what you define as perfection. In Chazelle's World, perfection is ruthless, brutal &amp; life-threatening. But, despite its hardcore approach, 'Whiplash' is a film that's worth watching, thanks to its mostly tight screenplay &amp; bravura performances. 'Whiplash' Synopsis: A promising young drummer enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.'Whiplash' narrates a frightening tale of a mentor &amp; his student. The anger &amp; ambition between the primary characters is lethal &amp; hardcore. You watch a monster of a coach behaving inhumanly, while the student aims only to achieve goal, come what may. The thriving journey of both the characters, is commendably structured. However, Chazelle's Screenplay gets slightly monotonous after a point. The repeated confrontations get a bit boring, especially towards the second-hour. However, Chazelle delivers a highly impressive culmination to the story. His Direction is sharp. Cinematography &amp; Editing are good. One of the prime reasons why 'Whiplash' works, is because of its performances. J. K. Simmons is electrifying as the fearsome instructor, displaying rage &amp; power, magnificently. Miles Teller is unbelievable. He takes upon a role that's challenging &amp; he translates the part into a career-making performance. He's extra-ordinary. Simmons &amp; Teller, both, are Oscar-Worthy!On the whole, despite some flaws in its screenplay, 'Whiplash' deserves a watch for its tense proceedings &amp; fabulous performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical thriller? This one's hard to categorize. One might say it's the exact opposite of an inspirational teacher movie, like Goodbye Mr. Chips. Miles Teller plays an eager drumming student at a music conservatory. He captures the attention of the head honcho of the school's peak band crew, J.K. Simmons. A normal person would wish they hadn't, because the guy's a total psycho. One wrong note or beat and the guy'll be roaring every curse word in the book at you. He's a legend, though, so no one would ever dare stand up to him. Teller is not a normal person - his dream is to be one of the best of all time, so he tries his damnedest to take Simmons' rage in stride. It's not easy. This film is simply gripping. Teller is amazingly focused. One ought not to disregard his physical performance, either. While the editing probably helped him survive this, he really is going to town on those drums. Simmons gives a performance for the ages. I wanted to murder this dude. As a supporting character, the film doesn't get too deeply into what his deal is, but the little bits that are shown are fascinating. The finale is absolutely outstanding. One of the year's best, no doubt.</fullReview>

This is a movie i'll guess for the winter weeks. www.explosm.net/comics/3876/ is a funny comic which is also about the movie in a way. The movie is one of the few when we are talking about a really milked out genre. I liked the movie, there were not many jokes and so i think the power of the movie is in the movie. Sometimes there are movies which are good because the jokes, music and dramatic story are nicely combined. This movie doesn't need a lot of humor and still is great. The performing of Simmons was really frightful and he scared me, no surprise he got the big prize. Excuses for my bad English grammar, sorry Greets from Amsterdam</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its every true everyone can't be an actor specially like J. K Simmons. This movie makes one feel the levels of hardship and mental agony one goes through in the process of achieving perfection. At times, Simmons scares you with this brutal way of dealing as an instructor. Miles Teller, is just incredible in replying his feeling when Simmons interrupts in the way of achieving his dreams. There are consequences when director makes audiences to feel everyone needs to be extra determined and focused when it comes in making dreams come true. Its an absolute journey of movie experience which enthralls you full time and makes you feel everything comes at a cost and their is no shortcut for SUCCESS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anybody out there has a passion for something, don't let anybody else take it away from you or push you to the edge, no matter what. If you're good at something, do it. There a lot of people out there who will provoke you endlessly and make your blood boil, so do not give them that benefit. This film made me believe in that fact once more, and took my breath away. Anybody with a dream, an intention, a vision of their future, has to see this motion picture event!!!! This is not a musical, this is not just a movie about drumming, DO NOT walk in with that misconception. WHIPLASH is a both electrifying and provocative well-paced drama that asks "what is the true definition of motivation" or as the AFI see it "What is the line between mentor and monster?". I urge you to check it out!!!!! If you're not at the edge of your seat while watching this once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece, something is wrong with you!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edge of your seat intensity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read my full review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2015/02/whiplash.htmlOh man. I just saw Whiplash and I am still reeling. I can't remember ever having such an electrifying experience watching a movie (I swear I wrote that before finding the poster on the left with the word "ELECTRIFYING" in all caps). I was riveted, on the edge of my seat strung up with excitement by this thing. It'll have you on your toes, sometimes shaking with anxiety and other times bursting with anger and then joyously applauding at the end. Whiplash indeed.Maybe it's because I had a taste for how nasty it was going to get, but I was just wiggling with anxiety, half anticipating/half dreading when the shoe would drop. And once it does for the first time you just never know when it's going to hit again. JK Simmon's performance is just gnarly and intense. He plays a man with a single-minded, unbending vision: create truly great jazz musicians, no matter the cost. For him, this means pushing them to the brink of their own destruction. The ends justify the means. He makes the tiger mom look like a cuddly kitten. At one point he pits three drummers against each other for hours on end. He dismisses the rest of the band while the three battle it out one after another and you can see Fletcher is in his element, relishing the opportunity to just dig in, give in to his rage, and make them suffer it out. Andrew plays until his hands are bleeding. This movie has more sweat and blood-stained drum sets then a Tool concert.Writer/Director Damian Chazelle (who just turned 30) reportedly based the movie on his own experience dealing with an overbearing band teacher in high school. I did band all through school and even had a teacher that had some mildly-similar elements. (Also, did I mention the director completed this movie by the time he was 29?!? So impressive.) Fletcher's character is certainly extreme, with some complaining that it is unrealistically so, but it is brilliantly carried out. Yeah, we know that life as a jazz student isn't' exactly like this - so what? Keep watch for when he takes off his jacket, usually a sign he's doing what he thinks is his most important work. Miles Teller's performance of Andrew show's great range as well as his character transitions from a young hopeful pup to a cocky upstart, then a broken down hound dog and finally an experienced wolf that, although not a master, has a couple of lessons under his belt. Now that he's been through the first few bumps he's more dedicated then ever.The movie really asks two questions: What does it really take to achieve greatness? And then the follow up, is it worth it? The final act is exhilarating, jump-out-of-your-seat kind of stuff. I do like jazz, especially the type in this movie. But I think even if you know nothing and care nothing for jazz, the performances, the visuals, the editing, and the resulting energy and dynamics of the final scenes will get anyone going. Even as you see the relationship between Andrew and Fletcher change and then change again during an extended musical sequence, you never know right till the last moment how it's going to end and what it means. And even then the movie still leaves it up to the viewer's interpretation. Maybe the answers that you think the movie is giving to those questions says more about you then about the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pathway to perfection is not an easy road to travel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many reasons to dislike this movie. It shows a teenager being psychologically and physically abused. It shows art being portrayed as something painful. It shows someone abusing his authority. It shows the collapse of a romantic relationship, causing deeply hurt feelings. The story in general comes off as being contrived. Yet, this movie is great. It is highly entertaining, the reason being its theme: what is an artist supposed to do to satisfy his quest for perfection? In this case, the metaphor for perfection is Buddy Rich, who was a famous American jazz drummer. In this movie, Rich's work is used as a standard for artistic perfection, in this case, artistic expression through the playing of percussion instruments. The structure of the plot is simple: a music teacher, Fletcher, wants to bring out the brilliance of his student, Andrew. He believes that the best way to accomplish this through humiliation which will test the level of the student's commitment to achieving greatness and perfection. The student becomes the tool through which the teacher can vicariously achieve perfection. For this story is about the teacher. He is the principal character, the one around whom the action takes place. The teacher is a metaphor for all the artists in the world who are striving for something that they themselves cannot achieve, and so seek it out in others. To bring it out is the challenge, and that generates conflict, as the teacher must first break down the student's resistance, which is a painful and risky process. Painful because it involves elements of abuse; risky because he may lose the student. The acting is superb. J. K. Simmons's gives a terrifically powerful performance as the teacher, Fletcher, and Miles Teller gives a tremendous performance as the student, Andrew. The story moves at a brisk pace and achieves moments of extreme intensity that alone make the movie worth watching. True, the movie includes brief but graphic scenes of physical violence perpetrated against a teenager, but this takes place within the context of an extremely emotional and volatile relationship which drives the story, and without which the story may lose some of it strength.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. A tight script with two nasty, dueling main characters. The teacher/student relationship has been explored many times before, but in this movie the twist is that both are unpleasant in their own way.Both Teller (as Andrew the student) and Simmons (as Fletcher the teacher) were very good and Simmons did deserve the Oscar.For once, I loved that I did not need to pick a side but I could just enjoy the ride and see how these two ambitious, arrogant and toxic personalities were going to hurt (or help?) each other. Also, I do not usually like open endings, but in this case I found it very appropriateThe music is great, as it was expected. The photography is also good and the story does not drag along for a single minute, as it happens far too often nowadays. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Acting and Energy, but ridiculously misplaced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I'd like to say I am a musician and I do appreciate jazz. That being said, I do like the music in this film. But that's about the only thing I did like.The story is very original, but ridiculously unrealistic and far-fetched. Honestly, if a college professor verbally, and even more importantly, PHYSICALLY abused students, they would be fired at the snap of a finger. Tenured or not, their career would be over.The acting is extremely good. J.K. Simmons did a very good job. But the energy was badly misplaced. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a JAZZ TEACHER AND CONDUCTOR! NOT A MARINE DRILL SERGEANT! There is no need for that amount of intensity, no matter how prestigious the school may be.And honestly, who would break up with a great, beautiful girl to focus on trying to impress an abusive teacher? I wouldn't. It's just dumb.My biggest problem with this film is the car crash scene. He got t-boned by an 18 wheeler and overturned. He should have been concussed and bones should have been broken. Instead, he's fine and decides to go perform. Stupid.At the end, Neimann is kicked out of school and Fletcher is out of a job, but for some reason, even with all that bad blood, they decided to get together and perform, which was just a setup by Fletcher to humiliate and embarrass Neimann. Highly unlikely. But then he kicks ass on drums and impresses Fletcher? That's stupid, too! IT VALIDATES ALL OF THE ABUSE FLETCHER PERPETRATED IN THE FIRST PLACE! It just ends with such a horrible message.It's a good film, just not my taste. Well acted, but everything about it's intensity is badly misplaced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWhiplash is a very good film that is carried by the outstanding performances of J.K. Simmons &amp; Miles Teller. The film overall is completely engaging although at times it is slightly over dramatic/unrealistic. I really enjoyed the catchy music themes throughout.The parts I didn't think went well with the overall tone of the film was the crash scene which seemed totally unnecessary and extremely unrealistic that he would get out the car, then still get there on time and play in the state he was in. I'm pretty sure that J.K. Simmons' character wouldn't be able to get away with such abusive ways and I was expecting the other drummers to take a stand together. I would liked more of a back story because the characters seemed great, the final scene was breathtaking but left slightly unresolved.It is a very engaging film with outstanding acting performances (I'm backing J.K. Simmons for the Oscar and also felt Miles Teller deserved a nomination) but I felt there was a few missed opportunities. Still I would highly recommend the film and I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've seen recently. Period. Both actors deliver their guts on their performances, and the awesome music is just a theme for their intricate and always ambiguous relationship. That is clearly the main focus of the movie.How far can you go to achieve greatness? How damaged can you become as an individual once you choose a path nobody understands? Well, when Andrew decides he wants to be a legend, the only obstacle in front of him seems to be his music teacher. This guy also demands perfection, but nonetheless makes it clear from day one that Andrew is not there. And most likely never will be. He's just another student, another ordinary scrub who will probably be discarded when someone slightly better appears to take his place. After being humiliated several times, Andrew just keeps pushing...pushing through physical pain, self-imposed limitations and through the very presence of Fletcher himself. Nobody will stop him, not even a crap teacher that thinks too much of his own ego. The paradox is this: who's got the larger ego? The teacher who cannot find a legend or the student who wants to become one?This toxic yet productive relationship is just a bliss to watch, as both actors stand out on each scene they're together, developing a mind blowing chemistry until the final climax. And the end is just superb.This movie is a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tests the Viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performance that Miles Teller gives in Damien Chazelle's new film "Whiplash" reminded me a lot of Robert De Niro's in "Raging Bull". They both play tenacious, unrelenting characters and do so in a way that can't be forgotten and stays with the viewer long after the movie's over. They may be pursuing different things, De Niro with boxing and Teller with drumming, but they're each after the same goal: greatness. And that's what this film is all about, reaching a goal that is relative to the person trying to achieve it. In this case, it centers around a guy who never feels understood. He's attending the most prestigious music school in the country and is constantly working to be 'one of the greats'. Who, in his eyes, is someone like Buddy Rich. Then unexpectedly, he's given a chance to prove his chops on the renowned studio band instructed by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). He's soon met with Fletcher's abusive teaching tactics and is continuously tested under pressure. The question is, can he withstand.It tests the psyche of a young man and shows how far a person will go for something they love and want to do for the rest of their life. That being said, it's a harsh movie. The audience is thrown right into the pressure cooker along with Teller, and if you're not ready for it, it can be unsettling and scary. But that's one of the main reasons why I liked it. Not only does it test the main character, it tests the viewer. You also can't deny the masterful performances on display and finesse that the director brings along with them. Needless to say, this is a must-see. If I had seen it in 2014, it would've undoubtedly made my top ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Constantly we hear about the lack of substance modern entertainment contains. This movie defies this generalization. Whiplash is excellently constructed, beautifully filmed, and the actors achieve a rarely reached level of skill, which collectively make it worthy of nine stars alone. However, it is Whiplash's display of the cost of greatness, it's insight into the nature of sacrifice and ambition, which make it a ten star film. J.K. Simmons role personifies the aspect of human ambition centered around seeking greatness at all costs, while Miles Teller shows the struggle of attempting to balance the losses.

		<shortDescription>Astounding, intense &amp; damn near perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Just wow! A young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller) enrolls at a prestigious music conservatory. Plucked from a rehearsal room, he is given the opportunity to play with the studio band under the tutelage of aggressively driven band leader Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a man with a vicious mouth, extreme methods and an obsession with driving his students way beyond breaking point in order to achieve their potential and find absolute perfection.Perhaps my greatest joy with Whiplash is that just a few weeks ago I was barely aware of its existence and deliberately knew little about it as I took my seat in the screening room. There is something very special about being blindsided without expectation, and blindsided I was. My screening companion and I felt exhausted by the end and were still discussing animatedly it an hour later.I knew I was in the presence of greatness within minutes of Whiplash. From the opening scenes of Andrew rehearsing and Fletcher observing, passing judgment and scything him down with sharpened tongue and looks that slayed, it was abundantly clear that writer/director Damien Chazelle was on a mission to hammer us repeatedly with verbal blades, withering looks and an intensity that other directors would kill to produce.There are insufficient superlatives to express the power and effect of Whiplash and Chazelle's achievement. At least four times in the course of the screening my heart sank as Chazelle took us towards an alleyway that was predictable and certain to kick a five-star experience into another four-star, notable also-ran. Each time, he turned it around beautifully, steadfastly refusing to take the convenient route, instead aiming another kick at the tender parts, slamming us with the unexpected and leaving us to reel or look on in wide-eye admiration.His brilliance is in the subtlety, the sharp cracks of dialogue that slice through the opposing character's confidence; it is in the reactions of the onlookers that we see once and only once, never over-egging a moment; it is in the blood, sweat and tears, literally, that coat the symbols; it is in the music, the performance and the slam of hand and stick on metal and skin and it is in the accompanying venomous glares that scream more eloquently than a thousand words could ever achieve.Until last night, I didn't really 'get' jazz. After 107 minutes of Whiplash that passed in a heart-pounding, hair prickling moment, I can't get enough. If there had been a second screening I'd have put myself through the exhaustion again in an instant.When the Oscar nominations are revealed tomorrow, I doubt if the Academy will honour Whiplash with a Best Film nod but I sincerely hope it is in the mix at least for director and editing. As for J.K. Simmons, his nomination and win as Best Supporting Actor are probably as much a certainty as Daniel Day Lewis was for Best Actor in 2013 for Lincoln. If Simmons doesn't clean up 90% of the principal awards and see his already superb career take a whole new trajectory after this, I'll eat my hat, and yours and every one I can find in the village! Good? Whiplash is damn near perfect and J.K. Simmons is a major reason for it! For those who know J.K. Simmons as 'that guy from?', no longer is he going to be the go-to guy for irascible bosses and supporting characters. There is an effortlessness to his commanding performance as the teacher his students fear but whose validation they crave. Powerful, venomous, controlling, manipulative, vindictive? Fletcher is at turns both horrible and, perhaps, a genius. J.K. Simmons' utter ownership of the character pokes an electrified finger into every nerve prompting us to hate, fear and, just maybe, respect and admire a man who walks a razor sharp line between obsessive insanity and genius, all the time staring his victims in the eye, screaming into their face and daring them to take him on.On the receiving end of much of his venom is Andrew, played with equal measure and control by Teller. It is a solid performance that meets Simmons' all the way. More than that is Teller's performance at the drums that astound. He plays with his hands and his fists and his mind and his emotions and every ounce of fluid he can ring out of every available pore in his body. At the risk of sounding repetitive, wow. Just wow! I recently reviewed Big Eyes, a true story that really didn't warrant a feature-length big screen outing. Conversely, Whiplash is an event I wish I could make a reality so that I could experience it in the flesh repeatedly.Chazelle has crafted a film that is pretty much perfect. I fear it will receive a limited audience because, on paper, the premise doesn't blow anyone away: Teacher gives student a hard time; student struggles to find himself... But back in 1994, a little prison movie was released that was badly marketed, garnered seven Oscar nominations, didn't win a single one and bombed at the box office. It was only word of mouth and the DVD release that made the world sit up en masse and notice that The Shawshank Redemption for what it is. Perhaps Whiplash will go through a similar experience, though I suspect Oscar won't make the same mistake this time around.The year is young but Whiplash is the best cinematic outing from it so far. See it, see it now and prepare for something remarkable. To steal a line, "I'll count you in?" For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Expectations, Rather A Moderate Impression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting for this movie for long time, as I am a drummer of sorts myself, I like music, I like drumming films, and this one seemed to be a great achievement. After all, there are all those raving reviews and blazing cheers made to this spectacular piece of cinematography. Well, yes, I have watched it, and what I can say? It is very over-rated. Yes, both Simmons and Teller seem to give very impressive performances, and yes, Teller is A Good drummer with neat stroke, precise beat, gentle swing and delicate accents. But then, he does not convince as an actor. The love story is the biggest disappointment and the greatest weakness of the film. It simply passes by. leaving me cold and unaffected. Was that dubious drumming achievement worth losing a beautiful girl? It was not. Simmons is surely the crowning top of the production, but then, he is too sadistic, too dry, too pedantic or a jazz aficionado, he seems more like a drill sergeant than a genial conductor. The final solo? To long and too drawn out for a satisfying coda. Kinda cool, but tiresome and yup, dragging. It is a film for a single watch and quick oblivion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-Blowing Jazz Music Harmonising with Some of the Most Amazing Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miles Teller being an up and coming actor along with JK Simmons who is a well-established underrated actor, whose performances have often been spell-bounding, together have made one of the best movies I've ever seen in the music genre (and I've seen Inside Llewyn Davis). Miles, who plays Andrew, a young drummer studying at one of the top schools of music, shows us his passion in every frame, every single time, whilst delivering a performance. His anger, temper, rise, fall, and everything else in between worked so well with the movie, that he caught my attention with every single frame passing by. As time passes, I am sure he will take the industry by storm along with all the other young up-and-coming actors and actresses. Simmons, who plays Fletcher, delivers a performance worthy of his name. Actually I might actually go ahead and say that this is the best I've ever seen him act. He convinces me completely that Fletcher is an insane perfectionist, so much so that he can forget that the performers were even human, until he gets the beat, tempo and rhythm he needs. Insanity suited his character and he delivered that in an extraordinary fashion. Both the actors showed their passion on screen, but I must give props to the director, who made the film go at the right pace, pushed the actors to show insane amounts of passion, and not allow the audience to divert their attention from these captivating performances. I love jazz music, but don't have much knowledge. But whatever I saw in this movie and heard as well, made me love it even more. Whiplash and Caravan were two genius compositions, and they were so amazingly beautiful. I actually don't know the right adjectives here to help me show how much I loved the score. All the other characters also played their part quite well making this movie one well-rounded show of art. All in all, this is one movie that even the non-jazz lovers will love. If you want passion on screen, you see it delivered in aces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you have seen black swan then you are going to watch it again but this time the main actor is male and instead of bale this time it is jazz or should say only drums !!! The acting is on the top that is for sure, but the plot is sometimes very unrealistic so it is difficult to believe what is going on !!! After time the music becomes annoying (I mean really annoying) The movie is a musical yes but that does not mean it has to have music all the time sometimes it is too long and drums are not to instrument that you want to listen all the time !!! Anyways for me it was another black swan movie which was a pointless boring movie, this movie was way better that black swan but still not a good movie !!! I gave it 2 out of 10 just because of the acting nothing else !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>choose skill and elitism over life - sincerely from Harvard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle , the writer/director of Whiplash is a Harvard graduate.If you keep in mind this trivia , while watching the movie , things can be explained better. Representing his directorial debut , he chose to create a film where the notion that getting good at something , having a career , conquer the greatest skill , is what counts most in life. It counts more than human interactions and socializing , friends and family. More than life itself. This is the message he felt like sharing with us in his first feature.Such a wrong " life meaning" can only be shown via a questionable and improbable sequence of shots. In other words , what this movie basically is , all in all.The movie fails strictly and only because of the story. I can overlook all other parts but not the ludicrous story chosen to be presented.First of it is an ugly story .I've never seen a film depicting rise to greatness in an uglier manner , unless some film about Hitler perhaps.And even if i skip its ugliness , we don't really see that much stuff about anything. The plot says its about the relationship between teacher/student ?What relationship? There was no depth and progress , development of some kind at all human interactions shown in the film. Some started to build , but then they stopped. I thought how Karate Kid ( the original ) showed in a beautiful way a relationship of teacher/student ,and boy-likes girl.Expect no such development quality in Whiplash.There is no depth in this film. Its all in your face. The same sentence over and over " i want greatness" .As far as the music goes , don't expect learning much about music through this supposedly " film about a jazz drummer " .I cant recall a single soundtrack , and no music information but for some quick words on Buddy Rich , one of the greatest jazz drummers.We see no relationship of any kind. Family , girl , friends , and even the teacher , there are just a few scenes ... nothing that would remotely be adequate to show a nice progression , for us the viewers to get involved and feel for the characters. The teacher character , as mentioned in other comments , suits more as an army general , but even then he'd be unrealistic and just wrong.The guy is just mean , beyond reality. It is mind-blowing that the people involved even allowed such a character in this kind of film.The Miles Teller character is okay in many ways. But for the vital one , that he chooses the superficial greatness over life , which is throughout the movie , the only topic adequately shown . At first i was waiting for the movie to get somewhere , it did start good , i wanted steady development , i wanted the character to learn , to share , to give to others his views , get better in life. Some good moral , you know. Chazelle didn't feel for a good moral though. He felt like introducing to us , meaningless , superficial characters that never learn. That would be okay if the ultimate film's point was that this is a wrong path , as any person with his head on his shoulders would think.But no , instead we get a savage film of selfishness and sadism. And that this is the road to take. There is no turn , no twist in this part.You can tell the direction comes from a guy who just started making films. Too many steady shots. The acting is alright. Nothing great , just fine though. I do hope that the one guy who learns something about life is the Director/writer of this film. Not the viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are multiple reasons why Whiplash comes to the Toronto International Film Festival with palpable anticipation. The film was showcased at this year's Sundance Film Festival where it went on to both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize award for best dramatic film. Actor Miles Teller was recently named as one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch and J.K. Simmons, well, he's J.K. freakin' Simmons. So the gathering audience at the afternoon screening was primed, ready and eager for the expected greatness about to be screened.Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman, a determined 19-year-old drummer who is pushed to his emotional limits by his new instructor Terence (J.K. Simmons). Terence has a reputation for being the best, but mentoring under his tutelage comes at a price. Terrence is no Mr. Miyagi. He is ruthless in his barrage of verbal sewage that attempts to push his students towards the greatness he believes they can achieve. Newcomer Andrew is no spared his ire as evidenced in this heated reaction when Andrew can't find Terence's tempo, , "Were you rushing or were you dragging? If you deliberately sabotage my band, I will gut you like a pig. Oh my dear God - are you one of those single tear people? You are a worthless pancy-ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year old girl!" There is no "Wash-on, Wash-off" PG-ness here.Being mean is in Terence's nature. And his assault on his young protégés is sometimes hard to watch. Think of Gunnery Sargent Hartman in Full Metal Jacket and imagine the persistent yelling and abuse for an entire film. Throughout, Andrew remains resilient. His goal to become a drummer of future legend has him shun friends and family. He's all alone and the uncomfortable Terence bond that he creates is all that he has.Audiences will be unsure of where Whiplash is headed. Are we headed for a triumphant climax where the drill sergeant-esque nature of the instructor pays off in a musical crescendo closing that brings audiences to their feet? Or will the pressure and barrage of verbal bullying take effect with a shocking tragedy that spotlights the harassment of our children. Be sure, this is no Mr. Holland's Opus and the hate and evil that Terence employs travels from opening to closing credits without reprieve.Writer-director Damien Chazelle does a stunning job of keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering when or if a climatic breakdown will occur. We watch in awe as Andrew gets pushed and pushes himself until his hands bleed after hours of relentless play. We feel as uncomfortable for his situation as we feel trapped in finding a solution to Andrew's goal.The concluding act only further exemplifies the events and personalities that took us to the stage and the audience cheered in Andrew's defiance while gasping at his situation.The result is a fantastic film that is sure to be considered for Best Picture at next year's Academy Award's. It is a rousing crowd pleaser will have audiences clapping with hands they will want washed of Terence's abuse. J.K. Simmons has the role he was meant to play and his character was not only brilliant but could rank as one of the best cinematic villains of all-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was around a year late to watching Whiplash because I honestly wasn't drawn in by the idea of a film about drumming, it didn't seem like my thing. After seeing many great things about this film I gave it a go and it was one of the best decisions I made. Whiplash has fantastic characters with two that absolutely stand out, Miles Teller's character Andrew is played brilliantly and I was rooting for him all the way through without a doubt. J.K Simmons brings an outstanding and intense performance and for me was one of the best supporting roles I have ever seen. The films tension is fantastic and there are so many gripping parts and even near the end I was sat drumming to myself because I was so hyped and excited. Overall the film is fantastic with great performances, great directing and a gripping story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whiplash" is cinematic adrenalin. It is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama. Damien Chazelle has taken a relatively unadventurous subject like the relationship between a music student and his teacher and turned it into a thriller built on a social perspective of what it takes to make it in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat world. How far are you willing to push yourself to succeed? How far are you willing to push someone else to force them on the path to success? Carried by two electric performances, "Whiplash" is as breathless as a drum solo, rising and falling just as the hopes and dreams of its protagonist climb and crash.A young man named Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is practicing late at night at his New York music school, when his drumming catches the ear of the infamous Mr. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the most important teacher at the school and the conductor for its most important jazz band. Fletcher pauses, listens, barks a few orders at the young man, and moves on, seemingly dissatisfied with what he heard. Andrew goes back to his routine class band, telling his dad that his opportunity to move up probably passed him by.Of course, Fletcher's dismissal of Andrew in that first scene is just the first of many examples of what could be called his "teaching style." Fletcher likes to tell the story of how Jo Jones threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head one night when he messed up, thereby pushing him to the breaking point at which he became Bird. Without that cymbal, would music history be the same? Would Charlie Parker have gone home, refined, practiced and driven himself without the threat of not just failure but physical violence? Fletcher uses that kind of barbarous technique on his students: throwing furniture, calling Andrew names, playing mind games and physically torturing him with repetitive drum solos until he bleeds on the kit. But that blood feeds his musical passion. And Andrew blossoms, asking out the cute girl he's been afraid to talk to before, and taking first chair in the most important band at the most important music school in the country.Miles Teller, so great in breakthrough roles in "Rabbit Hole" and "The Spectacular Now," does the best work of his young career here as Andrew. He is naturally apprehensive, but he also knows he has a drive, a passion, a skill that is unique. Teller walks that line, never faltering by making Andrew too confident while also carefully letting viewers see the spark within that Fletcher fuels.Even after the kind of inhumane mind games and physical abuse that should produce legal charges has unfolded on screen, we find ourselves drawn to Fletcher. He's not 100% wrong when he says that the most dangerous two words in the English language are "good job." Whether you think it's the right approach or not, we're in an era of praise, where encouragement is the teaching tool and every kid gets a medal for participation. Have true talents been left to wither because they were over- watered? Simmons perfectly captures the drive of a man who believes his abusive degree of pressure is the only way to produce a diamond.While "Whiplash" would be a notable film purely for Teller and Simmons' performances, it reaches a different level when one considers the execution of its tempo. Editor Tom Cross and cinematographer Sharone Meir often put us right on stage with Andrew and Fletcher. It is captivating, to say the least, particularly in a climax that produces more tension than any action film or thriller this year. The title refers to a song played multiple times throughout Chazelle's film. It could also refer to that sense of wowed exhaustion you'll feel when it's over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is the best movie ever for me. I am writing this review just because this movie made me to write it. No film inspired me this much to write a review here on IMDb. Everything was perfect about the movie. This movie is a powerful example of extraordinary filming which can inspire a generation of filmmakers and I mean it. It is important for me to say that this movie left behind The Godfather for me. Music, Acting, Direction and story. Loved this movie. What can I say more? Literally, actually the best movie ever. Last scene was great. When you think the movie is done, it takes a surge and you are drowning in excellence. I was feeling every beat in veins. I increased the volume of my computer to max (Thanks to vlc player, IYKWIM). Indian education system's convention of Guru (teacher) and Shishya (student) has depicted by this movie in an over-the-top manner. I loved the film. Going to watch it again. I owe you Director Sahib! BEST movie ever!!!</fullReview>

If you're into intense dramas, I suggest watching this movie as as soon as you can. It's a great music flick showing how determined Andrew (Miles Teller) is to impress Fletcher (J.K Simmons) and to show that he can be one of the best jazz drummers alive.10/10I would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never quite expected Whiplash to be a strong and independent film, it took me by surprise and swept me off the floor. The movie is one of the boldest in screenplay and acting. Miles Teller plays the character of a dreamy but perseverant drummer. His acting was so good on screen, because for a moment there I forgot that I was watching a movie and got involved in his character so much - I could feel his pain, his loss and his anger to excel. JK Simmons is a truly epic in this movie. Literally, I couldn't take my eyes off him. With an exceedingly true portrayal of an abusive teacher and his motive to find the next Charlie Parker, JK Simmons pulled off one of the best roles off all time and definitely the best in his career. Whiplash never misses the beat, there isn't a single moment wasted and every second feels packed with visual drama.</fullReview>

I had the best time watching it in HD as it is also very enjoyable to watch thanks to the scenes where the band is playing. Personally it even encouraged me to get back to music ! (I used to play guitar when I was younger) I really encourage everyone to see it as it is a movie for all ages (except for the "swearing" part...) and a stunning masterpiece in its genre! In conclusion, I am happy that i got to know about those two amazing actors : Miles Teller and JK Simmons. I got to appreciate their acting talents as well as their toughness ( during "hard times" in the movie)</fullReview>

I was dying to see him in Fantastic Four after seeing this, this kid is good, this kid can be great. how he was not nominated for an Oscar boggles my mind, I'm not saying he would have won but he should definitely have been nominated. mind you they didn't nominate Jake Gyllenhaal either and he killed everyones performance that was nominated. #biggestoscarsnuboftheyear anyways I'm getting off topic this film had Great direction great production great sound mixing and a lot of heart and emotion and let's not forget my boy J.K. Simmons who just blew me away with his acting skills that I didn't even Know he had. i mean i knew he was good but this role was great. the best supporting actor was all his for the taking(i think his only competition was Edward Norton in Birdman). any way this movie is a must watch for any movie lover its one of the best if not The best music based movie i have ever seen, maybe even one of the better movies i have ever seen as well 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only "Boyhood" Was Better 2014 Flick Than "Whiplash"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, you've surely heard about, or seen the trailer for, Damien Chazelle's latest picture, "Whiplash." That's the one in which veteran character actor J.K. Simmons plays a loud, obnoxious, condescending jazz band director at a prestigious music school. If you're like me, you're not thrilled about seeing this one. A little of that screaming goes a long way. Please allow me to tell you how misguided your decision to skip this one is.At first, Simmons (the father in "Juno") struck me as a jazz band version of R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant character in Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket." In both cases, the attitude is merely theatre, designed to drastically alter the mindsets of young men. But the difference is that Ermey's character attempted to make soldiers of men who might otherwise panic when faced with a life-or-death situation. Ermey's ranting and raving was, in a way, vital to the survival of our nation ? at least that's the way he saw it. But Simmons? His Terence Fletcher is bellowing at music students ? not soldiers. Yes, I initially found his character to be way over the top.But I soon realized there was a method to his madness. Fletcher's life was changed when he read about Charlie Parker's drummer, who threw a cymbal at young Parker when he didn't think the future saxophone aficionado was playing up to his potential. From that moment, Fletcher made it his lifelong goal to berate greatness, if you will, from his students. Fletcher is not a guy who ever says, "Good job." He can't be pleased; he can only be impressed.One day, he personally picks a freshman percussionist named Andrew to be an alternate player in his top jazz band. Fletcher sees enough potential that he subjects Andrew to his discordant teaching style in hopes that he may become the next Buddy Rich. What ensues is a fascinating game of one-upmanship, as these two strong personalities do battle against each other ? Fletcher, to bring the musical genius out of Andrew; and Andrew, to keep from being insulted and dishonored in the process.Still not convinced you oughta pluck down cash for this one? Let me tell you the two leads are out of this world. I wouldn't be surprised to see J.K. Simmons win (not just nominated, but win) the Supporting Actor Oscar ? even though I think both leads belong in the Lead Actor category, but that's another discussion for another day. And Miles Teller (so convincing in last year's "The Spectacular Now") is every bit as robust in his role as Andrew. In fact, Teller has the same problem Tom Cruise had in "Rain Man." How do you turn in a persuasive performance playing the straight man against a triumph of acting? But in both cases (Teller's and Cruise's), they are able to match the exultation of the actors in the more glamorous roles. Teller certainly deserves a Lead Actor nomination.I'd also be remiss not to mention both the script and the cinematography. Damien Chazelle's screenplay is succinct, a la David Mamet's screenplays. There are no "extra" scenes, no filler material, and the abrupt ending is perfect. Chazelle wisely opts to leave out the denouement scenes, in a story of two individuals who respect one another but don't particularly like one another.And Sharone Meir's cinematography deserves to be nominated as well. The musical sequences are peppered with rapid cuts and edits. Remember Martin Scorsese's "The Color Of Money," in which the camera seemed to concentrate on the rapid motion and beautiful color of the pool balls? Scorsese made the relatively mundane act of two men shooting pool into a spellbinding visual treat. Same thing here. We're not simply treated to watching a twelve-man jazz band belt out a tune. Instead, the camera pops from close-up shots of sweaty, hard-working Andrew with perfectionist Fletcher, interspersed with quick shots of the beautiful, shiny brass instruments. Viewers become mesmerized, as the music seems to crackle right off the screen. It's a real masterpiece of filmmaking, without being "gimmicky," as the long tracking shots were in Alejandro Inarritu's recent "Birdman."In short, "Whiplash" is the best film I've seen since Richard Linklater's "Boyhood" was out this summer. During awards season, I hope "Whiplash" doesn't become a forgotten memory, buried amongst all the big-budget over-hyped cinema of the year. This one's a gem, and I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unforgettable movie full of emotions, spectacular direction and awesome jazz music. The story revolves around Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) , a very passionate drummer, and Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) an intimidating maestro of jazz music. Andrew gets enrolled in one of the best music schools in order to fulfill his dream of becoming top jazz drummer. He is ready to sacrifice everything whether it be his health, relationship or family to become the best. Terence is the most ruthless teacher in the school and he trains jazz to a set of budding musicians. He is infamous for his controversial and extremely pressurizing methods to bring the best out of his students. Seeing Andrew practice one evening Terence picks him up as an alternate for the main drummer in his band and with his dedication and perseverance Andrew grabs the main position. At many points movie forces one to question Terence's philosophy of achieving utmost perfection. He believes that compliments reduce the scope of improvement. One gets satisfied with whatever he is doing on getting appreciated and this feeling of content hinders further growth. Movie is full of twists and turns complimenting the great chemistry between student and teacher.Movie conveys the message that no matter how many obstacles are present, with true desire one can always find a way to success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-What's your name? -Andrew Neiman sir. -What year are you? -I'm a? first year. -You know who I am? -Yes sir. -So, you know that I'm looking for players? -Yes sir. -Then, why did you stop playing?Andrew starts to play.-Did I ask you to start playing again? -Uh? sorry, I? -I ask why youstop playing and your version of an answer was to turn into a wind-up monkey.This is just the beginning.Is it necessary to get through everything Andrew Neiman does? Does an over strain mean success? He gets close to the edge for his dream; he risks his life at some points. In my opinion; the effort works out. I read some reviews that emphasized the film director goes too far with the premise of the movie. It's true, he almost crosses the line with Neiman's biggest dream, and he exemplifies it with the teacher. That is absolutely necessary only to know the effort a person needs to achieve his goal. Both have an unbreakable stubbornness and perseverance on what they want: Fletcher squeezes his students to reach the highest; Neiman wants to be the best drummer of all time.It's very easy to step into Andrew's shoes. Damien Chazelle handles a majestic direction and an astonishing edition that makes you feel the same emotions as the main character. The director uses several hands, face, eyes and ears closeups with thrilling transitions between them. You suffer in the same way Neiman does. The car impact is breathtaking and Justin Hurwitz's theme: "Accident" fits in perfectly. An outstanding, well-deserved Oscar edition. Exceptional OST. Pure jazz.I felt hyperactive when I left the movie theater and I wanted more. I was sweating as Andrew Neiman. The drums and cymbals were echoing inside my head all the time. The movie doesn't stop, the rhythm never slows down, the drums are unstoppable.The film industry needs musical-themed movies like Whiplash. Music is the best art in order to show our emotions, and combined with the filmmaking create something unique.www.filmaddiction.es</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's how I imagine a proper drama movie should look like. Excellent work by only a 30 yo director Damien Chazelle. From the beginning to the very end I was in the room with the characters, watching Andrew playing the sh*t out of those drums. Wonderful screenplay that seemed very casual and believable with absolutely stunning performances by both J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller. I'm glad Simmons got the Oscar, he really deserved it. The intensity he put into his Mr.Fletcher was really what made this film so great. But I guess I shouldn't over-praise, good- job are apparently the most harmful words in English language.P.S. : The final scene was one of the finest movie endings I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whiplash" puts us in the deliciously uncomfortable position of rooting for the shared success of two characters who are unlikable individually and toxic together. It's one of the most disturbing entertaining movies I've seen in a long while. The only thing I can compare it to would be watching a Stanley Kubrick film, although the second feature from 29- year-old writer-director Damien Chazelle couldn't be more different stylistically from the chilly and precise work of the late master; it's feverishly alive and relentlessly intense. Still, "Whiplash" similarly provokes contradictory reactions and emotions. It wows you and makes you squirm simultaneously. I can't say I enjoyed myself, but I also can't deny being dazzled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WhiplashBeing the drummer means being out of range of beer bottles the audience throws at your band.However, the audience attending performances in this drama are more apt to lob wine glasses.Determined to be a great musician like his idols, Andrew (Miles Teller), a freshmen drummer enrolled in the Shaffer Conservatory's Jazz program, accepts a spot on the studio band.But the ensemble's abusive conductor (J. K. Simmons) abruptly dissolves any dreams Andrew had of glory.Discouraged by his teacher's exacting and insulting nature, Andrew is pushed to his physical and emotional edge.The caustic couple later climaxes on-stage where each humiliates the other in order to achieve their best.With intense, inspired performances from both leads, breakneck editing, and an unrelenting rhythm permeating throughout, Whiplash is a fresh, in-your-face, approach to weary mentor/mentee movie clichés.Furthermore, drum solos are the ideal time to go to the washroom.

		<fullReview>As a display of emotional intensity and passion for musical excellence - I can't recall a better example than Whiplash. It's hard to turn away from the on screen drama, but it's not always easy to watch. As a non-musician I can't really relate to the discipline maintained and the pain that the chief protagonist is willing to go through, but it is no less believable. The mentor / teacher is a at once a beast and a proponent of tough love. My only frustration is that there is no redemption, no justice, no perspective....at least none that my value system can recognise. There is only continuance of obsession, from one generation to the next. So a little unsatisfying, but well worth the time spent nonetheless. Exhausting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simmons is the man! He is so brilliant in this movie, you want to punch him in the face for being the meanest man in charge since Sgt.Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. At one point in the movie, Andrew the student drummer, in a fit of rage tackles Mr.Fletcher (Simmons) and you want to join him in landing a punch or two. Andrew played by Miles Teller is also great in the movie. The editing in the film is slick and never once boring, which is normally possible when you make a movie where musicians are rehearsing for most part. I loved the soundtrack and developed a new found interest in Jazz music and playing with a band. It was a satisfying movie. I felt disappointed for a second towards the end when Fletcher expresses his sadness of never having met a Charlie Parker. The change in character seemed abrupt and unconvincing and I let out a groan. But Fletcher right back in at the final performance by taking Andrew by surprise. I was quite relieved with this and it made the ending all the more enjoyable. My bets are on JK Simmons to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. But for Best Film, I am still going to go with Imitation Game or Birdman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash Whiplash Whiplash it couldn't get better. I saw this movie yesterday and all I have to say about this movie is BRAVÓ. This movie was just brilliantly portrayed and the acting was amazing. Lets start of by talking about J.K. Simmons that was one of the best performances I have seen in a film in years he was outstanding and he really made the movie. Miles Teller was also excellent showing the struggle and how he coped with Fletcher's attitude. I could not recommend this movie anymore and where has Damien Chazelle been these past few years he did an outstanding job directing it. But to finish this off the thing that made this movie a movie was the cinematography the way they filmed the movie and the last scene was so intense that in the end it has me standing up clapping because it was so great. So I hope everyone sees this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some small but big plot holes, but its amazing acting, directing, editing and writing make Whiplash a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, it is directed and written by Damien Chazelle, and it is awesome, seriously, just awesome. It is a dazzling, electrifying and original movie. Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a drummer who aspires to be the best, like Buddy Rich. He is a part of an elite music school and one day, conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) accepts him into his band as the substitute drummer. From the first rehearsal it is apparent that Fletcher is the king dick of the galaxies. He is abusive of his students, assaulting them in every way possible. While practicing the song "Whiplash", he hurls a chair at Andrew for being on his tempo, and begins to slap and berate him for rushing and dragging the band. Fletcher continues to push Andrew to his limits, and in order to earn his approval, he starts practicing all the time. These two provide amazing acting, despite Simmons being the one with the most award buzz, I thought they were equally stunning, with incredible chemistry to boot. Teller brings the drive to be the best to the screen, creating an engaging and relatable character, who eventually becomes possessed with his ambition, his scenes after being under Fletcher's tutelage does to him as a person, it makes him start to lose his mind, it is very, very interesting, he provides fierce acting. It's as if Teller is an unstoppable force, and Simmons is an immovable object. Another awesome thing is that he did most of the drumming himself, that's already worth a lot of praise right there. His exhaustion is real, and you feel the work he put in the role, it all pays off, culminating in incredible acting. And Simmons, he is astounding. What a performance! He is so ferocious and ruthless, and his insults are great(and I hate to admit it, but they're pretty hilarious), the actor delivered them with such anger, just amazing. Such a dick of a character, just the fact that an actor can get so into character to the point of you wanting to beat him up so bad, is something to behold. The other supporting actors, Paul Reiser (his dad) and Melissa Benoist (his girlfriend) are very good as well, both their relationships with Andrew are very interesting to see.The movie is very well written as well, it has as good characterization for the two leads as it gets. Both of the characters have such intriguing character arks, with amazing development by the time the movie ends. Andrew of course is very humane and real, and since joining Schaffer he starts to become overwhelmed by his ambition to be the best, and starts to become disturbed, (like what he did with his girlfriend), and the character gets even more interesting from there. While Fletcher is usually this feral man, who has a terrible influence on his students, as can be seen from what he does to Andrew. He could have been pretty much a cartoon, but the script and Simmons' performance gave him such depth, showing some scenes where he truly does not seem like an entirely bad person, and while you can still see his reason for being a total dick to his students, of course it's not justified, but I liked how he had very strong views on his methods. And the butting of heads between these two? Such an amazing and interesting conflict, also best chemistry I've seen, these two did such an incredible job. And now for my only flaws with the film, and unfortunately they are big, it's the film's complete lack of realism in key plot points, for example, how the hell has Fletcher not lost his job? And this is after Andrew's first rehearsal, hell, before the movie even began, I mean, if you hurl a chair at a FIRST time student because he wasn't "on your tempo", well you can't expect to not be sued for everything you have, this is 2014 New York, no way in hell he would walk away scot-free. Also, there is another scene where Andrew goes to play in a concert, and something happens with him, something big, but no one reacts to it (hard not spoiling it). Those two problems drilled a gigantic hole in the plot, and they took me out of the film a bit. The rest of the movie was great however, nothing else wrong.Chazelle of course directed this film as well, and there's another praiseworthy achievement, each image is very well filmed, I specifically loved the beginning shots, which showcase Andrew walking around the beautiful nighttime NY, with each shot focusing on the buildings then scooting down to him, with some groovy and smooth jazz playing in the soundtrack, which is awesome! Full of fun and electric tunes, while also including some quite sad and dramatic songs. And the final act, that was some of the best minutes in a movie last year, everything in it is simply put, specially the music direction, and editing, Chazelle does a magnificent job, filming impossible shots right at the mouth of each trumpet and trombone, and the editing, my god it's so good! Tom Cross does an incredible job here, with tightly edited closeups of each instrument, changing the viewpoint with each beat and giving each instrument its time to shine. The sound is incredible as well, to make all those instruments sound so perfectly while all playing at the same time is a great feat. The ending of the film is really awesome, and I believe everyone will like it a lot.Despite its small but big flaws, Whiplash is a really awesome movie, one that reaches out to any type of moviegoer, it is beautifully acted, directed and edited, and has an amazing script with a strong story that is electric, emotional and astounding all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think anyone can question Miles Teller's acting talent after watching Whiplash. Matter of fact it should have never been in question, especially after The Spectacular Now or even Divergent. He is getting better with every role and it's only a matter of time before he is also being nominated for an Oscar. J.K. Simmons plays the ultimate jacka** teacher, who looks to other means of educating the Jazz band, abuse. When I say, I don't think there has ever been more of a despicable character I mean it. I can't even describe his character without cursing and wanting to yell in this review. Whiplash is truly an exhilarating experience that anyone with a superior who pushed them too far, can relate to.Andrew (Teller) is a motivated drummer, fresh out of high school and enrolls at the cream of the crop music school. He meets Fletcher (Simmons), who is just about the most strict music teacher on the planet. I never had a teacher like that, but I did have a harsh baseball coach in high school that took things too far at times. You're not a teacher or coach when you make the kids hate what they're doing and despise coming to that class or practice everyday. It makes me wonder how many of these educators we have in the world, and worse, how many are getting away with it. He's the type of man that when he walks on screen you immediately worry for everyone in the same room. Simmons was intense in the Spider-Man franchise, but he is ten times as bad in Whiplash. I think I'm actually afraid of J.K. Simmons now.Miles Teller apparently learned how to play drums for this role, but his intensity and emotional depth is unparalleled here. I can't see how he will be a bad Reed Richards, even with the chaos surrounding that project. He literally put his blood, sweat, and tears into this project, and it showed. That's why it's heartbreaking to see his character change as he gets more lost in Fletcher's world. His personality takes a turn for the worse and it ends up pushing the people closest to him away. Some of the actions Andrew does, or tries to do, to impress Fletcher is intolerable for the audience to see. Because of how much I hated Fletcher, I don't think I have rooted for someone more than I did with Andrew. I can say I will never coach kids or students like this, it's just inhumane.The script is nearly perfect. Some of the lines Simmons says are a few of most malign things someone can say to a person. What's worse is that he knows if you're lying and will flip the script on you if you're caught. Simmons will easily win the best supporting actor Oscar this year, but his character is so maleficent that I almost don't want him to. I do have a problem with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I just wanted more out of it. I would like to think with who these characters are, it would have wrapped up more to my liking. It's almost like the characters stuck too much to who they are, instead of completing their character arc.+Teller's immense dedication +Simmons.. enough said +Exhilarating roller-coaster +Script +Relatable with probably everyone -Ending 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top 10 Movie of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is without question one of the best movies of the year and worthy of every single Oscar nomination it has received. The performance by J.K. Simmons is terrifying, easily the best supporting role of the year. The amount of passion he brings to the movie is incredible, even during his 'lighter' moments, his persona is none the less intimidating and frightening at all moments of the movie. He is without a doubt the heart and soul of the movie, take that with a grain of salt. It's pretty crazy to see a movie about music and instruments pack so much energy and passion, when most action movies can't deliver this kind of tension. The movie takes the classic tale of 'What are you willing to sacrifice to be the best?", and spins it around the music career of a dedicated, aspiring drummer. And the movie doesn't make it a cake walk either, Andrew, the title character must first go through emotional hell in order to achieve his dream. (I'll leave the ending a mystery, that way you'll be able to see if he comes out cleansed or not). Whiplash is one of the best movies of the year and certainly one of the most surprising (how many other movies based around music have been a hit lately?) And as I said above, J.K. Simmons deserves an Oscar for his performance, Whiplash may revolve around Andrew, but it's Simmons character who gives the movie life!Full Review at : www.simplefilmreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is about Andrew(Miles Teller) who wants to be one of the greatest drummers in the world. He attends a music academy but after Fletcher(J.K. Simmons)takes him into his band, Andrew will now train even harder to be the best. First of, Wow!! What a movie. Whiplash was easily one of the best Movies of 2014. The performances were amazing. It mostly focuses on Andrew and Fletcher. Andrew who is played by Miles Teller did a Amazing job. Miles Teller played the drums Himself. He did a amazing job but J.K. Simmons just knock it out of the park. Every seen he was in, it was intense. It's worth paying a ticket to see his performance but it's worth paying a ticket because whiplash was amazing story told with amazing performances by J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller. A movie everyone should check out. J.K. Simmons deserves the Oscar all the way.</fullReview>

Probably my favorite movie to date. I highly recommend watching this movie. I always enjoyed J.K Simmons' natural representation of being an asshole, but he took this to a whole other level. There really is nothing like it in my opinion. I have seen countless movies with the whole "coach tries to mentor his student" but I feel that they always come off as forced and fake. J.K Simmons was able to pull it off by a long shot, and it made the movie enjoyable. Give it a try, and don't listen to all the hipsters saying that it sucked, because I almost gave in to it, and I would have regretted it had I known how good this was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My heart was racing, I felt an urge to just get up and clap until my hands bleed. That was me, 2 seconds after a black screen ended one of the most satisfying and thrilling experiences I've had.The writing, witty, Simmons's and Teller's acting is... Excellent, so as to not lose myself in descriptions. The plot has a fresh feeling to it. I don't feel like I've seen this story before with different characters, or anything like it, to be honest. The Hero's Journey is definitely not present here. The cinematography has a sense of humor to it, the writing is great, the acting, superb. Everything in this peace of art was carefully executed. BUT, all those qualities were overshadowed, at least for me, by the soundtrack. It felt like Buddy Rich and Dave Brubeck were playing for me. More than once I've caught myself syncopating to the songs. My ears were grateful for the pleasure of listening to such good, tasteful music. To my awe, the soundtrack feels more organic and integrated than in Tarantino's work.I spent the next 10 hours after watching the movie drinking a good beer and listening to Dave Brubeck, Yoko Kanno &amp; The Seatbelts ("Odd Ones" matches perfectly the movie's ambiance). I've always denied the existence of such thing as a "favorite movie", but, I got to say. THIS is my favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film about the lengths and obsession with wanting to achieve greatness. Miles Teller plays a young guy who plays the drums in a band. He is being taught by a hard has nails teacher. Played brilliantly by J.K Simmons. His performance reminded me of the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. You really get to see what it takes to make it in a cut throat world of competitive music. J.K Simmons as the teacher is amazing. Harsh, but you can see where is coming from. That anger, and desire to help students succeed. If you've ever wanted to achieve something in the arts, or in anything. This film will inspire you. It is a great movie. One of the best of 2014.

		<shortDescription>Whiplash isn't great, but it's quite an entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year, the Oscar voters include one or two independent films among the nominated ones for Best Picture; by doing that, they prove the fact that they aren't elitist and that they give the same opportunity to every strata of production, and not only to the big studios. This year, the film Whiplash was chosen as a sample of the generosity and democracy of the Oscars, and even though I don't think it deserves its nomination for Best Picture, I found it a very entertaining film with excellent performances and a solid screenplay. I would have personally preferred to see Nightcrawler in that "underdog" position. But, well... let's leave aside my cynicism and bitterness against the Oscars, and let's go back to the many pros of Whiplash. To start with, we have magnificent performances from two great actors who had been a bit underrated in the past: Miles Teller is practically initiating his career, but he has already shown huge talent. The other perfect performance is from J.K. Simmons, an acting veteran who shines in every thing he's involved, and elevates the quality from the projects he participates with his mere presence, either in cinema or TV (yes, I'm one of the few people who enjoyed the sitcom Growing Up Fisher, starred by him). The chemistry between these two actors is electrical, and brings intensity and emotional impact to many scenes. And then, we have the music. I'm not a fan of jazz, but the dynamism and energy of the musical numbers presented in Whiplash infect the spectator. In conclusion, I don't think I would consider Whiplash an excellent film, but I definitely think it's a solid one which deserves to be recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Whiplash' is probably my favourite film from 2014 (it was a 2015 release here in the UK but that's because of the way the award season works). No other film from last year drew me in and put me on the edge of my seat the way this film did. It is extremely well written, directed and edited. Damien Chazelle did a terrific job at making me feel the tension and anxiety that Andrew felt. The way Chazelle angled and moved the camera around was a bit unusual, but it made it feel like that there was someone with a unique and clear voice behind this film and directing it with passion, which drew me in even closer. Chazelle is clearly a writer/director to watch out for in the future. But when talking about this film, you cannot forget the performances. Miles Teller is a great as Andrew. He brings to the character the necessary drive and sociopathy (but not too much) need to make him interesting and watchable. The side characters are also great. In particular, Andrew's dad and Nicole, Andrew's girlfriend, were characters we do not spend a lot of time with, but are well written and well acted enough that they feel like real people who we like spending time with. However, the real star of the film is J.K. Simmons, who gives a standout performance as Terence Fletcher, who looms over Andrew throughout the film. Simmons does a magnificent job at bringing the character to life and making him monstrous, intimidating and surprisingly funny all at once. He is going to win the Oscar.And, of course, there's the finale. The climax is probably one of the best scenes in a film that I have seen in a long time. This is where Damien Chazelle excels as both a writer and a director. It is a non-stop thrill ride that it is incredibly nerve-racking. It is also brilliantly shot and edited. I don't think I have ever been more entranced by a film than this endingIf you have not already seen 'Whiplash', I highly recommend that you seek it out no matter how far the nearest cinema showing it is. Believe me, it is worth the hype.http://boxd.it/4SGHF</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight Up Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does it take to be great? There is only one word to describe Whiplash-INTENSE. It's the story of a young drummer who wants to be great, and an explosive instructor who demands perfection. Today, if you gave me a film fest time machine, I'm going to Sundance 2014. Why, you ask? To watch the tour de force that is Whiplash snag the Grand Jury Prize for Damien Chazelle. In this picture, Chazelle provides a vision for the future. From beginning to end, it's easy to appreciate his camera and the story it's telling through its lens. Teller and Simmons are masterful, but it's because their action and dialogue is so robust that they're able to pass along overtones of passion and intensity. Despite a limited release, it's safe to say Whiplash will turn enough heads with its recent Academy Award noms. If you're looking for what I call a perfect storm, you'll find it in this movie. The script is an A, the acting is A, the directing is an A. Whiplash won't just leave you speechless, it will leave you with a healthy dose of adrenaline all day long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>558th Review - And all that jazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a tour de force of a film that hits you hard in stomach from the get go and keeps going. With career defining performances from J K Simmons as a Svengali mentor and Miles Teller as an ambitious young drummer willing to go through hell to achieve greatness.Director Damien Chazelle gives the film a near stage like look that suits it well, there are only three or four outdoor scenes, otherwise the claustrophobia created by focusing on the music practice room suits the piece well.This is a film about suffering for ambition. A film about the need to be the best, to strive for fame, but also about two characters who are destined to clash. Simmons is pure vitriol, knowing exactly how to use his temper and words to break a player, and it is a fine performance - showing just the right level of loss of control with a cold logic.Central to the film is the struggle jazz has to be seen. Given the immense work required to become a jazz great, jazz tends to be difficult on film compared to the glamor of rock. This is a film that likes it jazz straight up - and is better for it.It is one of the better films of the year. It is a powerful film with great performances that it is about very human traits: the need for approval and the abuse of power and if liberation is ever possible. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a writer, I've never done a review before but I was so inspired by this film that I have to share this with whoever will read it. I've just seen "Whiplash" (exactly an hour ago in fact) and I have been utterly speechless since then. Everything about it, the cinematography, the acting, the directing, and the composing, was the most polished and perfected version of itself that it could possible be. No film has ever triggered such an emotional and physical response from me. I don't think I breathed for the entirety of the film and when I walked out, I could barely put one foot in front of the other. My whole body was filled with a state of utter shock. I don't know if it was shock at how incredible it was, or shock at the way it made me feel, but oh boy, it made me feel something. Another thing that baffles me is the overpowering message it leaves. What resonates with me from seeing this film is the desire, nay NEED to achieve greatness. And I don't mean getting 100% on a test paper, I want to be one of the greats. (If you pardon the reference).On a more personal level, acting has always been my aspiration but after witnessing this masterpiece I have a new ambition. I don't care if I act, direct, produce, compose, or film- I want to make something as good as this. I just can't believe what these people have created. If you spend your money on anything, even before paying rent, you should pay to see/feel/experience this marvel.</fullReview>

The film has Miles Teller as Andrew who's a young up and coming want to be drummer who after enrolling in a music school finds that life behind the drum is tough. It's when Andrew sees that his march to the beat of his own drum instructor Fletcher(J.K. Simmons in a very deviant and sadistic like teacher role and maybe his best performance)is one not to play with as the note and key must strike to his hand right on the drum! It's a pain taking task as you will see Andrew play the drums till his fingers bleed!

		<shortDescription>Nothing less than a straight ten is fair for this electrifying emotional blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the end credits rolled I let out an uncontrollable cheer and burst into spontaneous applause.It wasn't a film festival premiere, it was a cold Saturday matinée in Edinburgh in early January.But I had been emotionally unravelled. I'd been through the wringer and had come out the other end a whooping fan boy.Exhausted, I staggered from the cinema gasping for breath. How on earth could a movie about a Jazz teacher and his drumming protégé elicit such a visceral reaction? It's hard to say why because on the surface (subject aside) there is little that's fundamentally original about the movie's structure. But what there is, is two absolutely gut-wrenching and enthralling performances that smash your emotions all over the cinema. Hits to the solar plexus are about the size of it.The story concerns the relationship between a 19 year old drumming major in his first year at North America's best music conservatory and his desire to succeed at almost any cost in carving out a springboard and a shop window for a future career as a 'Lincoln Centre' core member.His tutor is, if anything, even more focused than he is, and certainly as unforgiving and intolerant of anything less than perfection as it's possible to be.The result is a fascinating emotional power struggle, shot through with manipulation by both protagonists.Much has been said about JK Simmons' barbaric performance as the tutor and Jazz Studio conductor who has expectations the height of Everest. But far less credit has been given to the equally powerful turn by his pupil played by Miles Teller. Simmons simply could not have achieved the heights he has without this perfect foil.The film smoulders from the opening scene and aside from Simmons and Teller pretty much nothing else matters (other than Charlie Parker, Buddy Rich et al whose canon of work is electrifyingly brought to life by the Studio Jazz Band that Teller so wants, no needs, to join).Much of it consists of boot camp scenarios where imperfections are punished again and again and again. It's these scenes that create the unbearable tension. But punctuating these are the human side of it - like Teller's inability to build any relationships at all, other than with his single father. Drumming is always more important. And not just drumming; but drumming fame.Do not let the subject matter put you off. Do not let the fact that this is a jazz infused hour and a half, much of it in performance put you off. This really is a very special movie indeed and fully deserves a straight ten rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riveting to the point of unbearable, "Whiplash" is a triumph of the power of the cinematic experience both in emotions and afterthoughts. When you are watching this movie there is no way possible you will be thinking of anything else if not this movie, when you will have stopped watching this movie, not many thoughts will have priority in your head to you thinking about this movie.Firstly I want to address the fact that some people have said that the film's message is that the more you practice the more you'll get better or that, as a critic said, "Whiplash does not celebrate jazz nor cinema". So firstly, if you think that the message is the more you practice the better you get, I strongly invite you to re-watch the movie and maybe turn your head on, ha? I will not get into spoilers, but dam it! When our character reaches the top of success he had not been practicing for months at least! He clearly reached the top of success because of inspiration to do so, obviously practice is fundamental for a musician, but without the drive you'll never achieve anything and that is exactly what Andrew wasn't expressing through the music. And this is coming from a musician with 15 years of experience. Once Andrew realizes it's time for music and it's time to make a show, he finally gets to the best he had ever been. All those hours of practice and of tension and harassment with Flectcher proved to be nothing, compared to the drive of giving proof of himself. Moreover Whiplash is an amazing cinematic piece of art, it is technically flawless and has some of the most solid and conscious direction you could expect. Finally, I have never ever been into Jazz, it is probably the only music genre in which I lack totally, but man did this movie make me get into it, I finally got a kick out of it, I don't know what it was and maybe Jazz purist will laugh at me maybe not, I am not an expert, but I know two things, the music was Jazz and I really enjoyed it.Speaking now of the cinematic qualities "Whiplash" has. It excels in so many fields I really don't know where to start because I simply can't put my finger on which one was better than the other. I'll go with the obvious choice, to start off, and add my two cents to the millions of praises J.K.Simmons got for this performance. It is astounding, full-stop. I cannot think how any other actor could have ever improved it, he definitely gave the best performance I have seen so far this year form anybody, be it actor or actress. I have been a Miles Teller fan before it was cool to be so and I will say that this is his best performance yet. He is being slightly overlooked because of Simmons, but he really isn't is no less than him. Carrying on to other elements: the sound, the editing, the pace, the cinematography, the writing, the direction, I could list them all and talk about each one for pages, they were so perfectly calculated and never occupied extra space, never felt artificial or intrusive. They are an example of true brilliance and genius in the craft of filmaking.I will say that the film to me did slightly overlook a big element, that being Andrew's character. I already hear the voice of the reader going "Wtf? f**k this guy". But just hear me out. I didn't say it completely didn't study him, but as much as the core material, the themes, the energetic scenes and the adrenaline pumping performances captured me I never understood Andrew's character, there are a couple of references in the film but it does not deepen him enough. I know that's not what the film is centrally about and I did certainly feel for him and connected to him, but I never got a deeper look at him and I kind of regret that, I wanted to know more about who he was. You see him transform, you see his down-spiraling, but you never understand to what degree does he change or how does he think. Whilst on Simmons' side you get a profound character study (which is certainly more the point of the film), the lead remains half in the shadows.But that is all I have to say against "Whiplash", it is a masterpiece that culminates in a breathtaking ending and has an ambiguity to it that will keep me thinking for god knows how much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash "There are no two words more harmful in the English language than 'Good job.'" Talent is the gateway drug to misery.In the most ferociously terrifying film in years, a young jazz drummer spends his days working for the opportunity to study under an acclaimed instructor at one of the country's most elite music schools.When he finally lands a spot, he's dealt a savagely vicious reminder to be careful what you wish for.Thus begins Whiplash.Easily 2014's best film, this is a cinematic manifestation of the barbarity, cruelty and depravity that arise from unyielding ambition. The never ending quest to be the best is one that often leaves its traveler with bumps and bruises rather than fame and fortune. WHIPLASH is unyielding and unrelenting in its journey of sacrifice and self-improvement ? and writer/director Damien Chazelle hits each beat with a confidence and stride of a filmmaker with ten times his experience.And then there's Mile Teller and J.K. Simmons ? the most awe inspiring cinematic pairing in years. Through blood, sweat and tears, these two tear through the screen with a raw bloodthirstiness that you can neither bear watching nor rip your eyes away from. Their embodiment of wicked electricity boils over onto the screen in a way that no two other actors could have accomplished.Whiplash is everything movies are supposed to be about: high wire emotions, acutely fleshed characters and a story that leaves you both exhausted and wanting more.That's why Whiplash is the best film of the year.So harmful or not, I'm going to say it.Good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally riveting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that a movie about a young musician training to the the drumming world's equivalent of Charlie 'Bird' Parker could be this gripping but Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash", (it's only his second film and he both wrote and directed), works both as a study about a pupil/teacher relationship and as a film about obsession as well as being a superlative jazz 'musical' and it's a film that confounds expectations at every turn. Only once does it go slightly off the rails in a melodramatic sequence leading up to a crucial concert but it recovers from this blip building to an incredible musical climax in Carnegie Hall.The pupil/teacher relationship is that between Andrew, a priggishly self-confident young drummer and Fletcher, his martinet music instructor. Fletcher's idea of teaching is to abuse, verbally and sometimes physically, his students until they do things his way. If they don't measure up, they're out. He's played by J.K. Simmons as the music world's equivalent of R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in "Full Metal Jacket" and at times you hope he might suffer the same fate. It's a career best performance from a great character actor finally getting his dues and almost certainly an Oscar. Andrew is MilesTeller and neither Teller nor Chazelle make him particularly likable or sympathetic which is a nice touch; there are times you feel he deserves all he gets. A cosier actor would have made for a cosier picture and a less exciting one. When they go up against each other you feel at least we might have a battle of equals. Fletcher is a monster but he might also be a great teacher who knows he may have finally found his Charlie Parker. There's just enough of an edge to Simmons' performance for us to want to look for the man beneath the caricature just as Teller's Andrew is equally alienating.Luckily, for such a blood-soaked saga, in a very literate sense, there is enough humour in Chazelle's excellent script to get us through the sticky passages, (and there are a few; there's only so much cymbal-throwing bluster we can take), and the almost wordless climax, including a nine minute drum solo, is as musically and dramatically riveting as anything in recent cinema. "Whiplash" may not be perfect but it's as near as dammit and marks Chazelle out as one of the best and most exciting young directors working today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endlessly exciting and original cinematic experience which will leave you buzzing like a taut snare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a sizeable chunk of the film's running time, aspiring jazz-drummer Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is caked in his own sweat and blood; battered and bruised from hours and hours of incessant practise, his blood drips onto the skin of the snare, and the cymbals are littered with beads of sweat ? his sweat. Perhaps this is the best way of describing the film: by no means perfect, but uncompromisingly passionate and energetic.I won't be too detailed in explaining what happens over the course of the drama as the film revels in its unpredictability. Besides you probably know the premise anyway. Just in case, Whiplash follows first year Shaffer Conservatoire student Andrew Neiman (Teller) in his quest for drumming supremacy. On the way he encounters big-band big-shot Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) who recruits him as a drummer for his formidable studio band. What then plays out is almost a battle of wits, with Neimen building up immunity to Fletcher's foul-mouthed tirades and Fletcher increasingly being provoked, intentionally or otherwise, by Neimen's ever increasing confidence.It portrays the teacher-pupil relationship as one of insurmountable hostility rather than encouragement, and JK Simmons clearly relishes the opportunity to let-rip some R. Lee Ermey-style ranting. If there are any weaknesses it's that first time (!) writer/director Damien Chazelle seems more comfortable with the musical set-pieces than at the human interaction, though even then a meeting between Neimen and love- interest Nicole (Melissa Benoist) is painfully well-realised, as is a family dinner scene. Clearly the film has no qualms with admitting that ultimately it is all about these moments of musical mayhem, and what wonderful moments they are, shot and edited with a ruthless and ferocious energy. It's an endlessly exciting and original cinematic experience which will leave you buzzing like a taut snare.BLOG: https://thepictureinner.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J K Simmons Deserves Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JK Simmons is a teacher at a prestigious music school in New York City; obviously Julliard, but the name is changed here, but it doesn't matter, the story is a compelling one with Miles Teller as an aspiring drummer who falls under the wrath of Simmons(Mr. Fletcher). The man is a Vince Lombardi type of instructor who treats everyone with equal contempt in order to get the best out of them. I am not a fan of jazz, but I as a music lover, I was able to appreciate the struggles of musicians of any kind. Teller is excellent as the kid who plays so hard that his hands bleed, and Paul Reiser appears as his supportive father. Simmons has been nominated for best supporting actor and he should take home the Oscar. I remember him playing a neo Nazi on the HBO series "Oz" and he is clearly a great character actor. Whiplash is one of the best movies of 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspirational and Powerful Thrill Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been hearing that Whiplash was one of the best films of 2014 from many people so I decided to go ahead and give it a whirl. Lucky for me I was not disappointed. Not in the slightest.Whiplash is a powerful depiction of ambition. Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at a prestigious music school. He is a talented drummer, with the single goal of becoming one of the greats. Right at the start he is noticed by one of the respected teachers at the school named Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. From here on you experience the back and forth between the student and the teacher as Andrew tries to persevere through the cutthroat approach of Fletcher.J.K. Simmons does an absolutely phenomenal job as Fletcher. Throughout the film Fletcher goes to the extremes to motivate and push his students to be better. His single focus is being the best, and any less than that just won't cut it. During each scene you can see the anger and frustration building within Andrew as Fletcher constantly berates him for each and every mistake. There isn't a single boring moment during the film. The two performances from Simmons and Teller carry the film with their incredible chemistry.It's inspirational watching Andrew push through the challenges he faces during his quest to be the greatest. At the same time you feel sad for him, as you experience during multiple moments of the film how much his dedication and ambition take a toll on his life. Whiplash takes you on an emotional ride through success, failure, happiness, sadness and a continually building tension as the two personalities of Andrew and Fletcher clash.I would be very confident in predicting some Oscars for Whiplash, most notably J.K. Simmons winning the Oscar for best supporting actor. If you are reading this review after the fact, and Whiplash has indeed won some Oscars, rest assured these awards are most certainly well-deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most inspiring movie I have seen this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the trailer for this movie prior to seeing Interstellar. While I enjoyed Interstellar, when the movie finished, all I could think of was how much I wanted to see Whiplash. Finally, I just did, and I can happily say it was well worth the wait. What an unbelievable feeling when the movie finished!It started a little slow however, and I was also a little confused with what the characters would bring to the table. I couldn't figure out whether the movie was about the love of Jazz music, a man that takes you beyond your limits or about the obsessiveness you need to develop in order to be truly remarkable at what you do. But I guess you have to wait for the ending to be really sure. And when you do, it will lift you off your chair. While I now want to listen to Jazz music more than ever before, and to learn all I can about the likes of Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong and the rest, I also want to go to the fist library and grab any book by Napoleon Hill, and Earl Nightingale to dig deeper into the subject of life goals and personal-success. This is how hard this movie has hit me!Inspiring!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shaffer Conservatory Of Music is not only the best music school in New York...but it's the best in America.Student Miles Teller - newly arrived - not only wants to succeed but wants to become one of the all-time great jazz drummers. He gets his opportunity when he's personally auditioned by teacher J K Simmons and invited to join the school's flagship jazz orchestra. Getting in was hard - staying in the orchestra proves to be almost impossible. Simmons is a ruthless taskmaster, throwing insults and chairs if anyone can't achieve - overachieve - his exacting standards. Keep up or get out. You want fame? Well, fame costs - and here is where Teller starts paying not only in sweat but in tears, blood....and his belief in himself.Despite a supporting cast, there are really only two characters in this film - Teller's eager-to- please student and J K Simmons' brutally unsympathetic professor. It's the back-and-forth between these two personalities that gives WHIPLASH its energy, its snap, its tension. Miles Teller excels in his role, his character having to endure euphoric heights and soul- destroying lows - often in the same scene. Teller is also an accomplished drummer in his own right and so gives his part the musical credibility it needs.However - with due respect to Teller - this is Simmons' film. He dominates every scene as the sadistic Fletcher, viciously tearing into his students with cutting, imaginative insults. Yet although he does monstrous things, Fletcher is no monster. Scriptwriter Damien Chazelle - who also directs - takes care to ensure Fletcher is not your run-of-the-mill, one dimensional hard bastard. There are many different shades to the character - light as well as dark - and Simmons blends them into a convincing, believable character. You may hate the guy but he's no cartoon. Instead, feel sorry for Robert Duvall, Ethan Hawke, Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo. There is no way on earth that the Best Supporting Actor Oscar is going anywhere else other than J K Simmons' shelf next month.It's a surprise to note that accomplished as it is, this is only the second film from Chazelle. It's a remarkably disciplined piece of work - tight as a drum - with no unnecessary subplots to distract our focus on the two leading characters. There's the kind of creative spark running through WHIPLASH that you find in the best of Scorcese's films. Imaginative camera-work. Razor-sharp editing. Smart, salty dialogue. There's a bold confidence to WHIPLASH that never lets up and keeps you hooked.As well as script, acting and direction, a film like WHIPLASH stands or falls on the quality of its soundtrack; fortunately, the choice of jazz classics and Justin Hurwitz's score are both exemplary. There's a danger some will be put off by the "j" word. Don't be. Yes, jazz runs through the film - in many ways, its the film's third character - but it's great jazz. It's sure as hell not the anonymous muzak that masquerades as jazz in bars and lifts around the country. This is the real deal. Fired up, red in tooth and claw and hungry for your attention.A terrific start to the movie year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drumming movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My run to the Oscar continues with a movie not released yet in Italy, so I haven't heard about it before the nominations. The plot doesn't stimulate my curiosity and the main theme looks not very appropriate for a film with 5 nominations. So I started Whiplash without knowing what to expect to. I have to admit that this is the first candidate movie that awake something more than a cold appreciation in me. It is a fantastic mix of music and images, with a drumming rhythm that takes the spectator with the eyes on the screen for all the time. This dynamic rhythm is reflected also in the acting and in the psychological fight between the two main characters. I loved the meanness of J. K. Simmons remembering me the atmosphere of Full metal jacket. In conclusion I found Whiplash a brilliant movie, very entertaining and engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some great movies are competing for the Best picture Oscar this year. Along with Boyhood and Birdman, Whiplash is another exhilarating ride! A 19 year old boy who is very ambitious to become one of the greatest drummers joins the best music school in the country. But things start to get a little worse for him. His music teacher who goes so rough on his students to get the best out of them, becomes his nightmare. J.k Simmons was absolutely amazing as the vicious music teacher. He abuses his students, hits them, bullies them, scares them and makes them go through a lot of mental pressure. He remembered me of Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He totally deserves his supporting actor nomination and I wish he wins it. Miles Teller was brilliant in his part too, the mentally pressured boy who never quits to become what he dreams to. The film has got some good music which keeps the flow so thrilling and editing was good making the film look tight. This without any doubt is one of the best movies I have seen this year along with Boyhood and Birdman. An amazing movie on the whole!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never have I felt so tense watching a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was speechless after watching this film. The story is relatively simple. The main character, played wonderfully by Miles Teller, is in a prestigious music school as a drummer. And he wants to be one of the greats. So there's a specific class he wants to get into that only takes the best of the best. The instructor of this group is played by JK Simmons. And wow is the only word I can come up with to describe his character and performance. I can't compliment JK Simmons enough for his roll in this film. He makes the movie. He's just one of the biggest dicks in movie history. He'll yell and swear and insult. I can't even give examples of the insults he throws around in this film on this family friendly site. I mean talk about emotional abuse... But he does have a reason. He pushes people to be the best that they can be. And even if his methods are a little questionable, he's going to make every student of his as good as they can be. He has a fantastic quote in this film (which I'll be quoting for years and years) that perfectly reflects his character: "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job." The film is just so amazing. It's so intense and emotional. Seriously, this film is more intense than most action movies. And it's about drumming. Think about that. There are times when I had a knot in my stomach and had to stop and take a deep breath because I was so nervous. And the ending is fantastic. I was sitting in my room watching this alone and I nearly applauded at the ending. Might not make much sense, but that's how great this film gets. If I had to list any negatives, my only complaint is that there's a small subplot between the main character and his girlfriend that I didn't really care for, but it does serve a purpose in the plot, so I can't complain too much. Other than that, I'd say it's a perfect film. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. And that one small complaint isn't going to make me dock it any points. 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash - tight as a jazz snare drum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is an authentic, well-acted and well-directed drama, definitely worth a watch - although a margin too much on the conventional drama side to rank highly amongst other music-based dramas.Despite being hugely focused on Andrew Neiman (the young drummer) and Terence Fletcher (his music coach), the plot rarely feels slow; however there were instances of Andrew's stubbornness simply seeming unbelievable, in the face of Simmons' face-slapping, emotionally abusive maestro.Cinematography is an element which stands out above the rest in Whiplash, with neat editing and many subtle shots of cymbals slick with sweat or blood. Indeed Miles Teller provided all of the bodily fluids on the drum kit, playing all his own drum parts in a superb performance that deserves recognition. Lighting plays an important part in the mood of the film, as does the music. An original score composed mostly of the diegetic jazz instrumentals oils the parts of otherwise bumpy scenes, and enforces the idea that jazz is Andrew's life, his world.One downside of the script itself is that it tries a little to hard to introduce comedy, in the form of Fletcher's hilariously abusive tirades. Attempting to make us laugh at a half-crazed fiend of a conductor only serves to cheapen the drama (admittedly without losing any of the tension).The denouement is surprisingly satisfying for such an open ending. Below everything, though, is the realisation that Fletcher's tyranny won out in the end, tricking Andrew's arrogance and ambition into making him surprise his former mentor on stage.There are dark themes within - the parallels between Andrew and the shadow of trumpeter Sean Casey's demise are slight but noticeable (note the idea of a car crash, and precocious young talent), and yet they divide at the end, with Andrew's resilience permitting him to exhibit his talents instead of caving in to Fletcher's abuse. The suggestion that Andrew's driven and alienating ambition leaves the audience with a feeling of triumph highlights a refreshingly original alternative to a softer ending, i.e. giving up drumming for the sake of friendship and women. His relationship with his father is an interesting one: although they're close, Andrew's refusal to "come home" with him after his initial embarrassment may symbolise the way in which he is moving apart from his dad and becoming a braver, riskier man in his own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension is built through the entire film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to successfully give tension, there must be a conflict worth caring about. The conflict must be something of great importance to one of the characters in the film, and must be, in some way, relatable or understandable to the audience so that they care about it. In addition, it must also create an atmosphere that anything could go wrong at any moment. These two aspects of a film combined create tension. Throughout the entirety of Whiplash, you are in a constant state of tension. You feel everything that Miles Teller's character, Andrew, is going through; and you want him to succeed just as much as he wants to. Just when you think things couldn't get more intense, it throws something completely unexpected your way; and this happens with every single scene. This is the definition of wonderful writing. You feel that each character in the story cares, and it is brought to life by the wonderful performances by all of the cast members. And those performances wouldn't be possible if it weren't for some amazing directing. And that amazing directing wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the wonderful writing. It was the type of writing that made my heart beat with every pound on the tension-building instrument: the drums.I recommend it greatly to all those who happened to stumble upon this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the ends justify the means?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me start out by saying: I've never written a review on here. Let that be my disclaimer. But, I felt I had to because I feel as if this movie has been rated lower by some because of what I believe is a misinterpretation of what Chazelle was going for in this movie. Many believe that this movie somehow validates abuse and mistreatment to push someone further. My answer to that is: Does it really? Is there really ANY point in the movie where you feel that Fletcher (JK Simmons) was validated in his actions? Did you ever like his character? For that matter, did you ever like Andrew's (Teller) character? I think this is where Chazelle very adequately displays human nature, and poses the philosophical question: Do the ends really justify the means? Was it worth it for Andrew to break up with Nicole? Was it worth it for Fletcher to drive the other boy to suicide? Is having another Charlie Parker worth it? IS there a line for pushing yourself and others? That's for the watcher to figure out for themselves. So I think Chazelle isn't validating anything, but really rather posing a question. Just my two cents. That said, great movie, fantastic acting, and great music. The only cons are a little unrealistic and melodramatic at times, but I believe the suspension of believe is required a little for Chazelle to properly make his point, so I let it slide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie. Whether you love Jazz or not, it's brilliant. The two main characters will draw you in from the start. You will undoubtedly root for Miles Teller's character (the aspiring musician) and despise J. K. Simmons' (the villainous music professor). By the end of the film you'll love them both. J. K. Simmons does a fantastic job as the music composer/instructor pushing his musicians to the the limits of their talents. Albeit a quite unorthodox method.With today's films being mostly poorly written action films, horror movies, and rewritten tales from the past it is refreshing to watch something that draws you into the story. Any time you can watch a film; be emotionally and excitedly pulled down the path, the actors are doing what few can do. Don't miss this. It is one you'll tell your friends about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Whiplash" is simply a tense, captivating study all about what it takes, and what is needed, to be great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash" is initially a captivating study about what it takes to be great and what is needed to become great, and it ends as a captivating study about what it is to be great. Miles Teller (playing Andrew Neiman) and J.K. Simmons (playing Terence Fletcher) are both absolutely fantastic in their respective roles and their performances are on par with those I loved witnessing in "Birdman" and they fit perfectly, as "Birdman"'s cast did with that films respective themes, with what "Whiplash" is all about. Greatness, as I mentioned earlier, is what "Whiplash" is all about. Teller's and Simmons' drive reflect this, and it comes through in their characters. Andrew wants to be "one of the greats" and Fletcher wants to be the man to coach one of them. Yet this is certainly the absolute minimum of what I gathered about this film before I saw it. This kind of drive is in motion about halfway through the film, and "Whiplash" has several twists and turns in it before it finishes. Teller and Simmons develop extremely complex characters and what you come to realise is that what makes them complex is their drive. Andrew for example is an initially very easy character to understand and in some ways, to relate to. We've all wanted to be better and get great at something. But what takes "Whiplash" in a different direction from the one where we see Andrew asking the girl behind the counter at the cinema out is Fletcher. He pushes Andrew beyond "what is expected of him". Watching Teller develop Andrew as a character is a fun ride although Fletcher swearing, slapping and throwing cymbals at him is not so much, but it's all for a reason. But is it necessary? Fletcher believes so, calling it "an absolute necessity" in a scene where he seems to reveal himself as the grand villain, right beneath our noses this whole time. "Whiplash" asks these questions and it's almost as if the film sprouted from them, not that they came up and were developed as the film continued to shoot. Andrew and Fletcher's relationship is an attempt at answering them, leaving it up to you whether the answers "Whiplash" puts forward are right or wrong. Are Fletchers methods the way forward? Could Andrew harness his talent and be great without Fletcher? Did Andrew have the talent to do such a thing? Is talent even a realistic construct? "Whiplash" asks all of these questions, and puts forward its answers here.Of course Teller and Simmons are fantastic too and deserve the nominations they are getting. Simmons character is particularly well developed (and funny too) and again it is a joy to witness Teller's development. Neither character can be described really. Simmons seems describable but there seems to be something beneath him that I couldn't figure out and in one scene we see that he isn't quite as tough as he seems to be. What surprises me though is how Simmons keeps winning awards and Teller does not. For me they are both brilliant and one does not outdo the other because in "Whiplash" you come to think of them as entirely separate individuals, and their relationship is instead an eternal one in regards to how it can be applied to several examples and asked whether it is one required for greatness. What's also worth mentioning is the films score. It's brilliant. It really is just a complete appraisal of Jazz. Drums of course predominantly feature and although the score is not as good as "Birdman"s, again heavily featuring drums, the reason it is not is because the score in "Whiplash" is external and in "Birdman", it's internal, inside the cast's heads. It has meaning and something to do with the film whereas in "Whiplash" it's almost as if Jazz music and the drums in this case are being used as a way by which we can see Andrew become great. It's another eternal concept of sorts. "Whiplash" is definitely worth seeing and although I wouldn't quite call it the film of the year, it certainly puts forward a good performance in several categories and has done well considering it was shot in 19 days and adapted from a short film. Most should come out saying "Whiplash" was a good film. It's tense and has some good performances in it and asks questions, and talks about, greatness. It's visually tense as well, helped along by slow-motion shots of sweat bouncing up and down off cymbals and blood dripping from a hand. Because of this, it was an utter relief, and felt hard-earned in some respects, to see the films ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is that hard. The first thought that comes to mind after watching it : It is that hard. To be great, to be amongst the greatest. This is the first and the most obvious narrative line in the film. The one that the protagonist (antipathetic friendless character who seems to be equipped with an extraordinary drive) sets as his ultimate goal. In this world purged of imperfections, faces are grim and no one looks you in the eye. The world is indifferent and you don't matter unless you do something really exceptional. Or die. There are no Grey zones, there is no redemption, no one cares. It is hard. The father and the girlfriend, the only two "human" characters, are marginalized for their mediocrity and lack of purpose and therefore, are irrelevant. We are in the mind of the protagonist whose only drive in life is to be the greatest drummer. So this is the price: in hundred and seven minutes you bleed with him, you get beaten and your spirit crushed to pieces. Time and again you get sick of the tension, of the pressure, of all that bloody jazz. Music has never been this hard. Director bashes his bat to the beat of the drum so that by the end you have adrenaline rushing and your heart pumping like you're about to have a heart attack. It is as discomforting and uncertain, as every great piece of Art should be. It is hard. There is a great moment by the end, when the student asks his mentor, brilliantly sadistic J.K.Simmons: where do you draw the line? This is the very premise of the film and this is what the film is really about. It is far beyond the story of success or one man's journey to realize his dreams, nor is about the brutal relationship between the student and his mentor (though it examines it perfectly). The weight lies not in them but in the complete lack of empathy for them. The human characters are merely tools of a superior concept. They channel an unbridled ambition which is the core of the film, its real protagonist. For those "who hear not the music" they appear mad, or if you prefer "driven". But what if they're right?Finally, it is a movie of our time and for our times. For generations brought up to believe they will all be great someday. Who think they've earned it with the birth certificate. Well here's the spoiler: it is that hard. I don't know if the director/writer draws from his own experience but he is definitely familiar with the concepts of sacrifice and commitment. Great job Damien Chazelle, you've earned it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intense Thrill Ride Anchored by Star Turning Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Music has never really been my thing ? unless you count film soundtracks and not many people do. So it thrills me to say that this film had me in shock when I left the cinema. I felt like I was on a drug, a drug that only a film like 'Whiplash' could provide.'Whiplash' is in a way unique ? it is not a thriller yet it grips from start to finish like only a masterfully created film could. So although this film is a Drama, it is incredibly intense always opting for the hardest, most difficult route. It never holds back and for some it may make the film difficult to swallow. It is this tendency towards filmmaking that hearkens back to the great, unforgettable Alfred Hitchcock. Is it a film that matches his greatest work ? 'Vertigo'? I would argue, yes. The Director appreciates film not just as entertainment, but as an art form as well. Take note Michael Bay.Every overriding factor of this film excels. I for one was not overly keen about a film that concerns a driven drummer. Yet the beauty of this film is that it pulls you in and overwhelms all of your senses.The script is pitch perfect in every way imaginable. We are always primarily concerned with Andrew, masterfully played to the full potential by Miles Teller, who now has an astonishing film to add to his CV. Andrew wants to become one of the great drummers of the world and Teller's performance could just be the start of him maturing as an actor. I really hope he pays attention to scripts like these in the future.J K Simmons revels in the ugly side of his character, literally the only side. Not to say that he is a weak character, because he sure is well written. There is no other word to describe his performance, scary. He plays the determined Mr who doesn't care if he has to throw a chair at your head to bring out the best in you. This man is determined to not let anything get in the way of his band being the best that the world has ever heard. Yes, he doesn't have an ethical code and believes the only way to get Andrew at his peak is to torture him mentally and physically. J K Simmons will get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and if he doesn't then I could not care less about the Oscars. He even adds a bit of snarky humour in there for good measure. He is a teacher you cannot trust, be picked as lead drummer one day, miss a beat the next and it is all over for you. Making the dramatic stakes in the film even higher and becoming all the more engrossing for it.This films soundtrack makes it even more heart racing and is the key for the film's success. If this music is poor then the majority of audience members will switch off straight away. It isn't and I could listen to Miles Teller drumming for his life all day, pouring sweat, pain and blood into his work ? not just metaphorically either.Although relationships in the film account for less than fifteen percent of it - they add a layer of depth to the characters and make them more fragile and nuanced. Andrew struggles to explain the situation to his girlfriend and ends up saying the wrong thing in the process. As his drumming career become more important than ever, he is left with some difficult choices to make. He cannot have his girlfriend and his career at the same time, one of them has got to go.Another thing that I could not get over was the editing and the cinematography. As Andrew's drumming gets louder and the beat and tempo quicken, the editing is more sudden with quick cuts and the camera work is more jarring. One key image that will stay with me forever is when Andrew plunges his bloody hands into a bucket of his ice. The screen is white and suddenly turns blood red. Andrew pushes himself beyond the limit, no matter the cost or the pain to his own body.If it was up to me the film would run over three hours, unfortunately it cannot. So instead we are left with under two hours of filmmaking bliss. Every cast member is on top form and shatter expectations. The camera work is stellar, Teller and Simmons give us a powerful dynamic to their relationship as student and mentor, and the score is any composer's idea of heaven. If this film doesn't make it into your Top Ten Films of 2014, then I'd advise seeing a doctor, you're brain clearly isn't functioning well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets the heart pumpin'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musicians aren't me but they don't have to be to appreciate a work of art. I haven't felt my heart pump and my whole body rockin to the beat of a drum in years and to say this did a pretty good job would be an understatement. J.K. Simmons is a marvel of snarky, and possibly psychotic, mentors. Every time I watch him I don't know whether to laugh at his smart ass remarks or smack him in the face. Either way, I will proudly remember him best as J. Johnna Jamesson from the Spider-Man movies and Terence Fletcher. I hope he wins best supporting actor at the Oscars. Miles Teller was impressive as the struggling drummer. Before this, I only saw him in Divergent which isn't my idea of a good film. There's one thing he did in the film that seemed really pointless and stupid, considering he opened the door on that situation early in the film. I won't say what, but it happens in a movie theater's concession stand. If that little subplot was written out, they wouldn't have lost anything in the movie. Aside from that, by the end the movie makes you want to stand up and cheer the hell out of it. It's an amazing feel for those who'd wants to bang the drums or just be in a band. Just pray you don't have a psychotic teacher.</fullReview>

Did people here know that Miles Teller is considered to be one of the best jazz drummers in America. I read that in Rolling Stone. He actually used to smoke weed and had to fight his way out of drugs to become a great drummer and actor. Well done.. and he is with out a doubt playing his best role.. And he wasn't even considered for the Golden Globe awards.With out a doubt one of the 4 best films of the year 2014</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just Great Performances but a Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously going into this film the hype was high with word of J.K. Simmons and his masterful performance, however I was pleasantly surprised by just about everything pertaining to this film. The performances, dialogue, lighting, cinematography, and over all direction was extremely well executed. There is a specific event in the film which kind of crosses a line into a completely unbelievable circumstance, however it does recover itself. The editing at points felt abrupt and rough, however it doesn't hinder the film too much. Just about every actor is over shadowed by the absolutely masterful performance by J.K. Simmons, one thing to be noticed by the end of the film is the performance of Miles Teller who seemingly solidifies himself as (as cliché as it is to say) one of the best young actors around. This film is certainly worth watching, no matter if you like Jazz or not.Also, I would like to say that I've noticed a few negative reviews regarding the "intensity" of some characters and the vulgarness of some of the lines. These people are politically correct douchebags, the type of person who get offended for other people, and who think a film showing assault simply means the creators condone that behavior. If anything, this movie is enjoyable if you've experienced life, persevered, and even after doing everything right you're told it's wrong, that's life and this film nails it. It makes you feel defeated at points, and it makes you feel enthused about something only to get slapped in the face (in a good way).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful intense experience led by Simmons performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a story that winds and lurches unexpectedly but decidedly against the conventional Hollywood grain.In Whiplash, a drummer aspiring for excellence comes under the subversive mentorship of a great jazz instructor. Please believe, this is not the standard Hollywood redemption story nor does it have the upliftingly sappy teacher/student cliché.Whiplash is an intense film about those few creative artists that pursue the notoriety of achieving elite greatness. Withing the confines of the cutthroat and prestigious Schaffer Conservatory, a promising freshman drummer named Andrew gains the attention of an esteemed professor named Fletcher, whose reputation precedes him. Fletcher invites Andrew into his exclusive studio band. It is a story of drive, ambition and the pursuit of excellence and the discipline bordering on insanity needed to accomplish this near-impossible goal.At first glance, the title of the film Whiplash comes from the song Fletcher uses as a competition piece for his jazz orchestra. The title and term whiplash can also be applied as an analogy for the constant jerking that Fletcher inflicts upon Andrew as Fletcher tries to unlock Andrew's potential through necessary, but brutal, harshness.No one truly knows the unyielding intensity that is needed for reaching creative genius when the capacity exists. The dynamic between the young prodigy and seasoned mentor created within Damien Chazelle's screenplay and translated with his direction to film is the most realistic representation of this relationship captured on screen in modern times. More impressive is the ability of Chazelle to flesh out his 17 minute short that debuted in 2013 at Sundance Film Festival into a feature film. The film is a little slow to start but once Fletcher ignites the drive within Andrew that unleashes some confidence, it is impossible for your attention to be diverted anywhere but on the screen.The character of Fletcher created by J.K. Simmons is complex, esoteric, and obscure. He is unlikeable, ruthlessly and maliciously sarcastic, unrelentingly tough but completely engaging. Every scene featuring the actor has your undivided attention with villainous allure.Whiplash is a story that winds and lurches unexpectedly but decidedly against the conventional Hollywood grain. Some viewers may feel the film ends unsatisfactorily open-ended but I find the final scene to be a definitive and momentously clear conclusion to the movie.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the reviews of awards nominees and recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, that was INTENSE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was straight up incredible. The acting from miles teller and j.k. Simmons was outstanding, they gave 2 of the greatest performances in the whole of 2014. the story, while being a little cut and dry, is still pretty great and is a good backdrop for the fantastic performances given in this movie. And of course, I have to talk about the tension in this movie. I've seen action movies, thrillers, horror movies, some intense stuff go down, and NOTHING i have seen compare to the tension that is built in this movie. The pressure put on this kid who has the potential to be truly great, that is put on him by this sadistic yet brilliant teacher, creates this level of tension that is ever rising and it just builds and builds until your literally on the edge of your seat saying to yourself I hope its gonna all work out. When you watch this movie, turn off your laptop, phone, and all other distractions because your gonna wanna get into this one. Fantastic movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense gem of a film that will be overlooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll cut through the fluff. I am rarely inclined to go out of my way to write a review of a film, but after just finishing Whiplash I couldn't help myself. Whether or not you are a musician and/or into jazz, do not let the plot of the film leave you "discouraged" - a theme that pops up repeatedly throughout the film.Short and sweet - this movie is about a freshman at the best music school in the country who wants to be one of the all-time great percussionists. Beyond his dream, the film shows the physical and emotional abuse he endures in the process. It is a true underdog film, the only difference here is that the underdog is already incredibly talented beyond his years. It is no doubt one of the most tense movies I've watched in years. It left me smiling during certain scenes, and with my jaw dropped during others. The dialogue is extreme, and even was reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket at certain moments.The Oscar nominations will be revealed a few days from now, and if J.K. Simmons doesn't get a nomination for Supporting Actor I will be extremely disappointed. If he does indeed get the nomination he will be near impossible to beat in my opinion. Granted he just won the Golden Globe for this category earlier tonight.If you have a free night, go check out this movie. It might not be for everyone, but in the very least you'll be taking a chance on a low budget film that currently is not getting the recognition it truly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful and Tense Examination of Some Harsh Lessons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle's Whiplash follows the story of a young and talented drummer studying at Schaffer academy in New York. The film expertly observes the pressures and stresses of working under such a manipulative director.Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is a 19 year-old student, gifted with the sticks in his hand. The film opens with him practising his drumming and is a clear indication of how ambitious and determined he is. After impressing Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), the director of the leading ensemble in the school, Neyman is promoted into the band. Here is where he discovers the strict conditions of working under the perfectionist Fletcher. Insults regarding his mother who ran away when he was young and having chairs thrown at him isn't what Neyman expected.However, he remains strong and as determined as ever to prove that he can be a great, continuing to practise at every opportunity, literally playing until his hands are blistering and bleeding.Whiplash ultimately becomes a clash of two musical geniuses striving for perfection, illustrating the pressures and tensions to the extent where the audience are expecting either one to crack at any stage. Chazelle keeps the film strongly in the shadow of Neyman, tracking every single strain and emotion with the camera spending a lot of the time behind the shoulder of Neyman. Tempo is a major theme throughout the film in relation to the jazz numbers on the soundtrack which all make for an enthralling watch.Teller and Simmons both deliver perfect performances. Teller, who is certainly coming of age, manages to truly reflect the development of Neyman, not only as a drummer, but also as a person. Teller spends the majority of the film in all kinds of pain; either sweating, bleeding or crying and he delivers every possible emotion his character endures.Simmons standing in the opposite corner also perfects the role of the cynical, terrifying director, constantly pushing his band for perfection in the most intimidating approach possible. His quips and insults leave the audience wondering whether to laugh or sit in a state shock.Whiplash is a dark and pulsating watch, which deservedly left Sundance with two awards under its arm. With the Oscar nominations just around the corner, it would be no surprise to see a number of honours coming the way of Chazelle's creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drumming! Really! Who knew it could be so exciting. This is a superb film with standout performances at every stage and the script fizzes off the screen continually self referencing and catching the arcs as you spot them and they come to fruition - this is a masterclass in how to pen a screenplay.The whole film is shot lo-fi and there is an intimate and almost voyeuristic nature to the filmmaking which I really liked. You practically want to punch the air at many times during the film and sometimes punch J.K Simmons (who is AMAZING). I found myself tapping along to the music and at one point (along with the rest of the cinema) nearly jumped out of my seat and the whole experience felt like a roller-coaster ride from start to finish.Great film, cannot recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the drum set, stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premise: a tough teacher with heterodox methods who manipulates and mistreats a promising protegé in order to make a triumph of him. The former gets away with psychological torture and even physical abuse in a manner that, in real life, would get him fired and banned from his profession in 15 seconds, and yet he succeeds... even when trying to undermine the poor kid. In another movie this would turn me off completely and make me snore for the whole 107 minutes.Instead, it is one of the most thrilling flicks I have ever seen. It put me firmly in the edge of my seat.That's because the "art" at stake is no McGuffin. The jazz drumming is a third, more powerful protagonist than either the bully or the victim, or their face-off - despite the undeniably excellent performances (JK Simmons is a slam dunk at the Oscar). The characters say what they are doing is all about the music, about becoming Charlie Parker, about being "one of the greats". But in reality you could not pull off this story with any other jazz instrument - certainly not with Parker's saxophone. I can't stress it enough. Damn the brass, the woodwinds, the bass. In the drums there is something visceral, at the same time primitive and sublime that comes through in a away music listeners perhaps never realized. The instrument forces the character to bleed, to suffer, to submit his mind to the beat, to the merciless tempo, to the task of commanding the band at the same time the player seems to be in the background. It demands his transfiguration into a brute who brings delight. It is much tougher than the sadistic, over-the-top teacher.The movie is about taming an instrument more than Karate Kid is about karate, or the first half of Full Metal Jacket is about making soldiers. More than any sports movie are about a sport. You never cared so much about the activity that supposedly is there only to provide the plot, without even noticing it.And you don't realize it, because the characters never discuss the particularities of the dreaded sticks, snares and cymbals. Not for one second. Maybe that is the brilliancy of Whiplash. People talk about the drum set as if it was any other jazz instrument. It is not! Instead, they just show and show and show challenge of the drumming. You live it, you suffer it, and you are enchanted by it. There is a reason the first and last shots of the movie, both abrupt, have Andrew at the stool, hitting the cymbals with all his energy and skill. In the end you don't know why you loved the movie, despite the stock characters, weak plot twist, and clichéd situations that stretch credulity. You are swept, and wonder what is there that you never seen before. The drum set is omnipresent yet and nearly unmentioned. It's alive. The drum set is the real appeal of Whiplash. It IS Whiplash. The piece that gives the movie its title and is played over and over has a heterodox, challenging time signature. Seven beats per measure. Maybe this strangeness contributes, but I don't know jazz enough to say for sure. The direction is above par, stylish and discreet at the same time. The actors are brilliant. But who cares? Just hit the notes, Andy, until you bleed, get beaten up by the instrument until your brain turns into mush, and ultimately produce pure art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A promising young drummer enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realise a student's potential. I finally got to see Whiplash starring Miles Teller and J.K Simmons. I remember the first time I noticed Miles Teller in a movie and that was in The Spectacular Now; with those two films he has shown us that he has a lot of talent and here especially on the drum. However, J.K Simmons in this film is an absolute revelation. He's brilliant and totally Oscar worthy. What's the most beautiful aspect of this movie is the drive Teller's character feels, this desire he has to be great, this passion he has for this subject and how he struggles to express it to his family. Every person with a dream and a passion for a particular subject where you know everything there is to know about it can understand that. Sometimes it can be hard to communicate this idea to someone else, make them understand and appreciate it as you do. This is a psychological film. This movie is so much more than just music, it's a psychological battle between two people who believe so strongly in their opinion. In fact, J.K Simmons' character is coming at him at all angle: verbally, mentally and physically. He's taring this kid down in the first place and till the end he's giving him hell the entire time. This movie builds a level of intensity that I haven't seen a lot in movies (and I've seen a lot of movies); particularly through the tune and drumming but also through something bigger, it's so intense because it's so personal. We get Teller's character feelings as we've all wanted something so bad enough, so bad in our lives that we'll literally put ourselves through hell to get it (and if you don't. Don't worry. You will!). Overall Whiplash is an intense film in which I can't see one flaw. It's simple and efficient. It deals with an ambitious young character played by a really good actor and his teacher played by J.K Simmons who kills it! Somehow you're able to project yourself into this movie and now more I think about it, better it gets!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teacher/Student relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I teach painting, drawing and workshops in 'public art," and would never treat my students, let alone another human being the way Terence Fletcher, the intensely controlling jazz instructor in a prestigious Music Conservatory in NYC (eerily and wonderfully acted by J.C. Simmons) "hammers" his students to what Fletcher considers "perfection." WHIPLASH directed by Damien Chazelle is part psychodrama, horror story, case study in manipulation, naked ambition and teaching techniques - do results justify brutal means? OR as I have found to be true does it do the opposite - discourage students to such a degree that they drop out or break down.We first meet Andrew (Miles Teller) in a movie theater sharing popcorn with a companion - who happens to be his father. Andrew, though socially awkward, is a young man who single- mindedly knows what he wants from life - to be as great a drummer as the legendary American jazz drummer Buddy Rich and in an almost Faustian bargain willingly succumbs to the spell of an abusive teacher who he believes can deliver him his goal. Fletcher's modus operandi is one of debasement coupled with an occasional affirmation all in the name of precision and superiority; a frighteningly dictatorial approach to the evolution of creativity.The exchange between student/teacher can be a tender one - growth develops out of sensitive and genuine respect for a pupil's intelligence and capacity, or one that is fraught with anxiety and sadistic motivational techniques. In WHIPLASH - the apt title comes from a Hank Levy (American jazz composer and saxophonist) tune that the school band is rehearsing over and over again; blood is psychologically and literally spilled under the "master's" pummeling - the repetitive practice drilling into one's psyche - the audience becomes as tense as the pounding sounds emanating from the tautly stretched membranes which are struck with sticks know as "beaters." Personalities and events are not always anticipated which made the movie compelling. Characterizations are slowly revealed through frenzied musical performances; audacious hunger for success taking precedence over one's personal life and human contact. Between the two lead characters, there are shifts in domination like a wire which coils and uncoils pulling their mentor/disciple relationship together and apart, spawning a tarnished creative union.</fullReview>

I was expecting some long side story of the lawsuit, but it was basically a few bits of dialog and it wasn't a major side story or anything. Amazing how that was written. I watched this alone at home. I was so involved with the movie that at the end, when Andrew walks back onto the stage, I literally stood up off my couch and fist pumped. It kinda freaked out my dogs.

Whiplash is truly a bright spot in today's cinemas as it does not rely on over the top stunt and explosion or large amounts of CGI but rather it relied on excellent dialog, good timing and good script as well as fantastic performances by veteran actor J.K. Simmons and rising star Miles Teler. A story revolving around a young jazz drummer whose only dream is to be the best the world has ever seen and his instructor who wants to see him achieve his goals. The only issue will this is that he does this through fear tactics, intimidation and just generally being a huge dick to his students. As the movie continues you learn to understand why he does this but the damage is done to the students and you can see it in the lasting effects that it brings</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew is a talented young jazz drummer at a prestigious musical school who is under the tutelage of Terence Fletcher, a band teacher who gets results by humiliation and bullying. This is a method which results in prices to be paid.This film, which never goes quite where you expect it to, features strong performances from Miles Teller as Andrew and JK Simmons as Fletcher. Fletcher is undoubtedly a monster, but the script and Simmons are canny enough to give him some rounded corners so that he is also human. And Teller gives a very physical performance which is not without some subtlety. The musical sequences are well done, especially the final one.It's not the easiest of films to like - Andrew and Fletcher are not particularly likable characters - but it's powerful stuff, and opens a window into what happens when two driven people come up against each other.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm over a year late on this one but I just got the chance to see Whiplash and my god it was fantastic. The acting from Miles Teller and JK Simmons was fantastic, throughout the whole movie I felt like it was me being yelled at. The movie is surprisingly very intense which is something you don't usually see in a music themed movie but the tension stuck with me for hours after watching the film. Speaking of the music, the movie's soundtrack was great, the jazzy music going on throughout was very enjoyable and I loved every second of it. The only point of improvement I have for this film is I wish that the relationship between Andrew and Nicole was developed more, I liked the awkward chemistry on their first date and I feel like it would be an interesting relationship to dive deeper into. Overall though this is one of the greatest movies i've seen and i'd recommend it to anyone looking to jazz up (pun intended) an evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking, revolutionary take on the music film genré</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that I haven't heard of this film before. I know the name sounded familiar when my friend first recommended it to me, but I wasn't sure what the film was about. So, without reading any reviews of any kind I started viewing the film.As a musician, producer and enthusiast that wants to keep evolving, I truly appreciated this film. I had not watched a single trailer, only reading the short synopsis and I already knew this film was my kind of film. What I did not know was that this film would be so different compared to other music genre films, it's truly a film with it's own genre and it's unique in so many ways.Now, the film started off pretty slowly. But soon enough we are introduced to the music teacher, who directly shows a character that is very strange, and keeps getting stranger the more you watch it. I had multiple theories of the characters personal life and reasoning behind his actions, but it was so unpredictable that I just couldn't puzzle it together until the very end. He is a very enthusiastic teacher, that however tends to push the students to their limits with harsh language, violent actions and provoking lessons. To many, especially the people I watched it with, he showed off kind of like an asshole. While, by time, you understand what he's doing, it's still hard to justify the actions in this film. Now, the acting in this film is top notch. The director did an amazing job with the film and I'm glad I sat down to watch it. Anyways, the movie centers around the young drummer (I can't remember his name) that goes to one of the finest music schools in the country. It shows how much he wants to make a career out of his drumming, and throughout the film, it only gets better. Some scenes, might to some people, have been unnecessary, but I felt that it helped to really get the audience get an understanding point of view on the characters, also while making us switch emotions. The music in this film is absolutely wonderful. As well as the screenplay, the humor and the acting. All done in a very professional and astounding way. This young director that I've never heard of before had done a splendid job. I can't wait to see more of his films.The film leaves you breathless, full of emotions and also a lot of questions. I say, if you can handle violent scenes, harsh language, you will enjoy this film. Other people might find it hard to watch. It's certainly not for the faint of heart. What I can tell you, without spoiling anything, is that this movie is unique in it's genré, and it's really like nothing I've ever seen before. A lot of other films, are familiar with each others, but this one was a complete fresh new for me. It's a bit shocking, but a great film that I hope ends up getting the awards it deserves. I would def. think it deserves an Oscar. The actors deserve it too. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a different film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A freshman at one of the top music schools in the country is pushed further and further towards perfection, but at what costs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has had them at some point in their academic life; that cutthroat, soul smothering, devastatingly proactive teacher that spat sweat and obscenities in a do or die mission to create perfection. They are that one teacher who if embraced, became singularly admired for their dedication and drive to back you into a corner until you pushed back. Possibly not as impetuous as Fletcher (JK Simmons), our rash but headstrong professor at Shaffer Conservatory, yet an influence that takes the path less traveled. It is this demonstrative ideology that our film takes, hurling verbal cymbals at our head in what surmounts to a throat clenching wake-up call to our senses. From the opening act, we place our motivational fortitude and drive to succeed on the table, in the end coming back to something beautifully and honestly changed.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a first year student at Shaffer Conservatory in New York City, one of the most prestigious schools for music in the country. We're introduced to him visually afar yet audibly intimate, his actions unfocused with a sound that's precise. After being heard and invited by Fletcher, Shaffer's top jazz professor, to sit in as alternative for core drummer in studio band, Andrew soon realizes the methods to Fletcher's teachings. He is belittled, slapped, and deconstructed in front of everyone on his first day, reducing him to tears. He then clears his room, moving his drum set into his studio space in order to better himself, playing as fast as he can until a defensive wall is constructed around him. Eventually earning his position as core drummer, battling it out for hours against his peers, Andrew begins bleeding Fletcher's fervor in a pursuit of perfection.Infusing his character with a determination and na?ve sense of guidance, Miles Teller ignites the screen with the crack of a snare drum. When we first hear Andrew speak, it's through his music, as he rolls and flams until he is recognized; a recognition that's responded to with uncertainty. Andrew doesn't so much voice his thoughts when he isn't playing, but emotes them through his gaze. Miles manages to capture the brittle mannerisms and the anxious looks of a young talent with total conviction, often saying more with a downward glance than anything verbal can capture. When he meets Fletcher and begins to adopt characteristics that come off foreign for him, Miles assumes a mirror image of his impressively tyrannical teachings, his blood spewing both literally and symbolically. Taking turns playing off each other is an undeniably fire-starting performance by JK Simmons as Fletcher, who tempos his vehemence and disparaging remarks like a whip, with Andrew his star whipping boy. Dressed in a tight black shirt, his arms acting more like weapons than batons, Simmons pushes our film forward with intensity and gas soaked propensity for evocation. As Andrew reacts to a cymbal hurtling towards him, we react in the same manner, our expressions of disbelief continually poked until a fire is raging within us. Fletcher and Andrew respond back and forth between each other, one using words while the other uses notes, all the while both are secretly being stripped of what they love.Written and directed by Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench), Whiplash plays out like a musical gladiatorial match, thunderous and composed, our freshman focus entering the arena in hopes of obtaining his freedom in the form of recognition. Having written The Last Exorcism Part II, Chazelle constructs his characters out of the character moldings of a horror film, filling Fletcher with an unpredictable rage and an obscure background that generates metronome like terror. Andrew never flees from his captor, instead battling his opponents with a tenacity and ferocity that eventually places him in the path of his deadliest adversary. There's a scene in which Andrew must prove his capability and worth, drumming toe to toe against two other potential core drummers. It's a scene that champions Chazelle's abilities behind the camera, and one that creates a slow burn for Editor Tom Cross. We re fixated on Andrew as he splits wounds in an even display of speed and impeding success, our visual tempo increasing as the scene unfolds. It's a phenomenal display of jump cuts that only gives us a taste of what's to come, Andrew's drum guiding the camera with precise intensity. We erupt with a snare buzz across the screen in a climactic confrontation that leaves us on the edge of our seat with our eyes and ears synched in stupendous harmony.In the end, Whiplash leaves a completely welcoming mark across our necks as visual craft merges with auditory storytelling in what surmounts to an undeniable achievement for Chazelle and Cross. Placing ourselves in front of the screen, we are pointedly told to observe the aspirations and barrages, both mental and physical, of our young talent, culminating in one of the most rewarding experiences this genre has ever seen. As the final act closes and we are left with just our ears as guidance, it becomes immediately evident that Damien Chazelle's sophomoric effort juxtaposes that of Andrew's virtuosity, placing itself as a cinematic rarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely something you would not expect from a music related movie. JK Simmons makes the movie and Miles Teller does a fantastic job of playing the student pushed to the edge. The plot centers around a hard teacher passing his students to be the best they can be but the constant dry and witty one liners make the movie. There is nothing intense about this movie at all except the swearing and teaching techniques which edge on bullying. Both actors are real life musicians and honestly do a great job. If you like crude but hilarious one liners with a music theme then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT Film; Simmons Deserved Every Award He Received</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHIPLASH is an insane rush. Who would've thought a movie about jazz drumming could be so intense? Or good? Seriously, just go scroll through the list of awards this movie took home. Jazz, normally a subject I would make an effort to avoid, is the heart of this film about young Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) who is accepted into the Schaffer Conservatory's award-winning jazz band as an aspiring drummer. Andrew loves jazz drumming, spending 100% of his waking hours listening to it, talking about it, or practicing it (except the odd occasion when he's not taking in a classic movie with his dad). Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime, yeah? Enter Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is the head of the band and a jazz aficionado, and he does not accept anything short of perfection. His methods are unconventional and, well, downright abusive. He often recites a tale of Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head and how it supposedly inspired Parker to become the legendary drummer he's known as, and he has apparently based his entire teaching method on that one moment. If Andrew wants the opportunities being in Fletcher's band will afford him, he is going to have to push himself to the limit and beyond. But that sort of dedication doesn't come without a price and the strain of it all becomes overwhelming. Does Andrew have the drive needed to become the jazz drumming legend he aspires to be? Or will he fold under the pressure?Only two things matter in WHIPLASH: characters (well, two of them anyway) and drums. Story is a distant third. As amazing a film as WHIPLASH is, it's not for the creative plot. There are very few risks taken story-wise and there are minor subplots that are picked up and dropped almost immediately. Melissa Benoist is lovely as Nicole, a movie theater concessions employee on whom Andrew has a crush, but as soon as he gets the nerve to ask her out he's breaking up with her a scene later. Her entire role in the film was to demonstrate how Andrew is willing to sacrifice parts of his life to ensure his focus remains on drumming and only drumming. There's a slight callback to it later with a bit of "too little, too late" closure, but that's all it amounts to. No, this movie succeeds because of Teller and Simmons. I primarily know Miles Teller as being the guy I'm always confusing with Shia LaBeouf (could've sworn he was the sidekick in CONSTANTINE) and Sam Huntington (could've sworn he was the sidekick in Dylan DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT) but, apparently, I've only ever actually seen him in PROJECT X (which I don't remember) and now the 2015 reboot of FANTASTIC FOUR. So he couldn't have picked a better film to break out of obscurity with. He's pretty awesome here. His character, Andrew, goes through a distinct change over the course of the film. Well, that's not accurate. More of an awakening. I'm almost certain the Andrew we see at the end of the film as within him the entire time, and it just took Fletcher to drag it out of him.And speaking of Fletcher, J.K. Simmons totally owns this role. It's no surprise the man won a boatload of awards for this performance. The man's intense. We've seen a taste of it with his hot-tempered J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series but here he's given a fully realized character to sink his teeth into. Fletcher is abusive, no argument there, but he's got a personal ambition he's striving for. Every insult flung, every chair tossed?he's doing it for a reason. Jazz is his life. His entire world, really. He is on a personal mission to find the next era of great jazz musicians; he just has a less-than- legal means of weeding out the losers. Teller is fantastic in the film but Simmons steals every scene he's present in. His character is just incredibly interesting. The big climax of the film between Andrew and Fletcher, of which I'll spare any details here, is one of the most intense sequences I've seen all year. And I can barely stand jazz. Just as FOXCATCHER did with wrestling, WHIPLASH takes a subject about with I care almost nothing and turns it into an amazing film. The movie plows along at a breakneck pace and I'm engaged from beginning to end; by the time the end credits roll and we're let loose, you'll almost feel whiplash yourself. Big recommend from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this picture coming out about a year ago as I write this, and the last few months demonstrating how more and more college campuses are clamoring for 'safety zones' and students finding even the slightest uncomfortable situation offensive, I have to wonder how someone like Fletcher would survive as an instructor today. As Fletcher, J.K. Simmons manages to demonstrate all the worst characteristics of, forget about teachers, but of human beings altogether, on a par with someone like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, and he had family members executed when they couldn't keep a beat.Seriously, even though I don't have a musical ear per se, how can one tell if a drummer is drumming too fast or too slow after two seconds, maybe less? That poor schmuck in the orchestra who got tossed when the other guy was the culprit probably went and committed suicide too if the story had followed him out the door. Fletcher's rants about perfection went beyond summoning inspiration and degenerated into nothing less than physical and emotional abuse. That Andrew put up with it and devised his own revenge may not have been the best way to deal with a monster like Fletcher, but at least he came away with a shred of dignity.This is an intense film and if you're not expecting the drama that goes with the story you'll be taken aback by the characters, situations and language that emanates from the players. I think it's a worthwhile film to see if one can keep a perspective on what it takes to achieve mastery of a subject without falling victim to abuse and risking one's health and sanity to do it. Both of the principal players are dynamic and excellent in their roles, and I couldn't help noticing that in certain scenes, Miles Teller had just the right look for the lead role in a movie about the Elvis Presley story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Protagonist Andrew Neiman is a student at New York's prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. He plays the drums and dreams of being one of the great jazz drummers. The next step to greatness is getting into conductor Terence Fletcher's studio band; Fletcher invites him to attend but when Neiman has difficulty with the tempo of 'Whiplash', Fletcher tears into him? at one point he even hurls a chair at him! It is clear that Fletcher expects perfection and will bully and cajole his students to get it. Neiman refuses to back down and practises till his hands bleed? will this be enough to impress Fletcher though? Every student knows that they are replaceable as despite his reputation everybody wants to be in Fletcher's band.Before watching this film I'd seen a few clips and thought I probably wouldn't enjoy it as Fletcher appeared to be such an overbearing character? who wants to watch somebody being bullied for an hour and a half? Thankfully when I watched it I realised it was far more than that; Fletcher be one of the most intense teachers depicted on film but thanks to J. K. Simmons's brilliant performance he isn't unlikable? his methods may be questionable but it is clear that he wants to help his students discover their inner greatness even if only a few will have what it takes. Miles Teller is also great as the equally intense Neiman? the student who will do what it takes to be the number one drummer? even playing minutes after a car crash that leaves him battered and bloody! The intensity of the music matched that of the situation. The rest of the cast are impressive enough but it is these two that the viewers will remember. Overall I'd highly recommend this although it is an intense experience and won't be for everybody.</fullReview>

I've never taken a moment to listen to jazz and I probably never will, do not let the dull sounding plot of the movie stop you from watching this great film. I had intended to watch Whiplash for a while but never got around to it until last week and I think I have the beat and rhythm of the film still stuck inside me. You'll almost die in anticipation at the final scene, some of you might but I did not and it meant I got to watch the whole enthralling 107 minutes of film again the very next day. If at least one of your eyes or ears work and you like film, this is a must-watch.Bravo Chazelle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The speed of the drumming was the speed of my heart throughout this movie. Intense thing to say right? The feeling throughout the entire movie is something that you wouldn't want to let go off, but once the film finished I had to go back and watch it once more. It might seem crazy but this couldn't be anymore true. These feelings of intensity and edge-of-your-seat sensation is something that only comes around once in a while but it is derived from the sensational performances of Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Miles Teller plays the character of Andrew Neiman who is a highly self driven person with dreams higher than what most people would be able to visualize. No matter what people tell him he continues to practice over and over with the end goal of being the fastest drummer he can be. It may seem like an easy character to play but it truly takes an actor who can show determination, least of all play the drums. Without a doubt the performance of Miles Teller is exceptional as it is a rares occurrence to see a person able to show blood, sweat and tears so realistically that it makes a person think, "have I ever worked that hard?" J.K. Simmons plays as Terrance Fletcher who is almost a morally bankrupt person. He is the brick wall holding Andrew back from achieving great success, but without him the movie would have no jazz. When the audience is first introduced to Terrance, he comes off as a person who gives everyone a shot at joining the best conservatory, however, throughout the movie he shows his full colours. All he was asking for is perfection from Andrew, but does throwing a chair at him help? Though to fully understand what I am talking about, the movie must be watched.Overall, great movie, great cast line up, and exceptional dialogue, almost unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of us have watched J.K. Simmons sail through film and television for years. And to think, all this time he had this kind of ability. It reminds me of Melvyn Douglas, second banana in dozens and dozens of films, playing similar roles, and then suddenly becoming one of the greatest actors of our time with Hud and I Never Sang for My Father.Miles Teller and Simmons star in "Whiplash," from 2014 and, no surprise to anyone, Simmons took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He plays Fletcher, a sociopathic, manipulative instructor in a music conservatory who abuses his students psychologically. Teller plays a young man. Andrew, who wants to be a great percussionist, better than any of them, including Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker. He tolerates the abuse and becomes arrogant with success, only to be humiliated by Fletcher. It is a deep psychological battle of wills.If you haven't seen the film, you will not believe the lengths that Andrew goes to in order to be on stage as first drummer.There's a nice turn here by Paul Reiser as Andrew's father.Having been a musician myself and having been psychologically abused by several teachers, I can tell you that this kind of torture is terribly destructive. The only survivors are people who are driven and willing to give everything they have to their music at the expense of everything and everybody else. Is Andrew one of them? You'll have to decide for yourself.Great soundtrack, powerful acting from Teller and Simmons -- this low- grossing film proved to be a real winner.</fullReview>

Simmons and director Damien Chazelle hold nothing back as Fletcher degrades Teller's character Andrew in one of the most intense battles of wills in cinema. An incredible finale leaves nothing to be desired and makes this movie absolutely top class.

		<fullReview>WHIPLASH Film Review by Adam GonzalezIf your a jazz junkie or drummer, then your going to love WHIPLASH. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, WHIPLASH is about a young drummer named Andrew Neyman (played by Miles Teller) who gets accepted into the best music school and lands a spot in the most cutthroat orchestra band led by conductor Terence Fletcher (played by J. K. Simmons). Andrew aspires to be one of the greats like his idol Buddy Rich (arguably the best jazz drummer that ever lived) but knows that this dream comes with heavy sacrifices. Andrew soon realizes that Fletcher's methods are extreme and pushes his students to the edge of their ability, sometimes with harsh consequences.Being a drummer myself I can totally relate to the competitive nature of being the best musician you can possibly be. Fletcher's obsession with winning prestigious competitions clashes with Andrew's drive to be the best. The hostility of Andrew and Fletcher explodes on the screen physically and musically with amazing drum solos and physical altercations. This film is a musical roller coaster ride that will have you on the edge of your seat the entire way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Word Review: Compelling, Scorching Tension; Incredibly Acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Damien Chazelle helms this blistering musical drama which borders on thriller, as student and ambitious jazz drummer Andrew (Miles Teller, The Spectacular Now,) is accepted into a prestigious band where conductor Terrence Fletcher, played by JK Simmons (Juno) will do anything to realise a musician's potential. Whiplash might just be the top contender for the most intense film I've ever seen. Which is surprising, and doubly hard, as the stakes here are nothing more than playing music in a small university jazz band. But due to Chazelle's assured direction, the quick editing of Tom Cross and Sharone Meir's expert cinematography, Whiplash is ensured to be the very definition of nail-biting. Surely one of the film's main attractions is the performances, namely Simmons' Oscar-winning performance as the terrifying conductor Fletcher. Playing like an X-rated version of his Spider-Man character J. Jonah Jameson, Simmons' performance is not only note-perfect but also a welcome subversion on the "inspirational teacher" cliché which sees him motivate his students with vulgar insults, a constant stream of profanity, and frequent violence. It says something about how good Simmons is in this film that he manages to overshadow the fabulous Teller, who like Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler was shamefully spurned by the awards ceremonies. The character Andrew is desperate to succeed, to go out with a bang and to be known and admired, rather than to live a long life full of regret and anonymity. Armed with this perspective he goes head to head with his nightmarish conductor, wearing his raw ambition on his sleeve in his endless desire to emulate jazz's Bird himself, Charlie Parker, and be the best in his field. And this has connotations beyond music. Chazelle's masterful films deals with obsession and the price of success, asking important questions about whether a hobby has a point when one does not enjoy themselves doing it. The other aspects of Whiplash are similarly marvellous. I found a new love for big band jazz music, especially Caravan as Fletcher's band plays the music, superbly compiled by Justin Hurwitz into a soundtrack that is toe-tapping and memorable. The conclusion put many off but I on the other hand laud the courage behind leaving it ambiguous and not feeling the need to dumb it down by explaining everything that happens after the climax, just like The Gift (2015). The one solitary thing that could be construed as bad about Whiplash is that the supporting characters, specifically Melissa Benoist's character and Paul Reiser, father to Andrew, seem underwritten and underdeveloped, yet this seems only to be a side effect of the full force, complexity and development of the two central characters. Basically all of Whiplash is a triumph. If you haven't, go see it now as it is a furious, intense and dramatic piece of art that definitely rests among the very best films of 2014, if not all time. 97/100.</fullReview>

Another great performance was the main character Andrew played by Miles Teller. I was very impressed with his performance and feel like he could be a very successful actor in the future. I was also surprised with his performance as I had never really heard of him before and didn't quite know what to expect. Overall Whiplash is a brilliant movie and is a must watch with some nail-biting tension, amazing performances and a fantastic ending. Seriously the ending was one of the best endings I have seen in a while. It is also faultless which is why I am definitely giving it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a movie that dazzles you the second it starts. "Whiplash" from new filmmaker Damien Chazzle astounds you with ferocious energy and insightful messages that deliver an independent cinematic experience rivaling any from this century. Rising star Miles Teller gives his best performance to date as a young drummer whop enters a highly rated music school in New York, only to encounter a terrifying and over the top demanding teacher played viciously by J.K. Simmons, you know, that guy from the "Farmers" commercials. Not only does Simmons have the screen presence that dominates each scene, he spits out his dialgoue perfectly and give facial expressions that raise the hairs on your spine. "Whiplash" is beautifully made, giving a film mostly about substance and character development a dazzling array of sights and sounds, from the high-speed editing to the perfect sound mixing that gives high-class jazz music. This film tackles to growing rate of competition and asks the question of how much it takes to succeed, and what kind of teaching and coaching is necessary,. With a shocking ending sequences that raises multiple questions, and a number of heart- racing scenes, "Whiplash" stands out as an electrifying piece of modern art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has very little to do with drumming. It has even less to do with Jazz. Musicians who complain about the factual - and musical - inaccuracies of this film are kind of missing the point.It's a drama. The script is excellent; the characters are as deep as you could possibly wish for; the acting is absolutely top notch across the board; the pacing as the story develops is wonderful; the ending will leave you hot and cold at the same time?Yes, the Charlie Parker story is apocryphal - but from a storytelling point of view it's perfect. Yes, Miles Teller's miming is sometimes rather off, but by Jove you can see he's put some bloody work in and taken it seriously. This isn't like Julia Stiles in Save The Last Dance. Incidentally, J. K. Simmons' piano miming is pretty on the money.If you don't know anything about music, you'll love it. If you're a musician, you'll love it if you've got any bloody common sense and remember that it's a film.Verdict: It's the Jazz version of Amadeus. So what if it's inaccurate - IT IS A BRILLIANT FILM.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J. K. Simmons aka. our ruthless subconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is probably one of the greatest film in 2015 and I think all of the 3 Oscars were a deserved reward. Although all of my musician friends who have seen Whiplash told me that if you had learnt music almost for 8 years, you knew this film has no point with music.Nonetheless this is not a mistake it's only a fact about the background. Let's talk about the one of the biggest reason why Whiplash is amazing nevertheless J. K. Simmons. His character is more then a sadist teacher,he's trying to pursuit a goal:being somebody who won't be forgotten. This intent isn't unknown for the humanity, it's all around us. I share the opinion that to be someone who dies earlier but the name will forever in people's mind is better, then to die unknown and lost the name. It's weird but I think there are a lot of people who want to be someone, do something important, and live forever in the other's mind. Miles Teller is this endeavor, and he's our goal to be someone. But there is no possibility to make his dream come true as long as he got an invitation from Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) to play in his orchestra. This is a true possibility which can change his live. If sometime you can get a chance from life you should accept it and don't throw it away. Andrew (Miles Teller) accepts the possibility and he's an ambitious guy with concrete goals to have a bright future. Fletcher is the one who can make him being this person. But Andrew gave up. He threw away his dreams and he tried to be a prosy man like everyone else, but he got another chance. During a person's lifetime, it's rare to get one or maybe two great and life-changing chance so it's important to recognize it and use it if you once got it.</fullReview>

Thankfully, my second "review" is simply to share my appreciation for one of the most captivating films i've ever had the privilege to watch. The film captures so many of the tortuous and joyful aspects of obsession &amp; passion and the relationship between two people who challenge one another. More than that however, it's been channelled into a exceptional, and hugely accessible film which i urge you to find the time to watch if you haven't already.

		<shortDescription>Probably My Favorite Drama/Music Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start off by saying that Drama is one of my favorite movie genres. The only other film I saw that includes music and Drama is Grand Piano, which is also a fun film. Now let's talk about this film: Great opening scene, really good comedy, action-packed, excellent story, really terrific performances and awesome new actors I'll be keeping an eye on them from now on. This movie has a great message to it, which is to never quit practicing and keep working until you reach your target, and it delivers it so well. Now let's talk a little about why I didn't give it 10/10: Sometimes there are moments in the film which you're not so sure about what you just saw, and times when you're like- Why ? So apart from those things, overall I had a really good time watching this film, and I'll definitely say you should check it out if you're into Drama movies, with musical elements and an important message executed very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotions Were Touched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a fantastic movie, wonderfully shot and the story is compelling. I must say that if you compare this film to action/crime movies, nothing is really happening but a story is there, a story build mostly on emotions rather than actions. It's not about a boy and what his life is in a certain stage rather about a boy and how he feels in a certain situation. If you can appreciate art, simplicity, authenticity and films in general, then this is the movie for you. This film made me feel all sorts of emotions I was not prepared to feel when I pressed play. Sadness, anger, frustration and actual hate for whom would be categorized as the antagonist, yet at the end you can feel the satisfaction of achieving what the character has, as if it was you. Every time his feelings are hurt, so are yours; each moment his dreams are crushed you could swear is your dreams that have been crushed. The story is very true to life as well, is not a sci-fi that can be possible in maybe a hundred years from now, is something many can relate to already and others can take this film as a preparation to what it would be like if they are ever in that situation. This film is different, refreshing (although painful in the chest from all the feelings at once) it is a piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting take on the classic story of getting through by effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've seen this before, usually in sports movies, where some guy or girl is set to get through some very difficult competition and works their ass off to make it. Whiplash is not really about the finishing competition, but about the mindset of the person wanting to "get there" and of the teacher who needs to find a prodigy to validate their own efforts. Most of all, the film is extraordinary for making the viewers ask themselves if there is a line and when can you consider it crossed, in both pupil and teacher.Other than that, though, I felt that the movie was close to mediocre. J.K. Simmons seems to have won the Oscar as recognition for all his acting jobs, because I can think of several actors of the top of my head that could have played the same role. It wasn't such a difficult role, not compared to the one Miles Teller played, at least. He did all the drumming scenes himself and 40% of the drums in the soundtrack are him playing.The ending, of course, is epic and the "training montages" are pretty convincing of the will of the music student, but the music does not convince me. I am not into jazz, but I've scoured the 'net and it's not either a spectacular style of music and even the musical references are not that accurate.Bottom line: could be inspiring, but I rather appreciated it for the guts to make the viewer consider boundaries, for them and others, in the teaching process, rather than for any spectacular acting or scripting. Worth a watch, surely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised how truly great this film is; the story is captivating, powerful, intense and inspirational. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, something unexpected happen. Both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons gave incredible performances. J.K.'s portrayal of Fletcher, the music instructor, was remarkable (a well deserved Oscar win).The scene when Andrew (Miles Teller) is at the dinner table with family spoke to me. Andrew is passionate about music, but his uncle doesn't care to try to support Andrew and his music. All he seems to care about is football like the world revolves around it, which makes Andrew seem like the "black sheep" of the family (which I can relate to). Andrew will stop at nothing to accomplish his dreams.Overall, Whiplash is quite the roller coaster of ups and downs with a great inspirational message about following your dreams and overcoming obstacles that get in your way. In my opinion Whiplash should have won the Oscar for Best Picture over Birdman. This film gave me a newfound respect for drummers. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Sadly, i cant understand how its rated so well. It just didn't click with me at all. Thought it was pretty predictable and so it lacked depth. I even found myself tuning out. Most of the acting was fine to good just didn't think the story was good enough. The young lad was fine at acting but the character was just not great. I didn't connect with the character or acting. It was just a wishy washy insipid type of experience. Maybe its because it came along with some other good films and I thought how is it even being mentioned!

If you are used to your typical musician against all odds film, be aware that this is anything but this blueprint you are used to.We're talking about a power performance (no pun intended) that has been already spoofed a lot, only to show the love for the passion this project had. It is so draining watching some of the stuff, you can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been for those involved.

JK Simmons, as fantastic as he is, is matched by Miles Teller. The only other film I had seen with Teller in it was Divergent, which I didn't care for. He wasn't poor in it, but his character was pretty one-dimensional. Here he has made a statement to the industry, demonstrating that he is already an actor of great class.This is how inspirational films are supposed to be made. It is what must be a true representation of how greatness is suffered for and earned. I believe this because for not one second did I want to be in Andrew's shoes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having now seen all of the Oscar nominated films for 2014 this was by far and away my favourite. Brilliant story, superb direction and mesmerising sound along with some very strong performances, notably from J.K. Simmons as the bullying music teacher, in a role reminiscent of R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket.The intensity picks up as the film progresses, and as a viewer it is impossible not to be pulled in to the sometimes harrowing scenes as the young drummer attempts to appease his dictatorial teacher.I always enjoy a film that attempts something different, and I feel that this film more than does this. I implore anyone who hasn't seen it to watch it if they can. I would be very surprised if you were disappointed.Damien Chazelle appears to be an exciting young director and I am really looking forward to what he does next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alternate View on the Whiplash Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, can I just say, what an unbelievable film. Every aspect of this film is incredible. The acting, the cinematography, the editing, the choice of shots. Every single part of this film is on another level to practically every other film of recent years. There are so many memorable moments as well, the fast panning between Fletcher and Neyman in an incredibly intense scene towards the end. When Neyman puts his phone down whilst driving his car, and looks up and suddenly gets smashed into by a lorry, and of course who could forget the look on Fletcher's face in that final shot.Anyway, I first watched this film just after it had been released, and it blew me away. So it's criminal really that I've only just got round to watching it for a second time. But this time, I had a thought about the ending and whether there could be more to it than actually meets the eye.Just to recap, Fletcher offers Andrew the chance to perform in his new band at a festival concert, and when Andrew gets there Fletcher is explaining to the group how certain members of the audience only have to make 1 phone call, and suddenly you could find yourself at one of the top music collages in the country if you perform well on stage. However, he also states that a bad performance could end their career, and that these people 'never forget'. Andrew walks onto the stage and sits at his drum set, before Fletcher explains that he knew it was him who testified against him, which consequently lead to Fletcher losing his job. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band in a new piece, which Andrew has never played before, and doesn't have a music sheet for, and therefore Fletcher looks to have ended any chance Andrew may have of becoming one of the 'greats'. However after originally walking off stage, Andrew returns, and plays "Caravan", a tune that he knows well, before ending with an incredible drum solo. Fletcher is soon won round by Andrew's superb ability, giving him a nod of approval, and proud smile before the film ends.One interpretation though that crossed my mind, is whether all of this was actually planned by Fletcher all along. Fletcher himself admitted that he pushes people to their limits. And even though he despises Andrew for testifying against him, he realises that Andrew is his best chance of finding a 'Charlie Parker'. So he purposely sabotages Andrew initially, but knows full well that Andrew will not discouraged, and will instead be even more fired up to give the performance of his life. Andrew then goes out and does that, believing that he is not only getting back at Fletcher for in his mind trying to ruin him, but also knowing that there are influential people in the room, and that this will be his only chance to get into Lincoln Centre, which he is so desperate to do. But Fletcher had planned this all along, and the nod that the 2 share towards the end, is a nod of recognition from Andrew to Fletcher of way of thanking him for the motivation he needed to give the performance of his life, and Fletcher's nod is in acknowledgement that Andrew has managed to become the pupil that he has desperately been searching for all these years.Just a thought really, I don't actually believe that alternate ending myself, I just thought I would share it as it is an interesting prospect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intense Piece of Film that is sure to Delight all Moviegoers,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is an fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I was in shock and awe throughout, it is a very intense film as we get a very deep look inside the life of a young man wanting to make a career in playing the drums, there are many scenes that are so powerful that I found myself not taking my face away from the screen for one second, not even blinking, I don't want to spoil any of these but I will just say that there is nothing like them in any other movie. I think we could have been given information about Fletcher, I know that we are following Andrew, but I would have liked to known some more about Fletcher's past and what made him turn out this way, it would have made J.K. Simmons performance even more substantial than it already is. The performances made this movie, as it is one that would have been terrible without great acting, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller hit it out of the park, I was always saw Simmons as a versatile actor, but he was never really given roles where he could really shine, he is given that opportunity in this and uses it to full effect, he is terrifying and in a strange way very likable, Teller also delivers a spectacular performance, particularly in parts where his character lashes out, and he clearly put in some serious drum lessons, which is very impressive. Dramatic, intense and all around outstanding, three Oscars dosen't lie, I would recommend Whiplash to all moviegoers. After enrolling in a music conservatory, a young man aspiring to become a drummer is challenged by his mentor to be the very best he can be, at whatever step it may take. Best Performance: J.K. Simmons Worst Performance: Austin Stowell If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brutal Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A previous reviewer mention Full Metal Jacket, the Kubrick film about the vicious Drill Sergeant who dehumanizes his men, but one of those men in particular. However, in that movie, the young Marine probably had no business being where he was. Here, a young man wants to be a drummer who will be remembered, like Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich. He has awesome ability which is recognized by Fletcher (Academy Award winner J. K. Simmons). His method involves brutalizing and horrifying his charges and humiliating them in front of their peers. People know he's the best there is, but what a price to pay. He justifies his intensity by repeating some incident where another band member threw cymbal at Charlie Parker's head. While this is good entertainment, if we were to look into the successes of many great performers, most of them were never terrorized. The drumwork is astounding, but all the bleeding is pretty far fetched. Ask some drummers you know. The final scene is all Hollywood as most reality goes out the window. Still, if you buy into the possibility that such a psychotic can command these musicians, it's very entertaining. The drumming is beyond belief, although I'm sure there were some strategic cuts along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Student We meet a music student. He has an intelligent face and is a talented drummer. His demeanor and expression are less advanced: awkward would be a better description here. Clearly, the demeanor is not at par. The Master noticed this dichotomy. A brief conversation between them in the corridor and the Master knows what makes this particular student tick. He expects all his students to bare their souls. Time to throw chairs. A multi-level battle for mastery begins; Master versus student, student versus student, student versus himself, versus his expression, through music. This is not an adventure movie; it is not a high tech FX galactic battle. But there is a battle, there is tension, and lots of it: when it's time to perform; time to plunge in; to hit the right notes; to suffer the blisters and play till you bleed. Metaphors abound: losing your head; give them enough rope to hang themselves; being left hanging; off with their heads. Decapitation comes in many forms.This movie grabbed me from the start. I identified with the characters. They go through the paces of finding one's place, making sacrifices, perfecting oneself in whatever endeavor we choose in life. It is a backdrop, a reference point, a moment in time we all live, as we strive to excel and express within our chosen adventure. Dare to be great.' This movie certainly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dizzying and intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film primarily focused on the relationship between teacher and student at a prestigious music school, Whiplash actually feels like one of the best American thrillers in years. Yes, it is about one young man's struggle for absolute greatness in his field and poses questions about how hard one should push themselves to achieve artistic integrity, but it is the verbal sparring between lead Miles Teller and the scene-stealing J.K. Simmons, and the sight of Teller pounding his drums to dizzying effect while his palms gush with blood, that really causes the heart to race.Andrew Neiman (Teller) is a first-year jazz drummer attending Shaffer Conservatory, playing as an alternative to core drummer Ryan Connolly (Austin Stowell). When his class is paid a visit by notorious conductor Terence Fletcher (Simmons), Andrew is given a brief moment to shine and is bumped up to Fletcher's class with immediate effect. He again plays as alternative, this time to core Carl Tanner (Nate Lang), and believes he's bound for greatness until he is asked to perform 'Whiplash', a particularly tricky - and extremely fast - jazz number. When Andrew struggles to keep to Fletcher's tempo, he has a chair hurled at him and is emasculated in front of the class. And so begins a tirade of mental abuse as Andrew strives for his master's acceptance.J.K. Simmons quite rightly won the Best Supporting Actor at this year's Oscar's for his terrifying portrayal of a passionate yet sadistic man. His drive is his desire to a find a new Charlie 'Bird' Parker, who, as the legend tells it, had a drum symbol hurled at his head during a disastrous early career performance. Rather than being deterred, Bird practised his arse off and, of course, the rest is history. Fletcher beats down on his students, shattering them with verbal assaults as they try to prove themselves worthy. Only Fletcher doesn't seem to have a limit; they are not on his tempo, as he repeatedly tells them. He wears black t-shirts, has muscly arms, and a giant, zig-zagging vein pulses on his forehead. He is a formidable presence, highly charismatic and, in the end, almost sympathetic.Teller is impressive too. A drummer in real life from a young age, he appears in every scene of the film, and pours his blood and sweat (literally) into the extremely physical musical performances. His showdowns with Fletcher provide the spine of the film, but the intimate moments with Andrew alone, pounding his drums as his face twists and turns, that provide the brain. Is the sacrifice truly worth it? We see Andrew push his body to dangerous limits, isolate himself from his family and his concerned father (played by Paul Reiser), and call for an early day on a brief relationship with a girl from his local cinema (Melissa Benoist). Just when the plot seems to be steering into conventional territory at the finale, director Damien Chazelle provides one of the most satisfying climaxes in recent memory. It's a dizzying orgy of cuts, close-up's and sheer style, which is as toe-tapping as it is awe-inspiring.</fullReview>

I see Whiplash listed, i briefly see it mentioned before i left London so clicked yes and it begun to play.What i didn't know was how good this film was, what to expect and most of all the impact it has left on me. Keep in mind i am watching this on a British Airways screen in economy class. So about 12", the saving grace my Goldring NS 1000 headphones keeping the plane noise at bay and providing me with the amazing audio..The movie hits hard, i was sweating. I paused the screen to accept my in flight meal, only then realizing i was pulsing with sweat dripping from my head. This contributed to the lack of fans on the BA flight, but also the music/acting and dam right brilliant directing. This movie is in a class of its own, it can stand up among any great movie and still leaving you with something new.10/10, watch own and cherish this original and pure cinema brilliance.</fullReview>

This film definitely captured the essence of what goes on in real schools when such passionate professors teach. Oscar well deserved for Simmons! Miles Tedder is such a revelation in his role. It's clear that he allowed himself o be fully submerged in his character. What I really loved was how he was able to step to separate himself from his previous roles. This was as raw of a performance as you could have gotten. In the scenes where the camera was close up on his face and you could see the drops of sweat, that was absolutely beautiful. It allowed me to see and to feel how much emotional impact the films circumstances had on the character. Miles definitely needs an Oscar in the near future because he is brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damn intense, relatable movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie speaks to me on two levels: both in the kinaesthesia of having a movie about the making of music AND as a well-made movie. I found out this movie only cost 3.3 million to make (including promo). I say this because it is shot AND edited more professionally and properly than most movie with a budget 30 times higher.Everything about this is amazing. The script is written with memorable moments and set-ups, such as Andrew's break-up with Nicole that serves as allegory to his unhealthy devotion to Shafer Studio Band, the dinner table and of course the now infamous "rushing or dragging" scene, which I frequently refer back to with some of my students. I teach guitar, so it's a little different. The soundtrack too is amazing, and I would recommend buying that along with the movie. Acting from the cast is above and beyond, mainly from Miles Teller who shows a passion and intensity I didn't see from many characters in 2014, Paul Reiser as his supporting yet unexceptional dad and Glee's Melissa Beniot as Nicole, his girlfriend whom he seems to be less focused on than the drumming.This brings to the ONE thing that this movie will be famous for the years to come. It's two words: J.K Simmons (could technically be three I guess?). This guy who has been the reliable, dependable good actor for 20 years brings his character acting chops in bags for this role. The character Terence Fletcher is utterly quotable, memorable but more than that, he seems real. This could easily have been a one-dimensional yeller but J.K brings him far enough into that mode to be threatening and cajoling to Andrew but also seem humane enough that when he finds out about Sean Casey's death the tears are real, or when he opens up to Andrew about his success in bringing the best from people, he is empathetic. Finally, at the end of the AMAZING Caravan performance at the end of the movie (which is edited, mixed and shot perfectly), the approval that Fletcher gives feels earned and we are happy for it: if we did not get those emotions, then the movie wouldn't have worked.Whiplash ROCKS! I recommend that you rush (not drag) out and buy it just before it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2014 was one of the of the best years for movies in quite a while;from big budget science fiction like Interstellar, to small indie horror films like The Babadook. However no film from the past year has affected me in such a way as Whiplash.Whiplash follows the story of Andrew(Miles Teller), a recent high school graduate who joins one of the top music conservatories in the country. He becomes the drummer for the extremely prestigious jazz band, where he meets the demanding and intimidating teacher, Fletcher(J.K. Simmons). Fletcher demands nothing short of perfection from his students and he pushes Andrew to limits not even he thought were possible. This film comes from rookie director/screenwriter Damien Chazelle, and boy did he make an impact. A big part of the reason Whiplash worked as well as it did is Chazelle's masterful direction. Never in my wildest dreams did I think a movie about jazz drumming would be even slightly tense. I'm happy to say Chazelle proved me wrong. He uses the camera in such a way to really make the intense sequences work, close up shots of Andrew's face as he profusely sweats while beating the drum as quick as possible, cuts between Andrew drumming violently and Fletcher screaming at him work so well it's hard to put into words. Whiplash asks the challenging question of how far is far enough to achieve success. How far are you willing to go? How far are you going to push someone? And it leaves the audience thinking about the film weeks after you watch it. It's been five months since I first saw the film and it still haunts me. Everything about Whiplash is as close to perfect as it can get. Teller and Simmons gave stellar performances, earning Simmons his first Academy Award for best supporting actor. Chazelle, although young, has already given us one of the best directed and written movies of the 21st century. I can honestly say this is one of the small handful of films that can be described as perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit the first time I saw the trailer I wasn't that interested into watching the movie but when the title appeared everywhere I gave it a try and I do not regret watching it. From my point of view, 17 old girl that loves drums, it is an amazing movie because I love how much effort Andrew puts into his passion and even if it gets out of hand I admire how much he loves it and wants the part. The end is AMAZING I've never loved an end as much as i love this one, and don't get me started on the acting... EXCELLENT!! The movie was EXCELLENT from the screams to the physical act its outstanding. I understand that many people found it a little bit "psycho" but to me it was just Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for Charlie Parker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Whiplash last night and have not been able to stop thinking about it. After reading many of the reviews I felt compelled to write.In art there are many ways to communicate and tell a story. And in film, there is a difference between a realistic docudrama and an allegorical tragedy-drama. I think it is obvious that liberties were taken in how the filmmakers explored the inner world of that obsessive drive for perfection, and yet not knowing or caring where that elusive sanity line is drawn. Do cymbals sweat? No. Are the bloody and raw hands realistic? Probably not. Would a teacher be allowed to continue with this type of punishing behavior in an American school today? No chance. Would like-minded obsessively driven students allow themselves to be treated so abusively in order to be the best? Perhaps...yes, I think so. The writing was wonderful with several non-formulaic turns and the ending, to me, was simply inspired. From the pivot point of the father saying, "Let's go home", to the symbolism of the film going briefly dark and, to the close-up of the smile...it all worked. But it was the fact that only after our teacher finds and touches greatness, along with our protagonist crossing the line into greatness, were they able to transcend all previous human experiences and feelings, which was at once, fully realized and truly sad.Whiplash. Perhaps only on a superficial level is the movie's title the same as the jazz song they were playing. Or it could also have been called, "Searching for Charlie Parker".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An enthralling story, set against the backdrop of a prestigious music school. It covers one young man's attempts to reach the top of the musical industry, and the band leader who may be his ticket, or his nemesis.A deeply psychological drama, it explores issues like ambition, obsession and power.Has a few interesting twists too, especially towards the end.Not perfect: some of the twists aren't consistent, character-wise. The final scene overplays the conclusion and is too neat in some ways. Despite this, it missed having a final word on one or two of the themes, leaving these as secondary considerations in favour of a more Hollywoodesque ending.Decent performance by Miles Teller in the lead role. Superb performance by JK Simmons as Fletcher, the band leader. He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a performance that is searingly intense and perfect for the character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so this is how I should start: Whiplash is not a film for students; not for MY students, anyway; it is restricted R because of the bad language and violence; I'm not the best example to promote restrictions, since I took my then 13 years old son to see Dredd ? which was interdicted to minors ? and we almost got kicked out of the cinema. Finally, since I demanded I was a teacher of a respected school and therefore knew what I was doing, I convinced the security at the cinema to let us in ? not that they had any other choice, with me playing the controlling mother and teacher and with my son carrying bags of popcorn and cans of cola and looking like a whiny. Would I do it again? No way ? it was not very flattering for me. Would I still let my 13 year-old watch a very violent film? Of course I would ? it was a good film and we enjoyed ourselves a lot ? it was what we call quality time with your children. Now back to business ? I was talking about the best film of the year in my humble opinion ? Whiplash. I know I'm not a professional film critic, although I can brag about me watching more than 10 films a month, which would make me a very good film fan. Is it enough to make me a film critic? Hardly. Is it good enough to make me worthy of an opinion? I think it is. I wanted to watch Whiplash first of all because it had a number of nominations for awards, and second of all because of my youth years when I used to listen to a lot of jazz and even used to go to jazz concerts and festivals (I worked for a local newspaper back then and I think my highest achievement was an interview with Harry Tavitian ? a famous Romanian jazz pianist and singer).But Whiplash is not about jazz ? not entirely, anyway. What is it about then? How far would you go for perfection? How do you draw the line between a strict, demanding teacher, who wants the best from their students, and a torturer, sadistic psycho? I couldn't. I have to say I was fascinated by the character of Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons' performance is Oscar granted). He is a monster, but one whose ultimate aim is getting the impossible out of his students. Andrew (Miles Teller) is his victim ? an innocent drum player whose dream is to become more than his father ? a failed writer, but his passion to achieve perfection quickly drives him to obsession, as his demanding instructor keeps on pushing him to the edge of both his ability and his sanity. I remember feeling the need to listen again and again to genius dialogues ? the most quoted one being There are no two words in the English language more harmful than, 'Good job.' Ultimately Whiplash is a story about the cost of greatness and how far would one go to achieve it. Whiplash is a thriller as much as a meaningful piece of storytelling. It is a masterpiece. I saw myself as Fletcher, a demanding teacher who wants more than possible from his students, and as Andrew, a student who would sacrifice everything, from his romantic life to his safety, for the sake of art. It is a film that made me wonder after so many years of living in a sordid, materialistic, sick and unhealthy society: What ever happened with art for art's sake?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One That Should Have Had Better Oscar Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was THE BEST film of 2014.The editing of this film gives it a very fast pace, making it seem as though an hour and forty minutes goes by in just under an hour. It is easy to see why this film won the Oscar for this category.What I find really brilliant is the use of sound in this film. There are great moments when the diegetic music within the film blends with and transitions into the score of the film. There are also super tense moments highlighted by haunting moments of total silence. As I have said before in other reviews, the lack of an element is just as effective as the element itself. The greatest "silence" in this film is probably at the conclusion of this film when we see the two main characters' sets of eyes as they look at each other, now working together, understanding each other.The acting is beyond phenomenal. J.K. Simmons, one of the nicest guys in Hollywood is absolutely terrifying, but you also can't help understanding where he comes from when he explains he is trying to get students to recognize their potential. If abuse is what it takes to create the next Charlie Parker, it is justified since you are giving the world the next great artist. As for Miles Teller, his acting apparently fell short of Oscar-worthy. I feel his performance was somewhat underrated, but I do not believe it was his fault - some of the dialogue his character had was a little flat from time to time.The best aspects of this film happen in scenes that involve music performance, whether it is a rehearsal, a competition, or what will become one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history. In scenes that examine Teller's character outside of his music performance there are strange and somewhat forced aspects. I nearly roll my eyes at the scene where he talks with his family (I think) about how they should pay more attention to him because it is all about the rivalry between sports and the arts. I like it because it shows how much of a jerk Andrew can be, but it practically force- feeds the audience the idea that the arts are not respected enough. However, I suppose this is realistic dinner conversation, especially the dialogue coming from Andrew.This is a movie with very few flaws and I give it my highest rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies that I had not even heard of going into Oscar season. When it was nominated for Best Picture I had no idea what it was about. And I am so grateful for that. This movie flew under the radar and turned out to be the best movie of 2014. The performances are outstanding. Miles Teller does such an excellent job as the leading role. But J.K. Simmons absolutely steals the show with his performance, which I think is the best of 2014. Simmons is electric and unstoppable; you can never take your eyes off him. The music was amazing and I even own the soundtrack and absolutely love it. One of the best soundtracks in years. This is one of those movies that I think people will be talking about for years to come and it will be regarded as the movie that should have won Best Picture. Also, I think "Not my tempo" will become a very memorable movie quote. Make the list again AFI. You cannot go wrong with this movie. Even the casual movie viewer will love it. It will leave you exhausted (in a good way) and keep you thinking about it long after you have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Neiman is determined to become perfect jazz drummer. This freshman at Shaffer Conservatory is convinced that the genius and terrifying instructor Terence Fletcher is the key to achieve his only desire, so he puts everything, including personal life and even his own sanity and on the edge to earn his conductor's approval and respect. This movie makes you smile, cry, sit back, stand up, get mad, worried, satisfied! It forces you to go throw every single test with Neiman, and even feel Fletcher's games on your head. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, the story is strong,the performances are great -which makes the story even more solid- special mention to an outstanding JK Simmons for the perfectly played character. To me, it felt like less than 30 minutes because it entertained me to the last second. Perfectly fitted my tempo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever felt that a movie was so intense and magical, that the very thought of it gives you goosebumps and chills in your spine? That you wanna keep watching endlessly all day long without wasting a moment? That literally makes you a character in the movie rather than one in the audience? Well, there may be quite a few such masterpieces and the recent to join my list of those unique cinematic experiences is Whiplash.A movie which keeps you engrossed on it all the while but feeds you a thousand thoughts to think about after the credits start rolling. The main objective being pushing yourself beyond the limits. JK Simmons' Academy winning gray-shaded role may seem villainous to some and heroic to some. But as explained in the bar/club scene, he is a symbol in making you realize your full potential and breaking all barriers. Not only in music but life as well. Choosing music as a medium to inflict this thought made it sound way too cool. I wish this movie had made it much more bigger and won a few more Academy awards. There is simply nothing to talk negative about or complain in this movie. Be it the power packed acting battle between the charismatic JK Simmons and the meek Miles Teller, the immensely grasping screenplay, the fittingly thunderous background score or the cut throat editing, everyone has drained and pushed their limits for this movie. The ultimate final fifteen minutes - the part where you forget to blink your eyelids, deserve a special mention. It will be considered as one of the most epic finales and be remembered for a long time. Arguably one of the greatest movies I have ever scene in my life. The projection of a simple story with a powerful moral in a such an intense manner is something really unique and movies like these are hard to find nowadays. All cheers to Damien Chazelle for giving such a spellbinding masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting for there to be too much hype and I wouldn't like it as much, but this is excellent. JK Simmons gives his best performance, Miles Teller is not talked about as much, he gave an excellent performance too. For a movie about a jazz band it was intense. I saw American Sniper and I was on the edge of my seat more in this movie. I have more respect for people in jazz band now. I like to think of this as the effed up Karate Kid. I could say this is one of my new favorites. I enjoyed the first and second act, but the third act is one of the best third acts I have ever seen. I can't wait to see what the actors will go on to next (Please have a cameo of JK Simmons in the next spider man movie). The way it was shot was intense too, if you don't like movies with insults then you will hate this. The only problem I had was the car crash, if they took that out it would be one of the few movies without a problem. Other than that this gets a 10/10, if you haven't seen it yet then go buy it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely... Mesmerizing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this film may not be to everyone's appreciative capacity. It is almost like a gourmet meal; sustenance people enjoy more once they have acquired an understanding of its purpose and place in culture. In this case, a deep appreciation for music, specifically jazz music, is that requirement that will ensure you maximum satisfaction while watching this film (that's not to say all others will be unable to appreciate it). The music, however, isn't the only highlight of this movie. There is so much that this feature has to offer its viewers. The plot is interesting,original, unpredictable,and intense. It inspired nervous emotions to fluctuate through my veins, as it kept me fully focused throughout. The edits where outstanding: fast at times but not shaky, brief but long enough for the mind to comprehend the scene. This greatly enhanced the dramatic sequences (Oscar for editing well deserved). The music, as mentioned - brilliant and genuine. The actors were unbelievably believable, to the point where I was mesmerized by their performance during certain scenes, being wrapped up into the world I could only see through a screen. It is a rare occurrence for me to be so absorbed into a fictitious world like that. The acting was so convincing I would forget the ever-present thought in my mind while watching movies - "these are only actors imitating." Perhaps even the real actors had forgotten about that fact, for they must've believed in their own roles to pull off such a stellar performance.I have just skimmed the surface. Hundreds of words of praise come to mind when writing this review but I will finalize this critique with the following statement (contains semi/mini-spoiler):The last 10 minutes of this movie contain the most intense and emotional battle without words that I have ever seen in a movie. The emotional level is so high that there is no way your mind won't be left blown by the overload of pure filming achievement you had just witnessed. The edits, the sound, the acting, and the nervousness and curiosity it inspires, all add up to an ultimately climatic ending to an already vigorous passionate film. My favorite type of movies are ones that blow my mind, which is usually achieved through the heavy use of unpredictable plot twists and difficult metaphors. This one blew my mind but in a way I never conceived possible, and therefore deserves a perfect rating from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, this film got a lot elements very right. It's musically dynamic and puts emphasis on how far people are willing to travel down the rabbit hole to achieve GREATNESS.It is a powerful process when one is inspiring greatness in another or having it pulled from within them by someone else. Especially when the driving force on both sides of this equation is rooted in a, "WHATEVER IT TAKES" mentality. And at the end of this process you are rewarded with something very, very special. This is the dualism of what "WHIPLASH" gives us.Fletcher's (J.K. Simmons) use of unconventional practices and gritty, unbridled approaches as an instructor with expectations of absolute perfection. Coupled with Andrew's (Miles Teller) fierce and unquenchable desire to produce said perfection at all costs, is very nicely displayed here.Both Simmons and Teller deliver the goods as we take this journey into what seems to be a very over the top aggression to performing exceptional jazz music. As a student, Andrew lives, eats, breaths and sleeps drumming to the point of self mutilation. His desire to be, "THE BEST" is superior to all else in his world. His only obstacle is the limitations in himself and the opposition his instructor, Fletcher, offers up in abundance. While Fletcher, the instructor/conductor is a perfectionist to the degree of being a narcissistic A-Hole. Deep down he wants the best out of the students who he deems worthy enough to be a part of his musical world.As the two entangle into this love hate relationship. Andrew begins a destructive evolution as a person and an aspiring musician. Taking blow after blow; with some self inflicted and others delved out by Fletcher himself. Andrew begins to detach from the world around him as he fights to become relevant in the eyes of his instructor. While Fletcher seems to want to break Andrew's will to achieve greatness to the point of involving others at his disposal to generate as many devices as possible to push his limits to the brink.Eventually the culmination of events crescendos to where both Andrew and Fletcher are brought back to reality. Each of them suffering a life altering aftermath to their destructive ways. They fatefully meet again some time after and all the blood, sweat, tears and tension laid out between them up to this point, lays the grounds for the MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES to ensue.Fletcher and Andrew collide in front of the world as they take the stage. Fletcher takes his shot to put Andrew on his knees for good only Andrew doesn't go down so easily. Hes cut form the same cloth as his instructor and the two reach deadlock. Their commonality is what wins in the end as we are subjected to the sweet spoils of their war.The ending result is a furious delivery of jaw dropping AWE. As the student becomes the master, we get exactly what they both have always wanted...absolute perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite Movie of 2014!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash, a powerful and emotional film for first time director Damien Chazelle. Whiplash is about a boy named Andrew (played by Miles Teller), who enrolls as a freshman at Shaffer college aspiring to be the next greatest jazz drummer. Andrews journey to greatness is hindered by a non supportive family other than his father, personal internal conflicts, and most of all his hard knock jazz teacher/mentor Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). The film goes through Andrews freshman year at Shaffer and his battles trying to impress Fletcher to allow him to stay on his jazz band.This movie had me feeling all sorts of ways. Personally, it hit home with how Andrews family never really supported him with his dream that he was very skilled at. His aunt and uncle focused more on their sons who played football when in reality he was much better than them and was most likely going to be more successful. I think a lot of people can relate to that theme that some passions of yours your not going to get many supporters on and your going to have to power through it your self through all adversity. This movie also has the motivational factor of an inspirational sports movie like Rudy. Seeing the scenes when Andrew is just pushing himself to his physical and mental limit just to make it in the industry are the best scenes in the movie. Watching him play the same beat over and over while his hands are bleeding just to get the pace right and impress fletcher motivated me to go and do something with my life and put as much effort into it as Andrew did. He showed that if you put your mind into a passion you can make it even in such a hard industry of being a drummer as cliché as that sounds. Going into this movie I expected a performance from Miles Teller that would be rather forgetful. The only other movies I had seen him in were 3 lackluster performances in equally not so good movies Divergent, Project X, and the Footloose remake. His roles in all 3 had been small parts, but he still didn't steal the screen like some actors with small roles do, so he had some big shoes to fill. After watching this I was blown away by his performance. At some points throughout it almost felt like he wasn't acting there was just so much raw emotion coming from him. The other thing that astonished me was his ability to actually play the drums. If that kid hadn't become an actor he could have easily pursued a career in music he's very talented. If he has another good performance in the upcoming fantastic four movie I could see big things from him.Now if you've seen the movie or even watched the Oscars, you know where the big chunk of my rave for this movie will be. He won best supporting actor in a performance I hadn't seen from a supporting actor in a long time and his name is J.K. Simmons. This guy just kills it in this movie. Whoever came up with the idea of casting him is a genius. The way his character physically and mentally torments his whole class and the way J.K. puts all of the emotion to show just how bad of a man Fletcher is is astounding. His performance is both hilarious with his creative and crude insults and terrifying at the same time with how how intimidating and scary Fletcher is. Watching him made me think back to the drill sergeant in full metal jacket, probably the best part of that film. Except the drill sergeant only gets 15-20 minutes of screen time when Simmons get a full hour and a half to show off his skills. If you had to pinpoint one part of this movie that makes it stand out as one of the best 2014 had to offer J.K. Simmons is your reason. To wrap up, this movie is my personal favorite of 2014 even though birdman is a close second. This movie thrives on individual performances but also has great writing, editing, and a stellar soundtrack, all of which were nominated for Oscars. The movies impact on the viewer is one you rarely find. I watched it a week ago and it still is on my mind today. Whiplash is definitely re watchable and one I will most likely be picking up on blu ray. This movie is on par with some of the best music movies like Almost Famous and This is Spinal Tap. My overall rating for this movie a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genius work of art, that dares to try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash was not just one of the best movies of the year, but possibly one of the best sports movies ever. That's right, sports movies. Whiplash did so many great things, but what was truly amazing watching it, was not just how good it was, but how in this age of movies it was able to transcend genres and portray a truly original and thought provoking theme, when most other movies don't even try. Never preachy, it presented a truly unbiased look at the question "How much push and pressure, is too much when trying to create talent and when does it go over the line?" The question itself is not an overtly new or creative one, but rather the fact of a movie trying to portray that and doing so, so well is. The movie follows a not all that great aspiring drummer at an elite music school, (Miles Teller). After being discovered by the infamous top jazz conductor at the school, (J K Simmons), he is promoted to the top jazz orchestra in the school. There, J K Simmons character runs the class with a beautifully acted satanic cruelty, as he attempts to push people past their limits and abilities. As Teller's character is pushed harder and harder, he falls into a crazed and exacerbated state where everything from his girlfriend, his dad, and his houses cleanliness falls away as he practices non stop, with that dream of becoming the next Charlie Parker. What we get, is a haunting and genius story that explores with flawless execution, how hard can, or how hard should a person be pushed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fifty shades of Fletcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are really into S &amp; M then forget that ultra tamed Grey movie and get into the real thing with this one. If you ever saw Fame (seventies original), you know that success in the artistic world is just pain. Even in something not so popular as the Jazz and classic music world; becoming just an orchestra member means suffering. Whiplash is the story of a drum player trying to succeed with a very extremely perfectionist but sadistic teacher. Did you ever consider drums and important part of a concert ? Yes; they are there but usually just as an accompanying instrument. Aside from STOMP; I really never care about a drum solo concert. Well, this movie will prove you wrong. There are moments in this picture you will hold your breath for the length of the scene; and some bloody moments will make you look elsewhere; but it is not an horror movie; is just a story of fighting your own frustration for some and for others about the God complex.J.K. Simmons is outstanding as Fletcher; the narcissistic and sadistic teacher; but Teller is also excellent as a mediocre person trying to get some kind of triumph in something. Whiplash is dark (there is almost not scenes with natural light) and humor is completely absent; but it will make you vibrate on pure emotion on the last scene the way you never imagined just hearing drums.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash serves as an exploration of how far one is willing to go in order to fulfill his/her ambition. What an exploration indeed. Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman, a promising drummer who enrolls at a music conservatory with a dream of becoming one of the great drummers. In the conservatory, he is trained along with a group of other students by abusive and mean instructor Terrence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. Acting first; Miles Teller is absolutely mesmerizing as Andrew Neiman. This is a movie where he gets an opportunity to showcase his acting skills and his subtle turn as a very ambitious student is the heart of the movie. However who the critics are lauding at is J.K. Simmons as Terrace Fletcher. Simmons gives one of the best performances of the year. His villainous performance would make all the other villains in 2014 hide in their closet in absolute fear. His layered character becomes increasingly complex and tragic towards the end, which just cements his caliber of acting.The script is marvelously written with impeccable pacing and dramatic narrative elements. A few minor events in this movie feels contrived but I only realized that minutes after exiting the cinema hall and forgot it immediately. The humour is dark and unrelenting, often reminding me of the insults in the show Sherlock, which are both funny and mean in equal measure. The last 15 minutes of this movie deserves a mention for it's sheer tension. The tension first felt when Neiman is first performing in front of J.K. Simmons' character is doubled here. Director Damien Chazelle masterfully directs this classic 15 minutes with visual grace which is complemented by a fascinating jazz score. The finale borders on the edge of realism but watching it Neiman giving his blood, sweat and tears in order to achieve his dream is fascinating to watch. Overall, it is a movie not to be missed. Gripping, intense and emotional, the harrowing Whiplash finds stars J.K. Simmons &amp; Miles Teller in top form and Damien Chazelle dazzling in his full feature film debut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an epic dramatic tale that may go down as one of the best ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have finally had a chance to see whiplash and not only is this my favourite film of 2015 so far but this may be one of my favourite films of all time. The premise sees a young drummer trying to succeed in music school until he meets a teacher who has an extreme method to get the best out of his students. I have seen miles teller in a few things and I have always thought he was decent but I never knew he had this dramatic performance in him. He is utterly fantastic in this film and he is ridiculously relatable because we have all wanted something so bad in our life that we will do anything to get it and this is how he feels in this film and you totally believe everything about his character. Now there is only one other character that matters and it is the breathtaking performance by JK Simmons, he is a complete douche but part of me understands why he is so extreme. He is trying to get the best out of his students and he truly believes that the only way to do that is to be this extreme, also his and tellers chemistry is off the charts and phenomenal. The story is intense, inspirational and emotional, forget that it is music this story represents how much you want something and how much you are willing to sacrifice to get it. The clashes between the two is as intense as anything and you really believe these characters motivations. The end of this film is also perfect for what this film was going for. The script is fantastic everything that teller and Simmons says makes you believe their characters and feel like they are real people that you either want to love or hate. The style is fantastic because it really needed a physical and psychological style to make this film as dramatic as possible and it definitely succeeded in that department. Overall this is a completely epic film that must be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An independent masterpiece that will make you feel assaulted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash", an independent film shot in 19 days, was one of the genuine pleasures of 2014 in film, telling the story of a promising young jazz drummer named Andrew at a prestigious music conservatory in New York being driven to manic ambition by a sadistic conductor/instructor named Terrence Fletcher. But it's so much more than a Faustian morality drama in functioning as a metaphor for the choice of reaching for the highest fame and success or being happy with the simple joys of life.It stars J.K. Simmons who reminds me of the great George C. Scott in that his performance here as a sadistic college band instructor is almost as intense in displaying unleashed machismo as Scott did playing General Patton. At this writing, the 2015 Oscars haven't been given out yet, but Simmons couldn't lose the Oscar if he dropped his pants on Hollywood Boulevard.Writer/director Damien Chazelle drew from his own experiences in High School (hopefully exaggerated!) to make a film that virtually assaults the viewer as if he were a punching bag continuously being pummeled by an enraged boxer. After an almost unbearable nine-minute drumming climax, the viewer will probably stagger out into the street, then spend days getting over the experience. By pushing the envelope almost to the unendurable, Chazelle has carved a cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently had a tremendous experience when I went to see 'Whiplash', and first I'd just like to recommend this to... well everyone!The acting in this movie was just astounding, I don't know much about Miles Teller but i'll be keeping an eye out from now on. Having only seen J.K Simmons in the spider-man franchise before I was extremely surprised, In what was easily an Oscar winning performance he delivers a terrifying combination of intimidation and a need for perfection that will have you captivated for the entire movie. The direction was also absolutely phenomenal, every scene was written and crafted to perfection, the entire movie was exactly like music, flowing up and down with a steady beat to it and all the components worked brilliantly off each other. By far, the best thing about this movie was its intensity. I couldn't believe myself when watching, I was on the edge of my seat completely wound up at the suspense and unpredictability, helped a lot by Simmons dazzling performance. To me the entire movie was designed as a crescendo of suspension, taking us viewers on a powerful journey through what most people struggle with in life, the desire to be great.The theme of losing oneself in the pursuit of greatness was stunning, the way Fletcher worked each of the drummers off each other, put Andrew through physical and mental hell to the absolute brink of sanity was incredible, each time he worked to the point of bleeding, pushing himself to the limit and beyond astounded me, and was an excellent example of incredible film making.I obviously can't cover everything because there was just so much good in the movie, just so many intricacies that worked towards a film that surpassed what was expected of it. I thoroughly recommend this movie, definitely a new favorite of mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is only the second movie of 2014 that overly exceeded my expectations (first one being Nightcrawler). Being neither a fan of jazz music nor finding a much stellar cast in this one I must say I was highly impressed. Whiplash is a tightly wound experience that puts forth the intense relationship of a student with his literally brutal mentor. Whiplash provides ample scope for deep study of its characters and their psychology.Miles Tellers plays Andrew Nieman an aspiring Jazz drummer who is confident and talented. One day at his music school the iconic main school band teacher Terrence Fletcher (memorably performed by J.K. Simmons) observers Andrew practicing. He sees some spark in Andrew but isn't fully convinced of what he is capable of. Fortunately for Andrew on another fine day Fletcher storms into their class asking each student to play what he wants and Andrew impresses playing something which he is very good at. Flecther brings in Andrew into the main school band as an alternative drummer. In order to become the main drummer Andrew has to face the seriously exhaustive and physically draining teaching methodology of Fletcher. Fletcher's motive behind all this is to find the next big jazz star in his students for which believes one should defy the limits. While Andrew is highly motivated and inspired climbing the ladder of success slowly but is unknowingly degrading his personal life. He is unable to keep up with his girlfriend and also ends up with family issues. Whiplash tries to portray what we mind end up with trying to achieve perfection in our field. The ultimate successful moment is very rewarding but many of the earlier hardships and sacrifices get overshadowed.Breaking down the various aspects of the film, the thing that stands out is the performances by the two leads. Miles Teller driving the enthusiasm and energy into the character of highly motivated drummer is really inspiring. While J.K. Simmon's pitch perfect portrayal of the furiously scary mentor was raw and brutal. Even if the character was unforgettable one thing I would like point out is that it would have been better if more light was shed on Flethcer personal life which would have made his character slightly more believable. After the acting, the terrific music and soundtrack absolutely sucked me into the jazz atmosphere.The track 'Whiplash' over which Flecther throws a chair at Miller for not reaching the perfection is mesmerizing. Whiplash has made me a fan of jazz music out of nowhere. The editing and cinematography is splendid which we can see that in the intense and energetic drumming sequences which will keep you glued to the screen. The final drumming sequence in the climax was so exhilarating, it gave me goosebumps. Director Damien Chazelle who wrote the script himself keeps the screenplay focused on the two main characters. The story is quite unpredictable and you can expect some twists here and there. I found it hard to believe when I read somewhere that the whole film was shot in 19 days. Nothing more to say. Excellent.To sum it up, Whiplash is one movie of 2014 not to be missed. 2014 has been really outstanding with films like 'Boyhood', 'Birdman', 'Nightcrawler', etc. and now another gem called 'Whiplash'. I am thankful for witnessing such quality film-making. Excellent performances with absorbing story and direction plus the jazz music on top of it made Whiplash a memorable experience which stayed with me for hours after finishing it. It is energetically inspiring and heartfelt. Don't miss it.RATING: [4.5/5]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly made film with two incredible performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the Oscars less than a week from today, I recently notched another best picture nomination under my belt in Whiplash. This film is undoubtedly the most under the radar of the eight nominations, receiving very limited release in theaters and netting around $10 million in the box office to date (one of the lowest grossing best picture nominations ever), but boy does it deliver. Whiplash comes to us from the essentially unknown (his only other directorial work was drama Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench in 2009) Damien Chazelle. Chazelle is a 30 year old Harvard grad who catapulted in to the spotlight with one of the best films of 2015. With edge of your seat drama and two incredibly strong performances from the leads, Whiplash tells the story of how far one drumming protégé will go being pushed by his mentor.The film opens with a dramatic approach shot that shows the star of Whiplash, Miles Teller playing one Andrew Nieman, vehemently practicing a piece on his drum kit. The soon to be 28 year old actor shows his authentic drum skills (most of the drumming you'll hear in the film is actually Teller) when he is interrupted by an eavesdropping instructor, Terrence Fletcher, played by the heavyweight J.K. Simmons. Fletcher immediately sets the tone for the relationship between Nieman and himself in this intimate opening scene that plays out in the rest of the film. Fletcher is seen standing in the doorway, obviously listening in on Nieman's practice session. He immediately tells him to play certain pieces certain ways to assess his skills, and from this the film unfolds. Nieman looks to Fletcher with clear reverence and respect, yet Fletcher, while realizing the potential, dehumanizes Nieman. This back and forth between the two leads, and the psychological and physical journey of Andrew Nieman that a brightly shining Miles Teller takes the audience on is terrifyingly fascinating. We learn shortly thereafter that Nieman has been without a mother for most of his life, and is very close with his father, as they are seen together in multiple scenes. Fletcher then invites Nieman to start rehearsing with his renowned studio band, which is where the film really starts to heat up. Fletcher and Nieman begin to clash in ways that make it tough for the viewer to watch at times, but in an oh too familiar, relatable, and dramatic way. With dark humor, an elegant score with fantastic scenes of musicianship, two Oscar worthy performances (Teller did not receive a nod from the Academy, but Simmons did and leads the pack to win best supporting actor), and a plot with character development and an ending that will absolutely leave you wanting more, Whiplash is a brilliant film. It is profoundly entertaining, yet perhaps more importantly, it stirs up emotions within the audience as to just how far is too far for one music teacher to push his protégé, and how much can, or should, a student in this situation take to be great? Whiplash sees the affirmation of the acting prowess that is JK Simmons and also the breakthrough role for an alarmingly talented Miles Teller. An absolutely can't miss film that is more than worthy of a best picture nomination this Oscar season. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Films Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb film led from the front by Miles Teller in the performance of his life, and a show stealing performance from JK Simmons who will be sweeping every award ceremony this season. The film does have some peripheral characters and story lines but in essence, its the JK and Teller show.The tension that these two build up in the film with their heated exchanges and aggressive bullying tactics is ridiculous. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the whole movie just waiting for this volcano to erupt.As with many films though, a lot of crescendo throughout the film can lead to a real let-down of a finale as the tension built up just fizzles away like a firework that didn't go off. This is absolutely not the case with Whiplash. The finale is anything but a let down. I'll say no more on that subject.All in all it's a fantastic film and is well worthy of its recognition by the Academy in this year's Oscar reckonings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHIPLASH Damien Chazzelle's Whiplash tells cinema's most compelling and engaging story of 2014. Despite a synopsis sure to put audiences to sleep, Whiplash's amazing performances, masterful direction, and powerful themes create a movie guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Whiplash follows Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a gifted young drummer attending the nation's top music school. Neiman struggles to make it into the school's most prestigious jazz band where he encounters a vicious Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), reminiscent of the drill sergeant of Full Metal Jacket. Neiman's desire to be the best there ever was and Fletcher's non-conventional methods of pushing him to his goals create a friction between the characters. This fuels competition and dialogue whose explosiveness are rarely seen in modern film. In his pursuit of greatness, Neiman must let go of what he loves as he and Fletcher clash in ways that will get your heart pounding. Whiplash is a story of true passion, start to finish. The propulsion for such a driving film is the fantastic performances by its cast - namely that of Simmons. Simmons becomes completely unrecognizable; it took less than a minute of screen-time to forget about his portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spiderman (no small feat). Simmons draws from the tough J.J.J. to create a character whose intensity steals the show. Commanding the screen in every frame he's on, Simmons' energy and sincerity is palpable. The depth of his character is shown in the third act, where we're introduced to entirely new layers of his mind. Teller also gives the best performance of his career, elevating a character from a good drummer, to a prodigy driven by genuine passion. Scenes involving both Simmons and Teller are nothing short of electrifying. Their presence and ability to play off of each other converge in scenes that are shocking, yet feel natural. Teller's best scenes by far are the ones in which the dynamic between he and Fletcher is shown. Simmons brings Teller to an entirely new level of acting prowess in their scenes together. Images of Andrew Neiman's intense and bloody practices are also well done by teller and provide viewers with pathways straight into his mind. The believability and intensity of the acting talent resulted in a movie that engages on many levels. I found myself unable to leave the theater for even a second; even though my popcorn was in need of a refill. Chazzelle's ability to create tension was unrivaled in 2014. Every creative choice contributed perfectly to the narrative as it flowed from start to finish. The score, an eclectic mix of jazz classics, paces the film as we progress. The title track Whiplash is incredibly fitting. Viewers are pulled back and forth as they progress through this swift emotional ride. The music does the job of a film score ? it fades into the background, furthering the visual sentiments passively. The cinematography stylistically inventive while technically classical, much like many of the jazz greats Neiman attempts to emulate. In terms of pacing, the film is absolutely perfect. Each scene wets viewer's appetites, leaving audiences begging for more, even until the credits roll. Chazzelle propels the story forward with tension that locks your eyes to the screen. In his second feature-length film, Damien Chazzelle more than impresses - he astonishes. Masculine virtues like tough-love and a visceral desire for greatness are explored in depth, and treated with real artistic regard. The harsh relationship between Fletcher and Neiman, especially when juxtaposed against his weak and infinitely apologetic father, give insight into raising a child with drive. The ideas of fatherliness we gain from both Fletcher and Mr. Neiman are sure to appeal to sons and fathers alike. Andrew Neiman's pure white-knuckled desire to be the best fuels a fire within him burning so bright Fletcher notices it from seeing him play only a few seconds. The film explores what it takes to realize dreams like Neiman's, and it even touches on contemporary society's over- sensitivity and issues with political correctness. These themes are well discussed in film, and the uniqueness of its messages is certainly one of Whiplash's greatest merits. The ability of Whiplash to outline specific commentary without the use of text at the end (I'm looking at you, The Imitation Game) is commendable. He crafts a narratively subtly, yet each point he makes is impactful. Although it deals with motifs and ideas with tact and expertise, Whiplash doesn't hit as hard emotionally as many other films this year. While it is gripping, and we become invested emotionally, we're not left contemplated the ideas he presents to us. The present commentary consists of respectful exploration, but doesn't hit hard, and doesn't delve into any particularly important topics of the time. Perhaps this will prevent it from becoming dated, but the movie just doesn't quite stack up to other films of its year like Boyhood narrative-wise. As a drummer myself, some inconsistencies between what was being played and what I heard were apparent. When compared to other movies, however, the film did an incredible job. Teller appears to actually be a much better drummer than I am. In part the movie, the blood on Teller's hands was poorly done and obviously fake. These flaws were very minor and didn't ever detract from my experience. Unfortunately, one scene in particular removed me from the movie. Neiman has a conversation with his family over dinner that in an attempt show his lack of regard for those around him ends up awkward and labored. Aside from that specific scene, there wasn't a weak performance to be found. Overall Whiplash has to be one of the best films of 2014, close to I?árritu's Birdman. The nearly impeccable acting, artful directorial choices, and thematic weight combine for an immensely and excitingly electric enjoyable film. What flaws exist are too small to have a significant impact on my experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply amazing! i love everything about this movie! The director obviously had a musical back ground and understood exactly what was going on musically as the scenes were shot to the music. The tone was great. Acting was great. A definite must watch and my personal pick for best picture although i doubt it will actually win *cries softly to self* Miles teller is a great rising star and i look forward to seeing him in other things although I'm not sure how Fantastic 4 will go over just yet as it has received almost no publicity other than one decent trailer. Any way, whiplash = great movie. I am super conservative with my 10/10 ratings and i have only given about 4 movies that rating out of the 426 I've watched and whiplash definitely earned it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director/writer is only 29!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this movie as I was randomly watching movie trailers one day. I found the trailer and I was hooked. I watched this movie the next day and it just blew me away. It is quite shocking to know that the director is only 29 years old. You won't guess that after you watch this movie. This movie has basically 2 actors, Miles Teller &amp; J.K. Simmons. Rest of the cast don't even matter. Both gave equally great performances in their own right. Miles Teller(Andrew) as "a kind of shy but committed to his goal" student and J.K. Simmons(Fletcher) as a ruthless, brutal, perfectionist teacher.Miles did a good job as a student and this movie will be one more feather in his cap in his still very young career. The character of Fletcher is a bit grandiose but looks brutally believable because of a very stellar J.K. Simmons performance(and he rightly got nominated for Best Supporting Actor). His character is plain ruthless. I had a lot of hatred towards his character throughout this movie. He should get bigger roles in the future.It would be a shame if JK Simmons doesn't win an Oscar for this.Overall this is easily an Oscar worthy material but I doubt if it will win. Still, it is the best movie I watched that released in 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Who knew drumming could be so tense?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you need to know about Whiplash is that it is going to exceed your set expectations so just sit back and enjoy watching it. I first heard about Whiplash whilst I was sitting in the cinema next to my friend about to watch the third installation in The Hobbit trilogy, when suddenly the trailer came on and that infamous drum role began, slowly getting quicker, whilst segments of the film perfectly spliced in time with the drum role, building up the tension with it. In that 2 minute and 8 seconds trailer, it managed to be more intense than the entire Hobbit film, and when I realised that, I knew this film was going to be something else. And does this film deliver, yes it does. You're transported into the world of Andrew (Miles Teller), the young first year jazz-student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory Music School, who wants nothing more in life than to be remembered, to be one of the greats. This character trait at times can be hard to watch as you just think what an ass-hole this guy is being, but that's the beauty of it as compared to Terrance Fletcher (J.K Simmons) he looks like a sweet and innocent like lamb being barked abuse at by the Big Bad Wolf from every children's story with a twisted sadistic side. But Miles Teller does capture the reclusive, I will be the best no matter what, loner type perfectly, watching him practise drumming and seeing the sheer amount of stress and pain it had on his life, just made me think now that's what you do if you are going to be the next Buddy Rich. But then there was J.K.Simmons who really took this role and owned it, from his first appearance on screen to his last, he had complete presence in the film, he was intriguing, brutal, and I felt I had to look up to him and wanted to hear his approving words of my Andrew. There were moments where he made me spit drink out my mouth with his quick but merciless lines that you could tell would shatter your bubble of confidence and leave you a hopeless, stuttering,mess. To moments when you just thought what he was doing was just wrong, and you couldn't believe that someone like that is actually allowed to be a teacher. The sound for the film was superb, having headphones plugged in whilst watching it was the best choice I have made in a long time. Whiplash and Caravan were perfect choices for songs to make cover versions of and really who knew drumming could be so intense? Director Damien Chazelle did a fantastic job with his debut directorial film, as the film was stylish with perfect smooth editing to link shots together for nice transitions between each shot and fitting well with the timing of the music to make you submerged into Fletcher's band. Which really contributed to the overall adrenaline rush you get from this film. Let's not forget that he also wrote the screenplay, which is also very well done, with a good pace to a satisfying ending, with surprising moments happening when you least expect it which is how the mood of scenes suddenly flip. All in all, this is an well-crafted, interesting concept, and highly entertaining film, which will have movie enthusiasts in awe and casual watchers with something new to try out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? I am an avid film lover and have been a musician for as long as I can remember. Though not helped by my early onset Alzheimers at the age of 21. I am just going to say it how it is. I saw this in the cinema and I couldn't talk for about 20 minutes after it had finished. I actually wept with how much I enjoyed this film. This film since I saw it became my favourite film of all time. I have seen many people complain about how this film is unrealistic, and while it has never been pushed to physical abuse I have been emotionally abused in a similar way with a music teacher of mine and I have had a separate teacher that has been known to throw chairs at people so from those 2 experiences combined I can actually see this film as being realistic.J.K. Simmons as of yesterday received a BAFTA for his role and I will be incredibly surprised if that is the last award he receives for this role. His angry bursts will initially have you laughing but as they become more and more intense will have you more and more fearful for the characters. Those of you that love J.K. Simmons as much as I have done over the years in Juno, Oz and the Spiderman trilogy will also finally be happy to see this man given the opportunity to be recognised to the great actor he is. Miles Teller was an actor I had not seen before and I think he played the part wonderfully changing between a character fearful of Fletcher to his arrogance and fluctuating between the 2 for the full movie. I think both actors need a special mention for the hours they put into their instruments running up to the film so, no, their playing on screen wasn't perfect, but you have to remember that they are actors who are meant to be playing as some of the best musicians in the world and Simmons and Teller can probably play their instruments a lot better than the best players in the world can act and gave a more than convincing enough performance. The script is wonderfully powerful, exploring the different takes on Fletcher's theory of how to create such a great musician. But as well as Fletcher's horrific torturing of the characters you also see his soft side in 2 scenes in particular (seeing his friend's daughter and talking to her before the 1st show and when he plays the piece of his former student). both showing that he is a human and though his method was horrendous, his motive was to produce greatness. The story is also not your typical story because although some things do go well there is a nice balance in story telling where things do not go the way you expect which is the key to good story telling.The camera work is fantastic, specially, in my opinion, in the last performance of the film. The soundtrack and sound editing are just perfect! This was the first film of Damien Chazelle that I have seen but from the fantastic work this man does with a pen and camera it will not be the last film of his I will see.I would encourage anyone to see this film. I can't tell if I wouldn't enjoy it as much as a musician but it can't hurt.</fullReview>

And then, when you finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail." and if you remember the ending scene since Parker is idolized during the whole movie, it's not weired that the director choosed to create and build up the final scene around this very quote.

		<fullReview>Whiplash, a story about a young jazz drummer whom tries to seek approbation and commendation from his austere and stern teacher which was played spectacularly by J.K.Simmons. All the cast has done a terrific job and every scene from the movie are shown/elucidated flawlessly.I should seriously apprise you guys that the cameras in this movie are really something or should I say that it is more "detail" which is a good thing. Besides the camera, the dialogs are beautifully done apart from the strong language, there are few lines from the dialogs that can be contemplated as an inspiration quote.Whiplash isn't just a movie, it is a paragon and archetype of discouragement. You guys might think that "what does it have to do with discouragement?" Sometimes discouragement is the key to success.It is an excellent movie with a solid story that had made an impact on me.In a nutshell, Whiplash hits the spot; NAILED IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is about a young musician, Andrew aka Miles Teller, who wants to achieve greatness and he might be able to do that under his mentor, Fletcher aka J. K. Simmons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fletcher is relentless in his pursuit of pushing his apprentices to do more and more even up to the point of breaking them. Andrew is humiliated, verbally abused at, mentally exhausted, physically threatened, all for the purpose of making him achieve his full potential. To find the next big thing in Jazz music. Fletcher wont stop at anything less than perfect. The final performance is gripping, tension between Andrew and Fletcher at its peak, it can't be justified in a line. Fletcher: There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'. Its no wonder that it got 5 Oscar nominations. And J.K.Simmons chances of getting an Oscar are quite bright!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy, intense and shocking movie about young jazz musician student.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would never believe, that its possible to make so intense music/drama movie like this before you have seen it.Andrew(Miles Teller) is a young musician student who wants to be one of the best and fastest drummer. Teacher Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) has a little bit crazy role again. He is known to me from prison series Oz.Everything in this movie is very authentic and intense. Music, hearing and other senses as well are present all the time. Shockingfactors in this movie points either bad, good or grey area of getting better.Teachers methods reminds military. Way to be the good is steps that are made of sweat, blood and doing again. Its just music that really matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young drummer Andrew (played by Miles Teller) is determined to do everything in order to achieve his goal. Becoming one of the greats. But when his dream becomes influenced by an instructor named Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons) who isn't easy on anything and that let Andrew stand on the edge.The story is flawlessly fluent and an achievement in every level of storytelling. And in really a short amount of time we come to learn and understand the two main characters in the movie. That's already an accomplishment in a movie which is shy of 2 hours runtime. Also, the exhilarating unexpected story is beautifully made and outstandingly exciting till' the very last seconds.The double twisted plot ending of Whiplash is just simply amazing. At one moment you can scream at it, and thereafter it is just speechless.Whiplash is inspiring, motivating, electrifying, emotional, a self reflection movie. A absolute triumph. A true hit with the drumstick on the drum.The most important thing about the movie was to me, the deeper meaning behind it. If you willing to do / give everything in order to fulfill your dream, you can also suddenly lose everything at once. But never stop trying and don't ever give up, because that is the key to success.And what better way to deliver this message than with music?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash: Teacher Abuse has never had such rhythm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.K. Simmons has always been "that guy in that thing" and he really has been in a lot of things from Spider man, Farmers Insurance commercials, to a family sitcom about a blind guy. And while Simmons has been around awhile, he hasn't really been given anything to sink his teeth into. In comes young upstart writer/director Damien Chazzelle and his jazz ensemble epic "Whiplash".Whiplash has the unique honor of being the least profitable film to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards (along with Chazzelles script and Simmons for supporting actor) but for a film that appears so small, it is one of the biggest and most epic viewing experiences of the year.One of the reasons I loved Whiplash is that it surrounds a subject matter that I have little knowledge on, the world of surprisingly competitive jazz ensemble. Jazz music is all about precision, technique, and patience and all of those are on display in explosive fashion. The story follows a young aspiring jazz drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) who dreams of greatness while at the Schaefer Music Conservatory in New York. All of the students hope to join the exclusive Jazz ensemble led by the tyrannical Terence Fletcher (Simmons) who puts the title of abusive teacher to a whole new level.Everyone has had that one teacher or coach in their lives that was unbearable. They would scream, criticize, and cause you so so much emotional abuse that caused you to fail more than the class or sport ever could. Few films have ever been able to capture this idea better than Whiplash as we watch Fletcher verbally emasculate his band members to tears and physical torment that is almost too much to watch. It's hard to say why Simmons was so effective here. He has the deep menacing voice, threatening eyes, and is looking surprisingly jacked in his black t-shirts (seriously, is Simmons gonna be the next Marvel super villain or something?) that help make him the bane of existence for all of his students.You also can't talk about Whiplash without mentioning the lead role of Miles Teller. Teller is one of Hollywoods talented up and comers (especially if you've seen him in "The Spectacular Now") and he almost seemed to be the heir apparent to Vince Vaughn as the funny, fast-talking, likable schlub who could go on to lead comedies for the foreseeable future. This is actually the most different Teller then we've seen in his young career. His character of Andrew is of a socially awkward and talented musician who hasn't had a lot of success in life and will do anything to establish himself and make it so he is remembered for being "great" long after he's gone (shown perfectly during the dinner scene with his family, maybe the best scene in the film). To do this, he is willing to take Fletcher's abuse and use it as the motivation to prove he is great.Anyone in the teaching/coaching profession can tell you that arguably the most difficult aspect of the profession is motivating your students. Fletcher's choice to use fear as his motivational tool proves to have varying success rates as he very easily breaks his students but their fear of him pushes them to be perfect because that is what he expects. You grow to hate Fletcher so much throughout the film that when it gets to a point in the film where he explains he cruelty it messes with you emotionally because you begin to somehow empathize with him. The fact that you can show any sympathy towards the character after what you've seen him to is a feat in itself and the credit goes to Chazzelle for shaping the story that way.I hate to use the term "emotional roller-coaster" few films of recent memory fit that cliché better than Whiplash. The Jazz genre really fits the flow of the story because it can be easy going and calculated one minute to explosive and heart-pounding the next. Being able to fit so much size into a small budget film like this is amazing and a screenplay Oscar for Chazzelle should be in order if there was any justice in the world. I don't know if Chazzelle had a film teacher who was as harsh as Fletcher who pushed him as hard, but one thing is for sure is that, much like Andrew, Chazzelle seems like he wants to be great and I can't wait for him to continue to prove that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simmons is mesmerising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme in 'Whiplash' could apply to anything at all in the world almost and I think that's part of what has made the film so popular. The movie chooses drumming as the subject for this particular story but showcases it in a way that makes people think "wow, I wonder if I had someone to push me at *insert hobby/passion* and I was willing to devote my life to it, could I be the greatest of all time?" It's an interesting notion. The answer sadly for 99.9% of people would still be no, but what's to stop them trying? Was the character in the movie ever going to be one of the greatest of all time? That's up for the viewer to decide but it doesn't even really matter. What matters is that he had both the person to drive him and also the capability to devote himself to it. So one way or the other, he was going to find out. J.K Simmons has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category at the the Academy Awards for his role in 'Whiplash' and is almost certainly to win. And rightly so. He is absolutely perfect in his role with shades of R. Lee Ermey in 'Full Metal Jacket' coming to mind. Every scene he is in is captivating to watch. We the viewer are actually as nervous as the characters are supposed to be at what his character will say or do to them next. A real pleasure to watch.The film is far from being simply for music lovers. I was surprised how entertaining I actually found the whole thing. A lot of the scenes (mainly the ones with Simmons) were very funny in quite a dark way but also Miles Teller played his role very well and was enjoyable to watch. The final scene is absolutely brilliant and tops off the movie perfectly. A deserved nominee for Best Picture without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Well-Made Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash follows a first year music student who is talent spotted by the school's most fearsome teachers. Now one of the drummers in his class, Andrew (Miles Teller) is under pressure to become the best he can be, and more.Making a film solely about drumming at least somewhat interesting can be a difficult task because it is such a niche interest. Whiplash manages to make a fantastic film about drumming. Please do not be put off by this film's subject; even if you know nothing about music or drumming, this is still a thoroughly entertaining film to watch and enjoy. One of the reasons this film works so well is that the performances are all great. J.K. Simmons obviously steals the show as the terrifying Fletcher, whose rants are appallingly personal to the extent where you eventually start cringing at every drum solo, just waiting for him to stop the music and begin his bullying once more. Miles Teller also gives a great performance, although his hasn't received awards recognition, it is still a solid performance that proves he can do more than comedies.Of course, it is not just the acting in Whiplash that makes it so successful; the direction of this is so effective that you can literally be on the edge of your seat during some of the drum solos. The only way to describe these scenes is as being almost like action scenes. The camera work at these moments is so fast-paced it creates a fantastically tense atmosphere. These are the aspects of the film that make it so great, it is difficult to convince most people to go see a film about drumming but hopefully people will give Whiplash a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph! No, really. Whiplash literally is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gut-wrenching. Intense. At times uncomfortable. At times triumphant. This is what you can expect from Whiplash. If you find yourself easily put in the shoes of sympathetic characters, then be prepared. This may be an emotional ride. J.K Simmons plays Fletcher, a music professor at a highly-regarded music school (think Juliard) who is very passionate about his work. Andrew's (Miles Teller) talent on the drums soon catches the renowned teacher's eye, and he is brought into an elite class of jazz musicians. But Andrew couldn't have predicted the price his new mentor will expect for this "honor". Simmons is more often seen in comedic roles than not, but that doesn't stop him from owning the show here as the antagonist. He's lean, and he's mean. Teller is relatively new to the game, yet he disappears into the depressed yet willful introvert that is Andrew, and shares the screen well with the more seasoned Simmons. Paul Riser (of Mad About You fame) makes a return to cinema here as Andrew's father, and Melissa Benoist of Glee fame makes her big screen debut as a love interest - enjoyable performances by both. If you've ever felt singled out by a superior, or striven for the impossible, you just may connect with this movie, and be thankful for the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash(2014) is a story of a wanted to be top- jazz drummer and his teacher at the music college. J.K.Simmons who played the role of ruthless,strict master is terrific in his role. I had a good 100 minute watch. What made me to watch this film is its trailer, perfectly cut, impactive. Watch the trailer, and then the film, only if you are interested to watch terrific performances. The plot is a bit week. Film didn't match the hype of critics at various film festivals, yet it is fantastic. See, I thought Miles Teller was playing some real life character. That is the reason ,I say it is Terrific. I don't know what drives the jury of those film festivals. We expected more out of it, yes but only because of the showoff in the trailer,ratings shown on posters. Ironically, its not showoff it is real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extraordinary movie that is one of a kind.It is one of the few movies where you feel like the antagonist, feel his pain,ambition and drive for striving in excellence.You actually feel that you are picking up the drumsticks and playing. You heart starts to beat faster as the bass beat of the drum increases.I actually did not know either of the actors.I learned that J.K Simmons was the guy from Spiderman. But now I am sure that both of them have left their mark in film history and have raised the bar for motivational films all over the world.The movie is intense.I can say that even the Saw franchise's brutality can not reproduce this kind of a scar in our minds like Whiplash did. And I love the name of the movie too "Whiplash" . It kinda relates to something in the movie, but if you watch the movie closely you can find out the brilliance in its story and its connection with the name.The movie has no flaws at all. You can watch this movie no matter what mood your in or what age you are or what gender you are or anything.God I so wanna play drums now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense and mesmerizing masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash was the most intense and exhilarating movie experience that i had throughout all of 2014. This movie did not slow down a single bit as it told the gripping and mesmerizing story of a boy striving to be the best jazz drummer in the world with the assistance of one of the most hilarious and memorable characters of the year. J. K. Simmons put in the best performance of his career and the most exciting and exhilarating performance of the year as this very talented and at time frightening jazz instructor. As a supporting actor whenever he was on screen i was in awe at just how compelling his character was, sometimes you are afraid of him and other times you can't take your eyes off how spectacular he is at what he does. Miles Teller also killed it in his performance as the boy who had a single goal in life and blew me away with the level of his talent. The back and forth chemistry between these two fantastic actors made for the best highlights of the movie. There were hilarious moments, scary moments and even emotional moments as the movie explores how their relationship evolves over time in ways that you would not have initially expected. This film does a lot to surprise you and gave some of the most memorable moments of the year. And just as it starts off strong it finishes even stronger with one of the most intense and inspiring finales in recent years. This movie was such a great experience that it is one of the best films of the year, with some of the best performances seen in 2014. - 9.7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******Spoiler Alert*******This film was so intense I could barely sit through it and watched many scenes through gritted teeth and squinted eyes. But I'm glad I didn't chicken out for something 'lighter' because the climax was totally amazing. The two lead roles and their elaborate interplay was absolutely brilliant and kept the pressure on so that almost 2 hours of viewing seemed to pass at break neck speed.This is a story about blood, sweat, tears and the utter determination to succeed against all odds. The sheer fire of Andrew Neyman, the young and ambitious Jazz drummer, played to perfection by Miles Teller is fuelled by a deep down knowing that this is what he was born to do. But this knowledge does not come into full force and confidence until the very last scene when it literally erupts out of him as a mixture of rage, defiance, grit and artistic brilliance all rolled into a roll interspersed with lashings of utterly wild embellishments.Meanwhile, his cruel and driven mentor, Fletcher, played horrifically flawlessly by J.K. Simmons provides the emotional stimulus for the movie as he is the fascist ass-hole who will do just about anything to push the potential out of his students. He embodies the amoral dogmatic maestro who values power above decency, adds insult to injury but ultimately bows to musical genius when he hears it. The relationship between student and mentor builds and builds throughout the film creating suspense and anxiety that something unexpected could happen any second, which it does frequently and instils that edge of the seat fear of power gone wild in the viewer! Their relationship reaches its final climax in the last scene when apprentice becomes master of his own emotions, of his instrument and equalises himself with his mentor. So finally the balance of power is restored and all is well in the jungle.To sum up, Whiplash is the clever weaving of a spell in more ways than one; the music, the drama, the power plays ? all cleverly and intricately crafted in every element. It is really about the forging and moulding of talent and skill into real genius. The movie is like an orchestrated symphony in itself; loud and soft movements, rises and falls, climaxes and summations; all with impeccable timing. An unblemished masterpiece in fact.I thoroughly enjoyed it. Superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes You Think, and Great Performances from Teller and Simmons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fictional story of "Whiplash" is that of 19 year-old Jazz Drummer student Andrew Nieman, played by Miles Teller. Nieman is a student at the fictional "Shaffer Consevatory" in New York, the top music school in the U.S. Nieman aspires to become one of the drummer "greats" and ends up in the class of conductor Terrence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. As the movie progresses, Fletcher is revealed to have display both verbal and physical abuse in his teaching to Nieman and other students. Despite this, Nieman is determined to please Fletcher is his quest for greatness. Both Teller, and Pre-Oscar Nominations Announcement, presumed Favorite Simmons for Best Supporting Actor, both give great performances. At times I rooted, loathed and then rooted again for Teller's character, as his own morals and values are questionable at points in the film. The question of how far is too far for a teacher to push a student, and a student to push his or herself is there, and the movie does make you think. As I heard, the last 15 minutes or so are something, and there is one surprise moment earlier in the film, that you just don't see coming, that really shocks you. In the end, while not the best, it is one of the better films I have seen this year, and I will want a repeated viewing to judge it further. For now - 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars (The ? Star for Teller's and Simmons's performances and the last 15 or so minutes), 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. K. Simmons grabs this film by the throat and tosses us around like rag dolls. Abusive, profane, maniacal and pushing the edges of sanity, his portrayal of a college music professor who motivates his students towards excellence using despicable, offensive language is the best thing he has ever done. Simmons playing Professor Fletcher meets Andrew played by Miles Teller in a practice room at the university. Andrew wants to be a great jazz drummer, and he is willing to pay the price to attain greatness. He is single-minded and ambitious. The professor motivates his most talented players using extreme abuse. He is a bully.Most of the film is a series of confrontations between the professor and his students. He destroys the young, and he goes too far. Professors Fletcher is on a quest of his own. He wants to find a young Charlie Parker or someone with that kind of potential and push him to stardom. Fletcher admits that, in all his years of destroying impressionable neophytes, he has never found a real star, but he is not remorseful about his outrageous conduct.He is more cruel to the truly talented because he has no time for the students who have no promise. All along the way, we know that Fletcher's harsh bullying has a purpose. We know he is trying to whip his students into better musicians, but he goes too far.This film is a study in character - the character of the teacher and the character of the student. Some of the best acting, screen writing and editing in 2014. There will be nominations for acting and writing, deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is an awesome film. Let me tell you why:Miles Teller is on a crazy streak; doing some decent movies and putting in even better performances, but Whiplash definitely taps his greatest effort thus far in his incredibly young career. J.K. Simmons hands in his role of a lifetime, playing a mentor who taps the spirit of R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, and throws 'acting punches' when you think the film can't get any better.The movie as a whole put me through a ride. My nerves were being toyed with as I watched Miles Teller's character share screen time with J.K. Simmons. The on screen chemistry is their and in full-bloom. And what puts the whole thing together? The grade A soundtrack that acts as the lifeblood of this gem of a film. See this film if appreciate jazz, young musicians and/or the musical process. The ending is also one of the best in any film I've seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid performances from the two leads.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This films takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. This film is carried by the two leads. Miles Teller is stellar and J.K. Simmons delivers the best performance of his career as of now. I haven't seen director Damien Chazelle's previous works, but I'll be keeping an eye out for anything he makes in the future. This is story that a lot of people can relate to. Andrew Neyman(Teller) is a talented drummer, and is committed to excellence and pursues to be the best of the best. His teacher Terence Fletcher(Simmons) is equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods. He leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, pushing him to his limits with mental and physical abuse.What grabbed me in the film is the similar experience Andrew goes through, with my experience with my family and at school. I'm an art student, and as corny as it sounds, my parents and teachers would push me to the limit to see if I can achieve greatness. So with that being said, the film asks many questions, just how far are you willing to go to achieve what you aspire to be? How bad do you want it? And is it worth it? The film also asks what is great art? Objectively and subjectively. All this pondered around my head and the story isn't even convoluted. It asks the right questions relating to the film. Miles Teller's performance is nothing short of amazing. His performance alone matches J.K. Simmons. He works hard to please himself and to please his instructor Fletcher. You see him go through so much and he pours his blood, sweat, and tears to become the best he can be, so much so that he puts off his relationship with his girlfriend Nicole(Melissa Benoist) to focus on his career. There are tender moments with Andrew and Fletcher, but even more tender moments with his father played by Paul Reiser who has an excellent supporting role. In Andrew's eyes, he loves his father, but ultimately sees him as a failure for not achieving his dreams to become a writer. Something he does not want to become. I loved his performance in this film, almost makes me somewhat optimistic about the new awful sounding Fantastic 4 reboot. J.K. Simmons is great as the intimidating instructor, a great all around drill-instructor/asshole performance. He is a bit over the top, which was kind of distracting. He's so unlikeable in the film and you can't help but wish he gets what he deserves, but also at the same time, he's endearing in a way when he gets his point across to Andrew on why he's so harsh and so brutal. Some pretty far-fetched events happen along the way, and that to me were the parts of the film that were apparent, out of place and almost too good to be true. But with that being said, the editing is fantastic as is the flow and pacing of the film. The performances are stellar, as are the drumming sequences.Whiplash is tense experience, watching a student with a talent go through all this torment is exhilarating and also a bit depressing. The film asks the right questions and although it gets a little preachy towards the end, it's not in your face. The performances alone is worth the admission. 8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2014.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have I been a part of an audience that universally applauded a film immediately after the images faded to black. Indeed, never have I seen film at the cinema that was more deserving of such a reception. Before I realised it, my hands were coming together. An involuntary action; a result of a perfect movie in every conceivable way. Every scene, every shot, every piece of music that was played. There were certainly a number of subtle themes permeating the background of this movie. The most notable being what it takes, the dedication and relentless determination that is required for an artist, or indeed anyone, to become truly great, to become more than what was thought to be the limit of their capability, or even perfection itself. Despite this, and the many other parallel themes, at its core: this is a movie MADE for drummers. In saying that though, you of course do not need to be a drummer or a real musician to enjoy this movie. It is that incredible and that diverse that the drama, the tension, the comedic quotes, along with the impeccable acting, carry this film on its shoulders alone. This is the best film of the year, by at least a 20 kilometre marathon.The plot of this film is simple, so I will not delve into that too much. But despite its simplicity, the incredibly written characters and their actions, their relationships, make this simplicity not just relevant, but yet another flawless aspect of the film. One of these characters is notorious music teacher Fletcher, a mean bastard of a man, whose depiction by J.K. Simmons is kicked out of the stadium, landing on the roof of a skyscraper several kilometres away. J.K. Simmons gives us, dare I say it, his best performance to date as an actor. Channeling his inner Vern Schillinder for the first time in over a decade, his every action, his every word, hell even his body language and emotions were entirely unpredictable for the entire movie, creating an amazingly tense atmosphere in a very different way to most other films. One could certainly not be blamed for pondering: is this man sick? Additionally, as if this wasn't enough, the script he is given to work with is sharper than Daniel-Day-Lewis' butcher knife. Every word he uttered counted, and many of his remarks stung worse than any Amazonian insect, and as if this wasn't enough, the black comedy that intertwines with the rest of the story, for the most part delivered viciously by Mr. Simmons, is unparalleled. Of course, there was a few inside jokes that only a drummer or a musician could fully understand for the most part, but these are sprinkled lightly on simply the best bowl of cereal you will ever come across. Simmons' dialogue was so strong, intense, scary and hilarious that it was impossible to take your eyes away from the screen. Countless insults, many rather graphic in nature, are abound, and coming from Simmons with such ferocity, I laughed almost every time he spoke. His methods, as he says himself, are intended to "push people beyond what is expected of them", a quote that sums up much of what this movie is saying very well.Opposite J.K. is the newcomer Miles Teller, who sets each drum-kit he touches on fire, with the skill and determination of someone destined to become great. The array of emotions that he experiences as he single-mindedly focuses on the task at hand is the best big-screen portrayal of the inner strength required to reach the highest of musical goals. Immature as the film begins, his character's personality progresses steadily and in a believable fashion, eventually causing the viewer to wonder what he will say next, as his character gradually transforms before out eyes. One can't help but laugh at some of the things he says, often rather bluntly. However, his stunning drum-work steal the show; or at the very least, share the stage with Simmons' performance.Alongside all this war-like chaos, as mentioned earlier, there are many themes are touched on subtly, including, but not limited to: trust and respect, and how it is earned. The relationships between family members, and the miserable feeling a musician or drummer can feel when their passion, their love, is not taken seriously at all; seen as a hobby destined to be grown out of. It explores the dynamics between band members and their conductor, showing us, realistically might I add, the tension that can arrive in an instant when that many people are trying to perfect one song together. And of course, it shows what real motivation, true focus and dedication can do to a person, both positive and negative, and how far someone will go to get to where they see themselves belonging.I am a drummer, so I realise that I am naturally going to be a little biased. But ignoring the inside drum jokes, I took myself out of my body, away from the drummer in me, and enjoyed this movie for what it was, as much as every other audience member I imagine, judging from the reaction as soon as those credits rolled. A factor for this sudden outburst of applause most probably has something to do with the thoroughly unpredictable, riveting final scene, that rivals any movie you could name for having the perfect ending. I could go on and on, in fact I am certain I could write a thesis on the amazing scope and execution of Whiplash. But I'll wrap it up here, as I have said enough, and I don't think I need to tell anyone reading this that they must see this movie as soon as they possibly can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Swan- for men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We were deciding on movies to watch at the local cinema and somehow I mixed up the plot lines of Daniel Radcliffe's "Horns" with "Whiplash," and thought it was a horror movie. We ended up deciding to see this. I was half right- this was a horror movie. Not a horrible movie, but a horror movie. It shows how blind ambition can descend into obsession and how mentoring can turn into sadism.This is the second movie I've seen in a week where two strong characters are played by two strong actors and that's what makes this film work. The first was, "The Judge." In this movie, it's like the scene in West Side Story where Tony and Maria only have eyes for each other and everything else is a blur. You can see glimpses of how the other musicians feel about the showdown, but the show is clearly Teller's and Simmons. What made Teller's performance to me is the contrast between his obsessive desire to be great and respected to just having a poker face in a pivotal scene with him and Simmons. Teller's face is a blank stare where you don't know if he's thinking, "What's my next line?" or "On, a twisted level, I understand where he's coming from." or "This man is sadistic man trying to justify it." So without the verbal and non-verbal cues, you have no definitive answer to how he really thinks of his mention. And Simmons is Simmons, as usual.The other thing I appreciated was that it kept me on the edge of my seat like any good thriller. Most of the time, I can call a movie from beginning to end because of it's predictable plot. This one I had no idea what would happen next. I was tense the entire movie and it took a minute to finally catch my breath when the movie faded to black. You can't even say that there was no reason to have such a visceral response because no one died, because well, you can't. Masterfully done, with subtle closeup shots that you wonder whether they were done as clues or just shots to be closeup shots. And being a jazz aficionado, it helped to have an awesome soundtrack. Look forward to buying it because the performances of the pieces in the movie were unmercifully short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well shot, edited, acted and designed; with a fresh take on old ideas. The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing earth-shattering on the intellectual side, but it's worth several Oscar nominations. The music is fantastic. See it on the big screen.As for the controversy around the abusive teacher, I would say that it's not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified, good or evil, effective or hindering, in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it. If a semi-vicious teacher who, in the real world, would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique, is a flaw in the movie, then it's not a damning one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best film of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon the release of the first trailer for 'Whiplash', I was hooked. Months before I had even walked in to the movie theater, my expectations were through the roof, and I was not disappointed. In his 2014, Damien Chazelle released his second directorial efforts upon the world. Based on a short film, written and directed by Chazelle, Whiplash follows the journey of aspiring drummer Andrew Neiman. A child of divorce, from a young age Neiman found solace in music, and dreamed of becoming the best. However, during his studies at Shaffer Conservatory in New York, Andrew comes face to face with his greatest obstacle, Terrence Fletcher. Chazelle is a master behind the camera, creating a wonderful character study and one of the greatest film antagonists put to film in Terrance Fletcher. The film gains additional praise from his lead performers, Miles Teller as the young Andrew Neiman, and J.K Simmons as the menacing Terrance Fletcher. From beginning to end, the audience is taken on a grand musical experience, and is topped off by what I have to say is the greatest conclusion to a film ever put to screen. I applaud you, Mr. Chazelle. I give Whiplash an A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash: Drummed Deep Into My Memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A steadily increasing drum beat mercilessly crashes through a narrow door, which sits at the end of a dingy dark corridor, where a young man plays his drums with ferocity. This is the opening scene of a movie full of harrowing, passionate scenes with a plot full of twists and turns.J.K. Simmons depicted the character Terence Fletcher, a strict conductor. Fletcher is a confusing maze of aggressive and passionate traits and emotions. Simmons goes from throwing a drum across the room that crashes directly above the head of a student to encouraging a young girl to continue her dream to pursue music. Simmons speaks and strides with the utmost confidence and poise. His demeanor shifts from calm to yelling and snarling in a matter of moments. He is a very active and reactive author. Simmons uses whatever you give him, whether a line or a prop and uses it to express whatever emotion he is trying to convey.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a young drummer who goes to a prestigious university for the musically talented known as Schaffer University. In this University he plays for a Jazz Band conducted under none other than Terence Fletcher, a much esteemed educator. Teller's acting in this film can only be described as very lackluster. In Whiplash, Teller seems to follow Simmons lead in the scenes, which would make sense seeing as this is Tellers first big role. He should have taken the scenes and added his own spin to the scene to truly leave his mark. This becomes quite apparent in the scene in which he is accepted into the Jazz band. His character should have been ecstatic at this opportunity. However, this was not the case. Instead his face served as a blank slate during this important moment. The volume of his voice was at a constant low and somewhat shaky, even feeble throughout the production. As the film proceeded he did become more diverse with his intonation and volume but it was not enough to redeem his performance in my eyes. The more he played the role the more he learned to manipulate it.The cinematography, led by Sharone Meir, was stellar. The movie was based in three main colors. A deep forest green, a rich maroon, and a bold mustard yellow. Whiplash is almost completely doused in these "dark" colors which really gives the movie a dank atmosphere. In the entire movie there was only a single scene of "light" and for Andrew, Miles Teller, it was a key game changer. The clear control of light and framework helps establish the overarching mood of this film as well as illuminate the internal struggle of the characters. Justin Hurwitz, the music director, did a stunning job of managing the music. Throughout the movie key moments were highlighted by a dulled jazz tune played in the background. Other times, when Andrew is playing for example, the music is a bright, tangy kind of jazz clear cut and angry most of the time. The music alone could have told the story in and of itself.Director and Writer Damien Chazelle did his best work with Whiplash. While his other movies weren't as well received, Grand Piano, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, and more, they can be overlooked because of this film. Some might decide to avoid this film out of fear that they won't understand the musical lingo. Watch it anyways. This movie was easy to understand even without a musical background. Overall this movie was excellent and deserved all of the nominations and awards it received. I am thrilled for Damien Chazelle's future work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whiplash" is a terrific film...no doubt about that. Normally, I'd spend several paragraphs talking about how great it is except that I am the 572nd review and many people have already gone on and on about what a terrific film it is....so what can I add?! It's the 40th highest rated film on IMDb after all! J.K. Simmons clearly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor because although he was no the star of the film, he dominated every moment he was on the screen. Was he a likable guy? No way..but he was mesmerizing. Kudos also for the young actor in the lead and everyone else with this film. It's among the best films of the year and one that impressed me so much because it did not have a complicated script of mega-million dollar special effects--it just had terrific acting, writing and direction. See this film and see how a quality film is crafted. 'Nuff said...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is rightly named. Just like a piece of music, a film has many components that must come together for it to work. You can't have a film without actors, without a script, or without a director. For this particular piece of music, all you need is a drummer and a teacher who will do anything to for a successful performance. I believe that is what Damien Chazelle has done here. He has pushed his actors as well as his audience to their limits and then some. The question this movie asks is: how far is too far? And the beautiful thing is that it never answers it and that was precisely Damien Chazelle's intention when he wrote the ending. We, as the audience, must decide for ourselves. I didn't enjoy sitting through this movie, but that doesn't make it bad. It made me think and ultimately it did what it set out to do. For that, I applaud it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unconventional for a Film About Musicians, but Not Uncommon for a Sports or Military Movie, this is a Unique Take on the Disciplined Disciples of an American Artform. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons Play a Student and Teacher Relationship that is the Stuff of Legend but Mostly Mythological Methods of Honing Raw Talent into Greatness. The Film is Ripe with Overstated but Eloquent Dialog and Snazzy Musical Accompaniment (when things finally conclude). It is a Rather Rich Display of Impromptu Talent as the Student Drummer has His Well Deserved Moment in the Spotlight and Makes the Most of It.The Film's Detractors are Want to Point Out that it is a Dehumanizing Display of a Sadistic Fascist Overlord. But what Makes the Film Work is its Off Toned Setting in the Elite Musical Education School that is On the Surface Less Than Believable. But What Does Surface is the Real Competitive World Among Artists and the Sacrifices Needed to Excel. The Movie Never Wants the Methods of Cruel Behavior by the Instructor to be Authentic but More of a Surreal Statement on the Reality. It is Hyper-Fiction and its Disguise is Evident Throughout and Not to Be Taken Literally.It's a Fresh Film Experience that is Thought-Provoking Inspiring Conversations and Debate. Overall, It's Better than Just a "Good Job".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J.K. Simmons plays Fletcher, a task master from hell in charge of a jazz band at an exclusive school. As told, students of Fletcher's frequently go on to successful careers, but Fletcher admits that he never mentored a Charlie Parker.Andrew, an ambitious young drummer comes to Fletcher's band with the idea of becoming the best drummer of all time, setting up a classic conflict of arrogant young student versus an instructor who borders on the sadistic. Fletcher recognizes Andrew's talent, but his philosophy is that people have to be pushed hard (an understatement) if they are going to reach the maximum height that their talent will take them. His method of pushing comes by way of trying to intimidate by the force of his menacing personality and telling students they are never quite up to his standards. Fletcher's idea is that unless a student can stand up to his regimen, then they do not have the drive to excel at the highest levels. In order to put up with Fletcher Andrew must have figured that getting his imprimatur would rate highly for future success. There was not much back-story given for either Fletcher or Andrew and I was left having to fill in a lot of that. For example, why did Fletcher command such respect that Andrew would put up with him? Fletcher could have been a strong father figure for Andrew, since Andrew indicated that his father was somewhat of a failed writer, a writer who maybe had not pushed himself.I appreciate that Fletcher's abusive style was exaggerated for dramatic effect (at one point he actually slaps Andrew on the face several times), but his military style of instruction is not rare. Only once in my life did an instructor ever get from me something beyond which I never thought I was capable. There was honest criticism, but mainly this instructor was so inspiring that I wanted to please him; I think his approach is to be preferred to that of Fletcher, but almost every day we see sports coaches who have adopted the Fletcher style.I have no great fondness for jazz and tend to view drum solos mainly as noise, but that did not keep me from enjoying this movie which touches on some broad themes. The arc of the story is familiar and it is mainly the high production values and excellent performances that carry the day.I wish there had been *some* indication that the people in Fletcher's band were there because they enjoyed making music, rather than primarily being driven there by an ambition to compete.I came away from this with mixed emotions. It is over the top, but I can't dismiss it.</fullReview>

The acting is great, Miles Teller is a very strong lead and JK Simmons is a powerful and frightening screen presence. The music is very good, as to be expected from a movie about drumming and music. You really care about Teller and want him to succeed. Simmons is given some unique motives for his harsh teaching, and you know the movie is well written when you start to understand why he does what he does. The movie is extremely intense, perfectly building up suspense and keeping you on the edge of your seat for a terrific finale.

		<fullReview>Whiplash follows the life of a young drummer striving for greatness at an exclusive music conservatory. His mentor and band leader pushes him to the brink and back in order to bring out his latent talent.This film was truly spellbinding. I literally couldn't turn my head away throughout it's duration. The sound track is gorgeously recorded Jazz music and every element of the sound of the film is only heightened by the cinematography, which draws your attention to every minute detail of the struggles of the drummers throughout the story.While it is a classic master and, never quite good enough until the very end of the movie, student tale, the whirlwind of events leading to that final payoff is well worth the time. The lead characters were simple and relatable caricatures of similar people I've seen in those positions.A great experience that well deserved it's plaudits in awards season!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would believe a guy playing drums for 30 minutes could create such a climax? personally I never thought a movie like this would catch my interest, but well, it did. Good acting all over, solid storyline, shocking plot twists and a powerful message. Honestly, what more can you ask of a movie?Miles Teller in the role as Andrew, an up and coming drummer, with hopes of being one of the true greats. Both the character and the execution of Teller is absolutely brilliant. The fact that Andrew is from a mediocre family which only interest is in sports, clearly illustrates that he is one of a kind. He gets in to the best music school in US, and practice till his hands bleed. He understands, like his teacher Fletcher(played by J.K Simmons, extremely well played by the way), that brutality, discipline and focus are needed to REALLY succeed at something. The plot is realistic, intriguing and to say the least shocking. At first eye-glance it is a typical Hollywood love story. Guy meets girl, falls in love, break up and finally get back together. But well, that would be the case, if not reality would come in to place. Andrew sacrifices the love of his life for the chance of maybe becoming one of the truly great. The whole plot is about Fisher's brutal teaching methods, only to get the best out of his pupils, in his search for one of the truly great. There are several shocking moments, but if I were to name one, it would probably be the end. (SPOILER ALERT)The fact that Fisher did not give Andrew the notes for the first song, in front of an audience that can determine his whole career and everything he has worked for, just to get back at him for telling on him, and being responsible for him losing his job. This of course leads to him running out crying in his fathers arms. BUT, this is not the end. Andrew realizes that he has reached rock bottom, and goes back out there, in what seems as an revenge-act. He is ruthless, and starts playing while Fletcher is presenting the next song. This revenge sh*t keeps going, until Fletcher finally gets with it, and the rest of the orchestra follows. When it is all over, Andrew starts playing a solo, which Fletcher catches his interest for. He starts directing the way Andrew plays, and forgets all about their history, because he finally found one of the great ones, which were his one goal as a teacher. "Get a good job" are the four worst words one can say to ambitious children . Those four words makes sure a little kid, loses all his ambitions. That is why there have not been AS many great ones in the 21st century. Hard work and dedication, as well as ambitions, are crucial for really succeeding in something. One of the best movies I have seen this year, and i recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin... I saw the preview of this film but went into it without really knowing what to expect. I didn't even know it had been nominated and won Academy Awards, but now I certainly understand why. The acting of both leads was phenomenal which is really what drove the movie, as it was their relationship that it was primarily about. I read only a few other reviews; one of them called Whiplash a study about ambition. I agree with that, and then some. Excellence, perfection, reputation... the main character(s) cared more about these than romance and/or friendships. Given this, I found it very interesting, too, that while there was no overt sexuality in this film, the suggestion of it was there often. Certainly in the use of sexual language, usually in a derogatory fashion by JK Simmons, and also in the intimations of gayness in his character and how he related to the men he taught. (I couldn't help but wonder, are women so absent from the world of jazz musicians?) In fact, I believe part of what was so powerful about the ending is the nonverbal communication that took place between the two main characters and the sexual nature of it (the physicality, the pacing, intensifying, sweating, panting, climaxing). Two people making music together... love of yet another kind? Very powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly intense, breathtaking, emotionally stunning masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have I been more transfixed to a movie screen than during my experience watching Whiplash, Damien Chazelle's spectacular second go-around as director. The story centers on 19-year-old music student Andrew Neiman (Teller), a young man with the sole ambition of becoming one of the greats in the art of jazz, as he enrolls in a prestigious music school class taught by the brutal Terence Fletcher (Simmons) who thrives to push people beyond what's expected of them. Whatever micro flaws this drama has are entirely muted by the countless strengths that plague this movie into the long line-up of modern classics. The two leads, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, have certainly raised the bar in their respective acting careers. Teller is amazing at portraying a shy yet ambitious outsider who puts everything on the line to have his impressive talents approved and recognized by the world. It's when this force collides with the terrifying and complex persona that Simmons masterfully molds that the tension goes to "armrest-gripping" territory. Simmons is a force to be reckoned with and will not go without considerable awards buzz across the board. It's strong enough that if Simmons's talent was slightly weaker when coupled with Chazelle's screenplay, the tension would be much less existent and would rob the film of its beauty. The premise is simple and gripping, but there is a humongous question sewn into this practically flawless film that will be entirely different depending on the person: "Are you willing to degrade yourself in order to excel?" It's a question that will appear many times when you near- disturbingly watch Andrew bleed from his aggressive drumming, overcome injury, or change the way he interacts with people. On a technical level, Whiplash is spellbinding. The orange tint that the film utilizes does great at setting the dark and dangerous mood that surges in Fletcher's rehearsal room &amp; the concert stage. Listening to the old-fashioned jazz numbers is a real treat, but the thing that grips even more is the use of drums to increase apprehension and expect the worst to happen in already-unpleasant situations. Editor Tom Cross deserves an Oscar nod himself for pacing this film with strong briskness and never drifting from the main focus of this film. It is a true shocker how this film hasn't spread anywhere else besides the indie field of movies. Whiplash is the prime example of why indies are worth the longer drive from your house to smaller-scale theaters in your city. It overcomes you with a powerful tension that will keep you from getting up out of your seat or hitting that pause button. Once all is said and done after a emotionally magnificent climax, you'll feel as relaxed as you feel after a spa treatment. Next to Boyhood, it's my favorite film of 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not many movies that I can think of that put me on the edge of my seat and was completely engaged to the screen as I did with Whiplash. This film is one of the best films I have seen in recent years and anyone that loves movie should watch this film. It's about a young drummer named Andrew (Miles Teller) who's trying to be the best drummer in his field and in order to do so, he's being instructed by a ruthless Jazz Instructor named Fletcher (J.K. Simmmons). From there, it is an intense psychological battle between the two and it is gripping to see the pair butt heads against each other. J.K. Simmons was absolutely brilliant as Fletcher. It's very hard for any actor to be a complete jerk as he was in this film and yet, there was still something entertaining about his performance that makes me appreciate his role in the film. Miles Teller was also really good and a little bit underrated as you can feel that his character is willing to put through hell just to be the best drummer in his field. I find it extremely fascinating that a movie about a jazz drummer could be so incredibly intense and Damien Chazelle, the writer and director of this film, was able to make the whole experience absolutely gripping. The music, as you might expect, is really great as the jazz songs that they have absolutely perfect for this film and extremely catchy as I would catch myself humming the songs long after I watched the movie. But if there's one thing that I have to give the movie big props for is that it was able to make me to applaud at the end of the film (which I've never done that in my life). Without giving too much away, the ending scene is absolutely intense and completely gripping to the point that when the ending sequence was over, I felt like that I was in the greatest movie trip in my life. This is my favorite film of the year and anybody who loves movies need to check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director and writer Damien Chazelle has brought us a tense, brutal and beautiful masterpiece. Whiplash tells a story about absolute perfectionism, and what it takes to get there, no matter what the cost . In the films case, we see this pursuit from both the protagonist and the antagonist, where drummer Andrew Neyman stops at nothing to become "one of the greats", and his maniacal teacher helping him get there through constant abuse. Filled with powerful performances from both Miles Teller and the incredible J.K. Simmons, ruthless direction and an unbelievable final act, Whiplash is bound to be deemed as an instant classic, and will remain as one of the most powerful films of the decade.</fullReview>

As for Miles Teller I have seen other films in which he appeared but I feel like my awareness of him as a true actor begins with whiplash and simply say that his performance was as brilliant as his characters playing in the final scene which had me applaud as the credits began to role. I loved this film and fellow music lovers will be sure to love it too but at the same time will have a broader appeal due to the fine acting and the relationships between the complex and intriguing characters.

		<fullReview>Being a film that won three Oscars and being ranked nr.36 on IMDb's top 250,this film had a lot to live up to and based on the trailer,I had no huge expectations in any way...but I was curious. And my curiosity was answered,met and extremely satisfied.This is not a film with many important characters,most of the support,like Paul Reisers odd but concerned dad exist only in the periphery....and that is completely okay,a film does not have to go all Magnolia and have half of Hollywood in it,sometimes all you need to make true sparks fly is an overlooked character actor and a newcomer,eager to prove himself.Miles Teller,of whom I've never heard,delivers a star-making performance. Truly impressive,showing an extreme range juggling Andrews insecurities,obsession,frustration,inner turmoil and rage. I expect great things from this young man.I have never held J.K Simmons in extremely high regard. I really dug him in OZ and as Jonah Jameson in the Spider-man series but otherwise,he often didn't really register,having a face that God seemed to have shaped to define the true expression of constant dead-pan sarcasm. Simmons completely sheds his usual on-screen persona here. Sure,his Fletcher is mean,a bully,a tormentor,a sadistic perfectionist....but he is given so much depth and complexity,handled by Simmons without missing a note,not one moment rings false.This man will sacrifice his own career just to find the next Charlie Parker;What first comes off as cruelty is a test of our young protagonists ambition. I might hate to admit it,as a big fan of Ruffalo's work in Foxcatcher and Norton's in Birdman but this veteran actor truly deserved his golden statue.This is a film about obsession,narcissism,competition,ambition and music. Both of the main characters have the same goal;For Andrew to achieve absolute greatness. The road to that possible goal is unfortunately for Andrew paved with abuse,torture and self-torture,all instigated by Fletchers harsh but effective coaching.One of them must take the role as antagonist for both to be able to reach their common goal,which might be easier said then done. This film,especially Andrews bleeding fingers,makes drumming seem more intense and endurance-demanding then Mixed Martial Arts,it sucks you in and refuses to let go.No,none of the two leads(Maybe Simmons should've been up for a lead Oscar)are especially likable,Fletchers vulgar persona is pretty quickly presented to us,while Andrew in a hilariously awkward scene breaks up with his girlfriend based on elaborate,selfish speculation on how she would react to him having drumming as his number-one-passion. They may not be that likable but they are very human and though not admitting it,they both know they're flawed individuals.The editing is amazing in this film. The frantic rhythm,the close,effective cuts in a rhythmic,musical tempo,especially during the films drumming-sessions,are hypnotic. Along with the flawless sound-mixing,that makes for three very well deserved Oscars. What a film!What an energy! What a masterpiece! I can not wait to see what the confident newcomer Damien Chazell brings us in the future. If this is not your tempo,then I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TLDR: This film is amazing, Miles Teller, though most people may be skeptical about him as an actor, J.K. Simmons is absolutely terrifying, but hilarious. Fantastic film!Whiplash: A young drummer (Played by Miles Teller) joins an elite band class with an abusive teacher (Played by J.K. Simmons) who is a massive jerk to all his students.Miles Teller is incredible in this movie, some may be skeptical about his mediocre career as an actor. But, though you may be doubtful about all performances done by Miles, unlike most of his performances. This performance is amazing. J.K. Simmons.. Holy &amp;#*$.. He is terrifying in the movie, it feels like a really good psychological horror movie when he is on screen. He has some really awful anger issues. Some of his lines include: "That is not your boyfriend's d&amp;%*, so don't come too early." or "We have a squeaker today, class. His name is Andrew Nieman, he's 19 years old. Isn't he cute?" He acts super nice to everyone in the beginning, then ruin's their life! Anyway, this movie is an 10/10, it's incredibly intense, and the acting is fantastic! I hope you have seen it, if not, see it.. NOW!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash" is an electrifying film about the lengths someone is willing to be pushed in order to achieve greatness. Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman and J.K. Simmons as Terrence Fletcher drum up their best performances to date, as well as a pair of the best performances of 2014. Teller as Neyman is phenomenal, and the butting of heads between the leads is what drives many scenes of this film. All of the Oscar buzz behind Simmons' performance is valid; Terrence Fletcher is the ruthless music teacher at Schafer college whom Andrew Neyman strives so hard to impress. J.K. Simmons gives such a vulgar, astounding, and unrelenting acting job as Fletcher that even I felt infuriated by what he was saying while watching this film. The emotional and physical pain Neyman goes through to try and impress Fletcher is absolutely unbelievable, but the acting by Miles Teller, who has come a long way from 21 &amp; Over, allows the pain to be understood. Damien Chazelle's directing is also very smooth, and the score is perfect for a movie about Jazz music. "Whiplash" is a fantastic film with magnificent acting, wonderful music, and a final fifteen minutes that will entice and amaze any viewer able to appreciate how far Andrew Neyman has come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, already a classic movie.In years to come we'll be looking back to it. Yes, it's that good. Amazing performances, amazing screenplay, surprising twists,...it has the lot. The movie that should have won best picture of the year.If you happen to be playing in a band, it's even more relevant. If, by one of those weird synchronicities, you happen to see it just after a bad rehearsal on which you quarreled with the drummer, which I had, it's kind of an emotional experience. I couldn't help but root for Fletcher. If you are into music, technically he was right all the time. There's not a moment in the movie when he's not spot on. He's a bastard and you can argue if it's right or not to treat another human being as he did (which I don't think it is), but he was fair. When they played good, he said it. That's his saving grace. And he had no hidden agenda. Just musical perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a student of classical music for 20 years I have always been in AWE of jazz musicians. I love jazz, I love listening to it, love the sense of humor it has, the style, the spirit and yes, the tempo - jazz is way more complex than your normal, every day music whether it's classical, rock or whatever. Whatever people think about the brutality or how music teachers push their students towards greatness is really not the point to me. The point is that it takes extreme discipline to reach perfection. How does one measure perfection? The only measure I know myself is if I get goosebumps when listening to a performance and if I hear that Big Boy Tempo without any hiccups. This movie and its music gave me goosebumps. Simple as that.So 10/10 stars here - no ifs or buts about it.</fullReview>

The limitation was finally broken through under the psycho master's abuse. That topic is so sick although it may be true in lots of real cases, but it shouldn't be advocated.Personally I think it will never be right to treat your students or apprentice like dirt! Is it really important to break through one's limitation while losing your life? If you don't have that talent, just forget it. Be a normal happy person is better that this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like J.K. Simmons, especially for during his Spider-man years - I think he's all the more deserving of that Oscar for being underrated for so long (still hope Edward Norton gets his pretty soon.)And I love jazz, and I love all sorts of genres of music; as long as I hear a good talented song, whatever it is, I i like it. Though I draw the line at heavy metal.I just watched this film just to see what all the hype was about - saw on people's review videos, from film critics, from Best Movies of 2014 lists, etc. But I'm a Christian, and I prefer more the wholesome, family-esc, morally strong, uplifting, and feel-good movies that are just enjoyable to the general audience. and I'm not a fan of violence or profanity, nore do I find them the least bit entertaining.Overall, I just think this film is quite unrealistic; a teacher bullying his students, especially in music classes, in New York. I just honestly don't think that would happen - I don't think I have any friends who practice any of the drums have a teacher even remotely close to that of Flecther.(Though it's almost ironic how Simmons - the actor I like - played the antagonist, while Miles Teller - an actor I almost don't like - played the protagonist.In the end, I give this film a a solid "6" simply for Simmons keeping me on the edge of my seat.PS: Want to watch a good, wholesome underrated film?

		<shortDescription>The genius in Andrew can even vanquish the monstrous tyrant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film we have a professor-conductor, Terence Fletcher, in Manhattan's music conservatory teaching jazz in some rather small big band formation (around twenty musicians). He wants to be and remain the best, at least he wants his band to be and remain the best, at least even more he wants his reputation to remain the best. To do that he must constantly recruit new musicians arriving in the school and he must train them and that's where the gist lies (both "is situated" and "tells a lie," the two "giving the lie to Fletcher"). Fletcher is a terror, absolutely feared to the point of total psychological deconstruction because he demands absolute submission to his own judgment and his own judgment is only targeting his sole objective: bring the daemonic genius out of the student for his (Fletcher's) sole interest.The point is that he fails over and over again because he tries to break the standard student he has in front of him with violence if necessary, throwing a chair at the student, and especially setting him in competition with people who are even at times less good that the concerned student is, putting these less good subjects in the student's place to make him earn that place though Fletcher will deny he has earned anything in the process. The question is why does this procedure fail? It is bound to fail because it is nothing but a slave-breaking procedure inspired from the infamous Willie Lynch. He should use his position to enter the student's mind and emotions and to push the student's pride and desire to become the best as an emotion that can develop in the student's mind and not as a tool for the professor to impose a dominating will power that comes exclusively from the professor.That's the absolute mistake that is done in most teaching positions and institutions by the few who mix up good intentions and power. Sooner or later anyway the concerned professors are marginalized and then expelled because they do not fit the standard definition and procedural methods. There will always be one who will complain, especially one who will have failed the attempt of becoming the best.Strangely enough in this film Andrew will be able to reach that point of excellence and excellent creativity, beyond all tempos or tempi, scores and conducting, let alone conductors. Andrew will find the energy to do it in two emotional successful failures, and I have to insist on that oxymoron because the best among us are always governed by contradictory emotions. With his one time girl friend he had broken off with, when he embarked on his second musical chance and wanted to patch it up with her ? a second chance given by Fletcher himself several months after Andrew's failure and his own being fired from the conservatory ? he then tries to invite her for the concert he is going to be part of and he discovers she has a boyfriend who is maybe is not in jazz. And after a first piece on that concert that did not work that well because he did not have the score and had not been told ahead of time by Fletcher about that piece: he had to improvise and Fletcher became obnoxious. Andrew then leaves and finds his father in the corridor who wants to take him home instead of rebuilding his pride. And that is the second emotional failure: his father did not understand his positive frustration and did not support the positive side of it and did not send him back on stage.Andrew will in fact and on his own lightning decision go back on stage and take over the performance, I mean, become the one who is leading the whole band. Details about the taming of the shrewish Fletcher by the finally revealed Andrew is a piece of absolute bliss for anyone who believes in education and in stepping over the line of perfection to reach the never ending road to creativity, best-hood. And all that is only expressed in music.To conclude on the school system that destroys students more than bring them to excellence, perfection and creativity, just listen to what Miles Teller has to say about one of these monster-teachers: "My second grade teacher told me I would never graduate high school. That I was going to be a juvenile delinquent." If the second grade was the sophomore high school year, this remark was de-motivating and absurd. If the second grade was the second grade of grade school, hence the second year of elementary school that remark was just criminal. Some education "specialists" were defending under Richard Nixon, and I guess are still defending, that any future delinquent could be picked as soon as 5, 6 or 7 years of age. We are not far from such a situation. And I can guarantee you such criminal teachers exist and that the majority of the teachers are just trying to teach to everyone a standard gruel called "subject X, Y or Z" considering it is the responsibility of the students to do the best they can with it, and that's just the point if they can.What is the alternative to Fletcher? It is to make a student target the highest point he can imagine but with his emotions, his psyche, his mind and the teacher has to articulate himself on these emotions, psyche and mind, in order to vitalize and amplify these emotions, this psyche and this mind. That's a lot more difficult. It takes more time, but it is bound to be successful, even with the most reluctant who might at first protest, but we all know "The lady protests too much." A marvelous film we should see over and over again. Not one minute is wasted in useless smooching. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and Brilliant!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jazz music has always been an enigma. Something that only a minority truly understand and for those who do, it is a passion which delves deep into the soul. In 'Whiplash', Director Damien Chazelle has captured the complexity, passion, soul and grit of jazz at it's very core. This astonishing film follows young drummer Andrew Nieman (Miles Tellar) who is discovered by the terrifying and yet utterly revered bandleader Terrence Fletcher (JK Simmons) whilst studying at the prestigious Shaffer Music Conservatory. Fletcher's unconventional and often brutal teaching techniques push Nieman above and beyond his physical, emotional and mental limits. Never before has a musical themed film portrayed the passion and literal blood and sweat that get thrown into playing music. The film is brilliantly shot with Andrew's brutal drumming scenes an absolute stand out. Droplets of sweat and blood drip from his sticks and cymbals as he rages through complex drum solos. JK Simmons plays the role of a lifetime as Fletcher. His presence alone is terrifying, as are the lines he delivers such as 'are you a rusher or are you a dragger or are you going to be on MY FU**ING TIME!!' These lines are delivered with such ferocity and brutality by Simmons. What ensues is one of the most impressive and tense power struggles in film history. Whiplash is an absolute landmark of a film that will ring in your ears long after the final stroke!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the other nominated Best Picture and I genuinely like them, but to me, this is by far the Best Picture of the year. Great writing, great acting, great directing, fantastic editing and amazing music. J.K. Simmons is an amazing actor. I remember him on OZ and boy did he blow the performance out the water... And you know what, Miles Teller met him step for step. This film is about obsession. Obsession of Mile Teller to be the best and Obsession of JK Simmons to never settle. The film centers around Miles as he is studying at a music conservatory. He is picked to be part of the best jazz ensemble in the school. But soon he realizes that the guy he admires is the toughest and most demanding person he has ever met. And you sit on the edge of your seat with each scene, ESPECIALLY when they are in it together. I wish I can tell you how its all going to play out, but I can't. I want you to enjoy each morsel, each moment that happens. I knew I wanted to see this movie once I saw the preview and heard part of the music. If you a fan of jazz, this is a must own. But music fan or not, this is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense and ambitious music story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is definitely Oscar material, a story about music conservatory student Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) who aspires to be one of the greatest drummers. His goals are tested by music instructor Terrance Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who will go at the most intense lengths to realize a student's potential.The film picks up speed immediately, where Fletcher sees Andrew practicing the drums, cynically asking him why he stopped when he walked into the room. It then takes you to non-stop suspense of Andrew ending up enrolling in Fletcher's band class, where he witnesses Fletcher's intense and abusive methods (from swearing/shouting at students to throwing music stands around) of teaching and where he goes through highs and lows to try to meet Fletcher's high standards of becoming the greatest drummer. This will make you become engaged to the film's plot as you try to find out if Andrew will ever meet his potential through Fletcher's eyes.Damien Chazelle did an outstanding job writing the script and directing the film, providing us with an intense and awe-inspiring plot and a well-acted cast of characters. J.T. Simmons did a spectacular job in his role as Fletcher, definitely worthy of his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win, and Miles Teller did a great job in his Andrew role - ambitious and energetic. I enjoyed watching the love/hate student-teacher relationship between them, and also thought the father/son relationship between Andrew and his dad Jim (Paul Reiser) was heartwarming.I took music lessons throughout my kid/teenage years and this film does take me back to those days of music practicing, rhythm and getting the notes in tune. I'm just glad my teachers weren't as intense or strict as Fletcher was :) Overall, it's one of the best dramas I've seen and is highly recommended! Grade A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to begin by appreciating Miles Teller. He is a brilliant actor! After watching Two night stand, I thought he'd be stuck doing rom coms but he does Whiplash and shines! J.K.Simmons is a seasoned actor but plays his part amazingly. All the tension and nervous energy that we feel in the movie is brought about mainly by Simmons. He's mostly not likable and I, like many others, did not quite approve of his technique of 'pushing kids over the edge'. He should push but should also know when to stop. Also, I felt like the end dragged a bit although during the (long!)final sequence I was cheering Teller for his drumming slap to Simmons. It was definitely a great shot. All in all, I liked the movie very much and initially, because of all the tension, I wanted to stop watching, but I did not and I am glad. It has many golden moments that will make you go whoa! There are a few points which required me to suspend my belief, like the bleeding hands from drumming, but I guess that just made the movie all the more intense. A very good movie and although it did not inspire me, it surely satisfied me and I will not be surprised if it bags more than a few awards.</fullReview>

But the way it is shot is so intense that you start to feel sorry for the lead actor (Miles Teller). I read in IMDb that he had learned to drum from the age of 15. He has put all that initial learning to use in this film so well. What a performance by this young chap!!!!J.K. Simmons as the instructor is raw and brutal. Stunning acting by a seasoned actor.

		<shortDescription>Mildly entertaining with mind-blowing musical scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now despite of what I'm going to say, I want to make it clear, that I don't think this is a bad movie at all. As usual, it's just the script, that fails to live up to it's premise and indie movie or not, Whiplash is being harshly overrated in my opinion.First of all, while J.K. Simmons' performance is highly enjoyable his character development is being entirely neglected throughout the movie, leaving me unable to comprehend his implied ambiguity at all. This is a major drawback, considering his motifs are a big part of the movie. Apparently I'm not the only one who noticed this, writer (and director) Damien Chazelle takes the cheap way out nevertheless and instead of giving Simmons some actual scenes to develop trough he just blatantly bashes in a monologue at the end trying to clarify the characters motifs. Chazelle instead puts all the focus on the character of Andrew Neyman and his rather trivial coming-of-age problems which are appropriate for an upper-middle class boy his age but nothing even in the ballpark of justifying a whole movie. He's studying music at an elite school and has to prioritize. His family doesn't quite get him. So what?The other thing being totally neglected is the chemistry between the two main characters. This might be understandable in context of the plot but in order for me to be able to connect with a relationship there first needs to be one. This unfortunately means Whiplash falls short on it's premise exactly where it matters, trying to be an underdog movie without a real underdog or a real mentor or real stakes making it impossible for the movie to live up to it's potential.These are just bad writing choices easily explained by simply not neglecting that Chazelle was the writer behind "masterpieces" like Grand Piano and The Last Exorcism Part II as well.Now while I feel the movie is being praised rather for what it could have been then for what it actually turned out to be I would still recommend it for most viewers. Teens and casuals probably won't be bothered by the shortcomings of the script and everyone is set to enjoy the musical scenes that are nothing short of amazing and fortunately receive major attention. The rest is kept together neatly by solid craftsmanship from everyone involved.All in all, Whiplash is mildly entertaining without any real lows and some amazing highs every time Andrew picks up those sticks.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying on a visceral level, but overcooked and conceptually absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the film this past weekend and, after mulling it over, ultimately came away liking it?. but not quite loving it. I think the movie is superbly made on a technical level: it's tremendously edited, the use of sound is terrific, the whole thing is incredibly kinetic, has great energy, and is an absolutely enthralling, gripping experience?. But on a conceptual level, it's just so preposterous and absurd, I had a lot of trouble taking it seriously (and maybe I'm not supposed to(?)). But for this film in particular, it was problematic for me and kept me from embracing it completely.This is going to sound harsh, but the movie played to me like a really, really good student film. It just feels overcooked, sort of "show-offy," but without much justification for all the razzle dazzle. It's set at such an outrageously high pitch from the outset, but the dramatic beats don't feel earned or believable in any way. It makes me wish the film were set in a different world where the character dynamic is still the same, but credible in a different narrative context. I get that part of the appeal of the film is that it's set in this world where you wouldn't necessarily expect this kind of tension and intensity to be wrung out of it? but that's part of the problem for me. It's like Chazelle started with this idea and setting and graphed the drama onto it so forcibly that the whole thing just feels inorganic and overtly "concocted" if that makes sense.So much of it works incredibly well, but it just lacks a convincing conceptual backbone? This may seem like a strange comparison, but I enjoyed the film for the similar reasons that I liked Blackhat (another film I saw this past week)? I found both films to be very engrossing and satisfying on a purely visceral level, in spite of their shortcomings.Chazelle seems like a promising filmmaker, and this film is impressive on a craftsmanship level, so I look forward to whatever he makes next.Again, I ultimately liked it? but not enough to call it one of the best of the year. I feel like I'm in the minority in saying that because I've seen it on so many people's top ten lists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash reminded me of just how much I love films, it made me feel alive, it was an exhilarating experience from start to finish, and it's without a shadow of a doubt the best film of 2014. The most disturbing thing is just how taken aback I was by the genius of Whiplash.There is a staunch invigorating sense of malice about it, there is tension that ebbs and flows and builds and the result is a work of inspired genius that leaves you pleading for more. The film is edited deliberately like a finely tuned instrument hitting every line of dialogue and composing every shot with the sharpest precision. The cuts are meticulously crafted with the strongest effect possible. There is an arresting visceral sensibility about it. There is a heavy emphasis throughout the film on the investment of blood and sweat required to play a piece of music perfectly in tune, in tempo and on time.Though not the primary genre of music I listen to I can certainly recognize that writer/director Damien Chazelle is intensely knowledgeable on Jazz as a subject matter, this holds him in good stead to deliver something purely inspirational with this film. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons develop a relationship of tectonic razor sharp attrition the likes of which I've never witnessed. It's a two man show of relentless ferocity. Teller is astounding as a musician with aspirations of great. Teller is given the much less flashy role of anchoring the movie in an emotional core, he pulls it off flawlessly. Simmons' performance is nothing short of brilliant as the coach whose heavy handed tactics and unique methods he believes will reward him with a great student. Simmons chews up the scenery at every given opportunity. His character is possessed by an anecdote relating to Charlie Parker reaching the pinnacle of jazz drumming after getting a symbol thrown at his head. He is rooted in the ideology that pushing people beyond what is expected of him will get him the results he craves. It is through the underlying rooting of these ideas through the characters that give it that extra layer of texture that allows it to reach higher in during the centerpiece moments of the film.There is an integral understanding of the fine line that exists between abuse and pushing someone mercilessly towards notorious greatness. The finale is engaging, pulsating, exhausting and uplifting. I was on the edge of my seat, the hairs were standing up on the back of my neck, and it was a sheer joy.There may be some who are not as taken with it by its very nature, a movie about jazz drumming I guess doesn't sound very exciting on paper. Synopses are lame; they never capture the true vision of the piece that can only be encapsulated by the sensory delights of the viewing experience. I was floored, shocked and amazing at its strength of conviction. It put a smile and my face and a beat in my head for hours afterwards. I am truly thankful for Whiplash, it was a film firmly rooted in the ideas of what a film should be. It had an in depth knowledge and understanding of its subject matter and showed the ability to be fearless and step out of the often stiflingly rigid narrative structures. It's not afraid to be bold and take risks at the same time. It was the definition of sensational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash indeed is the BEST film of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a perfect 10! my words simply cannot describe how good this film is. very powerful and at the same time, very moving. never thought a drummer would have to suffer so much in order to achieve the greatness. there's a sentence that made me feel so right: 'good job' actually is the reason why put off people to become great. because good job also means mediocre, it only means that you just reach a high plateau or just on the foothill instead at top of the mountain, the ultimate greatness. the year of 2014 was another year that gave us some of the best films, and 'whiplash' is right on the top list. Simmons had won lot of nominations and awards, but i do think the young actor also deserves the highest praise. before watched this film, i never paid any attention to this young actor, but now, i'd concentrate my focus on this young talent. also, the writer/director and all the supporting actors in this film are great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely in my top 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie changed my life. It made me a jazz fan over night, I've seen it at least 10 times. No kidding. This legendary movie made J.K. Simmons spike up in my top 10 actors. He deserves his Oscar totally. He took my breath away. I feel stupid trying to talk about this movie, it's just so so above brilliant. I am one of those people who watch at least 10 movies a week, and has seen almost everything there is to see, but seriously, having to speak about this work of art leaves me paralyzed, I feel like I don't know enough and appropriate words to do it justice. Watch it. If you are born, seriously, if you aren't blind or deaf, WATCH IT. This is the kind of movie you replay after you finish it. At least for me. It's such a relief that this kind of masterpieces make it to the Academy Awards, it deserved more than the nomination, even though Birdman made it a fair competitor. Just watch it. Anyone who reads this. WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple concept with a brilliant execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than "good job"."This is Whiplash's mantra; Damian Chazelle's second feature starring Milles Teller, who helms the film as a driven musician and drummer in a conservatory band led by the strict and abusive mentor J.K. Simmons. The plot follows their relationship as Teller struggles to gain success and the approval of his mentor. If you're not a jazz fan, don't worry. "Whiplash" is as much about jazz as "Raging Bull" is about boxing. It's just background, or maybe even less than that. This is a film that knows what audiences are fed, but it also knows what they are craving. Its story might seem almost too simple or formulaic, but the urgency with which it's told is what makes it unique.In an age where most movies dawdle through their run time, unsure of where to go or what to do, "Whiplash" is a breath of fresh air; but a breath you'll most likely be holding throughout the entire film. "Whiplash" builds up like an exquisite piece of music and doesn't waste a single frame. Teller and Simmons's relationship is at times sick, poisonous and even destructive. Chazelle magnificently frames "Whiplash" in ill lit and oppressive environments. Its close-ups are, for a lack of a better word, claustrophobic and make "Whiplash" look like it just might bend the frame and burst from the film at any time. Of course a lot of this energy is merit of the actors as well and, in this case, to say that J.K. Simmons is great is an understatement. I fail to recall a more menacing and authoritative performance since R. Lee Ermey in "Full Metal Jacket". Damian Chazelle has taken a simple and universal concept, the eternal struggle for success and acknowledgment, and made it into an incredible and high-octane film. While I know better than to congratulate him, with "Whiplash" I think it's safe to say he's earned it. He's done a hell of a job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way the movie connects with us is just delightful. It's different from all the movies I have watched and I will watch probably. That's why it's worth to watch over and over again. I've already seen it 3 times. I definitely recommend it to everyone. It's a movie I'd watch both alone and with friends or my family. Sometimes one needs to be alone and think by himself/herself because his/her close ones lowered his/her motivation. And this is a movie just for that. It just makes you gain your motivation again and makes you feel that you can accomplish anything in this world, if you want enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting study in obsession, ambition and sadism, brilliantly crafted and compelling to watch despite the disturbing content: endless sexism, abuse and brutality. But in the end, it seemed to me an eloquent justification for bullying and, as such, very distasteful. Teacher drives talented student to the brink of total self-destruction: I don't doubt that it sometimes happens, and is a worthy subject for a movie. Apparently the story is based on the director's own experience. But would a teacher whose abusive behaviour is so brazen, extreme and public really last long in a top institution? This movie seems to argue that such 'teaching' actually works and is to be celebrated. No thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadistic movie leaves confused feelings afterwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew from the trailer that the movie wouldn't be a nice movie leaving you with some happiness afterwards. However, I've seen most other movies that has come out lately so I had nothing else to watch and gave it a chance. I very rarely write reviews and usually just rate the movie, however this movie is so sadistic that it needs to be reviewed for other peoples safety.First of all, I used to be a drummer myself. The quality of the drumming and choice of music is fantastic. The actors are doing great except that the attention was towards the two main characters the whole movie. This gave the feeling that all the other characters were just put there to help show the personality of the two main characters. The drummer is an insecure, self centered teenager seeking for glory and the mentor is an sadistic, bullying psychopathic conductor justifying his methods with that they give result. The student struggles getting recognized by the conductor but somehow finds his glory and happy ending. I worry about the students future in this fictional world. He will probably kill himself in a couple of years as an another student of this conductor did.This movie didn't leave me either happy, relieved, inspired or anything similar. If you wish to not feel good afterwards, its an excellent movie for you. I worry people think bullying people into success is justified if it gives results since people made such positive reviews. It saddens me people like and supports movies which glorify bullying. I hope this review gives another perspective to the movie since most reviews were very positive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, the movie is totally captivating. It's uncomfortable, tension-filled and electric. Acted exactly right, you feel as if you're there, in the characters shoes, experiencing all of the emotions as if they're a part of you... an uncomfortable part of you.Filmed exactly right, expressions captured with all of their raw emotion, I was stunned when I discovered this was a relatively inexpensive Indie made in just 19 days! It's a different kind of review because I know that world. The world of hard-edge, power-driven, maniacal coaches that push to the limit, often, and mostly, without empathy, understanding that human greatness will not soar forth from the banal and the 'good enough' effort. However, the mental and emotional games and the cruelty can be seriously difficult to watch in this movie. It's arguable whether hard-hitting and demeaning instructors make or break students, but there's always that chance that once in a lifetime, the extremity of humiliation, mind games and emotional battering will meet with the kind of resistance and brilliance that every coach can only dream of.A must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...if you are interested in applied ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will analyze the issues raised by this movie: 1.Career vs. Love What do you do if you feel that you need all your time for your projects? Are you willing to discard your relationship even if there are promises of love? Are you willing to give up love to focus all your energy and passion in what you do? Time is a limited resource, if you have to choose between love and career what will you do? 2.Negative pedagogy As a pedagogue, Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is awful. I will not call in question his results (we are let to believe that he won a series of jazz competitions) but if you think at the overall picture, the number of people who left his classroom disappointed and with a ruined psyche you realize that he is a horrible teacher. And now we can address the point at issue: there are such reasons as to justify the kind of behavior displayed by Fletcher in the classroom, his extreme negative pedagogy? There are fields of human endeavor in which it doesn't matter how many are spoiled if you manage to produce one who is the very best? Is it OK to force people beyond their limits with the intention to make them great if in the process the majority is wrecked?Is it worth it to tear down a hundred reasonable musicians with the hope that one of them will become a great one, one who will make history? Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) asked a very good question: there is a line that once crossed has the effect of disheartening the next Charlie Parker? The answer given by Fletcher is very convenient: there isn't such a line. If someone is good he will put up with every kind of abuse. Practically he is giving himself a free license to behave no matter how abusive without the need to answer for the effects of his behavior. I believe that this method is dangerous because you may choose to push someone hard at the wrong time making him snap, destroying someone who could have been the next great one. Even if you are extremely skilled and you pay a lot of attention to your student you may go too far and this will have a terrible outcome. 3.Motivation How much rude and derogatory behavior is OK to endure, knowing that the abuse is making you better? Knowing that the anger you accumulate because of the abuse makes you give your very best? Is this the best way to energize yourself, submitting voluntarily as a target for rude and insulting behavior? What are the psychological consequences on your creativity? I presume that the goal is not only to become a virtuoso but also to be able to make your own music. Anger, rage are powerful emotions but are they the best avenue for energizing your will?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Interesting Perspective on a Typical Master/Apprentice Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OVERVIEW Instead of attempting to sit through a three-hour coming-of-age borefest I decided to watch this interesting movie written and directed by Damien Chazelle. It's one of those movies that I would typically have no interest in seeing, specifically with the central premise of the flick being jazz. However, I love and appreciate all types of music, and there was some extremely positive reviews surrounding it so I felt like I needed to see what the fuss was about. After sitting through it I can see why it is praised. This movie is completely captivating. It gives you a real sense of the passion invigorating the main character Andrew (Miles Teller) and the boundaries he is willing to push past in his venture for perfection. It plays off as a very dark interpretation of a typical 'master and apprentice' story. With the bold, and sometimes brutal, nature of Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) polars the suppressed, self-conscious drummer with an ambition.I think the main drive for the narrative in my opinion is the sympathy you feel towards Andrew. He is a lonely student with no social life and feels under appreciated by his family who don't understand his talent and career path. He is desperate to feel some sort of recognition and when the opportunity is given to him, he doesn't hold back. This ambition in turn has an effect on his ego, and his new found relationship with a love interest. The way the movie was shot really adds to the tension and frustration in scenes. The extreme close ups and fast paced cuts from camera to camera when he's trying to reach Fletcher's standard gives it such an exhilarating feel. You route for Andrew and feel his aggressive and confined love for the art and seeking his teacher's approval.PERFORMANCES The film practically has two performances to judge on, and both actors completely excel. Miles Teller as the suppressed but talented Andrew gives a fantastic performance. He adds such a sense of realism to the character you completely relate to his social anxiety and frustration in trying to find self worth. However, JK Simmons stands out by a few steps. The confident and dominant nature of Fletcher really shines through in his scenes, with the funny yet harsh jokes made at student's expense giving your hatred towards him, but the method behind the madness making sense in the end. They both work as a fantastic parallel in scenes.NOTEWORTHY MOMENTS I really feel that the most intriguing moments are involving the working relationship between Andrew and Fletcher. The classroom scenes are so tension driven it really adds a sense of anxiety towards the character. The physical and moral dilemmas faced by Andrew when trying to impress Simmons, with Fletcher constantly pushing him harder to bring out the greatness in his playing. It's fantastically done. Each classroom scene builds the tension between the two characters until Andrew comes to a boiling point and lashes out at Fletcher.This in turn leads me to the ending. After Andrew is kicked out of Shaffer for his outburst the movie takes a very interesting turn. He testifies against Fletcher anonymously and packs up his drums for good. When he stumbles across Fletcher performing in a Jazz club, he sits down with him and they talk. I love this scene, it establishes all of Fletcher's motivations in teaching and why he acted the way he did to his students. He wanted to push people to achieve greatness, and he is at piece with trying to make the next big musician for the dying jazz scene. It summarises the hopes he had for Andrew, and that his unorthodox methods were executed with incentive. The false promise that it gives to Andrew when he is offered a place in his Carnegie Hall performance only to seek revenge by ruining his chances of a career, really adds a sinister and cruel premise to the finale.The final scene when Andrew walks back out on stage after being humiliated really emphasises the difference in execution to straight forward story telling. Taking Andrew's journey through the movie into consideration; the protagonist enters a world filled with hopes and dreams, it doesn't turn out as planned, after his struggle to achieve his goal he is at his lowest point, only to face the obstacle and overcome it. This is a very simple, generic, but effective premise. But this movie tells it in such an interesting way that it doesn't feel patterned. Any story in the right hands will be done justice. The ending really emphasises Andrew's triumph over Fletcher, proving him right in his original thoughts on him and the musical connection that they slowly begin to share that was lacking throughout the film.FINAL VERDICT This movie is a unique perspective on simple storytelling, that offers both a strange yet exhilarating premise, driven home by two great performances and well directed scenes to add to the excitement. It's a great movie, it feels like Damien Chazelle cared about his film and the message that he was trying to convey. In order to achieve greatness, you have to work hard. But you have to be prepared to sacrifice some things you take for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash (2014) **** (out of 4) Hard-hitting drama plays out much like a thriller as Andrew (Miles Teller) dreams of becoming a great drummer no matter what the cost is. He ends up attending the best music school in the country and it doesn't take long before he's hand picked by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the best teacher there who will stop at nothing to get the best out of his students.WHIPLASH is a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and is leaving a major mark on those who see it. I will admit that I hadn't really heard too much about the film but it seems with each passing day there was someone new singing it's praises. Well, having now seen the movie I'm going to join the crowd and tell everyone how wonderful it actually is. I think one of the hardest things to do is take a familiar genre (teacher- student relationship) and trying to bring new life to it. Director-writer Damlen Chazelle manages to do just that because we've seen this type of film several times before but it's done in such a way here that you can't help but feel you're watching something fresh and original.I think one of the biggest reasons it feels fresh is due to the actual subject of a drummer. You'd expect to see something about singers or guitar players but to set this in the world of a drummer and Jazz music was something that works so well because of the wild, frantic style of the jazz score works perfectly well with the work and abuse that the main character forces on himself. The scenes of Andrew working his hands to blood are just so flawlessly edited with the score that you can't help but feel every drop of blood that drips from his hands. Another major plus is the actual editing, which is incredibly fast-pace but falls well short of that MTV-style that has become so worn out the past two decades.Of course, the film's highlight is without question the performance of Simmons who is simply wonderful. Again, we've seen angry people countless times before and we've seen caring teachers countless times before. What's so memorable about the performance here is how quickly Simmons is able to change emotions from caring to pure rage in the matter of seconds. Getting the eyes to tell you what you need to know from a scene is extremely hard but just watch Simmons' eyes throughout the picture.The rage he shows isn't just mindless screaming and cussing because you can still see a certain emotion and caring in his eyes. Teller is also excellent in the role and manages to stand his own against Simmons. Both Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist are also very good in their supporting parts.What also makes WHIPLASH so memorable is the fact that it really plays out like a thriller. I'm not going to ruin anything that happens but we can see the main character falling apart due to the abuse from the teacher and we know something is eventually going to happen to cause havoc. The film plays this suspense out as if you're watching a thriller and it really pays off in the final twenty-minutes as there are a couple excellent twists. The film certainly has everything you want from a movie and it's clearly one of the best of 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would anyone actually relinquish all traces of humanity for a shot at joining an orchestra, no matter how renowned?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the Shaffer Conservatory of Music in New York, 19 year-old Andrew (Miles Teller), an aspiring drummer in his first year, gets a chance audition with Dr. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the austere conductor of the highly esteemed jazz orchestra. The opportunity to shine is something of a blunder, though it leads to the talented student's eventual selection as an alternate for the band. But no one is really good enough for Fletcher, who rules his class with an iron fist and, like a drill sergeant, barks orders and spews colorful insults with an incredibly short temper. He interacts with his students in a passive-aggressive manner, one moment offering encouraging words, the next throwing objects at their heads. "Let's have fun!" he exclaims before switching a bipolarity switch to spontaneously arrange radical humiliation and unleash extreme scurrility.Fletcher isn't a friend or a role model, but a motivator. His quest for absolute perfection routinely borders on cruelty, especially as he seems to relish making his pupils quiver and cry in their chairs - marking his brand of incentivizing highly controversial. At the Overbrook Jazz Competition, a second of negligence ushers in a lucky break that allows Andrew to step into the core position, where he's subjected to even more excruciating forms of stimulus as he aims to be the next big thing (or the next Charlie Parker).Early on, the camera observes small details of musicians warming up, briefly touching upon the significance of sounds, the rhythm and pace that seems to exist in every activity, and the distinguishing separations of noise and music. But this artistic aside is lost to the relentless self-destruction of the lead character who, while determined to become a household name (like percussionists Buddy Rich and Jo Jones, though neither are perhaps as famous as Gene Krupa, who isn't mentioned - and it's likely all three drummers are far from common knowledge subjects), forfeits physical wellbeing, mental stability, and family and friends. His practicing is an unhealthy obsession; his goals are relatively impossible, his dedication resembles Stockholm syndrome, and his ideas of success reveal the most deplorable aspects of competition and rivalry.Andrew isn't much of a hero or antihero, while his nemesis is a thoroughly unlikeable, abusive monster, ultimately giving the audience no one to root for ? though the actors are unquestionably divine in their challenging roles. In "Whiplash's" examinations of passion, value, sacrifice, and meaningful accomplishment, a world of utter unhappiness emerges from an exaggerated arena of professional performers. The tolls on the mind and body are incredible and the payoff appears almost nonexistent. Is this an accurate portrayal, or just embellished representations for the sake of drama? Would anyone actually relinquish all traces of humanity for a shot at joining an orchestra, no matter how renowned? Is the film about unyieldingly pursuing dreams, callously dashing hopes, or recognizing failure? It isn't until the final 15 minutes that "Whiplash" unveils a striking shift in purpose and a very welcome twist. What was previously a character study and an analyzation of corrupted methodologies becomes a masterful blend of furious soloing, outrageous energy, a nerve-wracking power struggle, a climactic showdown, and the revelation of reasoning behind torturous tribulations. It all ends on a triumphantly upbeat note that has the intensity to completely dominate every annoyance and dubious direction that came before it. And the continuous jazz music playing in the background, through headphones, on compact discs, inextricably surfacing in musings, and emanating from recitals is utterly absorbing.</fullReview>

The storyline is far from original and brought in a far from original way, the acting is o-k-ish (just Simmons though, Teller is as weak as ever), the little love-angle that was put in might as well have been skipped and the story itself with the dictator-like teacher who, although the school principal said he was being watched, can do what he wants is just totally implausible.

Unfortunately, the same does not hold for the first 30 minutes of the film. This film really stretched the believability quotient for me. It was over-the-top absurd at times and I didn't "buy" much of the action. The music school was preposterous, people simply wouldn't let this behavior fly in this century. Miles Teller was quite good as the student, but I felt JK Simmons was miscast. Not because he is not a good actor, but because his TV persona is so memorable and opposite, that I just couldn't believe him in this role, unfortunately. The role was just ridiculous at times, so it's not just the actor. I'm happy to say that the film does get better in the second half, but not enough that I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bursting with energy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first sight, Whiplash seemed to me as another talent movie, which features the same clichés, no matter it's about music, dancing or sports. But the great reviews made me really curious about it, and I can honestly say, that it's nothing like your usual film about music.Damien Chazelle's work, like every beginner director's is full of raw power and energy. Every moment of Whiplash has so much dynamics and tension. You wouldn't expect surprising twists from these kind of movies, but Whiplash has the quality to show you something unexpected in every minute. The director incorporates a few small, but clever twist in the narrative, and these aren't twists for the twists' sake. Chazelle is unlike any other young director: his work is unbelievably calculated, there's not a single unnecessary frame in this picture, and he can always capture the essence of the moment or the actors' performances.And that's a good thing, because Whiplash relies hugely on those actors. Simmons' presence rules every scene he's in, he has clever lines, but the actor is doing most of the work. Miles Teller is a bit shadowed by him, but the young actor also does a great job, and the chemistry between the two of them is the absolute highlight of this movie. And with that, Chazelle can achieve that the songs are not just some promotional material, but important storytelling devices in the conflict of the main characters. The director is also great at capturing emotions through these song.Which takes us to my only problem with Whiplash: the scenes of the rehearsals or the musical performances are so intense and strong, that they make every other scene disappoint you a little. That's exactly the case with the storyline of the love interest or the middle part of the runtime.Whiplash is not the film of great words, act or emotional effects. But I think, nobody's going to care about that, because Chazelle's perfectionist storytelling is going to compensate everybody for that. It's not an flaming improvisation, it's not a shitty, but catchy pop song, but it's an artistic symphony. It may not be a classic, but it's brilliant cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this a 5, but it's important to explain that the reason is that I think it will please those who like these kinds of films and/or will enjoy the jazz. I agree with those who have pointed out that there were too many drill sargent/basic training type scenes, and while professional musicians put in a lot of practice time, what was portrayed here way way over the top. The Simmons character in particular was played with an almost sadistic quality (and little else to his personality), but for me that detracted greatly. I would like to have had some "backstory" on the two main characters, but instead it's just the same sort of thing, over and over again, with at least a mildly unrealistic ending that put it in the "Karate Kid" category.At least in "Searching for Bobby Fischer" we were compelled to ask if children should experience that kind of stress on a regular basis, but what's the essence of this film? Does it matter if this young man becomes a "great" drummer? I really don't care one way of the other. For all I know he is a rather nasty person who deserves to fail - nothing in the film suggested to the contrary! How can such a film me made with such obvious flaws? If it was made in someone's back yard with basically no budget, the story would be understandable, but it isn't here!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash may seem like an very original movie but really the story line is very shallow. I honestly just don't see where the story is going in Whiplash and at the end there seem to be a "meh" feeling of disappointment. Whiplash however does have its moments and the acting is phenomenal. I like the intensity and drama associated with Fletcher but story line wise there really is not much too it. Although don't get me wrong because Whiplash is a quality movie is just that the story it's pretty disappointing. So my advice to you on watching this movie is that don't expect too much from it because you really won't get anything out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece set in the jazz universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a promising young drummer studying at the best musical college of the country and his conflicted interaction with his teacher, played by J.K. Simmons. Simmons plays an abrasive, almost sadistic tutor, who pushes his students far beyond the line, physically as well as mentally, hoping to discover and shape the greatest jazz musician of the 21st century. His motto can be defined in one sentence: " There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'Good job'." Whereas Miles Teller embodies a new student to his class, dreaming of fame and greatness. As one could tell by this premise, their relationship is complex and holds mixed feelings of hope, violence, revenge and mental strength.It's one of the best films I have seen in the past years. The cast as well as the director have done an extraordinary job at catching those feelings on scene. The atmosphere is obviously dark and there is a lot of tension, and even as a spectator, you feel it deeply. I could not stand on my chair without being frustrated, or horrified or letting out gasps of surprise as I was watching it! In conclusion, I highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone!Bonus information: the film was filmed in the incredibly short time of 19 days, shot for 14 hours a day! This adds input on the incredible tension and pressure the movie evokes.</fullReview>

Believable characters. I had no idea J K Simmons was this good - so glad he got the Oscar, it was well deserved. The movie may be too intense for some people, but if you are a person with great passion for something in your life, then this will resonate with you very deeply! I was moved to tears on more than one occasion. On my drive home from the movie theater I was in tears again as I absorbed the passion of this great movie. This goes into my personal top ten favorites. This is a must-see movie!!! If you don't see this one, you are missing out on something very special. Loved it passionately!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely the best film of the year and perhaps the past 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Birdman is the pretentious heap that this film blows out of the water. As an artist, playwright, film maker, and writer I went into Birdman WANTING to love it. But alas, where the acting was good, the writing was not.Finally when it came Oscar time, I got to see Whiplash.This. This. This. is a film about art and about struggle. JK Simmons is absolutely incredible (although his acting career has already proved he can do anything.) Yes, he plays a hard arse teacher... and there is the debate that this film pushes that mentality that the only way to push your students is to demean them... but I see another side to it. For me at least, it was about the struggle we have as artists even just to accept ourselves as good enough. JK Simmons is the embodiment of the demons all artists struggle with.The entire film you are on the edge of your seat. It's a beautifully simple story while still being a very complex film. I've seen all the nominees and this film absolutely should have been best picture. Anyone that has seen it and "gets it" knows what we are talking about when we say that. It has such passion and fever that it is a classic already. I rarely say I have favorite films... but this one certainly jumped to my top 5.It's a testament to great acting, writing, directing and story. You'd be amiss to deny yourself the chance to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great as a movie - But jazz without improvisation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I greatly enjoyed this movie. The actors were very convincing and so was the story telling and cinematography. Ever since seeing it last night, this movie has haunted my mind. And of course that is a great thing a movie can achieve, right?I loved Whiplash because it raised many questions about art education and about teaching jazz music in particular. As a jazz lover I adored the music that was played. Unfortunately not all questions that were raised were actually answered within the story of the movie. Mainly because to my idea Whiplash displays an extremely limited view on what jazz music is about. And while being involved in the story I kept hoping that different approaches to music would be introduced... Too bad that did not happen.The main theme is all about dedication: Andrew wants to become a jazz legend so much, that he practices until his hands are bleeding. In his view the ultimate way towards success is to earn his teacher's approval. This professor (Fletcher) however, only exploits the student's ambition and keeps bullying him into raising the bar without end.But are talent, dedication and discipline the sole ingredients for achieving true greatness in music? Is fear of failure a good motivation? What about inspiration, the joy of creating fantastic music together with other musicians? In the school orchestras all students are trembling of making a mistake and in blind awe of their professor. Don't they have a mind of their own? In the movie Andrew also does not have any friends to create music with, not within nor outside of the school system. Does he really love music at all? He is only focusing on equaling the excellence of very old classic jazz (of half a century ago) and there is not even a spark of joy in the music he is making. Several times Charlie Parker is set as an example to Andrew by his teacher. He was supposed to have benefited greatly from his initial failure and humiliation. Why didn't the student question the truth behind the legend of Parker? Parker developed his technical and artistic talent by playing TOGETHER WITH many different other musicians in clubs during endless jam sessions. And very importantly: Charlie Parker's success was based on IMPROVISATION. How could a writer miss the opportunity to illustrate this huge thing by which jazz music is different from classical music? Why did Andrew allow himself to be degraded into a wind-up monkey, performing only the notes that are on the sheet music, within the tempo his teacher wanted to hear? Why did Andrew not get the insight that there is more to jazz music than this narrow path? It all remains a mystery.Even in the end of the movie his vision stays exactly the same: in the finale Andrew set off into a manic, everlasting drum solo, clearly intended only to wipe his teacher off his socks. In the end Andrew only starts to smile when Fletcher at last reluctantly approves of his performance. End of story...Music making as an equivalent to a boxing match! Play faster than Rocky Balboa's punches and the world is at your feet? Too bad the movie missed the opportunity of making clear that there is way much more to music.So, how about a sequel in which the ambitious student at last finds true artistic joy of playing REAL IMPROVISED JAZZ by playing WITH other musicians and by learning to actually LISTEN and INNOVATE music? That would have been the ultimate victory!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Suspenseful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie comes along that just whacks you over the head with its wonder and you don't know what to say. You don't know how it did it but it did. The notes it wanted to hit were all hit perfectly and it just can't be explained. "Whiplash" was one of those rare occurrences.Whiplash is the story of 19 year old Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) and his journey to achieving his dream of being one the best drummers the world has ever seen. This is complicated when he meets the instructor that will take him to that greatness, Terrance Fletcher (JK Simmons) and he realizes he is an extremely unpleasant human being that will do anything to bring him down. Andrew has to work harder than he ever thought he would have to if he is to survive and keep up with his instructors work demands and mind games.Being unpredictable is a trait that not many movies have. You can just about predict everything that's going to happen from start to finish for most movies but not this one. "Whiplash" has the tendency to make you believe you know exactly what's going to happen and then within the next minute that forecast will have been completely flipped on its head. There were numerous times in this film that gave my brain a workout just to try and comprehend what had just happened because it was both devastating and unexpected.If you're losing any hope or inspiration for keeping on going I would say this is great movie see. The lead character is a great metaphor for resilience and persistence. The amount of obstacles Andrew faces along his journey is immense but he never does what most people would do and lose sight of his goal. This is an honorable trait and gives me inspiration to really believe that with enough hard work you can do whatever you want to in life.The relationship between student and teacher is explored thoroughly in detail in "Whiplash" and the many complications it can have. How far is it OK to push the student to do their very best and how much is too little? Terrance Fletcher is one of the toughest and meanest authority figures to have ever graced the silver screen and when he attempts to teach the incredibly relatable Andrew Neiman you can't help but feel like Fletcher crosses the line. Though you can also see that all Terrance really wants to do is to sculpt a star out of Andrew and to make him achieve the goal that he's working so hard to achieve. Whether or not you agree in harsh teaching or soft and nurturing teaching the movie definitely displays the positive and negative sides of the way Terrance teachers and it's all down to how the student replies to the teaching and that is what the story is really about.JK Simmons does a wonderful job at portraying the vicious antagonist in "Whiplash" and stands out from all the rest. Miles Teller does a 'good job' as the relatable man with a dream but doesn't really take it to the next level as was the same with the rest of the cast, good but not great. This cannot be said for JK Simmons who gives an Oscar worthy and career defining act that will be remembered for many years to come as the nightmare for any struggling student. The director Damien Chazelle did a wonderful job of working with the actor's performances and creating a truly tense and uncomfortable environment that will stick in your mind for days to come. The only gripe I have with this movie is the overall story. The story is quite a dense story that doesn't really expand out to something bigger. It focuses on this man and struggle to follow his passion and that's about it. In saying that with what it has as an overall story this movie does a wonderful job of making you care about the story and it really forces you to feel every bump and turn that this movie has to offer which thankfully is plentiful.Overall "Whiplash" is an amazing movie that's really intense and really makes you care for the characters inside it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a good emotional ride and enjoys being in the dark to what's going to happen next in the story.I rate this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense &amp; electrifying film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a story about Andrew(Miles Teller). Andrew is an aspiring jazz drummer who is enrolled at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music. Andrew is extremely passionate about drumming &amp; will do anything to impress the chief band conductor at Shaffer, Fletcher(J.K. Simmons). However, Fletcher is an extremely short tempered &amp; driven teacher who will go to any lengths to make the student play to his full potential &amp; beyond. This could also mean something as extreme as inflicting emotional &amp; physical harm on his students. Soon, Andrew's drive to become the best jazz drummer in the world, turns unhealthy &amp; borders on obsession. Whiplash is an outstanding film. Right from the opening scene, the viewer is captivated by Andrew's drumming, goals &amp; aspirations. However, Whiplash is an unforgettable movie, thanks to the character of Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. Fletcher is unforgiving, intense, hilarious &amp; terrifying all at the same time. The jazz music in the film is catchy &amp; foot-tapping. What's even more impressive is Miles Teller did all of his own drumming in the movie. Director Damien Chazelle has made a scintillating film about jazz music. Miles Teller is brilliant as Andrew. Teller portrays Andrew's fatigue as the film progresses, beautifully. J.K. Simmons has given the best performance of his career as Fletcher. Simmons' portrayal of this insane teacher is flawless &amp; the highlight of the film. J.K. Simmons truly deserves all the praise &amp; awards he's received for his portrayal of Fletcher. Looking at the trend, he's definitely going to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Paul Reiser is great as Jim Neimann. Melissa Benoist is good as Nicole. Austin Stowell &amp; Nate Lang are impressive as Ryan &amp; Carl Tanner respectively. Whiplash is a must watch. Watch it immediately!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is a great behind the scenes look at a jazz band, about how greatness will drive people over the edge, until they soar. This film sucks you in and keeps you there, as it plays enthralling music at every opportunity it got, while making it look like the characters themselves were performing. JK Simmons performance was never faltering, and Miles Teller showed the hardships trying to be great could be. All side characters and performers were convincing, and never broke my immersion. While there were never really any awe inspiring single shots in the movie, the majority of the time a band was playing, the cameras would always be going everywhere, making even basic music playing very striking. Fantastic Movie, would recommend you blast the movie as loud as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash poses the ethical question, "how much is too much?" J.K. Simmons plays tough college music teacher Fletcher, whose mission is to find the next great jazz musician. In his efforts to get the best out of his musicians, he verbally, and at times, physically abuses his students. Simmons plays the character we should hate, but for some reason have an affection for. The movie is accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack and the best ending of the year, however is cluttered with an unnecessary plot line involving the main character and a girlfriend. However, Whiplash is strong enough to overcome its minor weaknesses, leaving the viewer satisfied.</fullReview>

After watching it I can say this:The movie was amazing, but you have to witness it yourself. As the emotions it makes you experience cannot be felt by reading.It starts rather slow, but it builds up just fine to the finale.Why I gave it a 9?

		<shortDescription>The determination and drive to be the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a craft in which you are trying to succeed at all costs, you need to fully realize that it will take every ounce of commitment from you, even if that alienates you in the eyes of others. The question is are you willing to go through with it? Whiplash is, in that regard, the answer to that situation, and whether one agrees with the method of getting to one's full potential, one cannot deny that once the final product is revealed, the struggle was worth it.So, we are introduced to a young man named Andrew (Miles Teller), with dreams of becoming one of the great jazz drummers to ever exist. At the music school he attends, Andrew is picked by the most lauded teacher in the staff, Terrence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), seemingly to Andrew's delight. But he will soon discover that his new mentor is abusive and mean spirited with his teaching method. From there on, Fletcher will look to push Andrew to his limits in order to truly shine as a full fledged drummer, while Andrew will have to decide how much he is willing to give up in order to make his dream come to fruition.All in all, when it comes to passion for art, in this specific case music, Whiplash showcases a powerful connection between the art form and it's performers. The movie works around the dynamic between Andrew and Fletcher, which is to say the student and the master. However it's in a twisted reverse psychology motivational tool that Whiplash stands out from other movies of the type (besides maybe war movies, where tough discipline is a way of preparing for the future). The relationship as a whole grows throughout the movie, as does Teller's performance, as he becomes increasingly more confident and focused. As for the soon to be Oscar winning turn from J.K Simmons, one can immediately highlight is commanding presence and demanding nature when he is angrily shouting at his students, yet his ability to change right back to a more understanding figure shows the diversity he brought to the role, as he is asserting in both capacities.Whiplash is unlike any movie you will see about the fight to excel no matter what obstacles are put in front of you. It's an addictive, powerful and complete film that will leave you begging for more.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the most exhilarating film I've seen this year, which is surprising given my love of both Interstellar &amp; American Sniper. J.K. Simmons (who will ALWAYS be Vern Schillinger from HBO's "OZ" to me) turns in perhaps the best performance of his career. The tension in nearly every scene of the film is palpable &amp; it's that edginess that drives the film. Ultimately a story of the cost to achieve excellence on the surface with an undertone that also touches on current society's state of complacently. This duality in the message I believe the writer is attempting to convey, is genius in the internal conflict it creates for the audience. Highly recommended and inspirational in a self looking glass sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, at first I was a bit disappointed by the end, as I do not appreciate abrupt endings without some explanation or closure if you will. Then, returning home, I just sat on the couch smoking for nearly an hour, motionless, contemplating about the movie. The next morning, the same thing happened and since then, from times to times I go back and think of it again and again. This is how I know that this movie is at least a "9/10" for me. It's not that often that movies have a tremendous impact on me like this one. The movie itself was as fast-paced as a jazz masterpiece, mixing up emotions, changing pace and then leaving you with a feeling of awe. Simmons was AMAZING! Words cannot describe his acting in this one. Especially in the scene where he threatens to "demolish" the guy entering his stage before a concert, was hilarious and intense at the same time! He managed to convey a character that really exists out there, pouring poison into the love of many many young artists for their art. All the cast gave their best effort, painting a canvas of intense emotions for the viewer. I easily put the movie up there with all the great "music-themed" movies like the Pianist, the Red Violin, the Solist, the Legend of 1900, etc. I am not a jazz player or an instrument player whatsoever, so having a movie "get to me" so much proves that this is a must see for everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash, a movie with power and passion, arrogance and raid, drums and dragons. A beauty brought out by real, controlled, direct and enchanting acting by the both of them, J.K. Simmons, Miles Teller.To many of those who cares, the movie is misleading for its exaggerated scenes but if one can except them as a movie, fiction, he can not neglect the amount of environment he is put in. Its a flow of music, beats, dedication, romance, arrogance, hatred, negligence, shamelessness, cruelty, empowering, encompassing, surrendering and finally acceptance. The beats drag and rush, the story drag and rush, the behavior drag and rush, So is asked "ARE YOU DRAGGING OR RUSHING". The movie is non-technical but it binds you.The acting of a psycho and talented teacher added to that of a boastful dedicated talented aspirant to bring out the magical world which even if is unreal, seems cozy and cruel at the same time. Passion and path cross each other, teacher and student fight, flows blood, drum beats, music plays, Caravan-Whiplash, sound surrounds and the moment it was to end Boom!! ....He Cues Them .... and it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full Metal Jacket In Band Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy cow, this movie works, but only as a comedy. I was in stitches throughout the film. Full Metal Jacket Drill Instructor decides to run a music school and to teach band class. Absolutely hilarious. More blood than Full Metal Jacket as well, mostly soaking up and covering drum kits. The ironic bit is that it is not supposed to be a comedy. Perhaps a satire of some sort? On that level it works and delivers. I'm a jazz musician and attended arguably the best Jazz school in the country, Berklee, and this movie's treatment of jazz and its musicianship is nothing but comedic. Under the tutelage of a vengeful, demeaning, sadistic, sociopath, who makes them practice until their fingers bleed and have nervous breakdowns, and calls the Jewish student Hymie, insults his mother, calls out gay students, etc... Totally over the top. On a sadder note, the movie does not have the first clue about what jazz really is, much less what it is like studying jazz and learning to play it proficiently. The only explanation for anyone being in that particular school band, is low self esteem and a masochism complex. The father form the movie Juno, plays the perfect bald, Nazzi-like sadist. You have to see this film to believe it. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Fantastic performances by Miles Teller who had me convinced he was a musician first and and an actor second, definite Oscar nomination in my book. J. K. Simmons who is looking in great shape for his age is perfectly cast in the role of teacher, mentor, bully and musician. A magical performance by both of these actors who dominate every scene. To be honest apart form the musicians the rest of the cast were just a minor support as these two went about portraying their characters with commitment and ease all at the same time...... make sure you watch this one for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blind ambition drives the tension of this student-mentor relationship underscored by powerful performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the first scene you feel the tension that develops between a young student entering a top music school in New York and his teacher who stops at nothing to push his students beyond their limits.Andrew is a talented 19-year old drummer with a drive to be the best in the world. Fletcher is jazz music teacher whose teaching style is geared towards finding the next great jazz performer. He will stop at nothing - his methods use a brutal manipulation, put-downs with the most refined language, emotional and physical abuse and a total disregard for any common decency.Andrew's ambition takes over his whole life as he drives all of his friends and colleagues away from himself in the blind pursuit of his dream. Only his father remains by his side as his constant support. Fletcher never doubts that he has a right to push his students by any means. His arrogance has no end. Just as you hope that maybe there is a human being behind the cruel persona, he proves you wrong again. To him, the worst two words in English language are "good job" as they are only for those who aspire to mediocrity. He wants his students to aspire to nothing but greatness.An emotional drama builds up and never lets go. Who will break first? The balance between the teacher and the student shifted several times and stayed unpredictable till the end. The drumming and jazz music was telling the story alongside the excellent performances of Miles Teller and J K Simmons.Achieving greatness has a cost and this film lets you think about the balance between the two.I give it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the tittle of my review is the name of the movie in my country translated to English and it really describes the movie. My musical taste is a lot different than the music that plays part in this movie; but I enjoy the music like it was something that I listen to everyday. So don't stop yourself from watching this because your musical style is not the same, you'll be missing a terrific film! I loved the main actor performance, I think I didn't watch him anywhere else; scenes where's he's pushing himself to the limit by playing drums are so good and better then some action scenes that would have you all tense and at the edge of your seat. I didn't watch many films from musical genre, but from what I have watched this goes at the top. Didn't expected much from Whiplash but I'm so satisfied and all psyched up from watching it.

It had me on the edge of my seat more than once although it is not an action movie.The cast does not consist of the most famous Hollywood stars, but Teller and Simmons play their roles remarkably.Maybe some may see the mentoring in this movie as too violent. I think that, especially when your family does not support you in pursuing your dream, your only chance is to have an objective person who believes in your strengths and who will push you out of your comfort zone.The theme of pushing yourself and pushing someone else to the limit and beyond perfection is timeless, therefore I hope that this movie will not be soon forgotten.I can't even begin to talk about the music. It seemed that people were skeptical because it is about Jazz, but even a person who hates Jazz will like it. The music does not overwhelm the movie, it goes smoothly together with the plot.I enjoyed it and would watch it again in a heartbeat.</fullReview>

Superbly acted, sharply written and directed this is a music drama tough and nail biting as a thriller. Actually I can't even remember a recent thriller which had more thrills than this seemingly calm movie about a young music student. J.K. Simmons will surely win an Oscar for this performance - it's superb and keeps the whole movie in tandem. Miles Teller is great here, playing a music student who will stop at nothing to become great. The supporting cast doesn't have much screen time, but does the best while on screen. Overall, "Whiplash" is 10/10 motion picture experience. Great music, superb acting, directing and writing accompanied by terrific sound design - this is a must see for all who appreciate a truly great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, yet very effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first and only feeling after watching this movie... WOW!! The story of a nineteen year old drummer (miles teller) who wants to be the best, a d his strict teacher (J. K. Simmons) who wont cut him some slack, is nothing but inspirational, to say the least. The fast paced, no crap storyline is both emotional and exhilarating, packed with a lot of great jazz music. Andrew has joined the best music school in the country to pursue his dream, where his teacher, a misanthropic perfectionist, picks him up to play for the college band. Andrew has a hard time pleasing his teacher, who does not take very well the concept of making mistakes, and steps up to be a bard task master. He adopts unconventional methods of teaching to finally turn the boy into a great musician. The story is perfect, the actors are perfect, the direction was perfect and all this packed with music that give you goosebumps. And considering the fact that all of this was shot in less than two and a half weeks, this movie proves that a good script is all that is required for the making of a great movie. Kudos to the director for having pulled off such a great movie in such a short time. FINAL VERDICT:This movie is a must watch for people in need of inspiration, an awesome experience in all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film blew me away; as soon as it would start to slow down it'd slam me back up against the wall and my eyes would be glued to the screen. This is pure cinema. This is art. It's essentially flawless. The script and direction are so incredibly well done it made my head spin. Every scene has raw power behind it. Right from the start there is this immediate sense of tension. You're legs won't stop bouncing and you're not entirely sure why. This is a testament to the immaculate talent on display in front and behind the camera. Miles Teller and JK Simmons absolutely destroy their competition. They dedicated themselves to every scene, every line of incredibly written dialogue and the pay off is spectacular.If I were to criticize one thing, just for the sake of nitpicking, I would say the overall story is slightly shallow (you basically know how the movie will end, what matters is the journey). The film is far from predictable and keeps you at the edge of your seat (quite literally) but some may be underwhelmed by the ending.Oh, and the editing was fantastic; some of the best this year right up there with Birdman and the Raid 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely worth the watch. I just wanted to start off by saying that much too you. It's not like this movie has any really flashy action or hardcore drama thrown into it to make it over bearing to the senses. This movie just did the amazing job of making you want to watch more of it and hope no one interrupted you while watching it. This movie is got comedy, drama, that feel good moment where you're just like HELL YES that was awesome and thank you for doing that. The casting was on point no matter what anyone else says. Miles Teller- Great J.K. Simmons - Phenomenal Those two are about the only people that make the movie worth watching. Those two are the ones the movie really revolves around. Anyone else is just a bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw the trailer for this film I thought this film should be awesome. And it was. Not only did this film successfully tell a story about passion, sacrifice, determination, commitment, and love, it featured two of the best performances I've seen for years with J.K Simmons expertly playing the extremely quotable Terrence Fletcher who impeccably shouted out harsh but hilarious insults at his poor victims, and Miles Teller who for me hasn't received enough praise for his excellent portrayal of a young musician trying to fight against the beast that stands in his way when he is trying to accomplish his dream of being one of the bests. In addition, Damien Chazelle's direction has to be applauded, especially for the epic, nail biting conclusion that had me, and everyone else nearly falling off their seats in amazement. Another plus is the electrifying jazz soundtrack and music that plays throughout most of the movie making you wonder 'what is going to happen next?' The only reason for why I didn't rate this film higher was because of my own selfish reasons, because for me the ending should have been wrapped up better, and one crash should have proved fatal. But you can't deny that Whiplash is a must-see for containing a master-class script, flawless lead performances, an unpredictable story, and the list goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, suspenseful and a film even non-jazz fans will appreciate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jazz music and psychology create a furious cinematic swell in Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash," a striking breakthrough effort that will have toes tapping and pulses racing. Centered on a 19- year-old aspiring Jazz drummer pushed to his limits for better and for worse (usually worse) by a merciless instructor, "Whiplash" tells a simple story of how far one's willing to go for their dream, and what inspires and motivates greatness.Miles Teller stars as Andrew, a first year student at a music conservatory with a clear-cut dream: become the next great jazz drummer. His talent catches the eye of Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) the conductor of the school's revered studio band, a no-nonsense teacher who pushes his students to their breaking point through cursing, screaming and insulting them, and he particularly enjoys directing his questionable tactics toward Andrew.By and large, Fletcher's methods inspire Andrew to push himself, but not without instilling a certain fear and anger in both him and the audience. The tension becomes powerfully thick whenever the two are in the same scene and any time Andrew makes the slightest mistake that will certainly invoke Fletcher's wrath, it's a gasp-worthy "oh crap" moment. Chazelle easily gets the audience under his finger in this way, but it's Simmons who really gives him that power.Simmons has been a beloved character actor for more than a decade, in large part due to his mouth and exceptional line delivery. The role of Fletcher plays to these strengths while allowing him to access a more sinister and dramatic side. In other words, when he rips off a comic insult in this film, you're also laughing out of nervousness. He's every strict, terrifying, bigoted, foul- mouthed teacher, instructor, coach or boss you've ever had (or that's ever been on screen) rolled into one and that has a profound influence on the film's suspense.Interestingly, executive producer Jason Reitman (director of "Up in the Air" and "Juno") has a lot of influence too, and that goes beyond that he likely recruited Simmons for the project. Chazelle likes to use a lot of sequence shots (such as all the student musicians opening their instrument cases one after the other) to create a rhythm to the film, one of Reitman's hallmarks. That said, it should by no means diminish the work Chazelle has done. He balances this with a lot of other techniques (the opening shot, for example, is a long take) and weaved together the film takes on the characteristics of a carefully orchestrated piece of music.Music has always played a crucial role in the creation of cinematic suspense, so a suspenseful film about music naturally has to take this relationship to another level. That's where the focus on percussion makes a difference. There's the obvious piece in that the drums are the pulse of the band, so the connection to our own physical response to the film is apparent. Also, and maybe slightly less obviously, there's a lot happening visually, so it's much easier to convey the intensity on film. Chazelle films Teller playing from just about every possible angle and distance, which ought to tell you that Teller's own drum skills were definitely put to the test. The suspense also impacts jazz standards "Whiplash" and "Caravan" and other pieces heard in the film, making them infinitely more gripping because of what's at stake for the characters.A surprising third act twist takes the story to another level and elevates a script that otherwise might've gotten too satisfied with simply highlighting the moral dilemma Fletcher and Andrew pose. There are weaker components too like a side plot involving a love interest (Melissa Benoist of "Glee") and a little stuff with Andrew's father (Paul Reiser) and extended family, but they help break up the intensity and also show that Andrew's pursuit of greatness doesn't exist in a vacuum. "Whiplash" works by being both niche (one small story taking place in the little-seen world of competitive collegiate jazz) and yet universal, while employing a multitude of sensory components both visual and aural to creating an engaging, accessible and entertaining film. Chazelle will surely have a number of encore performances to follow, while giving us an all-time great one from Simmons.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whipllash is for those who loves to play hard to achieve something in LIFE. RESPECT earned !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movies comes in your life which are thought-provoking and pumps up your blood to do the best in your hobby. Whiplash is one of those movies which ignites the fire in your heart and scales up your spirit to the extreme level.Whiplash tells the story of Fletcher, a fearsome Jazz music teacher who would go to any level to extract the best out of it. Andrew Leyman loves drumming and is offered to join Fletcher's band. However, the chemistry between the two gives away and Leyman loses the opportunity. He does not give up and fights back to earn the respect from his master.Newbie Damien Chazelle shows splendid talent in keeping you on your toes for the next 1.5 hours and that is the beauty of a solid script and brilliant direction. The movie is fast-paced with not even time given to blink your eyes. Every scene has been perfectly blended with smart camera work and foot-tapping background score. To put icing on the cake, editing and art direction with punching dialogues will add to the charm. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are the soul of the film. Both actors performed magnificently in their respective roles. The vibes they shared in the movie was so natural and alluring.On a whole, Whipllash is for those who loves to play hard to achieve something in LIFE. RESPECT earned !!! 5/5www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer Genius From Chazelle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin, Whiplash is the reason why I love films so much, I went into this film knowing it was about a guy who plays the drums and he has a harsh teacher, and I then proceeded to have my mind blown by this extraordinary film. Firstly, Miles Teller is phenomenal and gives a performance which I hope signifies the start of a long and successful career, this guy can act!! However his performance is completely overshadowed by what I think is one of the great performances in cinematic history. J.K Simmons take a bow, he plays Terence Fletcher a psychotic, incredibly passionate music teacher who attempts to get the best out of his students, this leads to some truly brilliant encounters with Teller's character Andrew Niemann. Whiplash is a film that has your complete and undivided attention from frame 1 and this is also due to the fantastic editing in the film which skips from scene to scene without giving you a second to breathe, the tension in this film is building from the start and leads to in my opinion the greatest ending I have ever seen, a 9 minute drum solo in which you are transfixed and blown away by this man's talent. Supporting performances from Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist are also stellar in their roles as people who are affected by Andrew's actions and his sacrifices in order to become the best. Whiplash is an inspiring film and an incredible effort by Damien Chazelle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Intense, Complex, and Brilliantly Acted Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 starsAndrew Neyman, a young and talented drummer attending a prestigious music conservatory finds himself under the wing of the most respected professor at the school, Terence Fletcher, one who does not hold back on abuse towards his students - an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods. Leading the top jazz ensemble in the school, Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability-and his sanity. The two form an odd relationship as the student tries to achieve greatness, and the professor will stop at nothing to realize his potential.Intense, inspiring, and well-acted, "Whiplash" is a brilliant sophomore effort from Director Damien Chazelle, and a riveting vehicle for actors Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Chazelle delivers a dark and dazzling jive into the hidden world of competitive music. If you didn't think music could involve actual blood, sweat, and tears, this breathtakingly visceral, coming-of-artistic-age drama will set you straight. Training a keen eye on the proceedings, the Director seems to delight in the spectacle of relentless punishment.What gives the film such a kick, is its raw and brutal but also very subtle portrayal of the shifting, attritional relations between teacher and student, sorcerer and apprentice - a hugely entertaining, refreshingly subversive take on the well-worn "inspirational teacher" theme: Few relationships in recent cinema have been quite so compelling. Miles Teller's Andrew pounds the drum skins as if his life depended on it. With J K Simmons' chair chucker Fletcher around, it very nearly might. Their relationship is so intense, nerve-wracking, dark, and incredibly complex, I suggest you take a defibrillator to "Whiplash", since the chances of cardiac arrest or spontaneous combustion during Simmons' and Teller's many run-ins and showdowns are high. The climax proves to be the tip of the iceberg, and is as gripping and as unexpected as one you've ever seen or will get to see.As infectious as the screenplay and Direction of "Whiplash" are, it's the acting that walks away with the most accolades. J.K. Simmons proves - as most of us already knew - he's a great actor, and deserves way more than being recognized as "that actor from said blockbuster" or for doing 30-second commercials as a spokesman for an insurance company. Simmons is unnervingly good as a teacher who rules by intimidation and his own contorted theories, and excels in "Whiplash's" hand-to-the throat storytelling style. To say he's brilliant would be a gross understatement. Miles Teller - who is actually a drummer - convinces us that he's easily among the best of a new crop of young actors from Hollywood's roster. Here is new kid on the block who's willing to stretch his horizons and take on difficult roles. He's wonderful in this one and almost goes toe-to- toe with Simmons.Compelling, compulsive, and excruciatingly funny, "Whiplash" commands that you never take your eyes off the screen. Come the last beat, you'll probably be exhausted. But you'll also feel darkly entertained, inspired, introspective, and wonderfully alive. As the credits roll, you'll feel like giving "Whiplash" a standing ovation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did this movie come from...doesn't matter...you won't ever forget it...period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the final film I needed to see for a couple of reasons. One it is the last of the Academy Award Best Picture nominees that I needed to see. It is also the last film I wanted to see before I went ahead and did my personal best of 2014 list. Good thing I waited because guess what? Whiplash is on it. Whiplash is headlining it. In the last three weeks of trying to see the best of 2014, I found THREE films that I am giving a huge ten to without hesitation. I suspected Whiplash would be good, I just don't understand where it came from. I may have seen a trailer once but for it to show up as a best picture nominee was perplexing. I didn't hear it doing particularly well or even any reviews on it. Whiplash is mesmerizing. Whiplash is an instant classic. Whiplash is probably the best film of 2014. I was entranced. My jaw was dropped for much of it and it is one of the best performances in a film I have ever seen. Whiplash is phenomenal and that doesn't do it justice. It is gut wrenching and expressive and explosive and if you are any kind of musician you will adore this film and if you love jazz or percussion music...well you'll just explode with joy. I could literally go back and watch this again as soon as the credits are done rolling and be blown away all over. Whiplash is a must see film in every sense of the word.This is easily the performance of Miles Teller young career. This should cement him as a serious actor in any genre. He's funny...we knew that and quirky but this role proves he has chops. The fact that he plays the drums (how much of it was actually him matters very little) because he gives a very real and incredible performance. At first I wasn't sure he had the guts to stay on par with Oscar nominated JK Simmons (I'll get to him in a minute) but as the film went on I began to see him rise up and show some incredible grit and realize he was holding his own and carrying the film very well. Teller was amazing. If Teller was amazing then JK Simmons took his role to a place you rarely see. Call it a whole new plain of performance existence. Simmons playing the borderline insane Fletcher is stunning. He is frightening and evil and driven and somehow you begin to understand him and when you think he's softening he comes back with another blow. The relationship between these two is fascinating and incredible complex. Simmons deserves this Oscar without a single doubt. He's always been a great character actor but this is a whole new level. Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell and Nate Lang are a few of the small supporting characters who do decently. But this is the type of film where you have two heavyweight performances and the entire film is focusing squarely on them.Its actually amazing that Damien Chazelle who wrote and directed this film is very new to Hollywood. Its pretty rare to find raw talent that comes out of nowhere and gives you this incredible passionate story but you can easily tell this is a labour of love for him. The story seems to come from somewhere beyond just an active imagination, maybe some truth in there somewhere. Whether you're a musician or not, you will love this film. The characters are vivid and in your face and the story, while we've seen similar before, is unlike anything before it because of the actors and the way the story unfolds. I didn't want it to end. The film is definitely for adults given its extreme bad language bordering on gratuitous but it works in the context of the film. This is likely to be overlooked at the Oscars but make no mistake, there is a reason this is nominated. It is flat out brilliant. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the young director, Damien Chazelle, proposes us to ponder upon is:Is high performance a natural product of talented people, or is there, at the core of it, an unhealed wound that makes people want to demonstrate they are worthy of love and approval?The main ideas of the movie are: - the incompleteness that is experienced when people feel average; - the absence of one parent leads more often than not to a deficiency of love, which makes people strive to fill this hole with professional recognition;- perfectionism. This hurts. This is "whipping"! - sometimes we accept being persecuted. We enroll in the mad dynamic of victim-persecutor when we think we need some people's approval;- Dominators build their power by humiliating others;http://lotuspocusfocus.com/2015/01/movie-recommendation-whiplash/</fullReview>

Andrew wants to become one of the greatest drummers of all time, He never gives up. He practices all the time 24/7. Jk Simmons performance was brilliant absolutely brilliant! I mean, Throughout the whole movie you HATE HIM TO DEATH!!! On the other hand you love Andrew because you hope he gets through everything. A great performance done by Miles Teller! The cinematography was excellent! And last but not least the film score composed by Justin Hurwitz was just amazingly put together! I really enjoyed the arrangement for Caravan the most!

		<fullReview>Whiplash is a fast moving story of the cut-throat music world of competing to become the best of the best. Andrew (Miles Teller) is determine to make it. He finds a spot on the very competitive Jazz section led by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). This story has grit and makes you appreciated the good sounds we get to experience around us. Paul Riser plays Andrew's dad and makes a fine showing. The lesson found in this film is that the ups and downs of the road of success are tough, but at the end, dreams are possible if you are willing to work for them. Nominated for five Oscars, including best picture and directed by Damien Chazelle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all, I have personally now seen all of the nominations for best picture for this years Oscars. Some have been marginally OK, some have been good but only one has struck me to be truly great and that film...is whiplash. We must not forget here that this is a film made in 19 days and by the backing of a few million bucks whilst others nominated have cost 20 times that. However, despite its unusually small budget for the film world we live in today, the intensity and passion delivered through the actors and director is simply astonishing. J.K Simmons gives us a performance to get excited about portraying a brilliant and often volatile music teacher who is seeking a sense of perfection from his new drummer within his band, portrayed by the excellent Miles Teller. This film is as raw as it gets, fast paced and at times tough to watch for all the right reasons and i beg all film lovers to go and see this masterpiece and inevitably recognise that this film proves to us that a 100 million budget is not always needed to create a film that will surely be talked about as a 'great' in years to come. And now i hope and expect the Academy to do it justice and award Whiplash with the best picture award come February 22nd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, this movie is about an ambitious boy possessing a strong will being driven to fulfil his dream of being a legendary drummer. I won't spoil much as this movie is totally worth watching. Keeping it short here. This movie is for everyone. Even if you're not a fan of drums and drama, this movie should keep you captivated to the very end. From the start, the movie had the ability to make your heart stop and race abruptly. Its easily as intense as any thriller out there. The storyline depicts a boy lost in his dreams and a teacher going to the extremes. Throughout the film, you'll be kept wondering whether the teacher is being harsh for the sake of the greater good as he claims or is he just being an ass who doesn't want to lose his pride. Many people may fall the same way in their lives and start to wonder whether whatever they're doing is worth it. This movie would serve as a mirror for this people, where they can look at themselves and reflect. The first class storyline coupled with top notch acting from the actors especially the coach makes the movie all the more enjoyable. This movie could easily have turned out to be an old cliché drama about success and all, but no, things were put right here.The ending was one of the best I've seen in a long time, Super intense and concludes the story well. Enough said i guess. Watch it to see why this movie was nominated for the best picture! Truly amazing</fullReview>

Simmons creates the strict teacher that doesn't settle for second best and won't stop until he's developed the next star. Miles Teller is convincing as the passionate drummer that won't give up until he becomes the next big thing even ending friendships and relationships to achieve his dreams.For all Jazz fans this film will be one of your favourites of all time and even casual music lovers will find this film as one hell of a time.

		<shortDescription>Painfully Inspiring Masterpiece, Whiplash will leave its mark on you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Whiplash, Miles Teller plays Andrew, a freshman at a very prestigious and exclusive music program in New York. His talent and work ethic gets him noticed by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) who invites him to be part of the schools award winning jazz band. Although once a part of the band Andrew learns how extreme Fletcher's teaching methods are in getting the great performances he demands. Don't call it a comeback J.K Simmons has been here for years. J.K. Simmons has been the unsung hero of movies for years. It's great to see the man get his day in the sun. From Juno (2007), Extract (2009), Up in the Air (2009) to the Spiderman franchise J.K. never disappoints. He plays grumpy sarcastic to an art form. In Whiplash we get the J.K. we love at fever pitch. He is the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket (1987) and a little of Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka (1971) without the whimsy and all the sadism. J.K.s is a phenomenal stand out performance that transcends the movie and creates this force of nature character that is unforgettable. Not to take anything away from Miles Teller. His drive and determination are similar to Rocky (1976) or Rudy (1993). This film is inspirational on par with them. Relative new comer director Damien Chazelle nails this film. His tempo is right on key, this film does not drag or lead. It is air tight storytelling at its finest. It's also great to see Paul Reiser getting some work. He is great as Andrew's father Jim. I also think that after watching this movie, I have a new found respect for drumming. Gone are the days of me using the drum solo at concerts to go use the restroom. This film really inspired me. Have you ever had a boss, mentor, coach or teacher who pushed you to the edge? Someone you grew to despise because of how hard they were on you. If so, you must see this movie. There is a line in the film where J.K. Simmons says, the worst thing you can tell a person is "that's good." We live in a society that gives way too much credit to mediocrity. This film is a harsh commentary on America's, everyone gets a trophy policy. To sharpen a knife you need a hard surface to sharpen it against. Some may say J.K. Simmons character Fletcher is a bully in this film. I say we need more positive bullies. Now I'm not taking about jerks who pick on the handicapped or beat up small kids for their lunch money. We need mentors who will push people to their limit to get greatness. To steal and alter a quote from Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas) in Wall Street (1987) "The point is, ladies and gentleman, that Bullying, for lack of a better word, is good. Bullying is right, bullying works. Bullying clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit?.And bullying, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA." Now it's amusing to transpose bulling and greed for the sake of a point here, but that is the overall message of this film. The minute we think we have it all we come complacent, that can be linked to the decline of all greatness in the world. You have to stay hungry and competitive. Another great quote comes from Orson Wells in The Third Man (1949) that I think illustrates this point perfectly. "Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock." Push hard to greatness dear friends. Our great country desperately needs more of it. If you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most powerful and intense movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies that can generate such a mixture of emotions whilst you're watching it. Whiplash is one of these exceptions. It's an edge of your seat thriller/ drama with one of the most unique relationships ever portrayed on film. The story that focuses on a young drummer (Miles Tellar) trying to impress his brutal and abusive teacher (J.K Simmons) is perhaps one of the best examples of a student- teacher relationship. The performances by Miles Tellar and J.K Simmons are nothing short of amazing. Tellar's performance is great as his character grows a huge amount in the film. Whilst drumming is a prime target for him, it becomes his obsession and he's determined to do anything he must to prove himself. Simmons delivers probably the best on screen performance I've seen in a long time. I mainly remember Simmons for comedic work such as Spiderman and Juno as well as his voice work in Portal 2. However, here you both love and hate the man. He's very reminiscent of R.Lee Ermey's drill instructor from Full Metal Jacket, however 10 times better. Every scene he's in, you're biting your nails as he is an incredibly unpredictable character and he deserves every bit of praise that he's getting The movie also has one of the most exciting and thrilling finales I've seen in a long time.I can't say much more about this film, then to go out and see it. It's definitely my favorite film of 2014 and possibly one of my favorite films ever. It's intense screenplay, amazing performances from its two leads and the music score all help to make this one of the greatest movies I've ever watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this modern times of ours, greatness is often seen as somewhat as a given, in the sense that, is effortless and only for a chosen few.Other symptom of that is the dumbing down of the modern society,we are always looking in our televisions,with a infinite number of channels, with an infinite number of idiots, that never aspired or never will aspire to do something great.(but lets talk about the movie, or i will never shut up).Whiplash, is a great movie, keeps you on your seat as you look into the struggle of Andrew, the lovable main character of the movie, as he tries to become great in what he is doing.During the movie, as Andrew is picked up by his mentor(or enemy?),we learn that becoming great is not something that is fun, not something that is rewarding, is not something that is gonna tuck you up at night and tell you that everything will be alright if you fail, is not! (The two most harming words of the English language are "GOOD JOB"),We Will have to make choices, and this choices will hurt, and we will not like them, but thats life!, and in life you can't have it all.I personally, am always picky about the timing of movies, like a great song, a great movie should be perfectly timed, moments of tension make or brake a movie, and in this regard this movie, like a good song, is right on time.The acting, is of course, perfectly delivered, Miles teller makes a likable character, J.K.Simmons a great antagonist, and that makes a perfect orchestra of a movie, with all the elements that make a good band play, and they are all on tune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most intense non-action movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is an astounding film. And I do not use the term "astounding" lightly. It's simplistic storyline is enriched with vivid cinematography, masterful directing, an enthralling script, and above all, two of the most heart-stopping, knock-out performances of the year: Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Together, they perform with such remarkable zeal that you feel afraid to move a single, solitary muscle in your body while they're on screen. Their superb, newly-unveiled talents rise to the surface to create a theatrical atmosphere so intense that the audience will find themselves clenching their fists, holding their breath, and physically incapable of looking away from the screen until the end-credits roll. This movie will beat you to a pulp, and burn your heart with the fire of inspiration. Whiplash masters the art of film-making on nearly every level. If you can appreciate a film for its technical precision, its emotional turbulence, and its ever-resonating impact, then see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Search For The Finest Film Of 2014 Is Over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is it. This is where the search for the finest film of 2014 comes to its end. And even though I still need to check out a few more films that were released during the last year, I doubt that watching them is going to change anything because after having sat through what is unquestionably a goosebumps-inducing cinematic experience from start to finish, I can say with absolute certainty that Whiplash is my Movie of the Year.Whiplash tells the story of Andrew Neiman; a 19-year-old Jazz drummer who aspires to become one of the great drummers like Buddy Rich &amp; finds himself under the wing of the school's most respected but fearsome teacher, Terence Fletcher. Determined to impress the instructor after getting the grilling of his life on his very first day, Neiman completely dedicates himself to his craft but Fletcher aims to push him beyond what he's capable of.Fabulously written &amp; meticulously directed by Damien Chazelle, Whiplash is a work of blazing originality that takes over the screen like an invading horde &amp; from its opening moments to the spectacular finale, Chazelle's kinetic direction in what is his sophomore effort controls the film's charged atmosphere with sublime precision while also keeping the rest of its elements perfectly in rhythm with each other.Coming to the technical aspects, the entire picture is a work of astounding production &amp; every aspect only contributes in further enriching the overall experience. Sets are refined to smallest of details, Cinematography makes near-perfect use of colour palettes, hues &amp; lighting, Editing is one of its strongest aspects that makes its viciously paced story all the more engaging while its jazz-heavy soundtrack keeps the premise on the verge of explosion at all times.As far as acting goes, this is easily Miles Teller's best performance to date for the actor gives his all in what is a physically demanding role to completely reinvent himself &amp; he's a revelation as Andrew Neiman. And yet, he is completely overshadowed by J.K. Simmons who plays Terence Fletcher and with his intimidating screen presence, he manages to deliver the most impressive, memorable &amp; dominating performance we've ever seen from the veteran actor.On an overall scale, Whiplash is a powerhouse of fierce direction, smart writing, charged atmosphere, dynamic photography, cut-throat editing, strong performances &amp; dazzling score which promises an emotionally intense cinematic experience &amp; effortlessly delivers it. Passionate filmmaking at its best, it's a heavy dose of adrenaline shot that marks a stunning breakthrough for its director, features the career-best performances from its cast &amp; is absolutely electrifying from start to finish.Electric, explosive, visceral, spectacular, feverish, muscular, volatile, provocative, intoxicant, dangerous, glorious, incredible, sharp, creative, vicious, kinetic, crazy, extraordinary, soulful, stellar, tremendous, triumphant, exhilarating, electrifying, thrilling, inspiring, transfixing, astounding, jaw-dropping, heartbreaking, intimidating, challenging, gripping, daring, entertaining, satisfying &amp; rewarding in every possible manner, Whiplash comes one hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting and claustrophobic musical drama more intense than any modern horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Whiplash, an aspiring drummer faces a music teacher who echoes Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. Throughout this powerful, punchy drama, the student tries to succeed while his brutal teacher terrifies him- and us- and tries to drive him to victory in the most damaging way possible. An awards season favourite, Whiplash boasts many fine qualities which will see it take home at least one award come Oscar night. Miles Teller shows vulnerability, character depth and determination as the main character, although his performance is overshadowed by J.K. Simmons as Terrence Fletcher, probably the Margaret White of music teachers. Fletcher is a very frightening character and is the antagonist of the film, but he is given depth and motivation as well. Whiplash deserved a best director nomination, and the editing and cinematography are intense and electrifying, matching the rhythm of the drum sticks beating furiously upon the drum throughout the film.The script dissects its characters and rounds them well, and neither the protagonist nor the antagonist are two dimensional. Whiplash has its problems though. J.K. Simmons is being tipped as a favourite to win the Oscar, but all he really does is shout most of the time, so he shouldn't win. Andrew, the main character, is not a very interesting character at first and while he evolves later, he never becomes someone we particularly care about. Whiplash is a claustrophobic experience as it's so ferocious, and this means it can be unpleasant to watch. Also, with a lack of anything genuinely uplifting, Whiplash is a ugly at times and is an overly depressing examination of the search for greatness. It's not a film I will rewatch, but it deserves its praise and for anyone interested in music it's a good film to watch. It's not the masterpiece many have said it is and doesn't beat the likes of Birdman, Boyhood and The Imitation Game, but it's worth seeing in the cinema and overall a unique look at ambition and pupil-teacher relationships.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly tuned pile-driver of a drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(77%) A film void of death, murder, and violence, yet is as intense as any thriller, horror, or action flick. With parallels to "Foxcatcher", with the student and trainer theme, only here J.K Simmons' character is not a fraud, but in fact is very gifted, and if anything is even more hardcore in his approach. Miles Teller is perfect as the gifted student, you really do believe every step of the way that the guy can achieve something if pushed, but you never truly know for sure if he is being pushed too far. This has all the bases covered in terms of acting, writing, and direction, with J.K Simmons brilliant performance just about nosing it above all else as the best asset. There's also some white-knuckle plot twists, a huge amount of politically incorrect insults thrown around, and a brilliant (and somewhat deafening) ending. A fondness for jazz isn't required to get something from this in the same sense that you don't need to like boxing to really enjoy Rocky, and as such this is deserving of a look for almost anyone looking for something well made, interesting, and memorable.</fullReview>

A top musical school is the setting where a young jazz drummer played very convincingly by Miles Teller. JK Simmons in his award winning role as Fletcher plays an over the top abusive in all senses of the word teacher. The verbal, psychological and physical abuse is shocking and darkly funny at the same time. Amazingly this movie is exciting and the pace is quick and involving. Even though the music isn't that varied what is featured is used in an exciting manner.It's over the top but so what, I had a good time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now whip it! Into shape, shape it up, looks great! Whip it real good!!! I just had the Devo inside in that intro for my movie review of the fabulous movie "Whiplash". What a gem!! "Whiplash" stars Miles Teller as first year music student Andrew Neiman. Andrew is a student drummer who is more than just a little drummer boy in his pursuit to excel at his beat craft. However, he has to prove his skills to the extremely rigid music school instructor/conductor Terrence Fletcher. Let's just say that Fletcher is trying to make a newman out of Neiman. As Andrew tries to excel in the battery, Fletcher's own authoritarian battery charge is always on full in pushing Andrew to the edge. Damien Chazzelle orchestrates "Whiplash" with a magnetic flow that hits all the right beats in his direction of the picture; and his screenplay also hit all the write verbal notes. Miles Teller delivers yet another stellar performance in his rising career; here as Neiman. J.K. Simmons was terrible as Fletcher! Wait, wait! I was J.K. (just kidding!) Simmons' work as Fletcher might just be the best delivered by any actor or actress this year. Paul Reiser also delivered an impressive supporting performance as Andrew's supporting dad; but I was not as mad about his performance as I was in Simmons' classic masterpiece thespian conduction. So here is my final drum roll of this picture.......... "Whiplash" is one of the best movies of 2014! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I come from this from the perspective of having gone through med school and the tension, anxiety, and fear that this film inflicts was gut wrenching. Everyone in life has a teacher that they fear, hate but admire and love at the same time. This film took me right back to that place where I was having involuntary bowel movements when even the mention of the teacher was whispered in the room. It takes you to that dark place and yet at the same time you hope for an uplifting moment when both the teacher and student will reach common ground. What makes this film great is that they never reach that point. They will never be friends or hang out but they will reach for that greatness in each of them. It is heart wrenchingly honest. This student gives up everything for his craft to the point of hating himself. Which for anyone that has ever pursued their passion can completely relate with. While there is no happy ending there is vindication in that final scene so despite us never knowing what will happen to the student he reaches a pinnacle in his craft that is a wonder to behold. I wish more could appreciate this film. It is a masterpiece and the actors in them are very little appreciated especially the young protagonist whom is often type casted. Please watch!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I will ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about being one of the greats and I think Damien Chazelle has himself become one of the greats. It doesn't matter in what trade or in what skill. It's an inspirational view or how someone's passion can drive them to be the best, to put eventing on the life second and to pursue complete brilliance in their art. I came out of this film literally buzzing. The sound track was epic. Perhaps my only criticism. MAKE IT LOUDER. But I was frothing like I'd just snorted a line of some of the best s*** in town I felt inspired to become the best. It's brilliantly acted and if anyone's ever been pushed to their limits by a teacher, coach or boss. They will completely understand the relationship between Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons who both played these roles superbly and it's no surprise 5 Oscar nominations have come through. This is not a safe film. If you want a safe predictable film go watch Angelina Jolie butcher a true war hero in unbroken. This film has brilliant wit, fast tempo and a superb vision of getting the best out of someone. It truly plays with your thoughts. And let me tell you for the last 20 minutes I went from the edge of my seat to shredding my finger nails to having a grin so wide the person behind me asked what tooth paste I used. GO WATCH THIS FILM RIGHT NOW. Because trust me your a rusher not a dragger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why I quit band</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever thought you had a mean and abrasive teacher, please allow Whiplash to make that teacher look like Mother Teresa. You don't know angry instructor until you've seen J.K. Simmons furiously shout his head off as Terrence Fletcher, the biggest hard ass of a band teacher to ever grace cinema screens. He's a teacher whose methods include spewing a creatively brutal string of insults with the intention of pushing a student to their full potential. You'll never hear him say the words "good job" because they are, "the two most dangerous words you can ever say to a musician." Whiplash is a movie carried by its two main characters, Miles Teller as Andrew Nieman, a college aged drummer, and his teacher, Fletcher, played by Simmons. Nieman wants to be the best, and Fletcher is determined to get him there, no matter how many times he has to spit the f-word at his face, or how many chairs he has to throw at his head. The film is no more than a character piece between the two forces, but it is a compelling, intense, and in-your-face piece that defines the student-teacher relationship when it comes to music. My band experience in high school was very short lived, but I have heard enough stories from band geek friends to affirm that the intensity of Simmon's character isn't too far-fetched. I have a feeling that Whiplash is a film that will resonate with any musician whose gone through professional training, and will strike a chord with any instructor whose mean shouty ways have always been misunderstood as sheer assholery. Sometimes it takes an asshole to make a maestro, and this is the feeling that you walk away from Whiplash with. This is a movie that takes a big risk, as it relies solely on the performances of its two leads to make this film compelling in any way. Luckily its got a great script delivered by a competent Miles Teller and a wildly entertaining and nerve wracking to watch J.K. Simmons. The scenes where Simmons attempts to keep Teller from dragging or rushing make my anxiety flare up and it makes me so glad I ditched band in high school and left it to the safety of film to make me understand the fury an instructor is truly capable of.When it comes to writing, Whiplash is excellent. When it comes to performances, it's impeccable. When it comes to pacing, it's jumpy and rocky at points, but when it comes to overall quality Whiplash tells an excellent and believable story. It's not something I'd watch again, but definitely something I'd recommend.</fullReview>

Truly great movies can be about a (on paper boring) subject like a Jazz drum player and still be amazing. J.K. Simmons plays a demonic music instructor (he makes Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket seem like a sweet little angel) who drills conservatory students to become masters in their craft. Whiplash got 5 Oscar nominations and 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role' can certainly go the J.K. for me. I highly recommend you check this movie out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will you clean the blood off my drum set?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is probably my favorite movie. Even though it is clear that it was made with a small budget, few scenarios, and a simple plot, it achieved its purposes, allowing us to see a masterpiece in a big screen. (You will understand this concept after the last scene) If you have seen at Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket you will realize that although Fletcher, played by the genius J. K. Simmons, is a "pain in the ass" as a perfectionist Jazz teacher, he has good intentions toward his musicians as Hartman had toward his cadets. From there, the movie will be substantially different because no matter what Fletcher does, we won't be able to hate him. On the other hand we have a promising young drummer named Andrew, played by Milles Teller an indie film actor with a couple of good rolls in Hollywood movies as supporting actor. I have to acknowledge that at the beginning of the movie I was not sure about his suitability for the roll, but after a few scenes and blood spatters over the floor tom, I realized I was wrong, he was meant to be seated behind the drums. Andrew's latent abilities managed to get him a place in Fletcher's band, receiving a warm welcome by Fletcher at the hallway before classes. Now, this will be the first time you realize that the tyranny of fletcher is based on a psychological abuse and brilliant strategies. The director Damien Chazelle brilliantly achieved to make us feel the passion for music, the passion for each note, melody, and sound emitted by the contact of the drumstick on the crash cymbal. So, this is it what it feels to stand up and clap at the end of a master concert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best chemistry between two leading actors within years...I have been waiting to see this movie for such a long time and for that reason I am really sorry that I couldn't enlist it in my Top 10 films of last year. But now that I have enjoyed it I am pretty sure that it is in my Top 3, maybe just behind Birdman.Why? Because of the perfect acting lessons displayed in it. Best supporting actor of the year no doubt. J.K. Simmons destroys Miles Teller's character and then builds him depending on Teller's inner talent to produce perfect music. I am really starting to think that most of all I enjoy the overall feel of a movie and then the actors' play. These two factors maybe are the two most interesting and inspiring aspects of a movie for me. And the music of course. Jazz is improvisation, polyrhythm and swing which we have a lot in this wonderful piece of movie history. I have no doubt that "Whiplash", "Grand Hotel Budapest" and "Birdman" will without a doubt find their dignified places in the history of cinema.The intense play is inspired by the beautiful script showing human emotions as we rarely find them in movies. This brilliant acting lesson is a true revelation for both leading actors and the director Damien Chazelle. It is no wonder that the American critics love it so much. It advocates the true statement that no talent can emerge without tons of hard work and practice. But the more compelling storyline is the one which shows us how the character of a person can grow when confronted by a real catalyst - the mentor, the teacher, the challenger. This is what I really liked in this film - the human emotional development within a talented young person. And Miles Teller is such a young talented actor too. So the symbol is perfect.For us Europeans it is really refreshing to see this psychological clash between the two main characters in this movie. All the more challenging is the setting - the stage seems like a gladiators' arena. It is by the end of the movie like a true battlefield! The hero of the story is challenged by this "villain" - his mentor. And he strives so hard, beyond the flesh and bone, to reach perfection, that he surpasses perfection by the end of this beautifully shot film piece. And the music in this movie is performed so well that it accompanies the characters' journey through this immense psychological arena of "war". The interaction in some scenes is so intense that it is simmering with uncompromising sharpness. We are viewing not only the main character's growth, we are seeing our appreciation of hard work grow too. And in a country like Bulgaria this kind of a lesson (although lifelike obvious) should be much appreciated."Whiplash"professes the things that matter to us and more importantly - how we can achieve them. It is the uncompromising will of our own souls which can only bring us to success and peacefulness. Perfection is not a mirage, it is a state of mind, a focus so clear, that one can achieve only by working hard on his talents. Every day, every second and every way possible. Even beyond the possible...</fullReview>

I know that because the hero not only survived a driver's side t-bone collision with a truck but then raced to the concert with blood dripping from his scalp.For that reason I can't take this film as seriously as many other reviewers.The story is taut and focuses so heavily on pupil and teacher that the other characters don't get much of a look in. Everything looks and sounds good, and I liked the abrupt ending.Usually this kind of thing is heart-warming, but this one aimed for brutal oneness.

		<shortDescription>A "Very Good Job." &#x2666; 75%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When jazz and cinema go for a date together, it usually ends with bitterness. While in Damien Chazelle's Whiplash the date goes fine, there still remains gaps that could've been filled.The story of how an overly disciplined jazz instructor Fletcher (J K Simmons) uses severe admonishment to push the abilities of a drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) who he thinks has the potential to make it great strikes its audience as a parable. Andrew tries normal ways to become a good drummer, but his meeting with ruthless Fletcher narrows his focus and inspires him in a manner we only find in prodigy stories. The film talks about the arduous path to success through a jazz setting, which helps in the recommendation process: people who enjoy jazz music will derive more pleasure from Whiplash.The film focuses on cussy tutelage and frames it as a necessity in the field of pedagogy. While it also throws light on how evolved the music industry has presently become, we do not fail to realize that strict teaching is what begets great musicians. Factors like perseverance, struggle, grit, and passion are heavily sampled and one may even grade the film as inspirational.J K Simmons is well-directed, and with his bald cranium, he easily handles the authoritarian air. Miles Teller's hard work is splashed everywhere and one stands and wonders the sheer brilliance with which he portrays the role. His subtle romance, his mild introspections, his familial negligence - all are done so well as the story picks up the gradual pace. While I can vote for Teller to be rising star of 2014, I don't see an Oscar. Simmons should receive the Best Supporting.Camera work is another best thing about Whiplash. It points and emphasizes on things that hold importance in a specific frame. It moves and focuses and fades with absolute charisma. Overall direction is good. Writing hits few bumps but they are negligible. Editing is very precise as is evident in the final sequence which reaches crescendo both with respect to the music playing and the movie itself. The teachings in the first half suspends its audience as we anticipate every following actions of the characters. While the story doesn't necessarily take a route that we expect, there is delight in every route it tries. Because jazz. Music is atmospheric.There are times that we feel all the admonishing goes over the line and the story to be a gimmick. Damien fails to draw a line between reality and strange fiction. Ounces of madness here and there makes it an engaging watch. But, it crosses the invisible line and surrounds some frames, causing a mess.Cinematography and editing may get the nods, but Best Picture looks far fetched.BOTTOM LINE: Whiplash is brilliant and hard-hitting. It inspires its audience to stop dilly-dallying and go beyond one's own abilities and with drumming, the most laborious music art, it succeeds in conveying the message.

		<fullReview>Last night I watched this movie and It has captured my mind completely and gave me such big lesson for life that I believe this can be easily be understood by anyone after watching this movie and will be able to implement in ones life too. Performance by J.K.Simmons will surely earn him Oscars for best supporting role and if this movie gets other award it would be it's music or best achievement in writing.The sound track is also awesome. I am waiting for its Disc to release so then I will include it in my library. I will ask every that person who likes special kind of movie, this movie will not be let down. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding tale of music, motivation, and drive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.K. Simmons has always been an underrated actor with his bit parts in numerous films. Now he gets a supporting role in this film, but he might as well be featured as a lead as he shows off that talent he possessed for a long time. Along with Miles Teller who is quickly becoming an actor to look for for many years to come and a great story we have a fantastic look at our dreams and what we would do to achieve them.Good: The acting from Teller and Simmons are outstanding. First off, Teller needs to get recognized more for his role here as he embodied a thirsty student with aspirations and fears. Teller brings this down to Earth and delivers an endearing and likable performance which makes his underdog role shine. Of course, Simmons shines as the sadistic music teacher where he gives R. Lee Ermey a run for his money in terms of an intimidating figure who is hell bent on creating diamonds out of coal. He is a force to be reckoned. The direction is another great aspect of the movie as it had a breakneck pace when needed with a lot of tension during the music scenes with hard hitting action that can rival even some action scenes in terms of tension and kinetic energy. The final scene is a perfect example of that with heart stopping energy and a perfect finish in my opinion.Overall, this is a great sports style movie without the sports. A movie about the determination a person can possess in order to achieve a goal or the limits a person will push another to make a difference in them. An excellent movie with fantastic performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there ever was a movie in 2014 that inspired me the most then this is it.The movie starts like a regular one, but it starts growing in you by the end of the movie you will on the edge of your seat.Now coming to the performances J.K. Simmons breakout performance does not exactly look like a breakout performance, it looks like the one which can only be delivered by legends, Miles Teller was really good at capturing the emotion of playing drums.The direction was not really legendary, but it was not that bad either.What you really care about throughout the entire movie is the story and with continuous jazz playing in the background, the movie becomes extremely interesting to both music and movie lovers alike.As mentioned in the summary this is a piece of inspiration that everyone should take a bite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the past 10 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHIPLASH!!!!Whiplash is an independent movie brought to you by writer/director Damien Chazelle. Chazelle entered a short story into the Sundance film festival in 2013. The clip was so high praised he gained funding to adapt it into a full movie. When it was shown in last years Sundance Festival on the 16th of January. It was given such high praise It won the Dramatic Audience Award and has been consistently talked about ever since. Do not fear greatness: Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. And boy, did this movie achieve it.Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller - The Spectacular now), is a 19 year old drummer at the fictional Shaffer Music Conservatory in New York City. Plagued by his farther's failure to become a prestigious writer, he will stop at nothing to reach his goal of becoming one of the greatest jazz drummer of all time. One day while he is practicing he catches the eye of the great Terrence Fletcher. (J.K. Simmons - Spider-Man Trilogy) Who leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. After impressing him, he thinks he has got the sweet deal he had always dreamed of. But instead of being the knight in shining armour that Andrew thinks is. He will soon discover Fletcher's frightening and brutal methods that will forever change his life. Andrew's passion to achieve greatness quickly spirals into an obsession. eventually pushing him to the brink of both his ability and sanity.Editing isn't really something I pay attention to, or even notice while watching movies, but the editing in this movie is fantastic. It is filled with swift transactions between the character to drum set. How it moves perfectly over to each drum or symbol in perfect timing to the music. The back and forth switching from character to character is outstanding, especially in the confronting, and emotional scenes.The most liberating thing in this movie, for me, is the acting. Oh man, the acting is incredible. J.K.Simmons really does give the performance of his life in this movie. He's so viscous and mean but he plays it to a T. You may say "well, it doesn't take a great actor to be able to scream and shout", but to give the emotion and brutality that he put into his scenes I feel absolutely no one could do better. Picture J. Jonah Jameson mixed with Sergeant Hartman from FMJ, but 10 times worse, and that's Simmons in this movie. Also let us not forget, Miles Teller. He really poured his heart and soul into this movie, a ground breaking performance from him. He catches the emotion of Andrew to perfection, and I couldn't imagine anyone fitting that role more than him.This movie is near perfection, the only real flaw I have with this movie is Andrew's girlfriend, Nicole (Melissa Benoist - Glee) I don't really thing she was necessary to this movie, maybe if they would have added just a few more scenes, maybe an extra 5 minutes, just so we could get a real feel for her character and care how she ends up. That is the only thing stopping me from giving this a 10/10. A 9.8/10 will suffice. But it is definitely in the run for some Oscar nominations and I believe it definitely deserves a few wins as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Drums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid guitar player, I vividly remember watching the amazing Steve Vai battle against Ralph Macchio during the simply superb guitar duel at the end of the 1986' film, Crossroads (No, not the Britney Spears film). Soon after watching it, I was amazed to find out that Macchio was not entirely playing the guitar during the film and instead, the music was performed by Ry Cooder, yet to me, the performance by Macchio was really happening in front of me. Aside from the guitar duel, Crossroads was pretty pants, yet the knowledge that Macchio must have had intense training regarding where to place his fingers on the fret-board, when to strum, and when to make Vai- like facial expressions still amazes me to this day. After watching Whiplash, I felt, and still feel, the exact sense of sheer wonder I did the first time I saw that guitar duel, yet unlike Crossroads, Whiplash isn't pants. In fact, it's pretty much perfect. The plot of the film focuses on Andre Neiman, played by Miles Teller. a 19 year-old jazz drummer, who is taken under the wing of notorious teacher Terrence Fletcher, at renowned music school, Shaffer Conservatory, in order to fulfil his dreams of becoming a legend in musical history. Much like Macchio in Crossroads, Teller is flawless in attempting to present realistic and uncanny musical performances throughout the film, and even goes one better by perfectly portraying a character who literally combines blood, sweat and tears with total dedication into his musical ability. Following him all the way is J.K. Simmons', who surely must regard this as a career best performance, with his portrayal of Fletcher characterised by one moment, being undeniably cool and calm, and then suddenly morphing into this all-swearing, larger than life, musical monster who takes no prisoners, accepts no excuses, and will literally throw chairs at you for being slightly out of time with the rest of his band. Aside from the two actors, another winner in this film is surely Tom Cross, whose editing within the film allows Teller's performance to propel into greatness, and it is good to see that he has been recognised by the BAFTA's for such outstanding work which surely means an Oscar nomination is set to land at his feet. Good job. Obviously the soundtrack is brilliant, with it already being on my wish-list, but what truly exceeds in this film is it's hard-hitting nature in its' attempt to show characters whose lives are not only engulfed by their passion and love for the music, but will do almost anything to keep that feeling flowing, evidenced during the very last performance within the film in which both Teller and Fletcher give a performance worthy of endless applause and shouts for just one more. Overall, Whiplash is a brilliant piece of cinema, packed full with spot-on performances, not only from the actors, but by editor, Tom Cross, a brilliant soundtrack, and a sense of wonder which gripped me from start to finish. Can I have an encore? Overall Score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Compelling With Unlikable Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-One of the most acclaimed films of the year, Whiplash is about a drummer and his struggle to become the best in the best music school in the US. The only thing standing in his way, as well as pushing him to be greater, is an overbearing, verbally abusive, perfectionist professor.-Whiplash has a few flaws, but it is pretty great.-The story is very compelling and original.-The pace is pretty quick.-The acting is great. The lead does great, but J.K. Simmons as the dictator music-professor really made the film and probably an Oscar.-The characters themselves are not that likable. Obviously JK Simmons is not, but I did not expect the main character to be dislikable. So as compelling as the entire film is, it is hard to like people in it.-The music is incredibly fitting. So if you like drums, jazz, or pop orchestra, you will love the entire film.-The finale is also one of my favorite finales of the year. And the editing. So good.-Whiplash is rated-R for language, which is moderate, but not heavy.-So if you are looking for a compelling story about success and being the best you can be, I've got the film for you! Unless you hate jerks in films or you hate film about drumming. Lots of drumming. I will say Whiplash is totally worth checking out at store price! (Would be worth seeing in theaters, but it's not in wide release) I will give Whiplash an 8/10. Really only because I did not like any of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pluses/Minuses, yet definitely worth the watch in any case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved the way _Whiplash_ played perilously on the margins of the question of whether the teacher really cared or didn't care a whit about his young charge. The direction/acting/cut make it so that, at times, I was on the verge of concluding that the teacher really was, simply, an unregenerated, cold-blooded ba5tar9. It struck me that J.K. Simmons could easily have R. Lee Ermey whimpering like a little girl.The technical work around creating believable musical milieus was lovely. You really believed in the musicianship of all the actors.Not exactly a "date" flick, eh? The strong allusion to the fabled mutual exclusion between the drive to excellence and boy/girl romance came off (to me) like a fatal dose of c0ckbl0ck. I can imagine loads of date couples walking out of the theater with dark clouds of impending argument/cold-shouldering trailing behind....I felt an overall pacing issue. We're invited to believe in the young man's initial musical/skill aptitude and his development over the timeframe depicted. At times, it _did_ feel like they pushed a little too hard. I can understand the constraints (and I feel another accolade coming on): The story was just too big for the standard time constraints of popular film practice. Whereas so many films feel like they go on too long--only to find that they faithfully hewed to the 90- minute running time--the ending of _Whiplash_ comes too fast. When the end credits start rolling, you blink in astonishment. And there was a bit of a "time accordion" effect as you're watching the flick, like trying to squeeze a dockworker's ham-foot into a svelte high-heeled pump. Perhaps they should have created a double-length feature, with entr'acte, like the big-budget epics of yore. But I can imagine the suits at the studios doubting the worthiness of that tack, balking at the very idea. Damn their bottom-line eyes!Loved J.K Simmons in this. He was generally well-directed, and always amazes in taking direction. Speaking of direction, the only place where I felt there was a lapse was at the very ending, when J.K. was (I presume) directed to play it a bit over the top. Besides being poor direction, it struck me a bit unworthy of a flick about excellence in jazz, seeing how good jazz manages tone with control and taste. Kinda sad to see this little ball get dropped at the very end!But my remonstrances are minor compared to the overall impression, which is... very impressed, indeed.Great story, good production, (generally) good direction, fine acting, warmth, fire, charm, high drama, great music... really, a very worthy piece of film work. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting, intense, passionate. Simply stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've had this intense, this passionate, this wild and soaring a film experience since, yes, Black Swan four years ago when I first saw it. They should probably put a label before the film starts warning viewers because this is probably the best depiction of a roller-coaster ride as I've ever seen a film be. How funny though, months ago when first hearing about the film, thinking it was going to be sort of like a simple and sweet story of a young man learning how to play drums. Entertainment-wise, it doesn't get any better than this really. You get completely entranced into it all. I knew J.K. Simmons was going to play a tough instructor, but gosh, was never prepared for what I got. The film wisely plays into many of your emotions at extremely high levels. It's a terrifying and intense film, and the direction is why. How Chazelle isn't being considered a front-runner for Director is anyone's guess. The film is a crowd-pleaser through and through. A scary one, a perhaps too-demented one, but a crowd-pleaser nonetheless, riding on the audience's feelings from minute to minute. If Black Swan had so much success with awards and nominations, how can't this? When that was a genre film about ballerinas and this is about playing music? Baffled. J.K. Simmons, yeah... not much else to say really, everyone's said it already. What I found surprising is that he has a ton of screen time, and the film really is about him and Teller (okay, Teller and his obsession with his music but in terms of human relationships). It's all told through Teller's perspective, so there's no category fraud, but it could've been a case, certainly because the AMPAS has nominated way shorter roles in leading. Miles Teller, again, how he isn't in the awards conversation at all is baffling, baffling to me. His part is extremely meaty, and he knocks it out of the park, stunning you in awe. He doesn't go overboard at all either, he plays it exactly as it should for it to have a huge emotional impact yet still feel realistic enough to sustain that impact. As an experience, it doesn't get much better than this. However, the film plays so much on emotional momentum and intensity and passion, that I feel like it may not be a film that holds up that well in retrospect, whether it be in months or as the years go by. I know that probably doesn't matter to quite a lot of people, but I rewatch films quite often and to me the rewatchability/retrospect factor is a big part as to why my love for certain films is sustained. I feel like certain people will be less enamored by it over time (like Black Swan) and that just like Aronofsky's thriller, many might just see it as an over-cooked, silly, unrealistic and over-the-top drama. And, perhaps worse because Black Swan is seen as a genre thriller and this a "music drama". I have some of those concerns too, but, the heck does it matter now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could tell just after the first 10 minutes that this film was an extraordinary experience. It is both intimidating and inspiring, packaged in a intense brew of bloody notes. Although it is specifically about a drummer and his teacher, it speaks to anyone who has struggled to soar beyond the mediocre and is willing to sacrifice everything to get there.Wow. And my son thought I was tough as his Suzuki violin coach. While I would never go to Fletcher's extreme in shaping a musician, I do see his point. Too many people go at their craft half-heartedly and wilt under the faintest of criticism. Even worse, they become successful for unexceptional work product that only serves to limit their development. The look on the drummer's father's face when he watched his son playing and realized that his son was more than a drummer--he was a galaxy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is great art only the product of great suffering? And by creating comfortable and nurturing educational environments are we only condemning young people to mediocrity? This wildly entertaining ride with a young drummer through a music academy proves neither proposition yet makes us think deeply about both, providing fabulous jazz performances and grueling drum solos at the same time. That's probably all I have to say, if I had to say more, it's that movies like this are definitely worth the price of admission.

		<fullReview>I'm fresh from seeing the movie, and I have to say this movie is a masterpiece. The directing is well-done and keeps you tense when needed, and vice versa. The acting is superb. JK Simmons deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor, no doubt. Miles Teller gave a complete out-of-nowhere performance, proving himself to be an actor this generation will know. The writing was perfect. Nothing else to say. The movie keeps going places you don't think are gonna happen, and always keeps you guessing what's gonna happen next. The one fault I can find with the movie is that a storyline in the movie doesn't really go anywhere, and didn't get the closure I feel it deserved, but, it did not impact the movie as a whole, and even then the storyline was very minor throughout the movie. This is a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is incredibly tempered film with two brilliant performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is mindblowing story of success and dreams and the question of how far would we go to achieve those goals. Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller) went all the way to be the best at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, in New York, in the whole world. At Shaffer, being the best means to be accepted by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) at his class and still, it's always just the beginning and the road is never easy. Fletcher is an eccentric, charismatic, harsh, indifferent asshole. He is the best teacher and the worst person the same time, so it's always intense to be in the same room with him. Nieman, to the contrary, is an young boy full of dreams, skills and guts who is just starting to step into the jazz world. His temper and obsession with jazz grabs Terence's attention who invites the newbie to the class.Even though Andrew has heard a lot horrible things about Fletcher, he experiences something only one man had experienced before - and he then committed a suicide. Even though Teller's character is extremely talented, there is never enough for his teacher, who does literally everything to turn his students into someones exceptionally brilliant. Unheardly difficult practice sessions are the least of problems, when you might be thrown a chair at, if you play a note slightly faster or slower. But Nieman is never ready to give up - ends relationship, sleeps with drums and does everything to get a permanent drummer place. And it all ends up with mind blowing competition between two brilliant minds creating a spectacular journey from day one of their meeting to its end.Whiplash is a masterful movie for so many reasons. Even though it's a small film, it has a lot interesting and memorable to suggest - two phenomenal performances, good story, number of crucial questions/answers and it will make you fall in love with Jazz.Fairly, I'd start with performances and by performances I not only mean J.K. Simmons, who gets all well deserved attention/awards, but Miles Teller, who definitely delivered so far his best and career changing performance, that I will remember for a long time. Teller is unbelievably perfect as Andrew Nielsen who has plenty of important, emotional, twisty moments that can be a dreamy material for any Hollywood actor. He nails all of them, started from teardrops on the first lesson, to late-night practices, in the middle with rage, fights against Fletcher. He completely becomes his character, this young, confused, though very strong kid who decides to go against the tyrant intimidating the whole NY music world.There is not much I can add to what has been said about J.K. Simmons's performance: it's breathtaking. He managed to create a monster from a man who was really a monster and the same time he somehow feels sympathetic. Because of his brilliant acting, whenever you see Fletcher on the screen you freeze just exactly the way his students do and this emotions stuck in my head very deeply even though I saw Whiplash couple of weeks ago.Besides the fact that Damien Chazelle's screenplay is an amazing material for both actors, it's a very challenging story. It makes you question so many things and most importantly how ready are you to fight for being the best. Showing the relationship of those two people gives you multiple answers and then it's up to your choice. Being written and directed by the same guy, Damien manages to craft a beautiful story and deliver it in the way that you feel every second of it and never gets boring. The reason why I appreciate his work is that it influenced my attitude towards jazz in a good way, it actually made me to listen to it, to feel it and it's not something many films can not do out there. The way he shot scenes, with close-ups, made feelings more acute and sequences were changing as fast as the rhymes of music. Each second, where they play an actual music named Whiplash is a masterpiece of editing, masterpiece of sound and as a whole hugely influential scenes.I loved how Chazelle played with blood scenes - showing Andrew's bruised hands, blood spots on drums and sticks - it all aggravated emotions how hard it was for the character to follow the his own and his teacher's ego.In conclusion, Whiplash is one of the most memorable movies I've seen this year, with two unforgettable performances, a quality writing and directing. It's an absolute must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about a driven young man, wanting to be the best jazz drummer in the world. Facing a abusive teacher, wanting to be responsible for the next great musician. Pushing his students to constantly pushing their limits. Expecting perfection constantly, and lashing out whenever he doesn't get it. The young drummer trains and trains, in order to show the teacher that he belongs in the special group of musicians.The relationship between the drummer and the teacher remains the mostly abusive and tense during the whole movie, driving the drummer to the brink of insanity due to the constant pressure, with exception of the last seven minutes. I think it ties together what has been discussed up to that point, gaining understanding for the teachers, or at least an explanation, behavior. But I don't know, at the same time it feels so rushed to making the drummer and teacher friends after having both of them building up the pressure and tension between them during the whole movie. But the pressure is perfectly portrayed, the abusive relationship is interesting (seeing how goody-two-shoe most films like this can be, evidently this movie takes that path as well in the end but It's because of the analogy between the drummer and Charlie Parker. Failing at first, only to succeed in the end.J.K. Simmons is incredible as the teacher, the music is great, the theme is great and is definitely a movie that needs to be watched if you like movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For lovers of jazz music and of stories dealing with young artists trying to find their way, this 2014 movie has it all.A young drummer, Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is accepted into Shaffer Conservatory, one of the best music schools in the country and yearns for the approval of Terence Fletcher, the school's intimidating and legendary master (J. K. Simmons, in his best role since "Juno"). Fletcher is only interested in the best of the best students and hopes to find the next Charlie Parker, only to be continually disappointed. The ferocious lead performances (Teller and Simmons) in "Whiplash" impute a mesmerizing power on the viewer, who witnesses a psychological struggle between teacher and pupil that is both unsettling and riveting. The parameters of artistic sacrifice in the face of a tyrannical teacher are questioned but not answered. Psychologically disturbing and thrilling all at once, we see a young prodigy become enslaved to his own ambition. These performances are not to be missed.

		<fullReview>Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons battle for the extent of the movie and I never wanted it end. Teller plays a dedicated drummer who is driven by the idea of being driven. He knows that in order to be the best drummer he can be he would have to sacrifice everything (even his body in different parts of the movie). He is able to convey his passion for drumming while also performing on the drums in an incredible fashion. J.K. Simmons plays the music teacher from hell. He is great at what he does but he will tear people apart in order to get the best out of them. Simmons goes through every insult in the book when he is in full rage mode and it is hysterical. What impressed me just as much as the acting by the two actors was the direction of this movie. Damien Chazelle does a great job in only his second movie. The shots of the drumming at all different angles throughout the course was a very unique aspect to this film. One shot of Teller putting his bloody hand into ice water stuck in my mind. The storyline which Chazelle wrote was also extremely original and didn't fall into many clichés that I was expecting. There was a love interest that was involved and as the movie went it could have fallen into the trap of needing to include her to perfectly wrap things up; it didn't go that way and I was glad to see that. The movie changes tempo quite often, which I enjoyed a lot. There are moments of high stress, comical back and forth, mutual understandings, and an overall authenticity to it all that makes you care about what is going on.The end of this movie is amazing. Even though the acting and directing throughout the entire movie are great, the last scene is where it all comes together. The battle between Simmons and Teller comes to a final clash and it is safe to say that they both win with how it all plays out. One of the most satisfying and original endings in recent memory. Whiplash is an under the radar film that will pleasantly surprise those who go out to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are at the end of the year, and superlatives are handed like candy in Halloween. Sometimes the films are about serious themes and are immediately branded as classic, and actors ushered into the pantheon of the immortals, only to be forgotten in a few days. It's a rather special moment when one runs into a film that doesn't need the superlatives, not because it hasn't earned them, but because it is pure perfection, with every note playing beautifully, every nuance, every loud beat reaching us at the right time. This is the case of "Whiplash", a hard driving, entertaining, and very satisfying piece. "Whiplash" benefits grandly from a pair of intense performers, giving us probably what could be the best of their careers, and in the case of J.K. Simmons, it just caps many years of very good work. Miles Teller is just beginning what I certainly hope is an illustrious career. He stole the show in "Footloose", and he's one of the brightest spots in the rather silly "Divergent".The film is the story of a man trying to find that new musical genius, one who believes you have to push beyond rational limits to make that diamond truly shine, even when some of the methods are a bit unconventional and borderline abusive. Then there is the student who firmly believes he can be that special one, but he might never get there because of his personal hubris, and the fact that his teacher might not give him the chance he needs.Tensions mount as teacher drives student to frustration, unbearable amounts of pain, and the point where he might doubt his true potential. In addition, we have twists of fate that are likely to derail everyone's plans, and in a terrific conclusion, a musical ride, unlike anything we have seen recently, making recent musical entries recoil in shame because they lacked both soul and talent. Here we have the beat at its most alive, matching the intensity of the performances, the beauty of the photography, and with masterful editing strokes, pushing us in the audience to witness what joy it is to see all of the pieces of a good movie team work in perfect unison.Teller shows what a physical performance can be, and he the dazzling Simmons to match and play along with. Both are leading performances and hopefully will be recognized as such. It's a perfect team, with the necessary balance to make everything work.Come and go along for the ride, and you'll truly see plenty of diamonds shine, like the most beautiful of those stars before they were told they were doing a very "good job" and started settling for less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a part time actor, I understand how competitive the world of creative arts is. The biggest and most fulfilling goal is to find something we love doing and being able to make money doing so. Some have a passion for the office life, but plenty others would rather do something creative. Who wouldn't like to make a living by singing and dancing? The problem here is that there are more untalented then there are prepared. It's not just that they come to make it, but it's that they stay without an epiphany that would send them home. The new goal is to show why you're better then the bunch.So that's when we turn to education to not only improve our abilities, but hope that some connection or showcase might give us something once we've finished. There's no guarantee, but the ones that work hard are likely find something to do. But to make it to the end, we have to prove to our teachers that were capable of handling the workload and pressure. The biggest question we face is why we need to prove our peers? There teaching because there not performing, so are they even the right people to prove? I guess it depends on the teacher, but the question gets bigger when we consider Whiplash.Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller) is an aspiring jazz drummer who is in his freshman year at the Shaffer Conservatory, the best music program in the country. He strives to be one of the greats and hopes to catch the attention of the schools infamous conductor, Terrence Fletcher (played by J. K. Simmons). Neiman knows of Fletchers reputation as a tough educator, but still aspires to be noticed as he continues to practice and juggle a new girlfriend.A surprise in-class audition finally gets Neiman a spot on Fletchers orchestra. At first, Fletchers seems calm and encouraging to the young man, telling him that everything will be fine. But once Fletchers anger is revealed and a chair is flung, Neiman breaks down in the middle of class, never having dealt with someone as intense as this conductor is. At this point, he knows that he has to impress him mentor, so he makes the decision to break off his relationship and all social life to focus on drumming. He gains bloody knuckles and blisters on his fingers, but Neiman strives to show that he has the potential to be the next great drummer.Whiplash is intense. Nope, that's not even the right word here. Whiplash goes beyond horror film intense. The lengths that our characters will go to play jazz is just surprising. This film breaks down upon the principle that practice makes perfect. Practicing helps, but does that create a genius? It seems to hint that it's all a croak and that were are either great at something or not. I can see the angle here as I'm aware of several people that read monologue daily, hoping that they'll be better actors. That helps improve their skill, but they can't be born gifted. They simply are better at it or not. This film works well because of our leads, Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. Teller must of gone through a crazy preparation for Whiplash as they clearly show him playing these up to ten minute drum solos that would have made my own hands fall off. Perhaps the actor himself should be a real drummer. Simmons on the other hand, is the kind of teacher that no one ever wants. Sure he's passionate for creating the next great players, but you really question how far he'll go to get that out of his students. The relationship between these two is something that's never been done to this extreme between student and teacher. I'll give this ten bloody drumsticks out of ten. As I said with Nightcrawler (the same company behind that also produced Whiplash), sanity is all over the place and that just makes for a better movie. It's all very fascinating and something that everyone who wants to go into the creative arts (especially music) should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is centered around a drummer named Andrew (Teller), a first year music student enrolled at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory, who is one night, whilst practicing his drumming skills, approached by the immensely respected jazz conductor Terence Fletcher (Simmons), who later offers him a place in his jazz band; the most respected band in all of the college. Andrew and Fletcher's personalities collide as Fletcher reveals a volatile and destructive nature upon Andrew's first rehearsal with the band. From here on out, Andrew attempts to earn the respect and admiration of a man who seeks only to push and demand perfection from his highly talented students.Released earlier this year at Sundance to universal praise from critics and audiences alike, Whiplash is one of the most adrenaline filled films of the year, despite not actually being an action or sport film. Infused with an electric quantity of energy, primarily due to the inventive, fast-paced and astounding cinematography and editing, Whiplash dazzles, punishes, challenges and ultimately rivets the audience member to their core. This is first class entertainment; a film which captures the ferocity and vehemence of an action film of the likes of Edge of Tomorrow, whilst combining it with the exploitative tendencies and emotional range of a film like Gone Girl. Strange comparisons, but accurate nevertheless.What makes Whiplash tick though is its unflinching documentation of a man who is so driven to achieve that he resents communication and socialization with those outside his chosen craft. Even as Andrew attempts to connect and discuss with those outside his life of drumming, including his father and a romantic interest in a girl named Nicole, the film always makes these portions of his life insignificant and unimportant in contrast. Andrew, unknowing of how to properly interact with people due to his lack of social skills, seems to be acting himself as he tries to fumble his way through a break-up and through seemingly insignificant conversations. His lack of interest in anything outside of his profession is showcased most prominently towards the end, where many of the characters receive little-to-no resolution whatsoever, apart from Andrew and Fletcher; the people instrumental in developing and challenging his drumming capabilities. Everyone and everything else simply fades into the background, as to Andrew, they're unimportant.The film is intensely personal and often riveting in the way it handles the primary protagonist, as the cinematography often reverts to close-ups and still shots, focusing solely on his speed and his efforts. As Andrew drums his way to bloody fingers and immense sweating sessions, the camera seems to block everyone else out of the shot, focusing solely on his exertions alone. The entire atmosphere of the film helps us to focus on our main protagonist, allowing us to get more in-tune with Andrew, his emotions and his drive. This is partially due to the efforts of the lighting technician for the film, Jack M. Guberman, who provides an eerie colour palette for the frame; all the drumming, rehearsal and concert scenes are shot with an orange filter, reflecting a jazz-vibe. Whilst it's at first comforting, the intensity of the lighting continues to build and build as Andrew becomes even more concerned with success and perfection; by the final concert of the film, the camera seems to visibly remark upon the intensity and power of the lighting, taking notice of it at every opportunity.Miles Teller and JK Simmons bring the characters of Andrew and Fletcher to life, and both are equally as commanding and compelling in their respective roles; Teller is fantastic as Andrew, whilst Simmons is merciless and cold as Fletcher. For neither of them to receive nominations for Best Actor and Supporting Actor come end of year would be a travesty, for these are honestly the most vivid and highly intense performances of 2014. The two men clash at each other with power and fire, but as they slowly come to respect the other as a fantastic musician and a driven individual, their delight and enthusiasm is most evident. Teller's eyes alone tell a story of pain and ambition, his expressions and eyes often moving from saddened to angry with natural precision. His somewhat sympathetic Sutter from The Spectacular Now entirely disappears as he inhabits Andrew, a man who is oft-times morally ambiguous, but commendable and confident nevertheless. Simmons is on a-whole-nother planet, the rest of this year's Best Supporting Actor Oscar contenders coming nowhere near his level of intensity, pain, emotion and brutal honesty. His threats directed at both Andrew and his fellow students are both sublime and ethically questionable, his moments of weakness and sadness raw and desperately genuine, and his encouragement forgiving and welcome. Every single scene these two are in together stun; they bounce off each other with grace, and as their relationship strains to an eventual climax, the tension leaps to new highs.I've had few experiences at the theatre this year be this effective, engrossing and highly entertaining, whilst also being immensely vigorous and exhausting. Leaving the theatre, I was awash with emotions. As a musician, I was moved and provoked. As a casual viewer, I was stunned and depleted. This is a cinematic experience not to be missed, whether you desire a fantastic plot which takes a number of interesting and unexpected plot twists, a drama which focuses on the desire and desperate strive to become one of the greats, or a high octane burst of energy in a crowd of films that are currently in cinemas which lack such. Damian Chazelle's direction and screenplay is masterful, and fit alongside stunning performances, tempo-driven editing from Tom Cross, stunning cinematography from Sharone Meir and a brilliant score from Justin Hurwitz, Whiplash is undoubtedly one of the year's best films, and one of the best directorial debuts I've ever seen. Watch out for Damian Chazelle, for he has all the talent to go far in this harsh and destructive business.10More film reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash is cinematic freeform jazz: unexpected, unpredictable, and quite fulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an artist, whether writing something, filming something, or playing something, requires a special edge. This special edge is a passion that not everyone can possess, and not everyone can maintain. This special edge can alienate you from the rest of society, can cast you as a black sheep, can drain all your willpower, but at the end of the day if you are good at your craft this is all that matters.Whiplash is a grandiose work of cinematic bittersweet delight that explores that darkness of said passion and the drawbacks that comes with it. It is required viewing if you ever want to know what it feels like to be a tortured soul determined to be the best. There were only 12 people in the theater when I watched this: we all wound up clapping in the end.Whiplash thrashes around like bebop jazz: initially inviting, then becomes loud, unexpected, twisted, daring, violent, and entertainingly tedious. On the surface it looks like a simple tale of an aspiring jazz drummer entering a tough course with a nasty instructor becomes something much more. It is about two people that seek perfection in their craft in an art form that can easily hide the blemishes. It is about two people trying to succeed in a type of music that is a far cry from what it used to be. The olden days are referenced aplenty, from style to music to the victim artists within the genre.On the surface, it may look like a simple film to direct. But Whiplash contains a heavy and hyper dosage of extreme close-ups, long shots, fast alternating cuts, and just a dizzying cinematographic energy that is on par with the best action films. Damien Chazzelle not only writes the strong script that is far from predictable, but also gives the movie a strong flavoring of authenticity from the small details to the music that is ultimately performed in front of our very own eyes.The acting deserves Oscar nominations all around. Although J.K. Simmons will receive almost all the (well-deserved) attention for a spellbinding and flawless performance as a profanity-laced and dangerous perfectionist teacher that becomes a tyrant once the class starts, Miles Teller also deserves just as much acclaim for bringing his extremely devoted yet sympathetic lead character to life. The jazz action is intense, the blood, sweat and tears are frighteningly real. The tension is heavy in an unlikely Hitchcockian sense, and by the time you get to the climactic scene you will simply be swept away by the musical, emotional, and psychological madness.It is not an easy movie to stomach, it is a tough pill to swallow. But surviving the intense thrill dramatic ride of passion brings enough catharsis and snarky emotional payoff to have you hooked from beginning to finish. Whiplash is easily one of the best films of 2014 as it all comes together perfectly like a great jazz ensemble.Being an artist is zealous torture, plain and simple. Whiplash perfectly personifies this fact of life.And this type of torture is exactly why I am writing this review at 4 in the morning. And whether you understand this aspect of my life or not, I wouldn't have it any other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And The Beat Goes On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is highly recommended. The need to create and the artistic challenges that go along with that innate desire are the force empowering the characters in Whiplash, a wonderful melodrama about a controlling teacher and his talented student. Their ongoing conflict is the basis for this film. Despite some overdone moments, it is one of this year's best.Skillfully written and directed by Damien Chazelle, Whiplash tells its conventional story very well. Andrew Neiman (Miles Telller) has a dream of becoming a first class jazz drummer and nothing will stand in his way. He practices daily, to the point of bloody self-destruction,and gets the attention of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a demanding conductor at the school whose high standard of excellence becomes Andrew's mantra.Chazelle has made a stylish film with superb editing by Tom Cross that follows the riffs and rhythms of its musical score while focusing on its central players. The passionate performances by Teller and Simmons are remarkable. Their rehearsal scenes crackle with tension as their relationship builds to become a master class in acting. Teller conveys the youthful eagerness to please with the vulnerable side of a gifted musician's fervent interest in his art. Simmons has been given the role of his career. There is no beloved Mr. Chips on campus. This professor lobs his barbed words at his class for direct impact and makes his tirades sting with indignation. If Simmon's memorable role as the overly zealous Fletcher is overlooked this award season, then the rules need to be revamped immediately. However, the logical question does arise and make one pause to the actual reality of academia: could a music professor be so sadistic and cruel and still be in charge of this class? The physical and mental abuse he inflicts on his pupils is layered with constant profanity, racial slurs, and acts of violence that certainly would never have given him tenure, let alone keep a job. This leap of logic almost tilts the story to absurdity.But the dramatics outweigh the reality of the situation. The film is so well crafted and boasts two of this year's finest performances that it demands your attention. Whiplash is emotionally involving from its first note to its last.

		<fullReview>Whiplash is by far, my most intriguing film of 2015; not only intriguing but highly under appreciated when it comes to popularity and recognition. This movie literally gave me chills, especially at the end, just stunning. Miles Teller, is possibly a leading man, some day, but is only sub-par here; clearly, the writing went into J.K. Simmons supporting character, and boy did it show. J.K. Simmons, showed me his true greatness, in which, I, thought he never had. Was, I, proved wrong? Absolutely! Simmons, truly is a powerful actor, who, deserves to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight, and Sir, take a bow.Whiplash is about a skilled young drummer, who, is promoted to his school's top-tier jazz band, where he (Teller) clashes with an obsessive music teacher (Simmons) and his intense methods.A must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew (Miles Teller) draws the attention of drum instructor Fletcher (J.K.

It makes no apologies about being brash and uncompromising. The fact that its well-made, brilliantly observed and written, most will concede. Whether they LIKE it may depend on their temperament. It raises interesting questions about nature vs nurture and morality and refuses to spoon-feed the answers. Reactions to this film should be mixed according to the personal truths people found in it. I could tell you my feelings, but that would defeat the purpose of what I've said and what the film is saying. Its up to you to find that line for yourself: is it worth it?8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, the interpretation of J.K. Simmon's as well as Miles Teller's was astonishing. Moreover, the scenario made me hold my breath until the last minute of the film! It was original and so aspiring. Furthermore, it is an absolutely aspiring and encouraging film that everybody must see.It gives you strength and teaches you that if you really work and focus on something you want to achieve, you will achieve it and your hard work will be rewarded! Finally, the soundtrack and the music during the film is great and it gave me the opportunity to look for further information and learn about jazz music and its musicians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man oh man, it's been a while since I was so fired up over a film. Indeed, the other times I can remember being this excited were when I first watched Memento roughly ten years ago and In the Mood for Love several years back. Regardless of any complaints I might have, to finally witness a film again that makes good on the promise of all those remarks about how 'astounding,' 'exhilarating' and 'electrifying' it is, is a breath of fresh air. Whiplash reminds me of Black Swan. Both films deal with an (unhealthy) desire to achieve artistic perfection. There's a key difference in the way both films handle this theme, however, which I think is crucial to understand why Whiplash is ultimately the superior film?but more on that later.Whiplash starts in pitch black as we hear the faint sound of drums slowly tapping. And then it slowly goes faster?and faster and just when you think it couldn't possibly go any faster, it does. The effect is euphoric. With a bang the first image appears, protagonist Andrew, a first-year student at Schaffer Conservatory in New York, sitting at his drum set, practicing. He is startled to see Terence Fletcher, a jazz instructor at the conservatory, watching him from a distance. Though Fletcher doesn't seem to be impressed, Andrew is eventually allowed to join his band as the alternate for the core drummer. Fletcher, however, turns out to be to jazz instructors what Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket is to drill sergeants: aka hardcore. Fletcher comes from the school of hard knocks and believes the only way new musical legends will ever arise is if people are pushed "beyond what is expected of them." Naturally, his teaching methods will have psychologists weeping in their theatre seats, but there you go. Andrew, feeling his family and friends don't truly understand and appreciate his efforts, naturally isolates himself from those around him and starts practicing until his hands bleed. The rest of the film traces his efforts to achieve his goals and his relationship with Fletcher.In pure cinematic terms, I'd almost label Whiplash a thriller. It's edited in such a way that even the act of Andrew quickly grabbing his stuff and getting into a car becomes exhausting. Even during scenes of jazz being played, the editing is alive, panning from player to player with quick close-ups of players and instruments added as well. Truly, this film is the perfect showcase for the power of editing.As for the acting, if you've heard anything at all about it, you'll know J.J. Jameson, uh, J.K. Simmons acts the hell out of his part. It's impossible not to feel a bit discouraged by the fact that only now, when he nabbed a really scene-chewing part, he's showered with awards, but it's hard not to like him, the man, mind you, not the character. What's more upsetting, however, is how Miles Teller (you know, the protagonist) flew under the collective radars of pretty much all major award bodies. I guess they felt it's hard to name someone 'best actor' when 50% of the time he's playing the drums. Nevertheless, he gives an astounding performance.As for the crucial difference between Black Swan and Whiplash: in Black Swan, you never 'felt' Nina's desire to become the best. You knew that's what she wanted, but you didn't share that longing. The film couldn't convey the feeling of reaching perfection being the only thing that matters. In Whiplash, however, there are no cheesy surrealist nightmare sequences with oh so deep symbolism. Instead, we see Andrew practicing and practicing and listening to old tapes of the drummers he's always idolized. When he starts experiencing success in Fletcher's band, we share his feeling of isolation when no one in his family appreciates the sacrifices he's made in the name of art. We start to share the feeling that being anything less than the next Charlie Parker just won't do.If there is a downside, it's that the film lacks a certain amount of plausibility. Whenever a film like Whiplash or Black Swan attempts to portray the quest for 'true art,' it's always paired with physical and emotional violence and so on. I get the point, believe me, but there's something unbelievable about a man like Fletcher doing what he does and it not resulting in his immediate dismissal from the conservatory. The film does its best to remedy this with characters that emphasize the emotional abuse Fletcher is dishing out to his players, basic human decency as portrayed by Andrew's father and by explicitly/implicitly dealing with questions of whether or not the end justifies Fletcher's means, whether being told you did a "good job" is good enough, whether or not all this effort and sacrifice is worth it, etc. Any viewer with a working thinking cap will realize the film doesn't portray Fletcher's methods as being the one path to greatness.But in the end, these minor quibbles don't stand in the way of Whiplash's true achievement: coming to share and understand Andrew's desire to succeed and this the film does with aplomb. Nowhere is this more evident than in the spectacular finale, one long rousing scene that is almost completely without dialogue. The music does all the talking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is such a myriad of blood, sweat, tears, anxiety, screaming, and terror in Whiplash that an outsider might mistake it for a horror show instead of a cursory, superiorly breathtaking thriller of sorts. I'm not the kind of critic that uses tired phrases like "kept me at the edge of my seat" or "made me sweat bullets" as devices to trickily describe my heart-rate, but during Whiplash, I experienced both sensations; not in the same way I did when Ghostface was chasing around Drew Barrymore with psychotic fascination in Scream and not in the same way I did when Marion Crane was getting shower-knifed in Psycho. Whiplash invents an entirely new kind of thrill, one where an aggressive insult is as excruciating as a punch to the face and a drum solo quivers with the same acrimony of a fist fight where no one wins.Miles Teller (who is already becoming one of Hollywood's many underrated young talents) portrays Andrew Neyman, an aspiring drummer who has found a place within the halls of a respected music conservatory on the East Coast. Though slightly cocky, his talent is undeniable; he aspires to be the next Buddy Rich, and it doesn't seem like all too much of an exaggeration. Little does he know that he is about to become the punching bag of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a sadistic conductor who isn't afraid to hurl verbal and physical assaults on his students in order to achieve a sickened sort of perfection.Famously, the American Film Institute compiled a series of Top 100 lists, its subjects being stars, laughs, passions, quotes, and more. If they were to start again from scratch in the next decade or so, Terence Fletcher would, in no doubt, find his place as one of the Top 50 Villains. Simmons has made himself a kind presence before (Juno, all those insurance commercials), but never again will I be able to look at him without a cautious, passing fear. As terrifying as Darth Vader or Nurse Ratched, Fletcher seems to enjoy inflicting pain onto his students; even scarier is the fact that the film never offers any explanation as to why he feels the need to traumatize the impressionable youths around him. Most movies would use a dying wife or an abusive childhood as excuses, but not with Fletcher. He is evil, probably not even realizing it. Simmons snarls his way through screaming matches with unbridled ferocity, but more disconcerting is his ability to radiate cruelty even when his manners are at their very best.In Whiplash, we're never quite sure if Fletcher's alarming teaching methods will ultimately guide Andrew in the direction of the greatest drummer alive, or if they will send him over the edge. Teller, a brilliant and intuitive actor, is aware that Andrew isn't always likable but makes up for it with fierce determination. As he practices unbelievable amounts of time to polish a certain section of a particular piece of music, blood rips through his hands like a geyser, sweat pours down his face like a waterfall. But will he give up? The lethal rapport between Teller and Simmons is morbid enough to keep us guessing.Mention must also be made for Tom Cross' magnificent editing. The way he pieces together Fletcher's attacks on Andrew are inflamed in peril, flickering with rough movement that matches Fletcher's unpredictable mood changes; most impressive is the climax (which is basically a long, extremely intense drum solo), which captures every single detail imaginable, ensnaring any drip of sweat or instrumental spasm of the performance.When the closing credits finally popped up, I noticed that, in all my leg-shaking and shortages of breath, I was drenched in sweat. Whiplash doesn't allow for a smoke break or a second to get your bearings straight ? the continuance of high tension makes it the most thrilling film of 2014.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feverish and Original, Whiplash excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is an ingenious clash between jazz and psychology, bringing with it a resounding tale of terror, music, and insanity that resolves itself so perfectly, viewers will be truly speechless at the end of the film. The film depicts Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drumming student at the fictional, yet very prestigious Schaffer Conservatory. A teacher at the school, Terrence Fletcher, finds Andrew and adopts him into his band where he proceeds to harass, verbally as well as physically abuse and push Andrew to his absolute limit. The dynamic of the two characters is riveting: A young, yet highly ambitious (he dumps Melissa Benoist to pursue drumming. I mean, you have to be ambitious to dump Melissa Benoist) student attempting to impress his seemingly unimpressible teacher who pushes and pushes Andrew inevitably to his breaking point. Damien Chazelle crafts Andrew's practice scenes exquisitely, often tuning cuts between shots to drum beats hammered out by the sweaty, bloody, and often exhausted Andrew as he wrenches his face and pounds away (once even punching a hole in snare drum out of sheer frustration) at a dilapidated old drum set. Andrew becomes cold, reckless, and violent in his pursuit of "greatness" while all this is encouraged by his teacher, pulling him deeper and deeper into an inescapable, sinister, and hopeless rabbit hole.I believe that the only issue with this film is its occasional lack of loyalty to a certain subject. At certain times it seems to jump between the central theme of jazz and the central theme of ambition, creating a sort of cinematic identity crisis. However, this is quite easy to overlook. But still. Watch it for the jazz. Watch it for the excellent performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Watch it for the unrelenting depiction of human ambition and what it can lead one into. Or watch it for Melissa Benoist.Whiplash is truly an excellent film with a mind-blowingly awesome ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked "Whiplash". It wasn't fast paced or anything like that because it didn't have to be. All it needed was the main characters looking for perfection and that's what made this this film a great one. Andrew (Miles Teller) joins a prestigious music school and is taught by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), An instructor who seeks nothing but perfection. What caused me and probably others to go out and see this film was J.K. Simmons' character, Fletcher. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) was like a musical drill sergeant abusing his students to get the best out of them. I know I'm not the only who thought this, but at times I was being reminded of "Full Metal Jacket". J.K. Simmons' performance in this film was excellent. That's why he won an Academy Award for best performance by an actor in a supporting role for this film. Also, the two main characters form an unusual bond that steers the film almost into another direction making the film just about perfect.</fullReview>

The movie examines an old-school, lambasting style of teaching which is cruel in action but good in its intent. It asks how far should someone go to push another to greatness and at what point are they pushing them away. The story focuses on the Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), an ambitious young jazz drummer, who is attending Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the most prestigious music school in America. Andrew has always been a loner and this remains the case at Shaffer where he is picked on by classmates and has no close friends. As a result Andrew spends his free time going to the movies with his father (Paul Reiser) and listening to his drumming hero Buddy Rich. During a late night practice session, Andrew's dedication and talent catches the attention of Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), the school's most ruthless teacher whose intense methods are legendary. Fletcher recruits Andrew to play in the schools top band which he runs akin to a military boot camp. Feelings and dignity take a rhythmic beating in Fletchers obsessive pursuit in driving his students to play pitch perfect jazz. His special interest in Andrew sees him bear the brunt of his unrelenting teaching style and he must endure many a metaphorical cymbal thrown at his head. Andrew succumbs to the constant mind game by falling into a state of obsession to please the unpleasable Fletcher. He drums until his hands bleed and shaves off all other elements of his life in fear they will only hold him back from eminence. One flaw is the supporting characters are one dimensional, inserted into the story purely to serve the main characters, although this is only a minor gripe due to the sheer magnetism of the leads.The director is able to draw the audience into the beauty of jazz in both setting and sound. Close-up shots of player's instruments show their intricate details and the dark lighting sets the scene for the emotional battles and musical performances in Shaffer's old rehearsal rooms. The grandiose jazz music will have you tapping along in your seat and feeling the same frustration as the musicians each time Fletcher cuts off the music mid-play with a swift clench of his fist, as you yearn for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the most engrossing films I have EVER seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason this film is SO engrossing is the tension that begins in the opening and just when it is easing (you think) it hits you again. Simmons is the evilest, meanest, son of a bitch band instructor in a top music college. Young Teller is a drummer and the movie is basically their story. It is so difficult to review without spoiling this fine script. I can only say, you DON'T have to be a big band jazz fan to be mesmerized by the casting, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, etc. It SHOULD have won BEST FILM at the Academy Awards in every category including Best Film. I am not a RAVER ever, but this I will watch again tomorrow. Again from the very edge of my chair. And what PROOF that you don't need to spend a half-billion to make an amazing film. This film was budgeted at just over THREE million dollars! Simply a MUST SEE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant acting, can't get it out of my mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dreading watching this film, having grown up with an abusive alcoholic father. But I did it and it wasn't uncomfortable like I thought it might be. However, it is not a true story and it has nothing to do with alcoholism. It is a fictional story with a well-written script, played by high caliber actors. Although Whiplash is not Best Picture material, it is worth seeing for the outstanding performances by the main two actors. JK Simmons absolutely deserved Best Supporting Actor for his role. I've been a Simmons fan for a long time, although many people are probably just now learning who he is. But in my opinion, the story is not really about him. In life, we all run into toxic people from time to time. How you deal with them says a lot about who you are. I can't say enough about the ending - a drawn out scene filled with edge-of-your-seat tension. I could not tear my eyes or ears away. Lots of great jazz music in the score, so make sure your speakers are turned up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Agony and the Ecstasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the Army's better slogans was "Be All You Can Be." Many people incorrectly reinterpret that as "You can be anything you want." They think getting a perfect SAT Math score means you have what it takes to be a mathematician; running a 2:20 marathon as a male means you're a top notch runner; getting an A+ in a quantum mechanics course makes you a top flight physicist; or playing "La Campanella" on the piano fast and without error makes you a great piano player.They are sadly mistaken, as this movie points out. The gap between being 99% and being 99.9999% is vaster than the gap between 50% and 99%. Interestingly, a lot of people who should know better, like the pompous reviewer at The New Yorker who dings "Whiplash" for technical inaccuracies, don't get it. Whiplash is not a Jazz documentary! It's a film about what it takes to be tops in your field. Being world class at something is a relentless selection process that starts with immense talent, and continues with extreme dedication and a good dose of luck. The food chain whittles down even a superior competitor when the time and place are not right. Again and again, there's only one chance, whether it's the future Nobel Prize winner who squeaked though her faculty interview, or in this movie, a nobody from NYC (our hero is called "Nieman," and "Niemand" with a "d" in German is nobody) makes it to the top through raw talent, bloody hard work, and a lot of lucky coincidences. The film is unapologetic about what we all know, or should know: a "good job" does not get you there, it's just the route to mediocrity.The film reminded me a bit of the Michaelangelo tale "The Agony and the Ecstasy." That one faced off Charlton Heston against Rex Harrison as Pope Julius. But "Whiplash" is actually better, a rare find among modern films. The script plays the actors just right, from the young naiveté of Nieman to the relentless perfectionism of J. K. Simmons as the jazz teacher Fletcher, who is searching for that one world-class student so his teaching career is validated. Even in the little details, the movie gets it right: like the arrogance of a New Yorker stating that "some of the best from NYC, and therefore, the world" are on stage.Along the way, Nieman shows that he is a na?ve asshole. He dumps his fledgling girlfriend, anticipating her interference with his hoped-for future greatness. He gets duped by an attorney into accusing Fletcher of abuse, and actually believes that this is going to remain a secret to Fletcher. Talent is often a very narrow thing, and does not mean one has common sense. Picasso (and how many others!) have pointed that out. The climax is very satisfying as the teacher throws the pupil a loop at a live performance, and the pupil, now master, throws it right back at him, until these two birds of a feather give each other a knowing smile.The only thing the film suffers from is a too relentlessly perfect plot, pulling all the right strings in all the right places, like a Ravel orchestration of Mussorgsky. The metaphorical trucks collide on time to cause career-ending whiplash, the metaphorical sheet music vanishes on cue for the inferior artist who actually needs it. It's like a giant clockwork orchestrated to get the maximum effect out of the 1 hour and 45 minutes. And yet, in the middle of the film the director lacks the courage to play the WHOLE of the title song just for once, fading instead into a "And the winner is..." These are nit-pickings in a great film that's fun to watch, and sends us all a reminder: When we think that "no matter what you do, someone always does it better, faster, more," that's true for most of us; but not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intense and epic!Damien Chazelle has landed a knockout blow in extremity with his epic jazz project. Whiplash is a story of a young drummer with a potential to stand amongst the greats and an abusive instructor who seeks perfection at every note to help his students achieve the greatness.The casting couldn't have been more perfect. Both Teller and Simmons fit the portrait of their characters superbly. Simmons is an exceptional actor. He dons the abusive and mean demeanour quite naturally and carries it throughout the flick, reeking of perversion, cruelty and foul-mouthed barbarism. Going inhumane to create a musical virtuoso was something Simmons was trying to achieve. Teller, an equally great actor leaves no stone unturned to play the obsessive drummer, who fumes with confidence and rage when tipped over the breaking point. You see him burn in wrath and conviction when he is trying to prove himself.There are excellent dramatic scenes in the movie that simply goes on to show how Teller has significantly evolved in the acting department. Watch out for the bit when he gets rammed by a truck and still goes on to play. Also when he plays so fiercely that he bleeds and jabs the drum in resentment.Direction is enthralling. The way camera moves quickly capturing every gesture of the instructor and the protagonist and then landing on every instrument in the orchestra was a delight to watch. Beats in the background subtly wrapping up New York buildings show exceptional direction skills of Chazelle. Editing was outstanding. There wasn't a moment of ennui in the entire movie.The climax of the movie would literally stop your breath. My hands were moving along with Andrew's sticks as if I was drumming it. One of the best drums you would ever listen to.Wasn't a big jazz fan. This movie has transformed the way I looked at it. Highly recommended quality cinema ladies and gentlemen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Swan for drummers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The types of films I love the most are the ones with a real raw intensity. Black Swan is definitely the most intense film experience I've had with Darren Aronofsky's chaotic direction becoming almost suffocating at times. It's a film which I endlessly admire, as is his second feature, Requiem for a Dream which features a similar intensity with an added emotional punch to the ribs. Whiplash is a film with that same kind of intensity. It's rare to find a film which grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits, but Whiplash manages to do more than that. It actually tightens the grip as the film goes on until you're just about choking by the end of it all!Whilst I don't think that Whiplash is quite the perfect masterpiece many people have made it out to be, there's no denying that it's an absolutely stellar and riveting film. It does for drumming, what Black Swan did for ballet. Imagine if Natalie Portman wanted to be the most perfect drummer in the world and Vincent Cassel was a shouty and overbearing bully pushing her way beyond the limits of human capacity and you have Whiplash.The film relies a lot on Damien Chazelle's exhilarating direction. He manages to bring scene after scene of gripping intensity which seems to build and build until the electrifying finale. He directs the drumming performances with lots of close-ups and quick cuts which end up leaving you feeling completely exhausted. On top of that you've got JK Simmons shouting at the top of his lungs at the students and wearing them out until they physically bleed. There's a scene early on where he picks on someone who's out of tune and it almost made me want to cry like the poor kid he was picking on.JK totally earned his Oscar here. It's a frightening and wildly intimidating performance full of passion and force. His presence fills every scene he's in and dares you not to take your eyes off of him. Miles Teller, who plays the protagonist drummer boy, is also very good in the role. He manages to be very convincing and you can't help but root for him to do well. He has an infectious passion for the drums and an admirable ambition. Although, if I was in his shoes I'd kick the drums into touch and take that girl and run!The idea of watching a film about an ambitious drummer trying to make it in a jazz band isn't an appealing one. It's down to Damien's superb directing and writing skills which make it utterly compelling. It's also incredibly unpredictable. There are so many twists and turns in the final 20 minutes that you have no idea how it's going to end. I also quite liked how it ended fairly ambiguously. The final scene is truly extraordinary to watch and extremely similar to Black Swan's final scene. It's so intense that it has your fingernails digging into the person you're sitting next to and your heart thumping like a steam train.There are a couple of problems which stop it from being perfect. I thought that the plot lacked more focus which could've added to the intensity of it all. In Black Swan we're made very aware of the days passing to the final performance and so when it arrives we feel almost as nervous as Nina! With Whiplash, it wasn't made clear as to what the jazz band were working towards half the time. At one point I didn't even realise that they were performing in front of an audience! There also felt like a lack of character development. However, ultimately these problems don't detract from the overwhelming experience the film offers.Whiplash is a masterful little film. Made for only one million dollars and shot in less than 30 days, Damien Chazelle has showed the world that he possesses an undeniable talent for filmmaking. It's a sensational debut and I defy anyone not to come out by the end of it feeling exhausted. It may not be everyone's idea of entertainment, but for those who are into dark, psychological and intense films then Whiplash is the film to see. I really look forward to going through it all again.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta say, i was expecting things from this movie and as i thought so they were way beyond my expectations, this movie has no words to explain the one of a kind experience it gives you. All music lovers have to watch this movie, a real journey into the amazing world of complex music. J.K. Simmons plays an amazing acting in this movie, as well as Miles Teller. J.K Simmons character really makes the audience, at least for me, feel the passion that music can give you. Hopefully everyone feels the way i did, and experience this unique journey into the world of jazz. 10/10, the soundtrack, the acting, everything that makes this movie a real special one. Thanks for reading my review, hope you enjoy this amazing movie. Almost forgot there's a short before this movie with same name, filmed in 2013, the director took it to the sundance festival after that he was able to make this one with a bigger budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably waited too long to see 2014's Whiplash. In fact, I have already comprised my list of top ten picks for said year. Regardless, if I had to revise things (which is something I don't normally do), this small yet loud Sony Pictures release would be right up at the top. I mean what a tantalizing title for a flick and even a cooler title for one about jazz drumming. One minute you're tapping your feet to its infectious groove. The next minute you are wincing and cringing at its mean spiritedness. Ultimately, Whiplash is powerful and heartbreaking. It's a cold sweat of movie, a real rat-a-tat-tat.The storytelling starts out a little slow only to pick up mega speed. Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller) is a 19-year old student at the prestigious Shaffer conservatory (in New York City). He plays the drums and is ambitious as anyone who has ever walked through its doors. He wants to be one of the great musicians of the 21st century with Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker being his full blown idols. He's also fixated on just playing percussion and nothing else. Finally, he doesn't need friends, a girlfriend, or any type of support system in his life to get the job done. In his way however, is conductor Terrence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons, who riffs on a sort of bi-polar version of Lee Emery). He has a boot camp approach to getting his orchestra to play the type of perfected tempo he wants. A moody perfectionist, Fletcher berates everyone physically and mentally. He messes with their heads while pounding their fragile psyches into complete submission (there's a scene where he calls someone a worthless pansy ass, that's a new one). Basically, you fear him every time he enters a room. He is the main antagonist but I'd like to think of him more as a bandshell's version of Bill "The Butcher".That brings me to the ending of Whiplash which is one that I can't quite describe. It's high tail and it's completely exhausting. Just think of the band Led Zeppelin and its late drummer John Bonham doing the solo to "Moby Dick". That might just give you a clue.Anyway, kudos to the performances featured here. This is a total triumph for actors Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. It's in an arena like you've never seen them before. J.K.'s persona as a loving dad in Juno plus the softy who does those Farmers Insurance commercials, gone! Teller's dopey characterizations from his plethora of forgotten romcoms, gone! J.K.'s Fletcher is a total hard ass, a real Nazi. Teller's Neiman is cut off from the outside world but in the end, he's a mad cymbal junkie incarnate, a real godsend. Together they make beautiful magic as actors and musical czars. Listen, I know this is a vehicle about excelling in an East Coast conservatory, but both of these characters are seen more as sergeants and privates than anything else. This isn't your normal drama, it's Full Metal Drum Kit.Kudos also goes to the rousing level of film making for "Whip's" one hour and forty-seven minute running time. Director Damien Chazelle deals in a frenzy of close-ups whether it be the actor's faces, their bloodied hands, or just objects in general. He also provides Whiplash with a couple of whip/swish pans accompanied by the constant sounds of Jazz music (one of the oldest forms of popular music known to man). The film has a shadowy look, it's sullen. Watching every scene feels like you're in a wine bar or a darkly lit restaurant. And the editing which won a coveted Academy Award, is designed to put Neiman's character's romantic life and his relationship with his father (Jim Neiman played by Paul Reiser) off to the side. It then becomes strictly a two person character study, a mishmash of nurse Ratched and convict Randle McMurphy or Andy Dufresne and Warden Norton if you will. Whiplash's themed morality: Sometimes you need to go through hell to find success in what you do. It takes sweat and guts, hits and bruises to achieve greatness. The little people who lack ambition, are nice, and coddle you, matter very minimally in the grand scheme of things (yes I'm talking about Andrew's weak-minded father). Dare I say that this is the best movie of 2014. Whiplash has real "whip" appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to begin this review. I am so speechless with the intensity of this movie. The performance, the script, the direction. This movie had script of just 19 pages they say and trust me by the time you are done watching the movie, each word will be imprinted in your brain.J.K. Simmons (Fletcher) nails it. I am sure he will win the Oscars for best supporting actor. The ultimate teacher we all need in your life who can push our will, to push our limits. To make us do things which we might have given up on, if we were surrounded by people who think everyone needs to be talked goody goody to. That is the best concept of the movie. All we see around us today is people appreciating every little thing you do and making you feel you did it best. The truth is never told. Miles Teller(Andrew) has done amazing job of a 19 year old guy who got exactly what he deserved by meeting his mentor. A hard headed and ruthless teacher who knows where the potential lies and very well knows how to squeeze that one more drop out of you to make you a legend you always wanted to be.This movie will glue you to your seat and when it ends, you will have a feeling you haven't had while watching any other movie. This is a must watch for everyone !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Italy, despite its five Academy nomination, its widely acclaimed reception and the debate has provoked all around the world Whiplash has been showed in 25 cinemas. In ALL Italy. For only one week. No jokes. That's why I had to hurry up yesterday night and go to see it before they took it away.I think Whiplash is not exactly an innovation for cinema: there is a load of similar movies which have been made, about music competition, et cetera. But I think there are at least two point which are original for it and deserve a remarking. The first one is, naturally, the character of Terrence Fletcher. Modern projection of Hartman Sergeant in a conservatory, it provides the most inspiring occasions for the screenplay, and the most emotional (meaning both tears and laughs) moments. The other one is the direction approach to the music scenes. Such peculiarity is given by a claustrophobic editing and by inspiring close-cuts on details: sweat, ears, the drops of blood. It was an innovative way to make the audience feel the same feelings and fear the same fears than the musician.I have a new champion to cheer for at the Academy Awards!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss. http://kostenlosefilm.net/de/movie/244786/Whiplash-2014I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Look: 'Whiplash'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than "good job". A total pulse-pounding, adrenaline rush of a movie, 'Whiplash' beats the odds as the 2014 American drama nominated for five Academy Awards at the 87th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and (winning) Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor for J.K. Simmons. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, the film is based on his own experiences in the Princeton High School Studio Band, basing Simmons' threatening character in the film on his own band instructor but "pushed it further" adding in bits of Buddy Rich as well as other notorious band leaders. But does the rhythm of the film match its message of unleashing one's deepest realms of potential to its most extreme extent? Let's take a look.Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a first-year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Aspiring to become one of the greats like his idol Buddy Rich from playing the drums since he was young, cut-throat jazz instructor Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons in an intense Oscar-winning performance) accepts Andrew into his studio as the alternate for Carl, the core drummer. Fletcher is abusive towards his students, as his main priority it to push them, especially Andrew, beyond their best through perspiration blood and tears into the realm of excellence. He takes pride in the fact that Jo Jones threw a cymbal at the young Charlie Parker as Gunnery Sergent Hartman did in the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald learned to shoot in the Marines. Fletcher mocks his pupils and hurls insults as he displays both verbally and physically with a chair of which he throws across the room, nearly missing Andrew's head for not keeping tempo when the band rehearses the Hank Levy piece of the eponymous film title, humiliating him in front of the entire class. He wants to incessantly pound his vision of greatness into Miles as furiously as he in turn pounds his set. Beaten but not broken, Andrew is undeterred to impress Fletcher with everything he's got, practicing, pouring into and pounding his drum set until his instrument is coated in sweat and blood while oozing blisters tear up his hands. The ending of the film portrays Andrew onstage in a festival concert with Fletcher's band with an extravagant drum performance that culminates the picture, almost leaving us breathless but satisfied as the inner Buddy Rich within has finally awoken from its sleep and torn itself away from hiding deep within the yearning soul of this former mediocre jazz musician now a dynamic drum soloist extraordinaire. We can only stand and cheer as the end credits roll.Anyone can be forgiven why Andrew does not just up and quit from not putting up with Fletcher's relentless verbal abuse and demanding perfectionism. However we can sense an invisible drive inside Andrew that ultimately pushes him to reject defeat, blot out Fletcher's rants and plunge headfirst into the daring and dangerous world of self-infliction by pounding the drum skins as if his very life were at stake; as if Fletcher were watching his every beat as a hungry predator would a small animal, looking for a chance to chew him up and spit out his bones at any given moment with one false note or tempo. Astounding, electrifying, unnerving and exhilarating, the heart will indeed pound with every drum beat struck and every bead of sweat and blood that falls in slow-motion. Here, the worlds of 'Fame' and 'Full Metal Jacket' collide into a dark, daring and dizzying jazz jive that you're more certain than likely to need a defibrillator for when the last note is played and the screen turns black. Bold and brash, engaging and extreme, 'Whiplash' is a fiery and fierce jazz movie truly undaunted and unafraid in beating to its own drum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J.K. Simmons' finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How far would you push yourself in order to be the best at something? Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is willing to isolate himself from his loved ones and the rest of the world in order to be the finest drummer at Shafer Conservatory of Music. When he is hand-picked by the highly respected Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), Andrew has no idea how far Fletcher is willing to push him to get the results he wants. Teller as Andrew is an insecure, awkward college determined to do his best. He is inept at talking to the cute girl who runs the movie theater concession stand till he begins to gain confidence after joining Shafer's jazz orchestra. His drive to be the best drummer since Buddy Rich causes him to become an increasingly isolated individual who cuts off all who love him to meet Fletcher' demands and attempt to gain his approval. However there is no real character development by the writer-director or Teller as an actor, Teller stays primarily stagnant until the final ten to fifteen minutes of the film where Andrew has his grandiose drum solo.The cream of the film truly belongs to J.K. Simmons's unbalanced, cruel and profane Fletcher. Simmons is usually the more fatherly or counselor-type in most of his film and TV appearances, but that is appropriately missing from this film. Cussing out at anyone he pleases and working his students to exhaustion, Fletcher is never placated with what Andrew or anyone else gives him. Garnering his first Oscar nomination, Simmons will bring home the gold for certain. The music is primarily jazz which is appropriate for the band, practice and café scenes of the film, but is unnecessary for the rest of the film. Cinematography spends most of its time up above the cast members except for more intimate dialogue. The script is pretty solid, but could've done without the girlfriend for Teller's character as she has only ten minutes of screen-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you have a dream? A dream of becoming a great football player? A great musician? A great dancer?. Our protagonist has, a dream of becoming a drummer, perhaps the greatest of them all.He wants to be someone who will be remembered for the years to come.Maybe we are still fighting for our dream or maybe we have given up on our dream of achieving greatness.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.I lost myself in the story and I believe you will too.It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. J.K Simmons and Miles Teller delivered the best performance of their career.J.K Simmons is powerful in every frame of the movie. Maybe it's his character.Some may find this movie boring and overrated. For some it will push them to pick up the guitar again, or maybe their dancing shoes or maybe go to the gym and bulk up, but there is one thing I can assure you that this movie will make you think about your life again,about getting your life together and WORK HARD.I believe he(Terence Fletcher) is right,people nowadays don't want to push themselves,we never want to cross our limits. All we want is to achieve immortality, without working for it.Doubtless, it is one of the most powerful film of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb horror-drama and the year's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few might expect an indie drama about a dysfunctional mentor-student relationship about jazz-drum can be such a thrilling adrenaline drive, WHIPLASH, which not only proudly joins the elite top 8 in the upcoming Oscar BEST PICTURE nominees, but is also counted as a major contender in for a harvest (with J.K. Simmons indisputably has BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR in his bag). It is also hard to imagine this is only young director Damien Chazelle's second feature, after his less-seen debut GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH (2009), WHIPLASH is such a full-grown piece of gem, with the slithering camera movement, a plethora of intensive close-ups and snappy editing, a buzzy audio surrounding and the irresistible jazzy soundtrack, it engages us with a daunting study of the pursuit of being the greatest and a spellbinding and unblemished mental orgasm in its fierce solo-drum finale. Structurally the film is unsparing wrangle of dual dynamism between Andrew (Teller), a 19- year-old initiated into an eminent music school in New York and his instructor Terrence Fletcher (Simmons), whose method is unapologetically radical, he has a firm conviction that there is only one way to elicit a prodigy's true potential, which is through high-handed pressure and unyielding dismissal, "good work" is the most vicious remark to nip a prospective genius in the bud, as the jazz titan Charlie "Yardbird" Parker, if his tutor had not thrown a cymbal to him after a mediocre performance, he would not be the short-lived legend in the history of music (he died in the age of 34 and was a severe dug addict). Of course, his one-sided theory cannot convince all the audience, and the truth is, his famous Charlie Parker vignette is mistakenly conceived.However, Andrew is aspiring to become someone like Parker, he professes to prefer dying young but being one of the greatest to living a conventional life of longevity, so in some extent, they have a tacitly consensual sadomasochistic relation which they both need as a pivot, for Andrew, it is the external incentive he needs to push him to reach raw passion over pure skill, and more sinisterly is for Terrence, he is no way a selfless tutor, to find a talent like Andrew is the ultimate solution to fulfill his own recognition of his entire life, he does't have the potentiality, but he has the keen eyes to detect one, in the final act, Chazelle manifestly tears off Terrence's mask of sanctimony, lays bare the selfishly- motivated intention of retaliation, and the final twist is superlatively terrific, in one hand they both get what they want, but for viewers it is less uplifting than chilling to witness Andrew's transcendence, like in a horror fare, Andrew has to morphed into a monster in order to fight back another monster, if this is the only way to achieve the greatness, I will never second to that kind of atrocity, and greatness doesn't matter under this circumstance. Miles Teller is formidably stunning as Andrew, with extra credits given to his prowess as a supposedly talented drummer, fully shoulders on Andrew's rite-of-passage from a "squeaker" to a full-charged powerhouse, not just with Terrence, where he never flinch, but also in the scenes with others, in particular during the sparse screen-time with his new girlfriend Nicole (Benoist), Teller's bent as a camera-friendly leading material does outstrip his relatively bland looks, it is a huge shame that he is not in the talk of Oscar-race for this outstanding performance. Yet again, the MVP is Simmons, his Terrence is a more intelligent and malevolent update of R. Lee Ermey's Sergeant Hartman in Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET (1987, 9/10), like a kicking time-bomb we never know when he will explode, even in his kindest moments, he is spine-chilling to behold from the protection of a screen, makes viewers wonder how can those survive in his studio band or even co-exist in the same place, that is the charisma of such a powerful portrayal, no praise is overstated. Finally, this film jumps to my current No. 1 of 2014, and good luck in the Oscars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is an astounding and intense story at the heart of "Whiplash"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teachers in films can be placed into two categories. On the one hand, you have your John Keatings (from Peter Weir's "Dead Poets Society"), who are kind, think-outside-the-box teachers who unlock parts of their students minds and inspire them to want to do better. On the other hand, you have your Terence Fletchers, who is played here by J.K. Simmons, who are feared by their students and use this to get the results they're after. You could write whole essays on which teaching method is more effective, but right now the focus is on Fletcher, the monster who attempts to make Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) a greater drummer. This is the astounding and intense story at the heart of "Whiplash".You can tell within the opening minutes of the film that Neiman is not cool. He doesn't have many friends, and he lives for jazz and playing the drums. We open with him alone in a practice room, playing and trying to get better. This is when he has his first encounter with Fletcher, who is brash and cold. He makes no attempt to be friendly, he merely sees what he wants and leaves. Over the course of the film, Neiman is invited into Fletcher's high- profile jazz band, where he is the victim of verbal abuse, psychological torment, and ends up with an intense drive to impress. If anything, he wants to impress too much, and reacts badly to Fletcher taking away the things that he's given him. 90% of the film is one long psychological trick on Fletcher's part, slowly turning Neiman insane. What makes the film so inspiring is that for the last 10%, Neiman takes his sanity back.There are three elements at the heart of the film that make it so incredibly watchable and gripping. Firstly, the film is clean, classy and shot incredibly well. It has the colour scheme of a "jazz" film, and some of the camera work, such as the flicking between drummer and conductor or instrument close-ups, is inspired. Next, the music is crisp and catchy, with so much toe-tapping throughout. The parts of the score that aren't played on screen are just as good, all fitting in with the styling of the film.But the most important element is made up of the two key performances at the centre of the movie - J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller are nothing but astounding in the film. In Teller's acting, you can see a real determination and desire to succeed. He brings across the awkwardness and lack of cool that the character has so well, and also his drum playing is pretty good. But it is Simmons who truly steals the show - Terence Fletcher is a terrifying, brutish, foul monster for the majority of the film, and simply would not be believable if he wasn't acted so well. The cursing and violence feels spontaneous, the coldness in his character seems to be so true, but I think it is the occasional signs of humanity (such as the discovery of a former pupil's death), which cement the character. He's not just a monster, he's another human who's been taken over by an internal drive. As much as Neiman's goal is to be one of the great drummers, Fletcher's goal is to cultivate one of the great musicians, something he believes he can only do through verbal abuse. His message is that "Good job" is never going to make anyone great, and he argues it so well that you do leave the film believing that.It's possible to have read everything I've written so far and feel that "Whiplash" is going to be a tough 2 hour pain-fest, but it's anything but. It's quite funny in parts, due to the absurdity of many of Fletcher's comments, and you can't help but leave it inspired. As for its place in this year's Oscar race, it utterly deserves its place among the other "Best Film" nominees, and there is no doubt in my mind that it's one of the top contenders for that award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poses a difficult philosophical question about the lengths one should go in the pursuit of molding talent into greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is a tight, thoughtful and exhilarating film based on director Damien Chazelle's 2013 short film of the same name. It's the sort of movie that sucks the air out of the cinema, not allowing its audience's mind to wander for an instant, demanding their utmost and constant attention. This is partly down to a devastatingly intense performance from JK Simmons as well as the power of Chazell's story and the careful unwinding of the idea at the center of its plot. One of the more riveting and refreshing aspects of Whiplash is it does not offer us a definitive conclusion in its ending but instead poses a difficult philosophical question about the lengths one should go in the pursuit of molding talent into greatness. Miles Teller plays Andrew, a talented jazz drummer in his first year at a prestigious music conservatory. Miles' talent is swiftly recognized by Fletcher (JK Simmons), a renowned and eccentric band leader. Fletcher's philosophy is that raw talent must be bullied, abused, threatened, and embarrassed or it will never feel the need to prove it's self on an obsessive level and subsequently prosper into true, true greatness. 'There are no two words in the English language more harmful then 'well done', he warns at one point.In Miles, Fletcher finds a drummer matching his heightened level of obsessive fervor, a young man already lacking in a male role model who is desperate for his approval despite his treatment at Fletcher's hands. Miles' own Father (Paul Reiser) is everything Fletcher is not, happy and loving, positive and genuinely supportive. He's only looking out for his Son and his Son's best interests yet Miles is far more interested in gaining the approval of Fletcher, as his Father lacks his Sons passion and seriousness. The interesting thing is, as an audience we fully understand Miles' view.Indeed Miles' Father may just be the only likable character in the film. Miles himself is obnoxious and arrogant in equal measure, dismissing the little successes of relatives against his own, breaking up with his girlfriend because she doesn't have it all quite as figured out as he does. Simmons is something else entirely. An utter obsessive and a bully, his performance is as excellent as it is hilarious. It's a strange human trait how inherently funny we find poetic verbal abuse once we're not on its receiving end. The script is tightly wound and although the plot is conventional enough so that we feel some turns in the plot before we take them, the story is such an engrossing one and the performances so excellent that it doesn't deter.For all the many ways we find Fletcher's character grotesque and heinous, in the end his contention is flawless. His actions lead to Andrew reaching a level of potential that he likely would have fallen short of without Fletcher's methods. His methods of coarse are unacceptable, but Whiplash joy is that it asks the audience the question of whether, in the end, the bad guy was right all along.</fullReview>

This movie had me at the very first scene of JK Simmons, he literally threatened me by his acting. Miles Teller, I can see how much effort he had put to become Neiman. The Movie started and ended with the same tempo. There is literally not a single flaw I can find in this movie. I've watched this movie like three days back while writing this review, still cant get over it. Personally, watching this movie was one of the best thing happened in my life.

I would watch it again and I normally don't watch movies more than once in the cinema. So exciting.If J.K. Simmons doesn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor next Sunday, I'll think the world's gone mad. I have to say that this movie is under-hyped, which is always refreshing. Literally, my favourite movie of the year.It also helped that the type of people that go to watch this kind of movie are mature adults that don't keep talking throughout the movie. Such a great experience and left me feeling buzzed and energized at the end of the movie - even in the mood to dance to some Jazz music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never thought that a casual browsing through a film, could turn out to be much more - storming, nerve- shattering, reminiscing horrors of the past, lift above them, and then becoming someone stronger than imaginable."Music was never so violent and war-like before"; and in the film, once the performances began the depiction was so hypnotic and fiercely staged with the apparently plain story-line of an aspiring drummer under the training of a bipolar-of-sorts aggressive conductor, that events turn out to be supernova-like - a blast, annihilation, whirlpool of debris, forming, convolution and then evolution. Nothing less than "rise of a phoenix from its ashes"!One of the most intense and emotionally-charging films that I've come across in recent times. Outstanding!!! Miles Teller&#x200b; is gradually coming in the zone of my favourite actors, and J. K. Simmons&#x200b; has given a formidably distinct signature-role in his name now, and that too with panache. An easy 8.5/10. Watch it, to believe it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film with lot to teach: never give up, pursue your dream, no matter what. Damien Chazelle, young and talented, becomes part of the history of cinema with this thrilling, exciting masterpiece. The constant drumming that stays with us for almost the entire film is amazing. There are many good film at the Oscar this year, but this is one of the few that moved me: at some point, I started crying and I couldn't stop and that doesn't happen to me very often. Miles Teller is surprisingly good, actually he is fantastic and this is his best performance so far. J.K. Simmons delivers a flawless and astonishing performance, which got him a Golden Globe for best supporting actor, and an Oscar nomination, which surely will turn into a win.</fullReview>

This story is mingled with the drum thing and jazz thing to get a fabulous performance from both the lead actors and when it ended, I just thought may be some more?!One of the best movies of 2014 for sure.

		<fullReview>I am not one for Drama films such as Whiplash, however this caught my attention. After watching the movie, i truly realized what i could have missed to be an astounding film, a unique film that comes by once in a while. Whiplash revolves around Andrew, who's passion for drumming in jazz has no ending; whilst his mentor continues to push him over limits of what is expected. Chazelle never fails to surprise me through out the movie. For such a unique film surrounding music as it's main core; ask anybody who watched and they will agree the extent of how intense it is - leaving us all on the edge of our seat. There were no explosions or guns or action to keep it interesting, just music. This is what makes it appeal so much to me, that feeling you will have to experience for yourself.The movie includes great music and a lot of ambition towards portraying characters; exceptionally acted out by J.K Simmons and Miles Teller. It is filled with important messages i think are terrific to reflect upon. I am looking forwards to more of Chazelle's work in the future. Now i can finally understand, a film like this one deserves getting an Oscar along its path.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely hyped for this film ever since I heard about it. I heard about it and thought "This is gonna be an Oscar caliber film", Well was I ever more right. This was the most powerful and riveting film I've seen in awhile and I loved it from beginning to end. I have been wanting to see Miles Teller give charged dramatic performance ever since I saw him in 21 and Over because he looked like he had that raw emotional energy. J.K Simmons kills it in this movie and he is absolutely going to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Simmons gives the performance of a life time and he is so powerful and he convinces you he'll push any body to their limits and beyond. The script is fantastic and powerful, Damien Chazelle is just a great young director and he knows how to capture intense powerful moments and he does so with this masterpiece. Acting is prime in this film and it's a Best Picture nomination for sure and Simmons will getting his Oscar February 22nd, 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of the Year (Raging Film Reviews)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not play any musical instruments, nor can I read music, nor can I do anything generally musical that isn't playing Hot Cross Buns on a recorder. Because of this fact I am incredibly relieved after spending almost two hours on the edge of my seat in anxious splendor as I watched a young, up-and-coming drummer get verbally abused by a brutal instructor. I am talking, of course, about Whiplash, and it is one of the best and most anxiety-inducing movies you have probably never heard of.Andrew wants to be great. He does not have any friends aside from his dad who he goes to see movies with; he instead spends most of his time in the practice room at his music conservatory perfecting his talent. He lives, breathes, and dreams of drumming. Whenever he isn't drumming, he is thinking of drumming; it's all he has. When the most well- known instructor in the conservatory takes notice, he finds himself under the mentorship of a tyrannical monster.Miles Teller is certainly a star on the rise. He gives such a heartbreaking and powerful performance in his strive for greatness but can never quite achieve it. He bleeds and pours sweat for his talent, ending up with blisters on his fingers and blood on the drums. We see him spiral downward throughout the film and it is horrifying. We get anxious whenever he is on the drums because if he messes up it is almost the equivalent to him pulling the wrong wire on a bomb that would destroy everything he loves and in this case it is drumming?without it he has nothing. It is so intense that the time he spends not drumming is a much needed relief. There are times we just want to shout for him to stop, that it's not worth it, but he keeps going. How far is too far for perfection? The movie hangs that question in front of you the entire time, but Andrew is oblivious to it. Is there a line that is crossed at some point? Or is there no limit to what someone should do to be perfect? It is a searing and penetrative question that will stick with you after the credits roll.The blood and sweat that Andrew pours is all for one man, Fletcher, played absolutely brilliantly by J.K. Simmons. He is the definition of a perfectionist, in fact he demands more than perfection. He wants so much out of his students that they leave the studio in tears and emotionally distressed. He throws expletives ?and chairs?at his students in such a way that he might even be considered the best movie "villain" of the year. Simmons shatters all images of his lovable father-figure in Juno, and puts to shame his already intense attitude in Spiderman. It is the role of a lifetime, and never have we hated him more for it, but he is just so damn good and electrifying. Seldom do we see beneath his harsh and demeaning persona, and even when we do we are quickly reminded that he is the cruelest character to appear on screen this year.From the foot-tapping score, to the kinetic and stylish editing, to comedic (though very dark) script, Whiplash will build you up and throw you back down hard. When the music is playing without interruptions we are relieved. When it stops, it can either mean that they are done for the day or, worse, that Terrence is going to hurl a chair at someones face or verbally destroy a musician to the point of tears. The editing keeps all the tense elements together. When we cut to shots of Andrew playing we have a momentary shock that he might slip or drop his sticks. It makes for a very enjoyable movie, but at times is almost takes away from the tension and makes you think you are seeing a light-hearted movie about a jazz band. The humor though, arises when you least expect it. It is, perhaps, our cathartic response to the terror that Fletcher puts Andrew through. We want to laugh to make ourselves feel better, we want to laugh because it might make it less horrible, but for as long at the movie goes, it does not get better.Whiplash is not an easy movie to watch; it will make you more anxious than just about any movie this year; it will make you fearful of a mistake and exuberantly happy when Andrew does a good job; and it will probably make you never want to pick up any sort of musical instrument ever again. With tour de force performances from two excellent actors who gave it their all for their roles, Whiplash is an amazing and devastating movie that questions what it means to be perfect and how far someone will go to be just that. If Whiplash is playing in a theater near you, go see it. Just be warned, you may have a panic-attack.for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought a film could capture me in such an emotional grasp more than Gravity did. I always tell myself that a film is great when it indulges me so much that I stop critiquing it in my head while watching. As a film student I often have the problem of always spotting the mistakes and focusing on camera angles and character development. But with Whiplash, I couldn't stay off the edge of my seat. I was enthralled by this film. Of course in the first few minutes of it I immediately started criticizing and tried to spot mistakes. Of course a few continuity here and there, but I was first blown away by the tiny details of character development. Little things like how Nicole's straw was chewed and bent compared to Andrew's on their first date. Another brilliant thing was the editing and the choice of shots. Bravo to the DP....the many many cuts to closeups of instruments and people's faces and specific objects. It was a new style of editing that I really enjoyed and was quite genius given that all of those random close-up shots were what the main character was focusing on. The first I noticed was at the very beginning when Andrew went to the concessions and we see your typical medium shot, wide shot, medium shot of his conversation with Nicole, but then we go to a closeup of her face, looking at him. That was very specific and it was what Andrew was focusing on, and later dwells on (leading to him asking her out). And also with the various closeups on all the instruments that he was performing with. The closeups they showed were what he was paying attention to specifically while drumming. I just really enjoyed the style of editing and the shot choices. Like I said, many things about this film was brilliant. Great film and deserves all of its wins and more. Bravo cast and crew!</fullReview>

It won't surprise me if he takes home an Oscar for his performance. The music is great as well, if you like jazz. The movie builds up to a climax and it delivers. The final scene of this movie is the best ending I've seen in a long time. Most of the times movies don't live up to your expectations.

		<fullReview>*** this review might contain spoilers *** Been reading IMDb since almost its inception and this is the first time I've been moved to write a review.The movie is phenomenal. It's grown in strength in the few days since I've seen it and all I want to do is see it again. Especially powerful if you're a musician or if you've ever embarked on any endeavor that's required years of practice to achieve excellence.Some have remarked that it's not realistic and the behavior of the teacher would never be tolerated and that some of the plot is over the top. Probably true, but you know, it's a MOVIE. It's trying to tell a story. It's not a documentary.The two leads are pitch perfect. Oscar nominations all around. I predict many for the movie as a whole.What holds the movie together is JK Simmons' character and the control he has over the lives of his students. From the moment we first see him we understand that he's some kind of monster. There's something unsettling about him from the beginning and it never lets up. In fact it just builds and builds. There seems to be no limit to how far he will go to get what he wants. And Simmons just plays it perfectly. One of the scariest characters in a long time. The performance will stay with you. I can still see that fist clench in the air, demanding, silently but unquestionably, for everything to STOP! NOW!And the ending. Oh, the ending. Can't give it away, but lord, what an ending. Musically it's fantastic, but the way the power shifts back and forth is just amazing. It's like a little movie all by itself.I don't mean to give Miles Teller short thrift. He also does a great job. He seems to be a drummer himself because all of the drumming seems perfectly realistic. He reminds me of a young John Cusack.As they say, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash ? Captivating reach for perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full Review:Andrew (Miles Teller) is a young and talented drummer enrolled in one of the best music colleges. He is mentored by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an absolute perfectionist who believes there is no line that can be crossed when trying to bring out the greatness in a student. The film follows Andrew as he is consumed and abused by Fletcher to the absolute limits, hoping to be one of the greats. Whiplash is a psychological battle between individuals that is tense at every palm sweating second of the movie. You will be completely captivated by the riveting performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, who show an acting side that we have never seen from them. This is not an easy movie to watch for some disturbing decisions made by the characters, but it is oh so rewarding to experience!Quickie Review:For me, Miles Teller for a long time was just some comedy actor. After watching another movie of his The Spectacular Now, I saw a potential in him to be more than that. So that is the reason I wanted to see Whiplash, but he simply blew me away more than I had expected. Equally J.K. Simmons' character is still haunting me after watching the movie.The most enticing and attention grabbing moments were when Andrew and Fletcher were in a scene together. It is a constant back-and- forth head butting of tolerance for each other. Andrew can be disobedient towards his mentor, and meanwhile Fletcher would be physically and verbally abusive. Seeing how they react to certain situations sometimes made my jaw drop and leave me speechless. There were moments where I'd repeatedly think "why, WHY? Why is he doing this?" as if they are real people. I know they are just some characters on a screen but because of the strong on-screen chemistry (as stressful as it was), I felt compelled to react.This brings me to the stellar acting by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, without whom Whiplash wouldn't be the gem that it is. I loved seeing the absolute dedication Teller showed through his character. So much so that in some scenes Teller is in actual physical pain that his character would be experiencing. Watching the drive for greatness destroy his other aspects of life and life itself felt very real and palpable. Many of you might know Simmons for playing J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-man movies, take that character make him more short-tempered, get rid of the lovable quality, and un-censor everything that comes out of his mouth, that's Fletcher (scary I know). One quote from the movie perfectly sums him up, Fletcher says "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'" It can't be any clearer how much he despises anything less than perfect. Well Simmons, if I were to ever meet you, I'd say you were perfect.This is yet another movie that is not widely released on every major screen. I had to go out of my way to see it in another city. But I have to stress, because of the exceptional acting talent Whiplash is worth going out of your way to experience.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

It's a movie that keep it's simple plot but use it in very subtle way to avoid the cliché and repetitive.Not only that Whiplash is a movie that i have so much fun , with it's intense scene between Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons characters makes this movie an explosive fun to watch.Also i have to say that i'm kind of a surprise the performance by Miles Teller last time i saw him on screen is in Divergent movie which he's not memorable at all but in this movie he's doing really good job and prove himself a bit too .BUT the real star of this movie is J.K. Simmons his performance is so amazing and stunning all the time he just control the movie in his own hand and i will be surprise if his name is not in a contender list in Oscar this year.In the end Whiplash is a Blast to watch with it's subtle script , explosive fun scene between Miles Teller and J.K Simmons and a amazing performance by J.K. Simmons makes this movie on the top of the list this year instantly and it's a movie that teach us , the dream is not something you can just try and get it you will have to try more harder and more harder even if it makes you bleed you still have to try more harder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Drumline" for White People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiplash" is a DRAMA (not comedy) about a drum student, Andrew (Miles Teller) who attends a prestigious music conservatory with dreams of becoming "one of the greats" in the world of jazz percussion. His talent and sheer desire lands him in the class of the most notable jazz instructor on campus, Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons); an emotionally and (at times) physically abusive man who militaristically and controversially pushes his students past their limits, in his quest to stop at nothing to find the next great jazz musician.This is a film which is either a lesson in how not to be content with mediocrity, or an examination of an abusive relationship. Whatever it is, experiencing the journey Andrew takes throughout as he decides whether to travel down a path which may lead to fame and isolation or the path which leads to a normal life, but away from his obsession, is fascinating.Writer/director Damien Chazelle's directorial style here seems to be one of simply laying down the tracks (or keeping the camera rolling) so as not to derail his two converging leads (Simmons and Teller). And in a movie which is so performance driven, this is all I could've asked from a director; to get the hell out of the way and let these powerhouses do their thing. But if I had to pay Chazelle a single individual compliment (other than the perfect use of heavily technical lingo throughout, while still keeping everything understandable for those not as familiar with reading music or tempo) it would have to be for his superb construction of the final ten minutes of "Whiplash", which includes the choice to hold on that final sequence (apologies for being so vague) and allow it to reach its natural conclusion.The one issue I had with this movie actually stems from J.K. Simmons' larger than life/scene-chewing performance, which while attention grabbing, at many points distracted from the film's dramatic element. In truth, this aspect may be the fault of Chazelle's script, which has Simmons spewing the most degrading and comically mean spirited lines of dialogue. The problem with that is: I didn't know if his character was meant to be intimidating or just comically mean, since the instances when he is berating these young students, making them play drums to the point of exhaustion, made me want to laugh, simply on the basis of his verbiage. The act of watching someone struggle and suffer while someone spews funny one-liners, just doesn't quite work. On the other hand, for some, his performance may only add to the adrenaline dump of this movie.Final Thought: A lot of Oscar buzz will be focused on Simmons' performance. It will draw comparisons to R. Lee Ermey in "Full Metal Jacket". But forget all of that! The real star of the show is Miles Teller, who gives an electrifyingly exhausting performance, both emotionally and physically. One year ago he was in a movie called "The Spectacular Now", and gave a performance which began his ascension into the stratosphere of young actors everybody should keep an eye on. "Whiplash" sees Teller at his apex. He not only deserves an Award nomination, but also the career Shia LaBouf would have had if he'd not A-holed it all away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Film this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have seen all year. It's a perfect story. I don't know if it just struck a chord with me, or if it is that great of a movie for everyone. This young kid is cocky and driven and believes he will be one of the greats. Some of his decisions come back to haunt him when his career takes a nosedive.The teacher, played by J.K. Simmons, does an incredible job. You have to get past the fact that he looks a lot like a Dr. Seuss turtle with his bald head and slithery neck but his abuse of his students is so creative and delightful its easy to giggle at. Even if you just check out the trailer for some of the insults, I think you will enjoy them. I like that his primary mission is to evoke greatness from his students which makes his abuse almost forgivable. You would never get to the greatness at the end without his emotional pestering and pushing. These musicians would remain forever mediocre.This movie had heart and passion and I was lost in its story. I was surprised at how much it hit me. It was a great lesson in not taking talent for granted and not getting complacent in any areas of life. Life is a fight and the harder you fight for yourself in your talent and your passion, the more life pays you back. I highly recommend seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunningly awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gob smacked at the praise this terrible film has received. Within the first few minutes I realised it was phony nonsense. The writing strikes me as very weak. It is not based on reality at all. I teach artists and I am well aware that psychotic, cruel bullying will destroy any talent a developing artist has, not foster it. I'm amazed anyone thinks otherwise.How fascinating that so many people enjoyed this sado-masochistic film. Is it the cruelty people enjoy, I wonder? I just found it silly. When I saw that the actor playing the teacher had won an Oscar for it I felt as though I had entered some surreal altered reality. I do not wish to be negative about anyone's work but this is not a strong piece of acting; he seemed to be playing a screaming drill sergeant in a second-rate war film. Mind you, who can blame the poor guy? The script didn't make sense so he did not have much to work with. I'm sorry to say there was not much musicianship in evidence in this film either. There's a lot more to drumming than speed and force.I have never written an online review before - I have never felt the need. But the strange success of this misguided piece of unpleasantness compels me.It's not the film that shocks me; lots of bad, unbelievable films are made. It's its popularity. Bizarre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J.K. Simmons deserved his Oscar for his performance in Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. She was perhaps puzzled by many scenes especially the ending. She certainly wasn't in love with J.K. Simmons' pretty sadistic music teacher character. Simmons' Oscar-winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence-according to him-he wants to get from them. His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died-which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way-does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him. And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness. I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father. The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there. So on that note, I highly recommend Whiplash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash (2014): Dir: Damien Chazelle / Cast: Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell: Riveting and powerful drama about emotional turmoil. It stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman, a promising young drummer who is accepted at Shaffer Conservatory only to be confronted with the reality that his professor is a master manipulator. J.K. Simmons becomes the greatest factor in this film playing Terence Fletcher who conducts the band with ruthless strict discipline. This becomes a back and forth battle of wits as Neiman, frustrated and determined, drums until his hands bleed. Fletcher draws him in with promise and hopes before cutting lose with insults and profanities that draws tears from the students. Director Damien Chazelle presents a screenplay detailed with hard hitting music measured to extreme perfection by students aiming to succeed before their sanity caves. Teller draws off the anguish of somebody constantly hitting bottom despite playing the hardest. J.K. Simmons plays a talented yet sadistic conductor whose methods draw controversy. The climax battle of wills is a masterpiece of push and shove. In supporting roles is Paul Reiser as Neiman's supportive father who shares movie night with his son as well as find legal support when things really heat up. Melissa Benoist plays a girl who works at the theatre whom Neiman strikes up the nerve to ask out until his music becomes too important. There is also two other drummers who endure the heinous emotional torture issued by Fletcher. The road to fame can be a trying one that arrives at the cost of one's emotional endurance. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen some bangers in my time but wow, now this is a banger! My favourite movie of 2014 by far. Whiplash was directed by Damien Chazelle who could poss by my new fave director just because of this absolute ripper of a film. Miles Teller plays a totes cute aspiring jazz drummer who wants to be one of the greats. His drive to be the best he can be is defs inspiring and so much that even non musos such as yourselves could appreciate it. Pushed by J.K Simmons, who plays a big meanie of an instructor, Teller's character experiences the highs and lows of what it takes to become a professional musician. 8/10 for Teller, 10/10 for Simmons, 9/10 bangers in the form of musical banter. Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above and beyond my expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was commenting the other day that I haven't seen a great movie in quite a while. Please don't think I'm some kind of film snob because that couldn't be further from the truth. In my opinion, as long as a film entertains it has done its job. However it's been a long time since I've finished a film with a little voice inside my head whispering "Bravo" as the credits rolled. This is that film. I will admit that I am positively biased toward this film because I am a drummer myself, but I think anyone with an interest in music or cinematography will enjoy this one. JK Simmons really brings it in his role as the borderline psychotic instructor pushing his students to their limit and beyond. But the star of this film is the relatively unknown, Miles Teller. From the moment he hits those drums it's obvious the actor has been a drummer for quite some time in real life. Remember everyone fawning over Jamie Fox because he knew how to play some piano notes in his role as Ray Charles in "Ray"? Well, take that talent and multiply it by 100. Miles Teller skillfully works his musical talent along side his acting talent to portray the timid yet talented 19- year old Shaffer Conservatory college student with dreams of becoming a legend. Does his notorious yet respected Jazz instructor help lead him to greatness or will he buckle under the pressure? You'll have to watch this movie to find out which I HIGHLY recommend you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a very great movie, one of the biggest, if I can say, of what will 2015. MY favorite part was obviously when Fletcher supposedly says to Andrew the two words that he says that should never be said to anyone, "Good Job". But, there are another scenes that dislikes my point of view of this movie, that's why I rated with a 9. Almost at the beginning the movie started to bore me, but it was far where Fletcher appeared that captivated me. I must say that I hate Fletcher throughout the movie, because of his arrogant, insulting and ruthless personality. Milles Teller acts so good, and his paper on this movie was crucial. His way of thinking how to play, and to overcome with the drums were priceless. Definitely, this is one of the best instrument movies I'd ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic but worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been both a musician and a music teacher, and this movie is unrealistic in so many ways. No "prestigious" music school would allow the bullying, profane monster portrayed by J.K. Simmons to have access to its students. No drummer's hands bleed in the manner portrayed by Miles Teller's character (maybe a blister or two might pop before he develops callouses--drummers should speak to this). The movie is almost unbearably slow at times besides.However, it is worth seeing if you like jazz--although most of the music is not modern jazz at all but more from the big-band era--and if you like good acting. Both J.K. Simmons--who won the Oscar for his portrayal--and Miles Teller do a phenomenal job of acting out their parts in this wildly unrealistic drama of a driven young musician's descent into near madness caused by a sadistic "instructor." The movie Shine with Geoffrey Rush was in a similar vein but was done much more realistically and with a painful type of beauty.J.K. Simmons absolutely deserved the win for his portrayal, but anyone who would rush to see this movie should go in with eyes wide open and a shot of caffeine to stay awake.</fullReview>

Other then comic con one (not that i do not like them) but there are too many of them.

		<shortDescription>The greatest musical film ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow-e! What can I say? The only thing I've thought about since I sat down and watched Whiplash is Whiplash. The combined mastery of Miles Teller (Andrew) and JK Simmons (Terrence Fletcher) creates a moving story, all revolving around the idea of ambition and resilience toward music and success. Oh, and don't forget those little elements like sound editing, sound mixing, cinematography and camera editing which were all done to outstanding effect and when incorporated together produced masterclass visuals. As exceptional as Miles and JK were, the story line of this ace flick was beyond what anyone could foretell and certainly blew me right out of my seat(that is if you had no idea what Whiplash was about, and in this case that's me). A young teen drummer accepted into a prestigious music school in New York City, spurned on by a hard, no nonsense teacher who won't take no as an answer and doesn't settle for anything less than perfect, or else, a chair will be thrown at your head. (literally). Andrew experiences lows and highs during his time with Fletcher and struggles to keep a consistent high level of drumming. Through blood, sweat and tears(again, literally) Andrew quickly learns that the industry is heavily competitive and one mistake can upend all of his hopes and dreams. He realizes that to succeed under the discrimination of this demon of a man he must maintain his ambition, drive and resilience no matter how much pain or hurt he feels. And boy does it pay off in that final scene when he receives that priceless smile from Fletcher after he sabotages his orchestra performance to take on his own drum solo and absolutely nail it. That is how the movie ends. And we presume, due to circumstances we witness on stage, he becomes recognized by important audience members who are looking for jazz drummers in illustrious orchestras. From the dumps and delight of Andrew's time with Fletcher, we see a eloquent story unfold before us and we feel the pain and pleasure Andrew goes through every step of the way which is what makes this such an effective and compelling film. Easily the greatest musical film ever made, a solid 9.5/10. I highly recommend you give this one a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent harmony of visual and audio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash, as the name suggests, packs a serious punch. There hasn't been a musical movie, or any movie for that matter, that gives such intense human relationship. The film brings a rich drama performed by engaging actors, it is crude in its nature but also possesses classy rhythm. Its mix of true to live cinematography and brilliantly pace musical score is edited so well, audience can't help to be drawn to its excellent tension.Andrew Nieman (Milles Teller) is a drummer and student in one of the best music schools. He's recruited by Terrence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a well-known teacher who's searching for a new musician to join his band. Nieman is a very dedicated young man, he strives to win Fletcher's approval but little did he know that Fletcher's method of teaching is rather unorthodox. The way Fletcher motivates his students is with a lot of profanities, overly honest assessment and borderline abusive behavior. Lots of stick with barely any carrot.The two are embroiled in an odd relationship, and both leads perform magnificently. Milles Teller represents the youthful ambitious character with hidden aggressive poise. Whereas Simmons as Fletcher is brilliantly antagonistic, he's a mentor but often time he resembles a manipulative enemy. From his body language and yell Simmons is too convincing, it could be unnerving at times, in the best possible way. If he had the opportunity like this in old Spider-Man movies as he portrayed the pushy editor, they would have been truly amazing.Camera-work captures the flow meticulously and mostly in close-up, it often pans back or slowly approaches the scene, allowing the audience to have a sense of the setting. However, when the music hits, it goes into high gears. Switching back and forth between the plowing of the drum, characters' subtle expressions or winces, down to the blood and sweat. The film's editing is wonderfully fitting, each frame is also accompanied by a spirited explosion of instruments. It's powerful, inevitably engrossingly.Whiplash is a monster of a movie, never skipping a beat. Rude, brash but stylishly captivating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always had this feeling that there could never be another movie as inspiring as 'Shawshank Redemption', ever in the history of motion picture production.But then, 'Whiplash' happened.It appears that this movie will always top my list of favorites.And here's why..The second best thing I loved in Spider-Man (2002), after Peter Parker of course, was J. Johan Jameson, played by J. K. Simmons.Having watched him previously only in Spider-Man, his transformation from a grumpy old 'editor-in-chief of Daily Bugle' to a hard-hearted, perfection seeking music conductor, literally blew my head off.And it didn't come to me as a surprise when he won the Academy Award for the Best Supporting Actor, Whiplash.Miles Teller equally complementing Simmons was a treat to watch.By the time the movie got over, I noticed my palms were sweaty and sweat pearls had gathered on my forehead! I am enthralled and awestruck having watched a masterpiece by Damien Chazelle and crew.This is one movie I'd love to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We have a squeaker today, class........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, and being the best at Shaffer means being under Terence Fletcher, and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school. Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, and quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best does not only mean playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. He creates an atmosphere of fear, but Andrew works hard to be the best, and to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. But how much emotional abuse is he willing to endure from Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by him.........To say that the last fifteen minutes of this will leave you breathless, is an understatement, and although its a typical cliché of many a critic, here that cliché is justifiable, and I'm sure you will agree with me after seeing this masterpiece.But what's funny is that it begins like any music school movie you may have come across in the past few years, and again, the introductions are your atypical high school movie fillers. Andrew is your man, the underdog, who doesn't have the accolades or the collateral like the other students, but Fisher sees something in him, but doesn't let him know.But then class begins, and the makers let Simmons loose, and if you think Ermey was harsh in Full Metal Jacket, try your time with Fisher, maybe the most poisonous teacher ever committed to celluloid, but hey, he's doing it all for the greater good.And that greater good is the medium of Jazz. Jazz is Fishers life, and its clear that he''ll be damned to let someone pass who is good, as stated by him several times, he wants the best, he wants the next Charlie Parker, someone who will give him that love of music, and much more.So the film asks the question, are his actions justifiable if he is so passionate about the music? He wants the music to be the best, and it appears that if you get a note wrong, its blasphemy in Fishers eyes.The film is monumental, so original and so fresh, it's been way too long since we have had something like this slap us round the face and take notice.Simmons will one hundred percent win best supporting actor at the Academy Awards, he is that good, a cross between the Grim Reaper, Drill Sergeant, and that teacher everyone hated at school, but at the same time, you empathise with him, it's his love, and it gives him pleasure as well as grief, as seen in the bar scene.When a film about music school can thrill, endear, shock, scare, and vex you, it's more than a film, it's an experience.A must see......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this - the first thing you should know is that this is a relatively 'small' movie. 3 million budget, young unknown director, casts the up-n-coming Miles Teller(brag and say I predicted his future success rt after watching '21 and Over') and JK Simmons known as 'the bald farmers insurance' guy.. the script is light in weight, the film didn't do great at the box-office but wasn't in many theaters to begin with.. Before I keep going I'd like to note that I've only given 43-"10's" out of 3450 ratings since I joined IMDb in 2006.For me, this wasn't a film that 'squeeked-in' either. It's my favorite film in a long, long time.What I love about "Whiplash", is that despite it's meager spec- sheet, it's packs one serious punch. That punch starts with J.K. Simmons, who deservedly brought home the Oscar for this performance. Right from his first sighting he commands the screen, and he quickly becomes one of films' most memorable antagonists. JK's "Fletcher" is a menacing figure. He holds futures in his hands, let's you know it, and isn't afraid to abuse the privilege. But, what really sets this character apart is that we still can't figure him out when the credits role. We certainly question his methods, but does he really have these kids interest at heart? We know(or think) that he feels some guilt because of a lie he tells about the death of a former student, but other moments like a hallway scene with what looks to be a former student make us question our hatred for the character.That's one of the amazing things about this film - the two lead characters are psychologically damaged, but driven men, and they lead us through a story that is much deeper at its' core than it is on the surface.The film begs to ask the question, "At what price?".This small film will linger with you for days."Whiplash" has a lot of other stuff going for it. There are some individual scenes here that are incredibly well-written, incredibly well-shot - the types of scenes that you won't soon forget. The break-up, the dinner scene, the early Shaffer scenes, and my God the ending. When Neiman's Dad is looking through the crack of that stage door we are mesmerized!!If you don't like this movie - you don't have a pulse. Don't get me wrong - I knew what the critics/detractors would say before I even looked. "That's not Jazz", "It's Unrealistic"(quickly becoming the cliché I look for in negative reviews that says to me, 'WATCH IT' - well, that and negative reviews that use the word cliché'd), and musicians and teachers that feel misrepresented,.. this and that of course there's those 'sensitive whussification of America' types that say it glorifies abuse. Hogwash!Forget that crap. Especially those giving it 1 or 2... I mean REALLY?!?!? 1 or 2??? I reserve ratings like that for "Master of Disguise" or "A Cold Day in Hell", not for good(make that great) films that you might have 'moral issues' with.This film is a psychological kick-drum to the face. It's brisk running time and that thin script just add to the mystique. I could watch the ending 50 times, and probably will.A week later, after chewing on everything in your head, you'll start to ask yourself if 'everything' Fletcher did was calculated. But then that would make him a decent guy? Personally, I think that he IS truly evil either way, but that is a notion that I'm still fighting with. It's that fine line between extreme motivation and abuse, and this film straddles-it for 85minutes. In the end, Fletcher loses, but doesn't ultimately lose much, and our antagonist rides into the sunset following what might be my favorite scene in film history Now, that's just one man's opinion.I love films like this that have such an amazing impact, but yet leave so much interpretation for the viewer.A MUST watch! 95/100 My fave since, hmmmm, Twilight Samurai or The Pianist maybe. It's been a while that's for sure.consider the potential 1.86 redbox charge as an instant coupon and go buy it! That's what I should have done. Hope it helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Directorial Intention... doesn't mean it's my cup of tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crux of Whiplash's story is obsession; whether that be obsession with the form of something (Fletcher), or your own legacy (Neiman), or acceptance (Nicole) or status (everyone in Neiman's family), and this film explores the dark depth's of this obsessive nature, and creates realistic characters in doing so. However, that doesn't make Whiplash a "great movie".It is a case where realism undermines escapism, as well as emotional attachment. In 106 minutes of film time I felt no empathy for any of the characters, in the real the world these are the type of people I would avoid and "b*tch" about to other friends; "Did you hear how Neiman got into his band? What a Richard?! And isn't it ran by that See you next Tuesday of a conductor as well? And here comes Nicole, oh god she is just such a downer... NICOLE! HEY!" I had to force myself through this film to what I felt was an unsatisfying conclusion, unfortunately since the film builds so much to this conclusion I will have to spoil it in the next paragraph.Neiman spends the entire film trying to impress Fletcher; Fletcher constantly undermines Neiman and downright abuses him. Neiman, like some kicked puppy, runs back to Fletcher for another bit of abuse. Some of his band mates call Neiman a "f**cking retard" and I spent most of the film vehemently agreeing with them by the way Neiman acts. When Fletcher finally breaks Neiman at the end of the film after he switches out his music sheet and embarrasses him in front of the New York public, instead of giving up he realises he should be playing music for himself not for the approval of others. This ending was projected through-out the film, and when the ending finally came it felt like a patronising school teacher's hand on your shoulder speaking around to the class "you shouldn't need the approval of others". *sigh* How many films feel like they need to tell me this moral/words of wisdom? I could list a 100 sports movies, Jesus even Happy Gilmore manages to have this idea in its film.Then we move to artistic intent; "You weren't meant to like the characters?" I have watched whole TV shows about characters I don't like; "The Sopranos", "Breaking Bad", but they have to some redeemable qualities. Tony was funny, Walt was pathetic and an everyman. Neiman is a spoilt little rich kid and Fletcher is an elitist know it all hipster, they have no self-awareness and no sense of humour, they are always serious and always stuck in their character.Of course there are a few things I liked about this film. JK Simmons and Miles Teller were so on point with their acting that I could have went out watched the two people I know like them, and I wouldn't have notice the difference. Damien Chazelle also seems to have a great deal of affection for the genre of Jazz, and sprinkles the film with some great choices for music.I did however have a lot of problems with the cinematography. People raved about how alive the film felt, but to me it felt stale. Constant close ups of music performances felt like beatniks describing jazz musicians, rather than fluid pictures, also lighting felt so similar to the college environment in "The Social Network", that I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the relationship between a sensitive music student who is driven to succeed and his teacher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a double character study that centers on the relationship between a sensitive, self doubting and introverted music student who is driven to succeed by a family that does not register music as any form of success. And by his teacher, who is driven to find the next world class jazz musician without any care of the cost to his students. "Andrew", the student, a young man who feels he is putting all he has into his drumming already and "Fletcher",the teacher, who demands ever more and believes that suffering is the only way to become a world class jazz musician feels his job is to obtain the impossible from his students. The student is willing to give up everything he has to become worthy in the eyes of this teacher, even dropping his girlfriend so that he can devote more effort to his playing. The teacher on the other hand does not ever believe that anyone is giving enough, to the point of regaling the students under him with public character ridicule and personal insults. And the teacher is willing to do anything to achieve what he feels is THE goal of finding that next world class jazz musician, even to the point of driving one former student to suicide. The current student and target is drummer Andrew, who takes the insults personally and drives himself harder and harder to achieve some kind of favor in the eyes of his teacher, who never gives it. Finally the student cracks under the pressure and has to leave the conservatory.After being convinced by the other dead student's family and his own father to relate the improper teaching techniques used by the teacher Andrew withdraws from college and begins a mundane life. Then that next summer Andrew sees the teacher playing in a small time venue at a jazz bar and stops to watch him play. The teacher approaches him and tells him that some other student told the conservatory stories about his methods and how he was "released" from his position. Then he tells the student about his philosophy on jazz musicians and pain &amp; suffering and that he was only trying to find the next great one and that was why his methods were so harsh. He told the young man he was only trying to drive his students to push beyond what they thought they could do. As they are going to part the teacher invites him to play with his new band at some competition. The student does a lot of thinking and then agrees to play in the band at this competition. Only when he steps up to the drums and thinks he is going to be happy the teacher steps up and tells the student he knows it was him that informed the conservatory about his methods. Then the student is surprised when the teacher tells the large audience that they will be playing a piece that he has not been given any music for. With no music to play from the student has to "wing it" as the teacher gives him a vindictive look and the student realizes he has been set up to fail in public. The student turns the tables on the teacher after the first piece and after the teacher delivers a gloating message "I guess you don't have it", referring to his talent. The student "takes over" the band by starting before the teacher can do so and gets the band to play with him rather than look bad. The teacher isn't happy but has no choice but to go along or look foolish to the crowd. Only the student is so good he is the one looking great, not the teacher. During the student's continuing subversion of the band the teacher basically has to go along with it until the student steps up and begins playing in a way that even the teacher finds great. Great enough that the teacher begins going along with it and takes his lead from the student. Then at some point the student realizes the teacher has finally started to see what talent he has and he slowly begins taking cues from the teacher until his elongated solo ends. Then there is a dead silence and you are left waiting to see if the teacher now accepts the talent of the student. The teacher, with only a look passes that communication across and the student smiles, knowing he has finally been found worthy by his teacher/mentor and the teacher then slashes the hand signal to the rest of the band and they deliver a rousing end to the piece. With that the movie ends and we are gifted with more great jazz music as the credits roll. Now I know I have not done the movie the credit it deserves because I only spoke on one level and the movie delivers on several. All I can say is that normally I wouldn't like a movie like this but this movie, THIS MOVIE I think was GREAT. If you enjoy music or if you enjoy the fire, the electric struggle between a rising student and a waning teacher and the convoluted symbiotic relationship between them then you should also like this movie. I watched that ending about 10 times. I really loved this movie because as a young teen I was very fortunate to have had a teacher/mentor similar to this character. I still think of him as a pure bastard at times, but oh what he drove me to achieve!Note: I had made this much more detailed and inclusive but IMDb made me pare it down to under 1000 words (Word commies)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Window on the creative process</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot of human drama here, but as one who has had more than a casual involvement in the realization of a music piece or two, I was impressed with the film's accuracy of that process. And it is a process. One reviewer lamented an irony that jazz was supposed to be so free, but the film reduced the music to something mechanical. Well, I hate to bust anybody's romantic notions,but when a conductor is assembling a music piece utilizing 10,20,50,100, or 300 individuals, it becomes a primary necessity to discipline the mechanics before all else, any individual expression belongs solely to the conductor who has determined well ahead of any of the other participants what he wants to hear to make a piece "tight". This film was all about that discipline, the time, blood, sweat and dedication involved in an uncompromising artistic pursuit of excellence, and the people who do it. There is always a lot of human drama involved in the pursuit of excellence, bloody taped fingers, sore muscles, stripped out vocal cords, the anguish of missing the mark, and the joy of overcoming. Whiplash is an excellent representation of exactly how a music piece is polished. The only weak spot I saw was how the actor portraying the conductor did not seem to grasp the importance of what a conductor does on stage. If you are a band, chorus, or orchestra member, your ears are filled with the sounds of the people in your immediate vicinity- you absolutely cannot hear what the people across the room are doing. So on stage, the conductors job becomes essential to keep everyone together, and cue sections in or out as needed. All members have eyes on him or her at all times for these purposes. It is far from an ornamental role, and the actor did not quite seem to get that.Other than that, "Whiplash" is exactly how music is made. Very real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action movie with jazz soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to watch this movie so you can get inspired I would tell you to skip it. After watching "Whiplash" I felt like I've just watched action movie with jazz soundtrack. Simmons and Teller did great job, and music was awesome, I'm big jazz fan and player. But, the hole idea of music and instrument playing being taken to this level, I really dislike. I mean blood on drum sticks....I'm drummer and drumming is fun, practicing is fun, not a torture. Playing with others, making music, not fighting over the part with others. I understand path to success is difficult in music business, but they showed it in completely wrong light. In large, I liked it but it shows drumming in the way I don't see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being the best is not easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie you maybe want to see two or three times (yes, is that good)The world of music is not easy, I have a brother that is into that, and you have to live with the constant pressure of being the best at what you do so you can keep being relevant in that world and so you sacrifices everything, family, friends, life, health. It's a jungle out there and you have to do all that it takes so you don't get to be the prey. That's the main theme on this movie, what are you willing to sacrifice to be the best?.From the beginning this movie is full of emotions, pressure and music and I love the music. J.K Simmons gave us one of those performance that we are already use to, he is great on every part of the movie, you start thinking "well maybe he is not that bad of a teacher" and then he surprises you with something.Miles Teller is great too, you get to see his transformation, how he accomplishes what he wants and all that he will do in order to succeed in this movie. I don't know if the blood is a requirement to play the drums in Jazz but there is a lot of it here.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. I completely love it and is going to be one of my favorites from now on. I recommend it 100%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way to go JK Simmons!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash definitely earned its best picture nomination this year! I've never seen a music movie that was so intense. There are really only two actors in this film that matter and they are Miles Teller and JK Simmons. Miles Teller is a young man who will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come (especially with his involvement in the reboot of the Fantastic Four). Teller can act, and he could have been nominated for an Oscar for this role. Teller is a veteran drummer so this story was something that he was certainly passionate about and that passion is apparent throughout the film. I'm glad they didn't stick a rookie behind the kit. JK Simmons, who has already won a Golden Globe for this performance, was so amazing. This guy came out of no where. The biggest role Simmons had before this film was playing J Jonah Jameson in the original Spiderman trilogy and he played him beautifully, but Whiplash will be the film he is remembered for. He is up for an Oscar for this film and I think the odds are likely in his favor considering the competition. I think that anyone can enjoy Whiplash because of its intensity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredibly Tense Journey Through Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie I heard a lot of praise for, and finally after watching it I can see why. This was an astounding movie with everyone having an amazing performance. One thing I felt made the movie for me was the tension between the perfectionist teacher and the student. First off, Miles Teller's performance was amazing and J.K. Simmons?This was probably one of the top 3 best performances of last year, and most definitely Simmons's best performance of his career. But that's not all, the way the characters interacted gave an amazing intense feeling that Teller's character was about to reach his breaking point. Another thing that was great in the movie was its use of music and silence throughout the film. There were points in the movie where the music fit the scene incredibly well and also used silence at points that made the intensity skyrocket. I find it an amazing thing to find something that can create a greater tone without a sound play out.In conclusion, this was an amazing film and I highly recommend you go see it (that is if its playing anywhere nearby). The only tiny problem I had was that there was some noticeable out sync sound design for some of the drumming. But besides that, the movie amazing through every minuteFinal Score: 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously a remarkable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most spectacular movie of the year is Whiplash, obviously a remarkable one.We can't call Miles Teller's acting performance as a perfect one but what he does deserves respects. Teller is weak at representing feelings as an actor but what he does is exactly what Andrew tries to do, so we catch all the challenges he faces. What J.K. Simmons does is kicking ass of acting. His performance is beyond movie time to time. He creates a character that we believe, we love, we hate and we love again.Everybody loves Jazz. Jazz is attractive. Jazz has created it's own culture, exist with it and represent it. It is a success story among this culture which is told in the movie but not in the usual way. You need to compete with your mentor too for succeed, as much as you do it with your competitors. You need to give up your life for being better and be ready to face up to blood and sweat and tear. It is a war that never been easy to win. There are rises and falls. But eventually legends are born out of the ashes.Supporting stories are not so original but how they are told and how they are finalized are not usual at all, such as a cliché dinner table conversation, the girl friend issue and rivalry for the place in orchestra. Movie doesn't take any risk to express feelings that wants to pass on us and uses approved successful methods for it. Characters are not solid and backgrounds are not clear. We watch Andrew's fight through only one perspective and we are pushed to understand all his twists. Fletcher seems to be focused only one purpose. We see him in couple of scenes out of orchestra but this scenes are more confusing than identifying his character. They are like puzzle pieces that we can't fix anywhere in his background. Many pieces feel this way and we can't totally put ourselves in the story.Besides everything, Damien Chazelle proved himself as a promising director even at his 30. With all deficiencies he presents us a strong movie. Some movies are as terrible as they are exaggerated but Whiplash deserves all attention it has and all excitement it brings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film on the recommendation of a friend who saw it on early access and I'm glad to say I took his advice. The storyline is very simple; a young drummer has aspirations of greatness, that's basically it. yet it is the stellar performance of the composer J K Simmons that really carries this film on his shoulders. He plays a man determined to produce the very best musicians, at any cost. For him, saying "good job" is a sin, as pure criticism is the means to success. For people who aren't that musically talented, myself included, I didn't really get much of the in-film criticism about off-beats and tempo etc.. which apparently separate the good from the great, but this lack of knowledge doesn't negatively impact the film and they manage to work around it. The final scene is one which I must pay homage to, and spoiler alert here if you haven't already it: Miles playing the drums solo whilst Fletcher stares on in anger, which morphs into fascination, then amazement, is simply amazing. The movie ends so abruptly after this change that it left me simply flabbergasted; there was no "happily ever after" displayed on screen" you merely saw a young man achieve his dream, whilst his muse looks on in awe, and the camera cuts to black, leaving you in the audience to simply marvel upon this moment. All being said, one of the best endings to a movie I've seen, and well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash is a story of a young musician who will stop at nothing in his search for greatness. Intense from beginning to end, I was left terrified by JK Simmons performance, which is easily the best of his career. Miles Teller also shines and shows his talent both in acting and drumming. This film will most definitely increase your heartbeat and leave you thinking. Not only is the story well written, it is an original tale which asks the question "how far is too far" when striving for your goals. It is a unforgettable film of relations and personal struggle which we all go through to some extent. There is also the plus of excellent music.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie at home one night after a friend suggested it as a very intense movie. I've checked this title out a while ago and was not attracted to the subject or anything about it for that matter. After 107 minutes my brain was intrigued, my heart was mesmerized and i stopped for a moment just to ask myself what has happened. I was drawn into the plot and i lived it side by side with the actors, i watched myself fail and get up again, die and be reborn. This movie reaches out to you and pulls out the inner self that wants more, that knows it can do more and keeps you on the edge of the seat for the entire duration. I started laying out in bed all covered up ready to fall asleep and ended up on the edge of the bed just 10-15 inches away from the screen. Excellent performance from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. This is what a movie should be about. Passion, intensity, willpower. Best movie i have seen in a long time and one of the few that have ever "spoken" to me. Go watch it ! It is worth every second of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy Rich approved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could write a long review like all the others here, but since I fully expect you to read those before you get to mine I'll stick to the core here. Miles Teller as Andrew and J.K. Simmons as Fletcher are the film. It's about the the blood the sweat and the tears of music. I was training as a boy to be a piano player and later played tenor sax in school.Because I had tough teachers I learned to stretch , to be full of myself sometimes and other times know that I didn't know it all no matter how good I thought I was.The dynamic here is gripping to the point I could not tear myself away but during the travel bit involving a rental car. From start to finish you know that what you see is real, there is no lowering of standards for the non musical or the that's really nice crowd. Every moment to the most extreme, has happened in practice or in your head or in the teacher's head at least once and more often than not the bits some will think exaggerated are if anything not as brutal as the real thing.And so we come to the drumming, was it him or was it clever editing and some anonymous hero? The simple answer is it was Miles Teller playing, but with help from extended takes and lots of practice, that's why it's so good. And it's no accident that he has pictures of Buddy Rich all over the place, I saw Buddy Rich live as well as see him practice with his band for over an hour when he came through my part of the world. Not only was that man a beast on drums, he expected only the best from his orchestra. A perfectionist, he ran that practice like a drill sergeant getting results worthy of the most knowledgeable paying customer in the hall. In both teacher and student, the ghost of Buddy Rich haunts and possesses them body and soul.Whiplash proves that sometimes you need to be an arsehole if you're going to be the best at anything. I regret not pushing harder to keep my piano teacher, but then again I was 10 and being a dickhead thinking I could just jump ahead and improvise during lessons before I had proved to my teacher's satisfaction I had nailed the material. Practice and discipline above and beyond the call of ordinary are the other pillars and in Whiplash you see that in abundance.As music films go, and they are rare as hens teeth to start with, Whiplash touches on all the elements you'd know are missing only if you ever studied music seriously. I loved it, I hope lots of people go out and see it so more such films will be made in future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ACTION movie about Drumming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have completed my quest to view all of the pictures nominated for the Academy Award this year with my viewing of WHIPLASH.And I finished my quest with a BANG!Whiplash is, basically, a "two-hander" between drum student Andrew (Miles Teller) and his teacher/mentor Terence Fletcher. Sounds boring, right? Not one bit. This movie has as much action as the best thriller.Front and center of this movie is the BRILLIANT portrayal of Fletcher by Simmons. He has walked away with just about every major Supporting Actor award this year and deserves every one of them. It is a "tour-de-force" performance and is the best acting performance of the year - Lead or Supporting, Male or Female - BY FAR. Fletcher is menacing, sharp, cutting, brilliant and, yes, vulnerable. it is this last trait that really makes the character. For if he was all blunt force and bravado, this character would seem too one note. But he is not, he is complex. Which makes him well worth watching.Of course, a performance like this would not be memorable if he did not have a strong performer to play against and Miles Teller more than holds his own. It was also welcome to see Paul Reiser appear in this film as Teller's father. I sure hope we get to see more of him in the future.Director and writer Damien Chazelle crafts a motion picture about drumming - DRUMMING! - expertly and the final performance/showdown between Teller and Simmons is an action sequence plain and simple. The fact that this "action" is a drum solo makes it quite remarkable, indeed.Still hanging on in theaters (to bring in the Academy Awards crowds, like me), WHIPLASH will soon be out in home video. Check it out, if for nothing else to see the performance of the year by JK Simmons.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiplash (Damien Chazelle) this is the biggest surprise of the productive year 2014. Relatively young director made from low-budget film a hit. The plot is quite simple. How to successfully skip obstacles and persevere. Want to be successful? Work, practice, bleed. The film is adorned with incredible dynamics and production. It is something different, a fresh wind in a world of big bucks rotten industry, who Just wanna make a buck more. Important are the characters. From Juno (Jason Reitman) he's on my eye, but this time he totally rocks, at all levels, and yes J.K. Simmons did steal the whole show. J.K Simmons, wow, what a performance. His mileage comes out big time. A respected professor in a music academy, you could say almost narcissistic psychopath, who requires more from students. Nothing wrong, if they would not be mentally tortured. Also a great performance from Miles Teller, who is slowly climbing on a letter to be a great actor. Yes we get it, so important to show how the main actor is suffering all the time, but the pain is a little over the top, and to many bloody hands. Screen capturing is that important in this movie, but the intense storyline and the personification of torture makes it alive alive.If you have a spare time, just grab this movie from the shelve and enjoy a masterpiece epic. To much drama, you would say...but Nonetheless a great juicy story, a nice pedigree of acting and a vivid package movie must see. I recommend it big time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no real expectations going into "Whiplash" because the trailer didn't wow me and I'm not the biggest fan of Miles Teller. However, the film proved to be a lot better than I was ready for.The story offers up no real surprises and there's a love interest element added to Andrew's story of becoming the best drummer and impressing his conductor and it really feels like it doesn't need to be there because the girl (Melissa Benoist) isn't really developed very well and feels forgotten about the rest of the time. However, despite this, the film is beautifully filmed and Miles Teller showed me that he's got some talent as he really showed the determination of Andrew. Also, I don't think I really have to mention that J.K. Simmons dominated as Fletcher, do I? We all know how awesome he is! In the end, "Whiplash" was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa! What a rush! The meaning of the all- too-relevant title revealed itself once during the movie's runtime, and then lashes back to what I thought it was, going in.What begins as a relentless game of cat and mouse between predator and prey never devolves into something lesser, like they do so usually. No amount of focus is lost in bringing this tale to life and that is perhaps one of its greatest strengths.One of many.What are its other strengths, indeed? What areas complement in the telling if this tale, one night well ponder. Lemme try laying it out, the best I can.The more-than-just-apt production design. The don't-look-away camera work and cinematography. The sublime sound design and marvelous score. The supremely rich characterization. Perhaps 2 of the greatest performances ever rendered on screen. Performance choreography. Perhaps the best ever to be seen on film.I literally have no nits to pick here. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.After lesser role since'The spectacular now', which he made his own, Miles Teller inhabits the character so thoroughly, that he must've got whiplash in real life too. JJJ, oops, JK Simmons, on the other hand, might have been typecast in such a role, but as the movie progresses, he subtly reminds us, subtly first, then powerfully, almost with a sledgehammer performance of sorts, on why we'll never be able to imagine anyone other than him in the role of the single minded genius prospector of musical talent, while surely getting off on what he can get away with. Masterful. Mind blowing. Forget Louis Gossett Jr. Forget R Lee Ermy. Meet Terence Fletcher. He Will get under your skin, claw his way in, dig in deep, and never, ever, leave. You might take 10, but you. Are. His. Forever.I can't wait to watch this again. And again. And then some.Don't miss. And spread the love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that almost reached to the level of perfect. Almost almost nearly perfect. Intense, powerful, and entertaining. I just had an awesome cinema experience. This movie shows that a drama can be extremely entertaining like an action movie. Even though this whole movie is all about the psychological battles between mentor and pupil, the movie executed really well. And I love that so much. An R rated movie which doesn't need killing, nudity, and extreme violence. This movie teaches us that sometimes you have to believe in yourself. It's so wonderful that both J.K and Miles gave an astonishing performance. The most wonderful thing is director Damien Chazelle just did an amazing job in his debut film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing! Hardcore Jazz Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not sure I wanted to watch this after reading the reviews about the abusive teacher, but after seeing the trailer I must admit I laughed despite myself at the cruel commentary to the student in that short example. Certainly there's more to come if you decide to see the film, but it isn't the main issue. I have in fact experienced teaching that comes pretty close in my junior high days, so it's not all that fictional. If you do decide to watch "Whiplash" I can only say it was intensely amazing from start to finish. Starts, and ends on a Jazzcore drum-roll, and knocks you around emotionally for the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes time. Many will take offense at the actions of the not necessarily likable characters, but it's the music and the feeling of passion that will remain with you by the time the credits roll. I think it is not intended to make a statement on the kind of people you see portrayed in the movie, it's more about asking questions about ambition in life. What motivates you to do certain things? If you just sit back and let the story flow, you will just realize that this is a movie like no other. Sure at it's core it has Faustian overtones, and classic themes of struggling for success against all odds, but never has it been visually and musically so well presented as in this movie. Even the title is perfect. "Whiplash" truly is a performance of a lifetime for all involved, and I am happy to have been able to experience it. "Beat Out That Rhythm On A Drum" has taken on new meaning after witnessing this stunning cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Whiplash" is exceptional filmmaking, but is just about one minute too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What price success? That's basically the question asked in "Whiplash" (R, 1:47). Is there such a thing as being TOO focused on a goal? How about pushing someone too hard to reach his potential? When does motivation become abuse? We've probably all either had a goal for which we were willing to sacrifice nearly everything, or had a parent, a coach, a teacher or a boss push us to the point where we wondered if it was all worth it. Well, what happens when those last two conditions are present in the same situation? Can we expect the result to be excellence ? or tragedy ? or both? Miles Teller plays Andrew Neimann, a freshman at an extremely prestigious (but fictional) music school in New York City, called the Shaffer Conservatory. Miles is a jazz drummer who is determined not just to BE great, but to be one of THE greats. His only friend is the single father (Paul Reiser) who raised him. He doesn't have friends or girlfriends. He needs to be free to focus on his music. He practices obsessively and things only get worse when he comes to the attention of Shaffer's most demanding professor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who picks Andrew for the school's very exclusive Studio Band. Fletcher makes the drill sergeant in 1987's "Full Metal Jacket" look like a purring kitten. Andrew literally gives Fletcher his blood, sweat and tears, but he never seems to be able to fully please his mentor. Fletcher regularly abuses all his students ? emotionally and even physically ? especially Andrew. It's Fletcher's idea of motivation. He sees it as necessary to bring out greatness, and greatness is what Andrew covets, but this relationship is not exactly mutually beneficial. It's toxic. And combustible. As the tension builds, Andrew even seems on the path to becoming as rude and cruel as Fletcher ? if Fletcher doesn't destroy him in the process. It seems just a matter of time before someone snaps. Inevitable.Besides asking some very important questions, "Whiplash" gets credit for excellent execution ? mostly. First of all, the acting is terrific. Simmons deserves all the awards he has won for the role and one wonders why Teller wasn't nominated for any awards. The film's cinematography and editing really add to the on screen tension and the music is so much a part of the story-telling that it's practically a character unto itself. This film will probably do more for jazz than any film since "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999). The only real problem I had with this film is the ending. What seems to be a strong narrative thread, a consistent message and a uniform tone (all thanks to writer-director Damien Chazelle, who based the characters on his experiences as a music student) gets off track in the film's final scene. This movie is simply 30-60 seconds too long. Except for that, this is a very artistically intense film and deserves a look ? and more than a passing thought about the questions it raises. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would of thought that a film about a young drummer could be so intense?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success."Damien Chazelle's Whiplash is one of the best films of 2014. It doesn't matter if you aren't much of a music fan (I'm not), because there is much more going on here than the simple premise of a young drummer trying to achieve perfection. I don't know much about jazz or music, but somehow Chazelle managed to make one of the most intense films of the year. Who would've thought that a film focusing on a relationship between a young drummer and his mentor could be so intense and have you at the edge of your seat during the final ten minutes of the film? It was quite a memorable experience. This is Chazelle's sophomore film (his debut film was Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench) and you can already conclude he's a brilliant director and one to look forward to. He's as determined as the main protagonist of the film. When he wasn't able to come up with the funding for this film he decided to make a 20 minute short which debuted at Sundance in 2013 and after garnering attention from critics he was able to finance this film. Perfection comes at a great cost and it requires discipline and practice. Chazelle makes sure we understand that this pursuit of perfection comes at a great cost and he lets the audience decide whether it's worth the price or not. Whiplash is one of those rare films that leaves you with many different things to think about. It raises so many questions: Does the end justify the means? Is the pursuit of perfection possible? Is it really worth all the sacrifice? and the most important question in my opinion; what is our definition of success? The young drummer in this film played brilliantly by Miles Teller (who had a breakout year in 2013) seems to have his mind made up of what success really means, but is he right? The director avoids taking sides and lets the audience come up with their own conclusions. There is a brilliant scene where Teller's character is courting a girl and telling her about his goals in life, and his reaction is brilliant when the girl (played by Melissa Benoist) doesn't really know what she wants to do with her life. He is so determined and focused that he finds it confusing that someone could live without this sort of ambition. These small scenes are what makes this movie so great because it allows us to learn new things about each character through these interactions. The core of this film is without a doubt the relationship between this aspiring young drummer and his abusive mentor. It is very different from most other mentor-student relationships explored in movies in the past and it avoids falling into similar formulas and clichés found in other films. This isn't the cool teacher, this is someone whose personal philosophy is about pushing his students to sacrifice everything in their lives to pursue greatness and the only way to do so in his opinion is by pushing and bullying his students to the point of breaking them. It is the opposite of what a mentor like Professor Keating in Dead Poets Society is like towards his students (and most films take a similar approach having an inspirational and caring mentor). But in Whiplash J.K. Simmons' Fletcher is the complete opposite and he psychologically terrorizes his students. You can feel the fear he installs in the students and his presence alone every time he enters a room is felt. Simmons' performance is the best I've seen all year and he delivers in every scene he's in. He is the main reason why the film is as intense as it is because every time Teller's Andrew gets in front of the drums we feel that anxiety and tension. We want him to succeed, but at times the cost seems too high. Simmons' presence is terrifying and even when he seems to be cooled down we know that he can burst in any moment with a missed note. The way he verbally assaults and demolishes his students is also a troubling part of the film because as an audience we know that it is wrong but we can't help but chuckle at some of the things he's saying. His character is almost cartoonish at times, but it is part of his persona because he thinks it is the only way to push his students to become the best. As good as Simmons is in this film, Miles Teller doesn't allow him to steal the spotlight. Teller is the lead character in this film and even when Simmons isn't on screen we are engaged with the story. The moments he is interacting with Nicole, the girl he is dating, and with his father (played by Paul Reiser) are also incredibly well constructed and they say a lot about who each character is. These relationships give us a glimpse of who Andrew really is and what drives him. Teller's performance is solid and even his drum skills are amazing in this film. The entire cast is fantastic, but of course Simmons receives most of the recognition because his presence on screen is just amazing here. There are so many other aspects of the film that work so well, like the rapid editing that goes along with the jazz beats. The cinematography is also gorgeous. Everything about this film is great and the performances simply elevate it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terence Fletcher: "There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job".Whiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.Okay let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen Birdman yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.J.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he's career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out, no, I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was real and not fake. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher. Now let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He has the best lines, when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say "You did a good job", and yes I did use the words "you did a great job", n my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it. This movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliché that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like "You will clap at the end", but you don't, or "You will feel inspired after the film", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie. For problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really.Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Neeman is a student at Shaffer, the best music school in USA, but he's just an alternate drummer in some school band. One night he accidentally catches the attention of Terence Fletcher, the most revered conductor in the school. But even since acquaintance, Fletcher has been such an irritating and abusive man. He humiliates Andrew at his first day on the band, to the point where Andrew cries. Andrew asks Nicole, the girl working at his favorite cinema, to go out with him. In a competition, Tanner, Fletcher's band's core drummer left his music sheets to Andrew, who neglects it for two seconds. The sheets disappear oddly. Tanner can't play without the sheets. Andrew steps in, stating he knows the song, Whiplash, by heart. Andrew plays well and earns Tanner's spot. But Fletcher introduces a new song, Caravan, which needs an extreme time stamp measure of 330 bpm. Fletcher keeps saying, harshly, that Andrew need to practice harder to gain the speed and tempo, Fletcher's tempo. Andrew breaks up with Nicole, saying his ambition will only hinder their relationship. One day Fletcher introduces Ryan, Andrew's band-mate in their former band where Andrew was Ryan's alternate, as another alternate drummer, heating more competition for the spot. At another competition, Andrew gets into an accident trying to be on time, after showing up late and has to go get his sticks back. He goes on and plays, all bloodied and battered, but Fletcher says he already loses his spot. Andrew had it and launches at Fletcher. He gets expelled from Shaffer for that. A lawyer approaches his family, encouraging Andrew to speak up against Fletcher's abuse, noting Shaun Casey, a player Fletcher boasted about earlier, was driven into suicide by Fletcher's attitude. Andrew agrees to it and Fletcher gets kicked out of Shaffer, without knowing who the whistle-blower is.Andrew continues on, leaving the kit for a while. But he sees Fletcher performs live. Fletcher sees him and they chat. Fletcher explains his view on his teaching method, that he drives the best out of his students. Fletcher offers the drummer spot for his band to perform at another upcoming festival with the same songs, Whiplash and Caravan. But it turns out to be Fletcher's revenge. The festival audiences are influential figures in the industry who can make or break someone's career. Fletcher intentionally leaves out Andrew from the opening song's music sheets. Andrew performs clueless. Embarrassed, he leaves the stage. But he goes back on to prove himself. As Fletcher talks into the second song, he starts himself with a solo and cues the band in for the song Caravan, which now he fully masters. After the song he still continues on with a long and speedy solo.This movie has been in my wish-list since I saw its first trailer months ago but I just get the chance to see it now after there is access to it on the internet. I have an experience in drumming so this movie relates to me even more. The story gets to be very engaging and it also teaches a very good lesson in my eyes, that to pursue your dreams you should do your best, and that includes putting blood, sweat and tears into the effort, and also choosing between your dreams and other priorities.The movie focuses on great characters. Andrew depicts a great character in his passion for music, for his dreams, and his ultimate choice to work himself out to achieve them. But the movie also plays it fair as it shows the consequences of being ambitious like Andrew does. Yes those cuts do happen to a drummer's hands, although maybe not that dramatic. Fletcher maybe perceived as the ultimate antagonist in this movie, shoving emotional pain to all his students. But we can also see the positive effects that students achieve their potential. Come to think of it, Fletcher has a great memory and a deep sense of ironic humor. When Andrew asks about Tanner as the drummer for the band performing on the JVC Jazz Festival, Fletcher answered that Tanner moved to a pre-med school, which is very ironic since Tanner stutters out from playing in Overbrook since he has a medical condition about his memory.The musical aspect is just great. The first time I saw this, there are many times that I feel a dilemma of choosing between closing my eyes to focus on listening to the great music and drum techniques, or keep opening it to see the acting. I am not quite sure that it's really Miles Teller on the kit, especially on those crazy 330 and 400 bpm tunes. But if it is really him, or if he at least plays a large chunk of those parts, I think he deserves more respect for his skills. The references to great musicians also serve as intriguing parts, if not inspiring.The acting is indeed a great job overall. I like how Miles Teller portrays the ambitious student, strengthening himself to withstand the obvious mental and emotional abuse to get the drummer spot for his dreams. J.K. Simmons acted out his usual part of yelling and screaming, we all got familiar with his J.J. Jameson parts on Spidemran movies. But this time he takes it up a few notches, getting more serious without the clumsy jokes.My say for this movie is that Whiplash (2014) stands up as one of 2014's best movie. It's a great regret that this movie doesn't get a wider release. I do think this movie deserves at least a nomination as best picture. Besides being entertaining and inspiring, like other best picture nominations do, this movie tells a great story about dreams and the struggle for it. A score of 8 out of 10 and a definite recommendation is from me for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film but really painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not help but recognize that this is sure to be one of the top films of the year. That's thanks to both great work by the director and superlative acting by virtually everyone, but especially the two stars. I had to rethink the quality of this film once it ended because I found it on many levels truly painful to watch. The "music professor" was such a villain I was cursing him out while watching his performance. And talk about sexist! It's so bad it's hardly worth mentioning. As a life long jazz fan, I found the music really dynamite, even though I usually hate drum solos. And since I'm a former New Yorker who currently lives in New Orleans, I'd describe the music as very Big Apple, which means it's the kind of stuff that in a New York club will generally run you a $25 or more cover plus a two drink minimum, and let's not talk about what it cost to park your car. And tempo as an issue? Guys down here in the Big Easy can get angry if you even ask them to tune up! One other problem I had was making Charlie Parker a sort of ultimate jazz hero. Let's not forget that Bird died at 34, his body so ravaged by heroin that the Coroner estimated his age as 50 to 60. Not quite my idea of someone you'd want to hold up as a role model.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jazz Drumming Is Still Alive In The Year 2014?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 1959 when I was 10 years old, my late Mother took me to see the movie "The Gene Krupa Story" with the late actor Sal Mineo playing the role of Gene Krupa. At that time in the year 1959 Jazz music and Jazz musicians were popular and Gene Krupa the jazz drummer was still alive. My late Father like a jazz style called "Cool Jazz" and so do I. I have the movie "The Gene Krupa Story" on DVD and I can see certain things in the movie I did not understand when I was 10 years old; It was the jazz drumming I was interested at that time in 1959. When I learn to play jazz drums, I was listening to a jazz drummer name Joe Morello who play jazz drums for the classic Dave Brubeck Quartet. Since then I have left jazz drumming and have become interested and involved in songwriting and music composing using the computer MIDI systems. After seeing the movie "Whiplash" is there a comparison to the two different movies from the year 1959 and 2014? I think there is - for example, the late jazz drummer Gene Krupa did not have the support of his father or mother or his siblings to help pursue his career as a musician and the character "Andrew" from the movie "Whiplash" did not have the support of his father to help pursue the music career of his son Andrew. I do not remember my music director being so forceful when I played the drums in the high school jazz band or the the college jazz band. Maybe the movie director took some liberty and dramatize some of the events? Today in 2014, I think, any band director would be fired for physically hitting any music band student. I like the movie and I am glad some filmmaker made a movie about jazz drumming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most epic showdowns in cinematic history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'WHIPLASH': Five Stars (Out of Five) A critically acclaimed (and Oscar hopeful) jazz musician character study that plays more like a psychological thriller than a heartwarming drama. It was written and directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. The film tells the story of a young jazz drummer studying to become great at an acclaimed music school, under the obsessive guidance of an abusive instructor. It also features Melissa Benoist and Paul Reiser, in supporting roles. I found it to be nothing short of great and a true masterpiece.Andrew (Teller) is 19-years-old and just started school at the Shaffer Conservatory, which is widely known as the best music school in the country. He really wants to be one of the great jazz drummers and to do so he'll need to gain the approval of a highly respected conductor, at the school, named Terence Fletcher (Simmons). Fletcher is determined to find the next great musician and his tactics for bringing out the best in students are highly questionable, and border on psychological abuse (and torture). Andrew is just as determined to become a great musician though, and the two engage in a battle that turns into one of the most epic showdowns in cinematic history.Simmons is great in the movie (and he's now seen as the Best Supporting Actor frontrunner, at this year's upcoming Academy Awards). I've been a fan of his, as a character actor, for years and it's great to see him taking on a lead role that he's this powerful and memorable in (it showcases all of his best talents). Teller is just as good as the main character though, he's a new actor but he's already shown an amazing gift for acting. The two very flawed but inspired characters, these actors bring to life in this film, are classic. It's a great story but what's even more impressive is how visceral a film going experience it is; Chazelle's directing is always breathtaking and beautiful to watch. I don't think a character study could possibly be more intense and thoroughly involving than this (and it does feel like a thriller or fast paced sports drama). It's one of the best movie experiences I've had this year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/TybVNWfCjYM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been an incredible amount of movies about kids who are following their dreams and have a tough couch that they hate. This formula has become quite cliché, luckily, Whiplash escapes it.Ernest Hemingway once said about his profession, that "There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed." This line, thought directed at his job as an author, is, in fact, applied to life. The movie's main character has this perfectly applied to his talents. He isn't a Mozart, who was born with the incredible gift to perform as musician. He, as most out there, had to become a good player through practice: Sitting down at the drums and bleeding.Thought there are a certain number of characters who play an important part in it (such as the ones played by Paul Reiser or Melissa Benoist), the movie truly goes around Andrew and Fletcher, who receive tremendously incredible performance from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. In fact, the entire crew did a good job with this movie and, exactly because of this, it is one of thee single greatest masterpieces of the year.For anyone who decided to follow something that matters for themselves, ignoring how profitable it must be, this movie will captivate you. For anyone who has a passion towards jazz, the drums or simply music, this movie will captivate you. For anyone who simply loves movies, with well done shots and a good screenplay, this movie will captivate you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In our memory we all have a teacher that was truly hard on us. Someone of them we admired and resented at the same time. Sharing my personal story, I use to have been a professional ballet dancer and had teachers who mentally and physically assaulted me and put me through some of the worst experiences of my life. My first female ballet teacher from age 10 till 13 use to, on a daily bases, would break a wooden ruler on my body or if I was lucky on bodies of someone else in the class. From age 13 till 17 we had psychopathic male teacher who apart from constant psychological abuse, would actually be assaulting us physically, which eventually got him suspended from the school many years later when he unleashed his rage on someone from the younger students who eventually got concussions. Now, those memories of my early ballet training with people that should have never been allowed around children created in me sense of willingness to work hard and succeed in this difficult artistic profession. After 12 years of professional career dancing in some of the best companies in the world, I am able now to forgive the horrors of my youth and try to look for positive spin on the training I had with people that in it's core were full of resentment and pain. They simply found position of power in their relationship with pupils and ultimate power corrupts, specially if they themselves did not had fulfilled careers in the first place. Would I have been less successful if I had normal teachers, I don't know. Motivation to prove someone wrong can also be a powerful fuel... "Whiplash" written and directed by Damien Chazelle won an Audience Award at this years Sundance Film Festival among other awards and is gathered plenty of positive review, like this one on it's way. It seems everyone can identify with this subtly told story of the relationship between student and his mentor that takes dramatic turns as the story progresses."A promising 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) enrolls at a cutthroat Shaffer Conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential."Young people specially in artistic professions are often very sensitive. They express their pain through artistic expression. Their life might not be the most financially stable and often a good teacher will demand more from the students that have a lot of potential. In "Whiplash" character played by Miles Teller displays that masochistic dedication to his craft that usually have potential to be turned in to a successful career. This is precisely why he is being pushed by J. K. Simmons character beyond exhaustion and mental breakdown. I am not a huge Jazz fan and yet I was absolutely captivated by the scenes of countless rehearsals and performances which created the state of constant tension and fatigue for the characters. The mixture of sweet, blood and tears is literally on display here. The way those scenes are edited created in the viewer sense of anticipation to look for a breaking point that will end the movie in a valiant outburst of a tragedy from one of the students. To Damien Chazelle credit he keeps the audience not only entertained but also surprised by twists and turns of story that with lesser writer/ director could become very predictable. But the ultimate highlight here are two roles of the main actors. Miles Teller who apparently has been drumming since he was 15 years old, took additional lessons 4 hours a day, 3 days a week to prepare for the movie and let me tell you, he displays masterful control over the instrument. On top of the physical challenge he wonderfully displays the emotions that makes us root for him to succeed. In the past he played mostly in comedies however here he truly showcases his dramatic edge that works as a counter part towards J. K. Simmons character. There has been talk of J. K. Simmons might be getting a Oscar nomination for this role of sadistic, narcissistic teacher and indeed it would be justified one. In "Whiplash" the amount of venom that comes out of his being is intoxicating for the characters around him, as well as the audience. I am glad that he finely received opportunity to showcase his dramatic edge that might indeed bring him more work of this kind in the future. To be very picky I must say the Academy always likes to reward with nominations characters that display duality and bring aspect of sexuality to their performance which this character had plenty potential for which J. K. Simmons shy away from. That might have been a fault of the director though. Never the less J. K. Simmons delivers arguably his best work in his prominent career. As I mentioned before I am not a huge Jazz fan but I was very entertained by this complex character driven drama that is worth seeing for the performances alone. This film forced me to go back to my childhood and reevaluate my relationship with teachers that scare my inner self and yet in some way made me the person I am today for better or worse. Perhaps as they say what want kill you will only make you stronger...You decide this weekend by watching excellent "Whiplash".For more of my reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raging Bull on drums!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The slow pace of a drum beat fills the screen. Then, it gradually gets louder and faster until you are grabbing the arms of your chair in anticipation as if you were riding to the top of a roller coaster. All of the sudden, the title card comes up and the next hour and forty minutes becomes a hair-standing, wide-eyed look at two people pushing beyond the boundaries of talent and mentorship. The film is Whiplash, the story of an overly-ambitious drum major (Miles Teller) at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music in New York who is chosen to play for the Conservatory band under the leadership of a tyrannical conductor (J.K. Simmons) and will go beyond any ethical code of conduct to turn his student into the next jazz virtuoso.The performances in this movie are flat-out amazing! Miles Teller was fifteen when he started playing the drums and practiced 4 hours a day to prepare for the movie, which was shot in a period of 19 days. Teller's passion and drive as a drummer and actor are shown in full view in his performance as Andrew, a musician who will sacrifice his blood, sweat, and tears until it pours out over the drums. J.K. Simmons, an actor who has been type- casted for his comedic, yet sympathetic, warmth, gives the performance of his career as Fletcher, an instructor so sadistic that he would make R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket look like an agony aunt. Both Simmons and Teller clash on the screen like Ali and Foreman in the ring or Ginger Baker and Elvin Jones on the drums. Witten and directed by Damien Chazelle, he drew from his own experiences as a high school student in a jazz ensemble group, in which his band instructor was a force not to be reckoned with. His static camera catches the energy and emotional swings with such unpredictability you would think it was a documentary. At first glance, you might think of this movie as "Rocky with drums" but, if anything, it draws comparisons to Raging Bull; from soaking a clenched, bloody fist into a bucket of ice after an intense drumming session to the dilemma of how one functions off the drum kit when the band stops playing. If you're looking for a film that pulls sympathetic punches in the style of Fame, Mr. Holland's Opus, or an agonizing episode of Glee, take a hike! Whiplash is a film that cuts deep with an intense and visceral edge that will make your jaw drop with amazement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing performances, one of the years best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that for me, the standout of the film is the acting performances, led by the support role of J. K. Simmons and lead actor Miles Teller.Their on-screen chemistry is phenomenal and whilst Teller does an outstanding job leading the film as Andrew; it is Simmons who steals the show as Fletcher, Andrew's music instructor who stops short of nothing in his pursuit for musical perfection.Whilst on the surface it may appear that you need an interest in music to enjoy the film, I do not believe this is the case. It is as much a haunting drama as it is a film about music (it drew parallels to Black Swan for me) and hits all the right notes in its direction, screenplay, cinematography, sound and above all acting!Do yourself a favour and don't miss this one, it's sure to be up there in awards talk come years end.My rating: 9/10 (2nd favourite movie of 2014 so far at time of writing)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash: Through Hell We Find Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally posted on Redtere Productions website by Chris Dolan.Have you ever felt so driven towards something that you nearly killed yourself in the pursuit of it and kept going anyway?Damien Chazelle's festival success Whiplash may be a film that becomes a game changer of sorts for not only modern independent film but modern conversation that comes from art. The film is so immensely immersive and satisfying to its audience and so focused on it's core question that I think anybody can walk out of the theater saying, "I not only enjoyed that film but I understand the question it raised." Film's so bold seem rarities these days because, in a business sense, what's safe seems standard and formulaic and, in an art sense, greatness is always out of reach and yesterday's youtube hit. The film itself seems to reflect these ideologies but truly challenge them at the same time in the characters of Andrew and Terrence.The two leading actors in the film, Miles Teller, who plays aspiring jazz drummer Andrew Nieman, and J. K. Simmons, who plays border-line sadistic jazz conductor Terrence Fletcher, really tease out the question "how much abuse is necessary to becoming great at what you do?" In the film, we see Terrence time and again reject Andrew and Andrew struggling with his resilience toward his goal. We see Andrew enter full tunnel-vision and start to prioritize his pursuit of greatness above everything else. In various ways, we see this pursuit harm Andrew in violent or even near catastrophic ways, but yet, he keeps clawing along. Both actors will undoubtedly be considered for Oscars.To relate to modern society, many students these days are pushed to undesired-limits to become all-encompassing machines of productivity. You have to take all these classes, have all these skills, be in these clubs, have a social life and be financially stable. That equation right there seems a recipe for burnout and the development for some seriously disillusioned people. In essence, if you can't do it all, we will find someone else who can and pay them a meager wage. Whiplash is a film that spits in the face of societal expectation and meritocracy and says "fuck you, I'm going to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world and there's nothing you can do to stop me!" Andrew knows what he wants, knows who inspires him, has an idea of what he lacks, and knows he has to give a great deal of himself to his goal if he is going to achieve it.Many people tend to fall into careers they regret everyday for the rest of their life. Some modern leaders find themselves unable to relate to, communicate with, and utilize their teams to reach new heights. These people don't have a lot of what Andrew has: an understanding of what they want, an idea of what they lack, an idea of who inspires them and what interests them, a drive to reach their goal- whether that goal be business-based, artistic-based, or humanity-based. It is truly no wonder why we can respect people who try to sucker us to buy something we don't want; who lobby for big tobacco; who preach at our local church; who fix our cars, but might not be the best at it. When we know that they are invested in what they do and that their function serves a purpose for them in life, it doesn't matter if they are involved in business, art, or humanity efforts, we embrace and relate to their struggles and respect them as a whole person in their pursuit. Andrew may be malicious at some points in the film towards family, friends, and himself, but we embrace his pursuit nonetheless and are cheering for him every step along the way, even when he is being abused. It is this central dynamic that is the silver lining of much great literature and film. Terrence, on the other hand, can be seen metaphysically as the other side of that central dynamic representing all that in society that stands in our way forcing us to submit to fear of failure. Why do we like him? It is because he challenges us? Because he hurts us? Because he knows who he is and what he wants? The ending of the film will definitely have some skeptical declaring Andrew is just submitting to abuse- but I challenge you to ask yourself, if you confronted that which you feared most, would you be a stronger person for it? This is probably a film everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explodes into a musical epiphany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are thinking about engaging in some other activity after watching Damian Chazelle's Whiplash, be sure to leave some time for decompression. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, the semi-autobiographical Whiplash is a visceral, adrenaline-pumping musical drama that raises but does not resolve the age-old question of whether the end justifies the means. In the film, 19-year-old Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller, The Spectacular Now), an ambitious drumming student enrolled at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory of Music (fictional) in midtown Manhattan, comes under the tutelage of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a high-ranking instructor who is well-known for pushing his students to the limits of their endurance and beyond.From the time that Fletcher watches Andrew in practice and invites him to play in the school jazz band, the film is essentially about the confrontation between the driven student and the seriously overbearing instructor, both pursuing perfection but by vastly different approaches. Fletcher does not hesitate to use racial, religious, and homophobic slurs, throw chairs, or play demeaning psychological games to motivate his students. In one instance, he starts and stops a performance over and over with shouts of "not my tempo," and repeatedly browbeats a pupil demanding to know if he is "rushing" or "dragging." In another example, he yells that someone in the band has lost the beat and asks the culprit to identify himself. When no one comes forward, Fletcher singles out a heavy-set boy and pressures him to admit that he was off-beat, then, on his reluctant admission, orders him to get out. Later, he tells the class that the boy was not off the beat but the fact that he didn't know that was just as telling. Close-ups of Fletcher's one-on-one confrontations show every line on his face including his contortions, grimaces, and each drop of his sweat. One of his justifications is that toughness pays off, citing the apocryphal story of teacher Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at the head of Charlie Parker that motivated him to practice harder and become the great jazz musician he turned out to be. The two most harmful words in the English language, Fletcher says, are "good job." He is, however, apparently more interested in his own legacy than in developing talent and his lack of integrity is evidenced when he lies about what actually caused the untimely death of one of his best students. Andrew is also single-minded in his pursuit of excellence, becoming the band's core drummer by mastering the double-swing time beat and practicing until there is blood all over his hands and instruments. His only release is going to the movies with his father Jim (Paul Reiser), an English teacher who gave up his ambition to become an author. As a single dad, he is very supportive but has no vision of what Andrew is capable of. Though powerfully assertive behind his drums, Neyman is awkward and insecure socially. His relationship with Nicole (Melissa Benoist), a concession worker at the movie theater, begins promisingly but ends abruptly when he tells her that their relationship, if continued, would become a hindrance to his ambitions, an idea she predictably does not take kindly to. When Andrew's cousins receive plaudits for playing football and both he and his father are disparaged at a dinner party, the conversation deteriorates into an angry exchange of insults about what it takes to succeed in life, Andrew, while truthful, comes off as a bit Fletcher-like in his put-downs. Both Teller and Simmons turn in amazingly convincing performances, genuinely capturing the essence of their characters and it's difficult to imagine any other two actors in their roles. Teller, an accomplished drummer, is vulnerable and likable though we become leery of his escalating internal fury.Simmons is a powerful presence who dominates every scene he is in. Though he is basically an unsympathetic character, he shows moments of humanity that bring his toxic character into a sharper focus. While the most provocative aspect of the film is the question of how far a teacher should go in motivating their students, it seems to me that Chazelle is saying that while harshness, crudeness, and authoritarianism may sometimes work temporarily to achieve a desired result, without the element of compassion, a talent may be realized but only at the price of health and well-being. The most compelling aspect of the film, however, is not the philosophy but the music and it is terrific. All the emotional build-up of the film comes together in the final segment which, while open to interpretation as to its underlying meaning, explodes into a musical epiphany that is far beyond anything that I've ever seen in film in the same vein. If Whiplash could succeed in turning me into a jazz fan, there is no limit to the miracles it can accomplish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Exhilarating Film About Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rash ambition has been quite the popular theme to explore this year with just last week's Nightcrawler considerably raising expectations on the honesty and depth we can witness from such commentary. Our culture ?the dog-eat-dog system?grooms us to be such ferocious competitors and through it, we lose more and more of our humanity. We lose sight of the people and the objects around us, and all focus is concentrated on one single objective like a cheetah menacingly sighting its prey. Well, it's Andrew Neyman's (Miles Teller) first year at the (fictional) best music school in the country, Schaffer Conservatory, and he wants to make something extraordinary out of it. Playing drums from a very young age, he has reached the point of maturity in which he wants to excel beyond "cute" talent that family simply compliments and prove himself in front of true professionals. Unfortunately, it's going to exhaust his soul and really test his endurance to reach that level. The jazz orchestra's conductor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who's promising that end goal of potential success and fame, is an abrasive, foul-mouthed, and mercilessly strict nightmare who puts his students through torture before they can even hope to perform in front of a large crowd or make it into serious competitions. To merely survive his class is to be one of the absolute best. Andrew has no idea what he's in for though, but when he starts getting slapped around and coarsely yelled at because his drum beats were rushing (and in other moments, dragging) by "just a hair," the lengths he'll have to reach for in order to ultimately prove himself become clearer. His hands already bleeding and his face heavily perspiring, how much harder and faster can he pound those drums to reach that paramount level? Competition out in the world is undoubtedly fierce, and after barely tolerating days after days of soul-crushing insults that can send anyone's self-esteem into oblivion, an even greater, desperate drive begins to consume Andrew. Realizing that becoming one of the greats is going to require hard confidence and unrelenting ambition, Andrew's attitude suddenly begins to take on an utterly smug, egocentric nature as he loudly proclaims that he's far superior to any of his peers and is very well on his way to becoming the next Buddy Rich. At this point, he doesn't even bother making superficial friends or attempting to please all the people around that are essentially meaningless in his climb to prosperity. Whiplash certainly remains tense throughout its entire duration as we see Andrew suffering, pounding the drums at an unbelievably rapid rate, (literally) with blood, sweat, and tears, which only gradually increases from there with every practice session and every vile rant from his teacher. Thrillingly immersive close-up shots of the snares and the pedals and the drumsticks?the whole intricate process is edited with such intensity that anyone in the audience, regardless of whether or not they have a musical background, feels the rush and taps their feet along to the ceaselessly energetic drum solos as Andrew only beats at it harder and harder. Of course, definitely one of the crucial elements of this picture is its two central performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, which are completely revelatory in their excellence?the emotional roller-coaster between student and teacher with the former's hope/assurance slowly draining away?yet desperation totally escalating? and the latter's uncompromising brutality pushing his students beyond capability and expectancy. What we have is a relationship that culminates in a compellingly angry battle of egos.The screenplay/dialogue moves along with such a sassy, swift pace? obviously complementing the hasty beat of the jazz music that it represents?but also implements a surprising amount of hilarious dry humor beneath all the emotional and philosophical darkness. Right from the very first shot as the film opens up to a long murky corridor with Andrew at the end of it practicing and practicing on his drums, you can tell how gloomy Whiplash is going to become by its prevalent darkened color. Everything (from the crowded streets of New York City to the haunting classroom) is presented with a transparent shade to these environments that would otherwise be brighter. However, by the end, Whiplash's thematic intentions become somewhat ambiguous?is it meant to be a dark critique on impossible ambition (because then its consequences and negative impact are not satisfyingly underlined) or is it an inspiring crowd-pleaser as some critics are pointing out (which is terribly frightening)? The actions and logic of the narrative do eventually begin to reach a troubling level in believability as the film nears its end, but the story isn't meant to be taken absolutely literally. The overall package is more or less a stark metaphor on the dangerous attitude that leads to final triumph but also destroys one's character and relationships in the meantime. "There are no two words in the English language that are more harmful than good job," Terrence claims. A man will never be as definitively great in his craft if he's not pushed to the absolute limit, okay, but what/when exactly is that limit?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash is the story of a dreaming teenage drummer and his interactions with a strict jazz teacher who team up to become some dynamic duo. That would be cliché as it is, but the writer/director tries to go for something different and fails miserably. Thankfully it's short, because there is hardly a single good thing about this waste of reel, except for perhaps a few nice cinematic shots.First of all, JK Simmons as Fletcher. JK is a good actor and plays the role very well, but the writing of his character is some of the worst in modern day cinema. Jazz is a very relaxed and fun genre. Smooth jazz is called smooth for a reason, you know. Fletcher is a jazz teacher who screams in his players face, belittles them in class, and even literally assaults them by throwing chairs at them and punching them in the face. This isn't the army, this is JAZZ. This character would be cartoony in an episode of Spongebob, let alone a live action film supposedly set in the real world. Do you really think people play SMOOTH JAZZ while being threatened and scared to play a single note incorrectly? No, they don't, they need to be calm. In one scene, Fletcher harasses an obese kid with a dumb name and claims he is playing out of key. He isn't, but second guesses himself when Fletcher calls him out. When the kid thinks about it, Fletcher not only calls him fat, but kicks him out of class. Another student had been playing out of key the entire time, and Fletcher says, "I know ____ was actually in key, but not knowing what key you're in is worse than being out of key." Are you kidding me? Of course you'll second guess yourself if a highly respected and very unstable man accuses you of playing out key. And literally the other guy who actually did play out of key gets off with no troubles. Unbelievable and very inconsistent with his character, as a real Fletcher would've given him some sort of punishment. All throughout the movie, Fletcher is belittling Miles, making fun of his dead mom and his depressed father, as if that would realistically motivate me to work with this guy further. If an instructor began making fun of my mom's cancer or my suicidal tendencies, I'd leave immediately and probably file a lawsuit. Again, this is very unrealistic for a character who is instructing a jazz band. Jazz players need to be as relaxed and free flowing as their music sounds, and they shouldn't be constantly on edge because of a sociopath Gunnery Sergeant Hartman of a teacher.Miles Teller's character is an smug, arrogant douchebag, much like the actor himself. I genuinely believed he had some form of autism in the movie. He separates himself from society and even belittles his girlfriend and family members for something he's barely good at. I get that the writer was trying to make it seem like drumming was tearing him apart mentally, as stated later in the movie, but there is a much better way to do it than "you're an idiot and I'm gonna be famous one day!" like he's a 5th grader brat. And then he later on tries to contact his ex-girlfriend, who he called an idiot on their final date, and asks her out despite the fact that he knows she has a new boyfriend. He's an immature child, and not the character we should like. In fact, not a single character is likable in this heap.There are so many more issues within the screenplay that it actually caused me to hit the 1000 maximum word limit, so I am just gonna jump to the ending. The film ends with the worst ending I've seen in a theatrical film this decade. Miles and Fletcher rekindle several months after the incident and team up to play in a new, not related to school jazz recital where Fletcher is the conductor. Right before the recital starts, we essentially learn that Fletcher is a mentally unstable child, who reveals that this entire teaming up was just a ploy to get his revenge on Miles. Yes, a 57 year old man with a job and career tries to get even with an immature autistic 19 year old college freshman. They also made it very clear that this was "the big show" and that the gig could "either create careers, or end careers". So Fletcher's decision to humiliate a 19 year old by intentionally screwing up the entire gig is super villain levels of evil, but not in a good way. In retaliation, Miles decides to one-up Fletcher by going on a six minute drum solo, where the most insulting part of the film comes. The final shot of the film is a close up of Fletcher grinning ear-to-ear and Miles nodding with another smile, implying that these two are back together again. The script even says "...and Fletcher has finally accepted Miles..." What a joke, and proof that something is seriously wrong not only with Fletcher, but this entire movie and probably the writer/director too.</fullReview>

You need your best effort, and more.You won't forget Mr. Fletcher (interpreted magistrally by J.K. Simmons). He will be by your side the rest of your life.

		<shortDescription>Blood, sweat and music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, this will not be fun and games. This much is clear as the camera moves slowly through a dark corridor towards a similarly dark and bare room with a sole drum kid behind which a young man is sweating. Relentlessly ? against his instrument and himself ? he is repeating the same patterns and rhythms, again and again. The distant view of him becomes intimate and then dissolves ? into partial glimpses of his face, hands, drumsticks. There will be much sweat, tears, blood, the drumsticks will become instruments of torture inflicted by the young man to himself. If love for music was the initial motivation to take up this strenuous activity, he has moved far beyond it at the film's outset. Miles Teller plays Andrew, an ambitious young musical student moving into the dark realm of obsession, willing to throw away family, friendship, love in pursuit of that elusive dream and nightmare of being someone special, being remembered, not fading into oblivion when his tombstone is erected. His face will harden and shut and distort itself as he will learn to play the game.A game whose master is Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) a legendary musician turned sadistic teacher who will do anything to achieve perfection, leaving plenty of corpses along the wayside. Soon Fletcher discovers Andrew and recruits him to his elite band in which survival of the fittest is the norm. Andrew, starting out in friendly naivety quickly learns the game, accepts the power struggle, lashes out against his competitors and ultimately overestimates his power. What starts out as a coming of age film about a boy pursuing his dream turns into a thriller in which strong wills battle and only one can survive. If Andrew wants to be the one he has to turn into the other, become Fletcher, lose all scruples, become unashamedly brutal and cruel. Against himself and against others. As in all good thrillers there are various twists and turns and, when all seems to be over, an epic showdown that leaves the viewer shaking. By that time, the lines between good and bad have long been blurred, the distinction become irrelevant, the price to be payed for the dream's pursuit unpayable and at the same time unquestioningly accepted.Whiplash is an unforgiving powerhouse of a film, an uncompromising tale about what trying to be the best entails, how much it can strip you of your humaneness, and about the choices one must make in life. Andrew makes his, has them taken away and restored and, given a second chance, returns to the path that already almost destroyed him once ? or maybe it already did. But it's his choice, he is victim and culprit all in one. Teller plays his role with brutal honestly and he has a frighteningly impressive counterpart in a Mephistophelic Simmons whose Faust ultimately threatens to supplant him. The film never goes for simple morality, it asks questions that we seem to be able to answer easily. But then we see this utterly likable boy find his own answers which are very different from ours and we start wondering whether all this might not be a little more complicated than we though.Director Damien Chazelle tells this story in the frantic rhythm of the jazz that is instrument and fate and abyss of those that fight in this arena, armed with drumsticks that are as deadly a weapon as swords. The images move with the pulse of this throbbing, unrelenting music, fragmenting into long shots and extreme close-ups, a dance of mosaic pieces that becomes its own song. Camera, editing, sound merge into a never-ending beat that accelerates and slows down, frantically races to its climax before it comes to a standstill only to restart itself into a powerful back and forth as the opponents who are also accomplices engage in one last battle. Light and color are part of the package, too: the slightly nostalgic glow of romantic dreams becomes the pale grey of disillusion before turning into the golden light of competition. Who has won and what would be the criteria for winning, what its price. Whiplash sings its own song of life, a life that isn't black or white, a life in which winning might be fatal and the greatest triumph the worst defeat. It has a million equation but no answers. All it offers is blood, sweat, tears. And music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.5/10 So basically, this is "R. Lee Ermey does conductor," and it's therefore as comical as you might imagine that it would be. Initially, the story shows signs of finesse, but it quickly descends into a juvenile, unrealistic, completely-over-the-top portrayal of a purely psychotic individual who'd never have been tolerated by anyone for any length of time.Oh--so he's suspected of causing a suicide. Just one, and seemingly moments before the new guy took the seat. How long has The Terminator been conducting (he looks rather old)? He only recently became completely psychotic? I suppose that it isn't impossible--but it isn't great writing, either.Oh--people just get nailed by big trucks at 40 mph, then, not walk, but *run* away (forgetting that leaving the scene of an accident is a crime that he apparently wasn't held accountable for). Got it.Further, I'm not sure that the awards were warranted, as this is essentially J.K. Rowling (whatever his name is) taking *himself* (based on his prior films) to the extreme. Is this acting, or is this simply his personality?Understand that this is nowhere near as sophisticated a piece of film as it tries to be, but try to enjoy it merely as a piece of snuff--that's essentially all it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited to see this movie on the theater knowing that was a music-themed feature, I was right in that decision. The movie tends to have that short-film soul; it goes straight to the point, from beginning to end, the story is simple but well placed and executed, we see what we need to see, a few main characters and settings, in other words minimal but powerful, this movie cuts all the bells and whistles we tend to see in an Oscar nominee feature to focus on making us feel empathetic with the story.The movie gave us moments of true energy on the screen, the tension we felt from the actors was great and real. J.K. Simmons truly delivers that professor that we feared at school but at the same time the one that we learned the most because he drove us to our very limits. Miles Teller delivers an excellent use of facial expression, he puts us on the spot of what being a student used to be; the want to be the best. Also, Teller gave us an outstanding representation of being a drummer, I applaud the fact that 40% of the soundtrack we hear in the movie was actually him.The movie lacks of great cinematography and camera direction, it's really simple and there is nothing special about it that's why I'm rating it a 9 instead of a full 10.I love the fact that it came from a short-movie and ended being a full feature film nominated and awarded by the Academy without losing it's soul in the process.

		<shortDescription>Fear and loathing in the conservatory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are teachers who want to be liked by their pupils. They try to be kind persons, because a teacher can get better results when there is mutual respect and positive feelings. Music teacher and band leader Terence Fletcher is not such a teacher. His authority is based on fear, humiliation and psychological warfare. That is necessary, he thinks, because it gets the best out of people. The psychological war between Fletcher and his pupil, the young drummer Andrew, is the subject of 'Whiplash'. Fletcher humiliates Andrew, but at the same time stimulates him to become the best drummer ever. Andrew dumps his girlfriend, because he doesn't have time or energy to do something else than learning how to drum. He ignores the pain caused by the bloody blisters during the long hours of practicing. When he almost comes late for an important concert, he crashes a rental car while speeding, stumbles out of the wreck and continues on foot towards the concert hall. But when he realizes that Fletcher has pushed him too far, he decides to put an end to this reign of terror. Revenge and counter-revenge is the result. The film has the characteristics of a thriller, but it is at the same time an exciting account of how far musicians can go to get the best out of themselves. The scenes in which the two protagonists confront each other, are wonderfully intense, even when there is no shouting and insulting or even drumming involved. J.K. Simmons's Oscar for his role of the ruthless maniac Fletcher is completely deserved. Some scenes towards the end feel a bit overdone, but on the other hand, people are capable of extreme acts when pushed to the limit. Afterwards, you can ponder over the questions the movie asks the viewer: how far can you go to find talents no-one knew the existence of? What is the toll you're prepared to pay to outdo yourself? Is an extraordinary accomplishment worth anything?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling film. A feast for the viewer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most compelling films of the last few months. 2015 just ceases to amaze cinematically. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a talented drummer at a New York music school driven to perfection by a domineering music teacher Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher's at times unconventional methods of improving his pupils ability can be construed as bullying. Andrew ditches his girlfriend and concentrates fully on his drumming in order to satisfy the 'bully' and gain entry into an elite class/jazz band and become one of the main players. Teller comes across a bit nerdy and boring. I think it is Fletcher who is the star of the film. Part psycho? His put downs of some of his 'failing' musical students are classic . J.K. Simmons is unknown (to me anyway!) but he steals the movie and deserves recognition. A battle of musical wits that quite literally draws sweat and blood is set between the two central characters. Not a blockbuster by any means but one if not the best film of recent times for its original screenplay and performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for a movie that had 3.3 million budget it doesn't look it. no special effects (not fancy avengers ones anyways). so hopefully that money when straight into Simmons pocket.J.K Simmons carried this movie and in a way i love. pure straight forward honesty even if angry or insensitive. a lot of people in movies and in real life don't have the balls to do that anymore. they just are 2 faced and hide there anger at work to score a paycheck. well i can relate since i get fired all the time for speaking my mind.enough about Simmons aka Fletcher who we will call our antagonist. lets talk about miles Teller aka Andrew. well cast for the role and i had already been groomed to his understated stage presence when i watched the spectacular now where he basically played the same character only not a drummer. i haven't seen him in anything else so i cant be certain of his range but miles teller was well chosen here.Basically u turn on this movie you blink and its over. the stand out best scenes are the ones where Fletcher lays into his class. he really reams them i was in stitch's the entire time. reminded me of myself screaming at team mates in online gaming. Even greater than those scenes is the climax which is best picture worthy. i cant say anymore without ruining it. go watch this movie now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash : "The pace is too fast, you just won't last " !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash deserves all the good critics it received. How not to be carried away by the preposterous and unreasonable pace of Andrew's drum sticks, a young drummer of the Shaffer Conservatory, obsessed with the recognition of his talent ? The film's dynamism itself is designed as a hysterical sequence of notes; but the ensemble of notes is formed by a set of shades of the same notes, making the film panting, almost suffocating, and administering a dose of unsustainable adrenaline. Yet this is exactly what happens to Andrew in his relationship to Fletcher, prestigious professor at the Conservatory.What is emerging is a constant struggle between these two entities: on one side, Andrew, tested, and on the other, Fletcher. The film takes its full extent in the many narrative and emotional breakdowns, because each rhythm set by the instrument immediately becomes a visual rhythm that almost forces the viewer into the torments of its characters. However, in the reflection of Andrew, what drives him, contrary to what we might think, is the break in the rhythm and in relationships. What drives him to play more intensely, until he even bleeds, is a break in the game between him and Fletcher, who encourages him for a while, then suddenly and sadistically discourages him. J.K Simmons plays the conductor, in that he carefully organizes these ruptures that eventually form the film's tempo and the determination of the unresolved Andrew to be unique.Whiplash, tinged with a black humor partition and intense sequences, conducted by the stunning performances of Miles Teller &amp; Simmons, clearly stands out in the Oscars race being already rewarded many times at the tempo of one instrument, almost too proud of itself, paradoxically exhausted by its inordinate ambition, as it demonstrates extreme measure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job." Fletcher (J.K. Simmons)Fletcher and his uncompromising, ninja teaching methods do not include praise for pupils in Whiplash, or in any Marine squad facing a stolid drill instructor. This intense drama about a young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller), who attends a Julliard-like music school, has the advantage of hyperbole?an abusive coach who coaxes performance beyond expectations by verbally and physically pushing his studio band to reach the best they can do.Because Teller was already a drummer before he took this part, the many shots of him drumming at a furious pace as he pursues Buddy Rich's ghost have a real feel, the bloody hands remotely suggesting a Christ-like devotion to perfection. The sacrifices demanded by Fletcher rise above the trite into a moving commentary on the challenges necessary to become great, not just in music but in life itself.When the driven Andrew must cut loose his girlfriend because he sees she'll distract him from his goal of becoming the best drummer, it is apparent that bloody hands and wounded hearts will be the constant companions in the pursuit of greatness.Writer/director Damien Chazelle and DP Charone Meir cut frequently to Andrew's blazing, bloody drummer hands to show the painful grandeur of excellence. We are only too aware that few humans are capable of such extreme passion.The core of Whiplash is the conflict between gentle nurturing (a popular learning philosophy over the last few decades) and the coaching that brooks no weakness, never admits greatness, and sometimes produces a Charlie Parker. Or Max Roach. Or Buddy Rich the apparent inspiration of Andrew's ambition. The film is dominated by Fletcher's take-no-prisoners method whereby he pushes to get performances beyond expectations.Both Simmons as the musical DI and Teller as the ambitious young musician should get Oscar nominations. Whiplash is just that: a head-turning experience."I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success." Andrew</fullReview>

The truth here is that why doesn't the schools administration know what's happening? Even Woody Hayes got fired for slapping the punter.If you like drumming this movie is for you. Good performances. Hard to imagine buying insurance from J.K. Simmons after this role. The many reasons not to like him include the writer directors unnecessary need to lie about the cause of death of a former student. Things work for most of the movie but it becomes laughable moments after a car wreck. That changes the meaning of "Whiplash". The I'll show you, no I'll show you ending gets set up by a chance meeting at a bar? There are plenty of in your face scenes shot digitally with not enough light. The small budget is apparent on the screen. No need to search this out in a theater as it will play well at home very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense performances and a brutal outlook make this a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Whiplash' concerns the efforts of Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), a jazz drummer student who desperately wants to become 'one of the greats'. This desire is fiercely challenged by his perfectionist, borderline emotionally abusive conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). The performances of the two leads are simply fantastic. Miles Teller, relying on small mannerisms and facial tics, is flawlessly able to come across as a highly introverted, yet highly motivated protagonist. JK Simmons on the other hand, excretes aggression and confidence to deliver one of the most terrifying and captivating cinematic roles I've seen in recent years. An almost definite Best Supporting Actor nominee. The film perfectly captures the intensity and ruthlessness surrounding those trying to break into creative industries. As opposed to going down the cliché-ridden path of showing Andrew being gently fostered and motivated into the jazz scene by a kind, caring professor, 'Whiplash' shows the protagonist being relentlessly put down again and again, almost reaching psychological breaking point in the process. In adopting this brutal, cynical approach, 'Whiplash' takes what could have been another generic, bland music-themed film and turns it into an intense psychological study of the lengths one can go to to realise their dreams, giving it all the suspense and potency of any classic Hitchcockian thriller. Must-see viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you have two of the best performers of their generation, a razor-sharp script, and a director with a passion for music? You get Whiplash - one of the most intense, energetic and enormously entertaining films you will see all year. You will sweat, your heart rate will increase and you won't be able to draw your eyes away from the madness happening on screen.The story follows Andrew (Miles Teller) a nineteen-year-old drummer who only has one aspiration - to be one of the greats, no matter the costs. He attends a prestigious music in New York, though is subjugated to the sidelines as back-up for the core players. However, he gets the attention of the school's infamous music teacher Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) and joins his advanced class, where he is exposed to the intensive training/borderline mental torture his ensemble endures for the ultimate pursuit of excellence.This movie is electrifying. Whether it's Simmon's masterful performance that could have been cartoonish, if it wasn't for the nuance he gives his character, or Teller's restrained portrayal full of loneliness and built up frustration. The real stars of the movie is the phenomenal music and editing, building constant tension and even a small sense of dread up until it's breathtaking finale.This movie is a roller-coaster ride, bustling with energy scene to scene. It never let's up in it's 100 minute running time, narrative-wise or stylistically, the film is simply one of the best of the year. Damien Chazelle has crafted a kinetic masterpiece that has put his names down as one of the new directors on the block to keep an eye on. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

I was like: - "Are you kidding me? It is not even close to worth it? How can a film about music be a Best Picture?"Well, I'll remember this evening for the rest of my life! I swear to God that at the moment it Cut to Black, I cried for almost 10 minutes in my bed. Not because it was so sad, or sentimental, or whatever, not at all! Simply because it was a Best Picture, without expecting it.This film is about a drummer who want to be The Great. Fletcher, his instructor, sees some potential in him, so he won't stop at nothing to realize the dream of Andrew. Throughout this movie, you will see the determination of a young drummer who's not trying anymore, but simply BE The Great. We can see how much our dreams can be important in our life, and how much we are willing to sacrifice to achieve them."Best Supporting actor - J. K.

		<shortDescription>The film is based on Chazelle's life but is fiction because reality is realising not everything is possible if we're willing to try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reality television shows like The X-Factor and American Idol have created a culture of humiliation where it is as fun to watch people fail stardom as it is to discover the next great talent. But the behaviour of J.K. Simmons's character in Whiplash is so extreme and over the top it would make Simon Cowell wilt in disbelief. Imagine an episode of The X- Factor where Redfoo repeatedly slaps one of his contestants in the face or Ronan Keating lays down a homophobic slur. That said, the vision of Delta Goodrem in previews of The Voice screaming at young children "I need you on my team!" and telling kids they're mega stars amplifies the pressure and expectations placed on young people to be successful today. The stakes are higher than before because technology like the Internet and Youtube has increased the volume of global talent and shortened the waiting time. With his second feature film Whiplash, writer-director Damien Chazelle addresses the culture of fear and expectations he suffered firsthand. As a drummer in a high school jazz orchestra, his anxiety grew from not playing for fun but necessity. He was isolated by a desire to succeed and pushed by the encouragement of his school conductor, which became the basis of a short film and this feature produced by Jason Reitman. Chazelle draws from his own experiences but also the story of jazz musician Charlie Parker, who used humiliation to shape his career. At sixteen, Parker played poorly one night and had a cymbal thrown at him, which embarrassed him but motivated him to become a legend. The cymbal is mild compared to Whiplash. Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now, Divergent) plays Andrew, a shy introverted jazz drummer playing at an east coast music conservatory who is given a chance to perform in the company of conductor Terence Fletcher (Simmons). The other students look older and heavier and several are African American, subtly conveying Andrew's distance from them. Fletcher is a crackpot, the music equivalent of R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket. He swears at his students, insults them, intimidates them and breaks them. The insults are achingly funny and cruel but the humour leaves little room for plausibility and realism. How has this behaviour gone unnoticed and is the American education system competitive enough to allow students to be bullied into perfection? Seeing Fletcher's methods build fear and uncertainty into the students is still fascinating. A fine sequence sees him trial three students at once on the drums, including Andrew, and the slightest imperfection makes him repeatedly interchange them.Under a miniscule budget of three million dollars, the technical aspects impress. The jazz music is toe-tapping and spectacular and the way the camera compliments the performance scenes by gliding between instruments is confident. The film is also purposeful in creating mood and feeling with the dim lighting and shadows resembling the appearance of a jazz club. At the beginning of the film, a long shot frames Andrew playing in a room at the end of a corridor, which underscores his isolation and loneliness. The camera zooms into his space and reverse cuts to Fletcher standing in the doorway, typifying the arc of Andrew overcoming his aloneness through the arrival of his mentor. One fault is parts of the story have undergone heavy editing. Andrew's inner life, his relationship with Nicole (Melissa Benoist) a girl he builds the courage to ask out, is sidelined and fragmented and a scene where we see his sporty family and relatives doesn't soar because there's little context of these family members besides his dad, a failed writer. These cuts haven't affected J.K's Simmon's brave take no prisoners performance. Through films like Juno and the video game Portal 2, Simmons's gift is effortlessly melding rage and comedy. By playing serious here, no winking, Fletcher is colossal and fearsome and darkly comic. Small gestures, like high-fiving a little girl before he enters class, help humanise Fletcher as a performer himself. The power of Simmons is so great he overshadows the timidness of Miles Teller, who had more expression in The Spectacular Now but the physicality of his performance, including playing the instruments, should not be overlooked. Whiplash looks to distinguish itself from similar rags to riches underdog stories by posturing as an assault on the subject of mediocrity itself. Late in the story, Fletcher signposts his true intentions, explaining how his methods push students as far as possible, believing complacency is damaging to the quality of a performance. Is Fletcher going too far or is he agreeable given the disposability of pop culture today? But the film isn't breaking new ground with its themes and its ending. Its resolutions, like an unstoppable drum solo, are a cover version of the American Dream and a toast to durability. Whiplash is a conventional sports movie and Fletcher, the archetype of the brutal coach or mentor, proves students can sustain their individualism and have the tenacity to overcome pain and reach their potential. On top of Fletcher's tactics, scenes like one involving a car crash strain the believability of Andrew's endurance test. Chazelle says "greatness at any cost" is fundamental to the American character. By channelling his own story, using an actor who looks like him, he is justifying to himself that the pain was worth experiencing. But the liberal ideology of Whiplash, like individualism and willpower, doesn't strengthen the film's realism, it reveals fantasy. The film is based on Chazelle's life but is fiction because reality is realising not everything is possible if we're willing to try. Real life is failure, a concession even reality television has made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drums, drumming and drummer. I precisely put what this film is about.There is a kid in his twenties who joins the so-called best music school in America and it's about how he goes about his passion that is Drums.Drums are percussion instruments that make a lot of noise if not played well. But here, they seem to have been played to the beat.Okay, now let me give this to all the jazz lovers. If you are going to watch with an expectation to learn or know more or to understand jazz music, stay away, please. Except for few mentions of Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Buddy Rich and a few more, this film has not got any jazz. In the garb of jazz, it has got music that is as good as any other film with no greatness added.The movie is more about abuse of power and authority than Jazz for sure. Not one frame I saw can be termed "musical".The acting is superb above all else. The whole outlook is dark and I was very surprised because that's so not music. Perhaps, it deals with dark emotions thus, it is set dark.I am going with a 3/5 for a good one, but only for some good acting. All else is just OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash" is a film that left me breathless and physically exhausted when I got up to walk out of the theater, and all I had done for the past hour and forty minutes was lounge in a theater recliner and watch somebody else work themselves into a sweaty mess. A good film about motivation and determination leaves you humbled, but a great film about the same subjects leaves you emotionally drained and even enraged; enraged from watching others bring the lead character down and even attempt to compromise his or her dreams. The film may even leave you determined to exercise your own dreams out to a fuller extent, not compromising your talents or adhering to requirements, and realizing what makes you happy may not make others happy, but those others aren't you or likely sleeping in the same bed as you."Whiplash" is a contemplative film in that regard; a film that earns every word of praise and every glowing adjective on its theatrical poster and the many accolades it has received. It's a film that gives you the heartbreak of perceived failure and allows you to be affected by the few words of praise the lead character receives as well as every negative drawback and vulgar criticism (and there are plenty here). The film concerns Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a nineteen-year-old first year student at Shaffer Conservatory, a prestigious music school. Andrew is a drummer, but not your typical "I'm in a band drummer;" his goal is to go down as one of the greatest drummers who ever lived, etching himself alongside Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker. At first, we, the audience, may sneer at his dreams, but it's cool; Andrew couldn't care less. When we see him practice until his hands are calloused and bleeding excessively from the tight grip of his drumsticks is when we see his determination is real. When we see him tear through his drumset, banging his sticks angrily on his symbols and throwing his kit across the stage is when we truly realize his drive to be the best he can be.Andrew's entire world is tested when he meets Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an uncommonly strict music teacher, who has no problem making his classmates stay until 2:00AM to get the music notes right or sees anything wrong with throwing a chair at one of his students who can't keep up with his tempo. His personality is vulgar, blatantly calling his students two demeaning twelve-letter words, along with some other homemade curse words himself, giving these kids more discipline than they've ever been granted in their lives. Fletcher doesn't just push kids past their limit; he pushes them into mentally-corrupting realms, boldly stating to Andrew, "there are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'." Beneath an incorruptible drive in Andrew is a tender, soft soul at first, who sheds a single tear when Fletcher vulgarly criticizes him for the first time. "What am I, a double rainbow?," he asks Andrew, spitting and contorting his face in various ways. Fletcher is a no-nonsense guy, and no better to play him than the incorrigible character actor Simmons himself. The man who played a contemptible, vile subhuman in HBO's "Oz" gives probably his most engaging performance yet as one of film's strictest, most uncompromising professors. His intensity is heightened to the point where we, the audience, feel compelled to lift our theater seats, despite them being bolted to the ground, and hurl them at his character, calling him every disgusting name he has called his students.I've said before that Teller is on his way to becoming a truly remarkable actor, after performances in "The Spectacular Now" and "Two Night Stand" show true promise as a human leading male and "Whiplash" will be one of the various used to iterate that point to others. Teller communicates not only the attitude but the mentality and the realism of these characters, becoming not just a person for his films, but an attitude and a personality, throwing himself into the mindset of a dateless loser, a teenage alcoholic, or, in this case, an incomparably determined music student. His performance here is by far his most amazing work."Whiplash" also features a beautiful score and live orchestra music, maybe not in the opinion of Simmons' Fletcher, who would probably ostracize it as a contribution to the downfall of contemporary jazz, but sounds absolutely incredible. The piece of music "Whiplash," played frequently in the film, is a mesmerizing and relaxing piece of music, contrasting the film's breakneck tone. On top of that, the editing style of the film, done by Tom Cross, is a visually arresting art here, consistently captivating us with briskly-paced scenes of literal blood and sweat and close-ups of a wide variety of musical instruments as they are both prepared and played.Much will be made about the ending; some will love it, others will say it's incomplete. I find it to be satisfying, if disheartening. While audiences, after giving it enough thought and credit, will likely be pleased, they may realize a deeper sadness and that sadness is simple ? where is Andrew going after this? Without divulging into spoiler territory, it's something every artist faces after his or her best work and it's a terrifying thought. For a film with such a quiet, almost devastating, ending, "Whiplash" sure gave me one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The journey to pursuing your passions and then some.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since hearing all the positive feedback this film had received from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival, I had my hopes of checking out Whiplash. After my first viewing at my local art house theater, Whiplash didn't just met my initial expectations, but it also surpassed them by a mile. This film contains elements you would expect from a typical musical film and then some.First of all, the writing by Damien Chazelle, showcases a surprisingly excellent screenplay from a sophomoric director. Based off of Chazelle's personal experiences, he displays an electrifying and intense story which follows college freshman Andrew who is pursuing to be world-class jazz drummer who ends up getting more than what he initially bargained for. The pacing is solid with enough going on to keep the plot moving, the dialogue is engaging yet rich with tension, and the direction by Chazelle is simply top- notch.Of course, the biggest praise Whiplash gets on top of it's enthralling screenplay comes from the two main leads played by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Of all the films that Miles Teller has stared in, this is hands down his greatest performance to date and boy this guy can drum. Teller's performance as Andrew captures the raw passion and pain that his character goes through and its as powerful as acting performance can get. Lets not also forget the intimidating J.K. Simmons as Andrew's music instructor Terence Fletcher. Simmons simply gives out a phenomenal performance and he just has an astonishing screen presence every time his character comes to life. Fletcher is a character you can hate yet sympathize with at the same time which already a challenge to pull off by any means.The cinematography for this amazing film is also executed in a stylish fashion bringing out the raw intensity of the story onto the big screen. Plus, the tight-cut editing adds icing to the cake when bringing out the rich tension throughout every musical performance. Speaking of music, the lavish amount of jazz and swing just makes this excellent work of cinema that more entertaining to watch and it is a soundtrack worth multiple listening sessions.I simply cannot praise Whiplash enough than I had already did in this review and I highly urge each and every one of you to seek out this excellent work of film-making whenever it comes to a theater near you. With a brilliant script, phenomenal performances, great camera work, top-notch editing, and some amazing music, Whiplash is one of the best movies of 2014 and will probably end up being one of my personal favorites. Do yourself a huge favor, see Whiplash for yourself and you will guaranteed to leave this film more than satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not miss a beat - no pun intended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2013, writer and director Damien Chazelle attempted to make a small, but innovative movie about a musician and his relationship with a mentor. Unfortunately the funding was denied - so he made a short film to tempt them into funding it instead. It was incredibly well received and immediately given full feature funding - and that movie is Whiplash.Filled out with a deeper story, character study and creativity - the film follows Andrew (Miles Teller), a first-year student at a musical-based college. With aspirations of becoming a drummer who will be remembered, he is chosen to join the school band, by Mr Fletcher (JK Simmons) - a ruthless teacher that pushes students beyond limits to make them realise their potential, often to the point of stretching his humanity.Like a boxer tapes up their bloodied fist, Andrew tapes up his fingers as he practises harder than ever before to gain Fletcher's approval. Much like the boxing films, we track Andrew on the difficult, vigorous journey to become the best.It's a basic plot, but the reliance on the characters pays off, and incredibly shot in just nineteen days - it is overall cinema perfection.Fletcher, portrayed by JK Simmons is close to what Pogue Colonel is in a Full Metal Jacket; raw, terrifying and bursting with energy. Starring in the lead role, Miles Teller is outstanding in the enduring journey to be the best under his dreaded-teaching.It doesn't matter if you are a Jazz fan or not, the film is innovative enough to engage you. Overall, Whiplash does not miss a beat (no pun intended).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it does not even need a Best Picture win for this description. Damien Chazelle's "Whiplash" was one of the big players this awards season mounting in three Academy Award wins. J.K. Simmons basically dominated the supporting actor (so happy for him, he is such a likable guy, but was he really supporting?) category from start to finish and Chazelle himself managed a writing nomination with the Academy. Given he just turned 30 and has a bright future ahead of him, I am sure he can live without the director nomination. "Whiplash" is a great film. It starts off good, but quickly has you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. They kept it at clearly under 2 hours, which helped a lot as it would have sucked if they had filled the film with unnecessary scenes. This way now, it's really all essential from start to finish.There were a few scenes I struggled initially, like the protagonist breaking up, but in retrospective I have to say it all makes sense now. His self-confidence grows with his dedication for his art mounting in the explosion of his anger when he physically attacks Fletcher (Simmons). Fletcher is possibly this year's most interesting character. No black-and-white as he walks the fine line between genius and insanity in every single scene. One great example would be how he talks to a little girl and asks her gently if she wants to join his band one day and in the next scene he talks to his band the way he always does. The monsters shows again. The ending was great too. I was a bit unsure when they missed a good ending scene when Fletcher asked Teller's character if he wants to fill in in his new band, but the actual ending was at least as good. Fletcher really gets his Bird in the end. By the way, I wondered if he would shoot the young man on stage (nice "Birdman" reference). Everything seemed possible, but the path of the wrong sheet was a brilliant one as well.No doubt that Teller is a real competitor for best actor under 30 right now after his performance here. He would have deserved a lead actor Oscar nomination as well, over Cumberbatch for example. The new "Fantastic Four" makers seem to agree. And Simmons is just a force of nature in this film. He also appeared in Chazelle's short film that this is based on, so great choice for him back then and good job on Chazelle for not giving the part to anybody else. Not many out there who would have been as good. And with said short story background, this project was a true success story that goes way back to a stroke of genius by Chazelle.Now, if you are interested in drumming, let me suggest you Richard Jenkins' "The Visitor", a more silent approach on the issue. Or you could maybe also call it a "Black Swan" for males. Or Fletcher could be categorized as a more radical Dr. House. Anyway, back to this one here. It's my number one or two of the year right now (against Cotillard's Oscar nominated film) and I cannot recommend enough watching it. You will not be disappointed. It's been a while since I had a theater that applauded after the end of the film, but this one did and it was oh so deserving. Each scene a winner and this movie is the perfect example of how a great script is much much more important than a cast that includes the best actors of the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiplash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film and thought it looked good and unusually dark, I liked the fact that the star of Spider-Man was getting a more leading role also, and with award nominations and high praise from critics for it I knew it was a must see. Basically nineteen year old Andrew Neiman (Rabbit Hole's Miles Teller) attends the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory music school as a first-year jazz student, his skill is drumming, he inspires to be a great drummer like Buddy Rich, and one day he gains the attention of respected professor and conductor Terrence Fletcher (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning J.K. Simmons), only for him leave the room with no word. Andrew elsewhere olives with his father Jim (Aliens' Paul Reiser) and they often go to the cinema, it is there he is often served by college student Nicole (Melissa Benoist), and he asks her out and they start dating, and not long later Andrew is approached by Fletcher, he is accepted into his band as an alternative for core drummer Carl Tanner (Nate Lang). Andrew arrives early to his first session, Fletcher arrives and the class practise the Hank Levy piece "Whiplash", it is during this that Andrew sees what he is getting himself, as Fletcher is abusive towards the students, mocking and insulting, and when he hears instruments off tune or rhythm off tempo he will hurl a chair, slap and berate. Andrew is determined to impress Fletcher, so he practises constantly at home with his drum kit, to the point where his hands bleed due to sores from the drumsticks, and he breaks up with Nicole thinking she will distract him, and next Andrew attends a local jazz competition, with a misplaced music sheet he claims he can play "Whiplash" from memory and he is promoted to main drummer, however core drummer Ryan (Austin Stowell) from a former class replaces him and he is demoted to alternative. In a following class session Fletcher tearfully talks about talented former student Sean Casey who has died in a car accident, after this the band rehearses Juan Tizol piece "Caravan", but Carl struggles with tempo, so Fletcher keeps him, Andrew and Ryan in the classroom for several hours until they can perfect their playing, Fletcher finally gives core drummer position to Andrew. Andrew makes his way to a competition, but problems arise as first the bus he is on breaks down, so he rents a car determined to make the performance, arriving late he is kicked out by Fletcher for forgetting his drumsticks, Andrew drives back to the car rental office to retrieve them, speeding back his car is hit by a truck, he survives the accident and crawls from the wreckage badly injured covered in spots of blood, he arrives on stage but is unable to play properly, Fletcher tells him he is "done", and Andre attacks him in front of the audience. Andrew is expelled from Shaffer Conservatory music school, a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey contacts and explains that Sean hanged himself after suffering severe anxiety and depression, Fletcher's abusive methods are being blamed, Sean's parents want to stop him teaching, Andrew testifies and Fletcher is fired. Months later Andrew sees Fletcher performing in a club, they drink together and Fletcher explains his behaviour, he wants to achieve greatness which is why he pushes his students beyond expectations, he invites Andrew to join his band to perform at a festival concert, Andrew agrees and wants to invite Nicole, but she reveals she has a new boyfriend and cannot come. On stage before the performance, Fletcher tells Andrew he knows he testified against him, the band then begin playing a piece Andrew does not have the music sheet of, leaving him humiliated on stage as he tries to keep up with the tempo. But as Fletcher makes a speech Andrew interrupts with his drumming and he begins playing "Caravan", he cues the rest of the band to play along and Fletcher follows suit, Andrew continues an extravagant dumb solo, playing non-stop, Fletcher is first angry, but during the play of "Whiplash" he supports him throughout, and when Andrew finishes he finally gets a nod of approval from Fletcher. Also starring Chris Mulkey as Uncle Frank and Damon Gupton as Mr. Kramer. Teller proves a fantastic newcomer as the student who will not give up on his drummer dreams and making an impression to his teacher, but for me the film absolutely belongs to Simmons who is a sensational tour de force as the foul-mouthed maestro who thinks nothing of bringing his students to literal bloodshed to make the perfect music, the duo work fabulously against each other, I agree Reiser could have had a bit more to do, but he cannot stand up against the other two. This gives the often made "inspirational teacher" plot a good kick in the face, it's like a cross between School of Rock and Full Metal Jacket, with a drillmaster like composer getting the head of the hero drummer, it is a great combination of terrific music pieces, bad language and blistering mind games and a marvellous script, it will keep you gripped all the way to the showy ending, I cannot say enough much I loved this film, an exceptional music drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay Damien Chazelle, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction for Damien Chazelle. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie works so well in that it does what a good film should. It provokes thought and discussion.I went to watch this with my wife at the cinema and then out for a meal. After a decade of marriage and three kids, date night sometimes becomes a chat about jobs, money and the children. After watching this film we were both so intrigued that we chatted about it for an hour and that chat morphed into a chat about existence and triggers and passion in life.I don't want to give too much away but there is a conversation near the end that meant we both interpreted the ending in different ways and that is where our conversation began. And it didn't stop, the more we talked the more we got into different themes raised by the film.Now, it may read as if I'm thanking this movie for giving me something to chat to the wife about; that is not really the case. What I wanted to say is that this is a wonderful film because our conversation was not "what was good and bad in the film?" it was "what did it mean to you?".Great art should provoke thought and conversation between it's viewers. Whiplash does just that. It takes a simple story and lays it out in equally simple terms, but the narrative runs a lot deeper so does the subsequent deconstruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teller &amp; Simmons give Oscar-worthy performances in this blood, sweat and tears exercise into the passion of music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHIPLASH (2014) ***1/2 Miles Teller, JK Simmons, Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell, Nate Lang, Chris Mulkey. Teller gives an amazing performance as a steadfast talented drummer who enrolled in a fiercely competitive music conservatory in New York City faces not only his inner will to be the best but his most unlikely mentor, his taskmaster instructor (Simmons at his career best), a sadistical no-nonsense fascist who drives fear as a wedge between achieving his goal as well as instilling a darker side he never knew existed. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle in a stunning debut spares no one from the at-times hard to watch brow-beating, haranguing and general unease put upon Teller by Simmons (all three deserve Oscar nods) proving that blood, sweat and tears into something you love (and crave) just may be your downward spiral nightmare instead of a dream fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JK Simmons is the ONLY reason to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiplash chronicles a jazz drummer's tumultuous relationship with a volatile instructor. While this is well acted and shot beautifully, Whiplash fails to catapult itself to greatness with bogging down its story with rather wooden supporting characters and a slow as molasses storyline. Whiplash tells the story of Andrew, a jazz drummer coming into a cutthroat art school and his instructor, Terrence Fletcher, an off the wall and emotionally abusive instructor. The strengths of Whiplash lie solely in the hands of J.K. Simmons. Simmons delivers a tour de force performance, turning a fiery rage into something inspiring for our lead, Miles Teller. Simmons has some truly great scenes, spouting off profanity laced rants when trying to bring out the best in Andrew. The scenes with Simmons send the film into overdrive, making you want to know what happens next. However, this feeling of excellence on screen quickly turns into boredom as we see Miles Teller try to captivate us the same way his co-star did and falters. At the end of it all, this comes down to talent. J.K. Simmons sets a high bar for his co-stars, and this actually ends up hurting the film because of his performance. Miles Teller seems as if he can't keep up in scenes with Simmons and rather than captivating us with his relentless drumming until his blood hits the sweat filled drum kit, it actually ends up feeling as if he is trying too hard to top his co-star in regards to intensity. This creates for an uneven film, one that never truly becomes the masterpiece it wants to be. Despite these lesser qualities, Whiplash does feature some truly great scenes of Simmons berating his students with some of the best delivered insults this side of Full Metal Jacket. Damien Chazelle does showcase his talents, lingering on the physical and emotional tolls that the environment takes on Andrew and other students. Despite this quality, Chazelle fails to connect his characters to his audience. But one thing that won't be lost in translation is where these characters are and how competitive it is. Quite honestly, I feel this worked better as a short film. There is simply not enough for audiences to latch on to or enough for them to care about. But one thing is for sure, J.K. Simmons is ON FIRE in this film and delivers one of the best performances of his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Nieman is a shy freshman in the Schaefer Conservatory of Music in New York City. He does not have friends as he is always obsessively practicing on his drums. He catches the attention of a notoriously hard- driving teacher Terence Fletcher. Fletcher recruits Andrew to join his studio jazz band. There, Fletcher pushes Nieman to perfect playing of his instrument with an abrasive instruction style that teeters on military drill sergeant abuse, both physically and emotionally. Will Andrew make it through or will he snap under the pressure?Miles Teller is a young star on the rise. He was in three other films this year alone, "That Awkward Moment", "Divergent" and "Two Night Stand." He is set to be seen as Mr. Fantastic in the reboot of The Fantastic Four next year, along with four other films. "Whiplash" proves that he is also a serious actor to reckon with. As the drums prodigy Andrew, Teller looks like he mastered playing that drum set for real for this difficult role. Unlike the piano, it is hard to fake playing the drums. His passion in playing is palpable from across the screen.J.K. Simmons, whom many of us only know as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter Parker's boss, in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films, plays the irascible Mr. Fletcher, a teacher who is never satisfied with only good enough. He plays a hateful character who tended to exceed his boundaries as a mentor, but Simmons imbues Fletcher with other layers so we do not only see him as just the villain. Be it in his expletive-laden tirades or with just one penetrating stare, Simmons drips a malevolence we all feel."Whiplash" features some glorious jazz performances since this is about a jazz band. I personally do not like jazz so much, but the precision of the playing and the richness of the music is hard to resist. The perfectly-edited scenes showing the band as they played the most formidable-looking sheets of music had the vigor and energy of a sports match. That super-intense final scene alone will literally keep you at the edge of your seat. The audience in the theater where I watched erupted into spontaneous applause when it ended.This is certainly not just another "Mr. Holland's Opus" or "Music of the Heart". Writer and director Damien Chazelle gives us the same basic student-teacher drama and beautiful music, but presented his story in a most unexpectedly disturbing, suspenseful, violent and even horrific way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I don't know about you all, but if my college band professor slapped me around like that and degraded me like that, I would have beat his ass in front of everyone. GO ON then! Kick me out. F*** it! That tight black T shirt and shaved head ain't gonna stop me from F***'in you up! Punk a** had probably never been in a fight in his LIFE! Scrawny little drum student takes him down on stage in front of everybody... I was like "GET HIS ASS!!" What more could it possibly hurt if you choose to go all the way with it at that point?Intimidating that trombone player, the fat kid, was pretty f'd up. But really this is some pretty contrived S***. OOOhhh the pressure!! Playng until you Bleeeed... what horsepucky! I know many FINE drummers that went through the shizz and NEVER came out with wounds like THAT from playing!And That Final scene... Great drumming! Beautiful Arrangement! BUT!!! Didn't you all kind of expect Fletcher to pull something like that. Throw some chart the kid ain't ever seen before and be like "HAAAhaaaaaa! I will now make you look like Poooooo!! Vengenance and Victory is MINE!! You will SUCK and walk off the Stage with your head held in SHAME!! BUT! Then! He goes NOO! I will GO back up there and SHOW YOU ALL!! - Pssh....

		<shortDescription>This brings the art of music down to the level of sports</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throwing a chair, slapping a music student repeatedly in front of his class in rehearsal simply because the teacher doesn't know how to teach rhythm. This movie brings the art of music down to the level of sports sadly. There are already enough bad teachers out there, we don't need a training film for them. The guy isn't a "hard teacher", he's just an asshole. Anyone knows that a good teacher can solve simple problems like this very quickly and knows that hitting a student isn't the answer. But this screenplay is an amateur work and sought out this method to evoke drama than showing someone who was a real teacher who was passionate about the craft and found a better way to work with students. But hey, showing a kid get slapped around gets you off, then this hazing film is for you. It's sure to play on your Picure-in-Picture along side wresting with you and your buddies pausing to say, "Wait...watch this..." and the kid gets slapped and they all say, "awesome!" and have another beer. Too bad IMDb doesn't allow zero stars. Who green-lighted this project, someone's family have a lot of money to fund it? Who's paying for all this over the top reviews of this piece of trash?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why make a Jazz movie and only cast white people?Make the movie about classical music or cast black people. How hard is that?If the movie had monsters or robots to distract us, it would be easier to not notice that everyone with major speaking roles is white. This movie would be far more interesting, even with the same functional dialog, if the leads were both black women, and the music lessons were being kept a secret from our fascist alien robot overlords. The inhumanity of the mentor to build the humanity of the hero, to spite the inhumanity of the robots. Instead we have a movie that endorses the abusive gravy-training of children.
