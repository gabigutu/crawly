		<shortDescription>If you liked "Cube" or "Event Horizon," you'll like MORGAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film MORGAN is one that you'd file under decent attempt. Directed by Ridley's son, Luke Scott, you wonder if the apple doesn't fall far from the tree or the talent gets passed down trough genes, well, don't expect MORGAN to be on the same level as Ridley's "Alien," that's for sure, but again, a decent attempt is what it is, the closest to a compliment I can give the film at this point.Kate Mara plays a corporate risk management officer, a troubleshooter, and she's sent to a top secret location to investigate and evaluate a recent accident, she's supposed to be there to find out what went wrong and judge the asset in terms of the overall profit. At this top secret location, scientists have successfully created what is perceived to be the perfect human (Anya Taylor-Joy) but turns out, she comes with her own set of unpredictable threats.What I can appreciate about MORGAN is that it takes familiar concepts from the world of science fiction and makes it its own. Creating life out of nothing or creating a life that's flawless has always been a fascination for ages. The film has its own way of addressing that. It's not perfect but the build up, the intensity, and the way things escalate as soon as situations go sideways, they're all well-paced and shot quite nicely. Definitely the one that stands out the most is young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, she already impressed me in "The Witch" earlier this year, and so her cold, calculating, fearsome performance in MORGAN only solidifies her reputation as the latest incredible force to be reckoned with. Better watch out for that one, she's going to go places. With its ensemble cast and its emphasis on keeping you guessing till the very end while wowing you with fight sequences and a big reveal, MORGAN is just the right dose of horror/sci-fi/thriller for us fans of such films as 1997's "Cube" or "Event Horizon" -- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Sci-Fi Horror Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Morgan", starring Kate Mara-House of Cards, Fantastic Four_2015; Anya Taylor-Joy- Atlantis_tv, The Witch; Michelle Yeoh-Strike Back_tv, Tomorrow Never Dies and Paul Giamatti-Straight Outta Compton, San Andreas.This is a sci-fi horror thriller directed by Luke Scott-this is his first time to direct a feature movie. Oh yeah, he is also the son of Ridley. The story involves a group of scientists/doctors that are trying to gene splice a new type of human. Michelle is the doctor in charge and the experiments are conducted in a secure, underground bunker. The doctors have had several failures before Anya/Morgan seems to be the ultimate winner. Anya has developed mentally and physically way beyond her physical age of 5-she looks like a teenager. The only problem is Anya seems to be having anger issues and when she gets mad, someone or some animal usually gets hurt-that is why she is confined to the underground bunker. After the latest temper fit-she tore out a doctor's eye-corporate headquarters sends Kate, their top risk management consultant, to figure out what should be done and then do it-you know, give Anya a sucker or terminate her. Guess which one Kate chooses? Paul is an evaluation expert that is also sent in to check up on Anya and he seems to agree with Kate. Of course, Anya does not agree with their assessment and makes a break for freedom. That is when the fun begins. There are some good martial arts fight scenes-Anya can go toe to toe with any adult at the compound-and there is a nice plot twist at the end of the movie that I did not see coming. It's rated "R" for extreme violence-have you ever seen a person kill a deer with their bare hands?-and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 32 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpredictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a lot of unexpected twists and I was pleasantly surprised. While you're watching the movie you have a prediction and then slowly change it as the movie progresses, and they did a great job foreshadowing while leading your mind down a different path, so they could trick you. I appreciated the small amount of cast members, they all brought a lot to the movie, but nothing about the movie was confusing. It made it easy to find someone to relate to. The movie started with action, and then immediately slows down and allows the audience to relate to the characters on a emotional level. Then picks back up towards the middle/end and it was just fabulous, and loved how it slowly brought out the truths in the movie. The actor who plays Morgan is simply beautiful &amp; did a fabulous job making the audience believe she was just an innocent science experiment. Lee worked for corporate in this movie, and does a fabulous job being cold as corporate workers are often portrayed. Obviously, Morgan was the main character in this movie but personally I feel as if they almost all equally important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing beginning and poor plot development ruined this movie.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a girl named Morgan who created by a very talented scientist but after made this creature there are lots problem happen around this girl. Lee Weathers must decide whether or not to terminate an artificially created humanoid being. There some other problems happened in this story but this is the theme of this movie. this is a science fiction movie and there are lots of experiments happened in this and lots of explanation of them. But the main thing is do a humanoid creature and the creature is very intelligent and this is a threat for humanities and you have shut down this.this is not as common story line but the theme is very common and the central character is very similar to any other science fiction movie. But the main problem is it's slow paced build up and the plot development. The first half of the movie is very slow and the director takes unnecessary time to build up the story and take the audience to the center. There are lots of information and explanation about the experiment but these are took so much time. The plot is a science fiction but the director had to maintain the pace of the movie. The first half is totally made of poor direction. The second half is little bit faster but another problem is the story contained too many subplot and effects in the second half which are very difficult to digest in small time. Plot development is totally missing in the whole movie. The character development is another problem in this movie. Any of these characters has no clarification or connection to the others and I literally found no explanation why the scientist get wrong and what is the main reason for creating Morgan. Kate Mara and Paul Giamatti were trying but the script give them nothing to execute any acting glance. Sometimes the director confused how he end up the story and conclude something positive. if you are a hardcore sci fi fan than this is a fair choice for you otherwise avoid this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but misses out on potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan starts with a simple premise of the moral and ethical implications of genetically crafting a biological being from scratch. Even if such a being looks and acts human, is it? Is the being a "she" or an "it"?and does the being have rights or autonomy, or can it be owned like a pet, or an iPhone? Based on nothing more than the trailers, the movie struck me as a sort of biological&nbsp;/ genetic mirror of Ex Machina. That turns out to be true to an extent, but Morgan doesn't do as good a job of exploring the philosophical question or examining the humanity of the being. The question is sort of posed, and then quickly falls aside as Morgan turns into more of a blood and guts action flick.There is a twist at the end that I actually didn't see coming. My son says it was obvious early on, but the first hint I got was only moments before the truth of the twist was revealed.I enjoyed the movie?and I recommend you go see it. I just feel like there was much more potential there to really dig into the philosophical issues and ethical debates of creating a genetic hybrid.I had a chance to speak to director Luke Scott after seeing Morgan, and we dove into those issues a bit further. Scott told me that in his opinion the basic premise of Morgan is entirely plausible. "A lot of the background science?of course it's a fantasy that we made?but a lot of the background science is rooted in truth." We talked some about the similarities and differences between the premise of Ex Machina and the premise of Morgan?a cybernetic android being versus a genetic hybrid biological being. Scott shared his belief that the technical possibility of creating something as advanced as the android in&nbsp;Ex Machina is far beyond our abilities, but Morgan, and the ability to create a biological being, is within our reach."The&nbsp;science is there," explained Scott. "The only thing holding us back is a moral question." It is a valid and important moral question, too. If a company like Monsanto can create genetically modified seeds to produce healthier or more bountiful crops and&nbsp;own a patent on that seed, would we&nbsp;allow a genetic engineering company to craft healthier or more capable gene pools and own a patent on those genes? Could we create a society where those with the financial resources are able to purchase superior genetics?thereby artificially widening&nbsp;the gap and creating a population of genetic "Haves" and "Have Nots"? Or, would we deem a genetically modified or engineered being to be&nbsp;less than human?a thing or creature that can be owned, rather than a sentient being with rights? Those are all great questions to explore, but Morgan really just scratches the surface of&nbsp;them.I asked Luke Scott what's next on his horizon, and he let me know he's working on a project that also comes with a moral and ethical dilemma, but this one is based on a true story. Scott told me he is working on a script based on a book describing the story of the Donner Party?a&nbsp;group of homesteading pioneers that got caught in bad weather and stranded on a glacier and had to resort to cannibalism to survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A corporate risk assessor is called in to determine whether to terminate an artificial being after an incident. This tag-line may make you think of an intelligent movie that perhaps delves into the nature of emotion and whether they can be simulated by an AI. And, this is what Morgan delivers?in its first half anyway.Kate Mara takes the lead in Morgan as the aforementioned assessor through whose eyes we see the experiment into artificial life gone wrong. A remote estate in the middle of nowhere provides the setting with a team of scientists shut off from the outside world as they attempt to develop synthetic life. Mara's Lee Weathers probes into the pseudo-family who seem a little overprotective of their creation and it isn't long before the cracks begin to show.The first half of the movie presents an intriguing analysis of emotion and whether they can be truly emulated by an AI. Paul Giamatti enters as a psychoanalyst who is tasked to determine Morgan's viability. In this interview scene, Morgan asks if artificial life can only perceive emotions as a preconditioned response to a given event and cannot truly simulate the complexity experienced by humans. There is talk of the 'correct' emotional response from the AI that hints at programming rather than feeling and this is a fascinating exploration. However, Morgan quickly runs out of steam with this and shifts tack rather abruptly to a formulaic action movie. That isn't all bad as the action is quite suspenseful but it's disappointing if you wanted something deeper.The second half of the movie is consumed with the scientists' protection of their prodigy and it all seems so familiar that it's like watching Ex Machina again. The parallels with this earlier movie are stark but perhaps improved upon somewhat. The woodland setting makes for some good location shots and the cast as a whole do a good job. Boyd Holbrook, the team's chef, stands out as the human element of the movie but is underused and doesn't quite add the contrast to the artificial that he could have.Returning to the comparison with Ex Machina, Morgan takes the formula and improves upon it by twisting the ending so we're given a more satisfying conclusion. Although the final revelation may dawn on you a short time before it happens, it's interesting nonetheless, and much better than Ex Machina's limp finale.Morgan isn't quite a thinking movie and it isn't quite a fully- fledged action movie. It's a little of both and doesn't quite make the successful merger that it could. It's a good 90-minutes' entertainment but it's all been done before so there is little new here. Take it for what it is and you'll enjoy it but will probably forget about it by tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but lacking emotional connection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moran is a fun, entertaining thriller that kept me engaged for the entire 90 minutes. I probably would have rated it a bit lower if it weren't for the clever twist ending that I honestly didn't see coming. In fact, that alone makes me want to re-watch the movie to pick up on clues that were sprinkled throughout the movie.Anya Taylor-Joy is well cast as Morgan and she does a good job expressing the conflicting and confusing emotions of an AI human who is only five years old and still learning. After watching this and The Witch, I look forward to future Taylor-Joy movies.However, Morgan would have been improved with better character development in the supporting cast. Or maybe just pare down the size so we could feel sympathy for them. Paul Giamatti's character for instance, wasn't much more than an extended cameo and could have been eliminated. I would have loved to have seen more of the day-to-day life that Morgan lived at the institute, how she was treated, and how she related to the staff. As it is, we only see Morgan as she is presently with just a few video clips of her as a "child". More insight into her five years of life would have been fascinating. So while I was entertained for the entire film, I never felt any real emotional connection that would have made Morgan awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More moral discussion than horror, Morgan fails to deliver suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture it, flashing lights, eerie music and images of an artificial life being created on a giant screen. Paints the idea of a science fiction horror movie right? Yeah that's what I thought when I saw the trailer for Morgan. However, Hollywood is known for fooling us with their editing and therefore I return to my viewing spot once more. Let's get startedLIKES ? A true science fiction plot ? Decent acting ? Twist in the endTo quote a friend, "We seldom get a true science fiction movie that isn't drowned out by CGI action scenes and grotesque monsters." Fortunately, Morgan defies that trend and dives deep into the core of the genre, focusing on the scientific process in all its details. In a script laden with scientific jargon, one will return to a college biology course sprinkled with a genetics topping. But the natural science pales to Morgan's primary focus of the ethics involved with creating life and trying to control it. Much of the film revolves around the small band of scientists arguing about Morgan's role in life and what the future holds for their creation. It's another black and white debate between parties, with some slight character development thrown in to add some depth. As mentioned the film centers on scientists trying to rationalize the ethics of their creations. So it's probably important to have a good cast to bring the roles to life right? In my opinion, the team did okay, but it wasn't the most earth shattering performances to grace the screen. Kate Mara led the team playing a monotone role that while flat, held some mystery to it. While she certainly was able to look mean and perform stage combat, I wanted to see more of her character to round things out. Anya-Taylor Joy as Morgan certainly has the sociopathic role down and could easily play the next serial villain in a crime drama show. The other assembled casts did a smashing job on their part, both looking and playing the part of obsessive scientists to quite impressive levels. But perhaps the biggest like of the movie was the twist in the end. In terms of the plot, there is more than meets the eye to some of the characters and the mystery begins to unravel as things heat up. You'll have to get to the end of the film before the pieces fall together, but those with open eyes may pick up hints if they watch carefully. In addition, the movie actually gets a twist in genre at the end, turning into a part action movie with surprisingly violent stunts. While certainly cheesy this change of pace makes for a semi-exciting climax that relieves the movie of its drab pace. DISLIKES: ? Boring, slow pace ? Not a horror movie or suspenseful ? Graphic Torture Morgan's message about the mistakes made when playing God are beaten over the head, but the package it's delivered in was so dull at times. Sure scientific minds may get caught up in the jargon and scientific ideas, but the team focused too much on the scholastic and not enough on the entertainment. Surely the mystery element could make up for it, but I found little mystery in this movie other than when Morgan would go nuts, what would happen to her, and of course the twist I don't want to ruin. If you're into the moral dilemmas and high grade vocabulary this won't bother you, but you might want to bring a pillow in case science wasn't your cup of tea. When the monotonous discussion eventually stops and the system begins to fail, I thought the suspense would pour in. Wrong again. Despite the dark hallways painted in red, there wasn't much outside of Morgan's creepy close ups that one would find unsettling. I apologize for sounding like a broken record, but this movie lacks in thrills or suspense until the final fifteen to twenty minutes. When it finally rears its head, the suspense comes in the form graphic torture, that involves brutal mauling, mindless shooting, and a little kung fu to sweeten the wet meat deal. I'll admit some of these moments are fitting, however it also felt hastily wrapped up into an anticlimactic ending (like the ending to American Horror Story Season 4). The VERDICTMorgan held a lot of potential, but this reviewer felt much of it was lost in the direction it took. While I appreciate the attempts at being a true science fiction movie and preaching the importance of morals in discovery, it certainly failed to deliver the promised thrills. Such a shame considering they had a decent cast and setting to bring those horrors to life, but you can't hit a home run all the time right? I can't recommend this film for the theater, but you might give this one a shot at home when it hits Redbox in a few months. Instead find your local showing of Don't Breathe and get your thrills from that. My scores:Drama/Horror/Mystery: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I cannot recall a movie to go downhill as badly as this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, there are very heavy spoilers in this, because to talk about the film properly, that's what has to happen.I was really excited for this movie because of both the premise sounding like there could be a load of cool concepts within it, and the cast. Ridley Scott's involvement did have me concerned - I unfortunately have only really had bad experiences with Ridley Scott bar The Martian - but I still saw it.The majority of the first part of the film, where it takes its time to explore the facilities and who everyone is and what their role is in Morgan's wellbeing is nice, with there being many characters that the actors do so well in adapting. The overall design of the film is strong, with the Scott's showing a clear expertise in how to make a film look pretty and have high production quality in terms of sets and style.This is where my positive outlook REALLY goes out the window, and from now on it's all rage. The film does away with a cool concept of the scientists being emotionally attached to this thing they've made, and then makes it into the film of smart people doing dumb things i.e. not increasing any security after the incident in which Morgan brutally stabbed out a anothers eye, allowing a deliberately provoking psychologist to go in unprepared and unprotected (spoilers, that character dies), immediately taking the restraints off her when the last thing she remembers was them agreeing to kill her and telling her she's worthless, or not teaching her anything that would be worthy to know for functioning in the real world (which is the 'explained' purpose of the program). Addition is the fact that certain characters are killed for almost no reason; I mentioned the lady who got her eye stabbed out played by a wasted Jennifer Jason Leigh...we never, EVER find out what provoked her to do this, or kill her as she does later, which is bad writing. Others I'm thinking, "yes that person deserved that"/"Wait, why that guy?"/"Why's this person killing this person?", which all builds up to a twist that is so bad that I saw it in the first 5 minutes but just didn't want to believe. I'll talk about it at the end.This film is mess; a hot mess that wastes so much of its cast. The best things in the film are the Cinematography, the visual style and that Anya Taylor-Joy, Toby Jones and Rose Leslie were really trying to add so much more than had, and succeeded because they are majorly talented. However, if you are going to watch this, wait for it to be on TV.OK, twist: The only performance I had a real issue with in the film was Kate Mara, as whilst she is a very quirky, fun actress, the part is completely standoff-ish and emotionless. She's less emotional than Morgan, and at this point I could see she wasn't a risk assessment analyst but likely another experiment. At the end of the film, they reveal that the L3 (lee) is superior to the M4, and she was "perfect" meaning she was indeed another experiment. The problem with this is that entire movie I was on the side of the scientists, and even Morgan, because of the personality they exhibited and that they weren't a blank slate, and also...they were in the right so often and things were made worse by the actions of the company. It also makes me ask a bunch of questions, such as: - If the L3 was perfect, why bother making Morgan? What was the fault that needed correcting or whatever? - If that was the sole purpose of the visit, why did so many other characters HAVE to die? Lee murders two people, including a cook that had no role to play in the main story; so much for "perfect". - What purpose does Lee have to the company? Weapon? Extra help? Profit? If it's any of those, how and why? - How does NO ONE pick up on any of the obvious hints of what's going on? She speaks fluent Chinese to the Chinese doctor on the project despite being there "not long", and knows so much info the doctors don't, has the ability to survive a long fight with Morgan and clumsily proclaims her job's to kill Morgan.The whole film I didn't want Lee to win. I'm serious, I totally sided with the 'villain', and that flip at the end put a really sour taste in not just my mouth, the audience I saw it with. And...I end there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - never breaks from the mold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the trailer, I had high hopes for Morgan. The ideas looked interesting, and the movie starts off pretty strongly. There's an eerie ambiance, and a peculiar mystery being set up without the usual amount of exposition, which is a bonus!The main trouble for me was the lack of experience behind the camera. As director Scott's and writer Owen's first proper feature film, there was never quite the unique spark of originality that a movie like this needs. Being a mystery, it's laden with twists, most of which you can see coming ages before they do (especially the big one). But because you're never surprised by what happens, there's very little tension built up because you can predict the direction of the film.Though the gist of the story is intriguing, it hinges on the characters - which didn't really work. The acting is mostly decent - Mara is pretty weird right from the start - you know there's something hidden about her. Taylor-Joy also does a fairly good job following her fantastic performance in The Witch, but her character (despite being the most interesting one) is fairly undeveloped and surprisingly shallow. Jones is brilliant, his character deserved a much bigger role, but the turning point in the film comes from Giamatti. His scene where he interviews Morgan feels so unnatural, unrealistic and unmotivated - aggression coming from nowhere, with predictable consequences that set the tone for the remainder of the movie.So basically, it feels like a dumber version of Ex Machina. Human- like creature/experiment is kept in a cell while clever people work out whether it can cope in the real world. Except the difference is, Ex Machina has depth, subtlety and intelligence. Morgan offers some pretty good action, but its logic lets it down. Just too predictable and nonsensical to be enjoyable or engaging.3/5</fullReview>
