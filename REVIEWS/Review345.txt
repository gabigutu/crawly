		<shortDescription>Nifty, well-crafted shark thriller boasting a strong lead performance by Blake Lively.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows knows exactly what it is, and that's the best praise I can give it. It's barely 90 minutes long, has a small cast, and only one location. Its only purpose is to give you a thrill-ride during that time; an adrenaline rush based on an ubiquitous fear among humans: being stranded in the ocean with a shark. However as the title suggests, this doesn't take place in the middle of the ocean. This woman is stranded only a couple hundred yards from the shore, close enough to potentially shout for help. What The Shallows does so well is establish this sense of isolation and hopelessness for our main character, and her situation of being so close yet so far from safety.Blake Lively is great in this role. It's mostly a reactionary role - not much dialogue aside from some early establishing conversations to develop her character. For the majority of the film Lively is terrified and fighting for survival against a deadly shark. This thing is huge, like the Jaws' shark's father huge. And it's interesting to see how she follows its patterns and observes its behavior, allowing her to act accordingly without being trapped. There are some far-fetched scenes, sure, but Jaws had them as well and it's hailed as a classic. Now I'm not saying The Shallows is as good a movie as Jaws, because it certainly isn't. But again, the movie knows what it is, and as a short shark thriller appealing solely to our primal fear, it gets the job done and then some.Now, it has its faults. The electronic music during the surfing scenes was immediately off-putting, and there are some slo-mo shots that definitely did not deserve to be in slo-mo. But the directing as a whole is well done - gorgeous sweeping shots of the open ocean, the slow build up before the initial attack, showing the shark only when it's most effective. The writing is clever and practical, relatable to the point that you feel for this character's predicament, and the acting as I said is top notch. The Shallows doesn't break any new ground, but it does exactly what it sets out to do - give the audience yet another reason to avoid the beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Shark Movie since Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It first I didn't know what to expect from this movie, as it has become so hard to take shark movies seriously, however The Shallows not only surprised me, it is the best shark movie since Jaws and honestly the best creature feature in ages!At only 85 minutes, this movie absolutely makes the most of that run-time and its 17 million dollar budget and delivers a tense, gripping, stress inducing movie that will constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. Blake Lively is on her way to stardom, as she carries this entire movie and is able to act without speaking, which is insanely hard to do. You care about her and you want her character to survive. The movie is insanely smart and the Director deserves all the credit in making a movie that honestly should not have worked and made it a classic in this genre.The shark is absolutely terrifying and the way Lively is able to not only face off against this shark, but how she is able to make the most over her situation while being under-prepared was not only intelligent, but believable. The story is simple, straight forward, believable and so genuinely crafted, stylishly executed, and not a single scene is wasted. Director Jaume Collet- Serra will have no problem landing a future big budget Hollywood Blockbuster and Blake Lively will soon find herself as a leading lady more often.The Shallows is the biggest surprise of the year, with gripping tension, a career performance from Blake Lively, beautiful scenery, an amazing story of will and survival and one big, mean, scary shark, The Shallows is a Summer movie that you don't want to miss! 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shallows gets it right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This smart little thrill ride may not make you afraid to get back in the water like the one-and-only Jaws...because it does something on a much more conscious level than Spielberg's very fictional tale, and for that, I applaud the director and writer for coming up with a story that is more about self-empowerment than it is about painting sharks as man-eating monsters -- they're not, and that's why this movie is a shark movie done right. While menacing, /this/ fish in our story is /not/ a spawn of the devil bent on upping the beach-goer body count for sport. It's about two instinctive creatures, the girl and the shark (whom both have good reason to be on the beach) crossing paths, hence the struggle to survive. You'll get your fair share of thrills and shocks, yes, /and/ heart, which this movie has just enough of; centered on a young woman you can really get behind and cheer on. 'The Shallows' has subtle-yet-palpable themes and an even tone, and is surprisingly emotional without being cheesy. And also, the cinematography is just gorgeous. Cudos to the entire cast and crew for getting this one right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws...for this generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't even know how else to describe it. It's a dynamic duo...ish movie, considering the fact, that one of the two is immensely beautiful and talented Blake Lively, and the other is...well...A SHARK!it's basically a nurse vs. the shark movie and its awesome. from the cinematic beauty to superb sound design. the plot is the main villain here, as it will keep you guessing till the end. and when that ending comes you will be craving for more, even though the final act is totally satisfying. grippingly suspenseful, it will keep your eyes and mind occupied through the whole run of the movie. and there also is Stephen Seagal joke in it.I'm full thumbs up for this one. I will definitely get a bu-ray and put it next to Jaws(the first one, obviously) in my collection.9/10 and to be clear that 9 stands there only because i hoped to get a killer soundtrack(like Jaws) with this splendid movie, but i guess i'm asking too much. but you should watch it anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep - Not Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best shark movie in years. This movie pits a young woman's desire to live against a shark's desire to eat. Both characters are doing what they need to do to survive.There are those who will say that the shark would have feasted on the whale corpse and ignored the people. There are those who will observe that a shark really doesn't go on a killing spree. In the movie's defense, you have to have something to keep the film interesting and build tension for the film to work well.Blake Lively is wonderful and brings a lot of life and character to the film. She makes you root for her - which brings more tension into the project. The film did a nice job showing her "logically" figure out ways to help herself survive. That was a huge bonus. It was a very well written script that gave you a believable situation.The shark looked great. The movie kept the shark at a minimum (ala Jaws) which was a smart thing to do. Keeping the film focused on Lively's character was the best way to tell this particular story.I had low expectations going into this film because of the history of bad shark movies that have polluted the industry, but I was rewarded with a great survival film that I would highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the most part, riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a couple of issues with this film (occasionally too much CGI, and a weird ending) but for the majority of its brief, 86-minutes-long run, this is a riveting film, exquisitely filmed in the Gold Coast of Australia, about a survivor of a shark attack clinging to life, figuratively and literally, on the side of a rock 200 feet from shore, with the shark still circling the waters. Normally watered down PG13-rating gives way to some surprisingly grisly bursts of gore, as she tries to suture her wounds with makeshift surgical tools, and a couple of brutal attack scenes. The film makes the most of a small cast, and Blake Lively carries the film almost entirely herself, spending at least two thirds of the film completely isolated. Well, she's not completely alone, she also has Steven "Sully" Seagull, as himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love shark attack films, see this on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows has the most realistic looking shark out of any shark film I've watched. The tension builds up nicely throughout and every time the shark shows up is a treat. The only reservation that I have with this film is the end is a little silly. However you really have to suspend belief when it comes to any film that's based completely around a shark attacking people. They are always going to be unrealistic. Bottom line: The shark is awesome, hopefully this movie being successful at the box office will give way to more heavily plot based shark films; where the shark looks just as real as the one seen here. 10/10 for being the only entertaining shark film since Deep Blue Sea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects were incredible!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go see it and leave your opinions at home. I felt there was not one single scene where I thought "Yeah. that was a cheesy shark effect". Quite a few "jump out of your seat" moments that makes this a really intense and entertaining movie. You spend a lot of time scanning the water behind Nancy for a clue of where the shark might be. If you like adventure, suspense, and horror, this is the movie to see this weekend! Blake Lively played the part of Nancy well, and you suffer along with every drop of blood she loses. I haven't had such a good time at the movies in a long time. It came out one day early at the local cinema, and I just had to see it. Very real and believable special effects makes this the shark movie that now sets the bar for all other shark movies. I rated it 8 out of 10, because of a few plot holes that could have been patched fairly easy, but were overlooked. This movie shows what can be done with a good special effects team and the attention to detail that sets this movie apart from others released over the past few years. If this movie causes a resurgence of animal attack movies I for one am ready for the ride, because if they are as well done as "The Shallows" I will have a reason to see things on the big screen instead of waiting for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best shark movie since jaws, this make jaws a pussy cat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likes : WOW...............never have i ever watched a film that pull my emotions left , right &amp; center by the end of the film i was in tears , this is such incredible film to watch Blake lively was certainly the best casting choice for this film , god dam she look hot in a bikini. (Ryan Reynolds you are one lucky guy) For the get go you get a brief camera footage which come apparent later on in the film, thing seem so calm &amp; beautiful on Mexico beach until the this film main story kicks in it because a serious film. Woman vs nature for survival &amp; omg god does Blake lively pull this off with a convincing role as Texan medical student Nancy who trip turn's in to a nightmare when she heavy stalked by a 25 foot great white out blood.This is where this film turn into intense moment with brutal &amp; shocking scene of death that make jaws ashamed ,iam not kidding this film manages to keep that concept of peril like there is no hope of survival through out the film which bring you to tears because you don't know if she gonna survive or die at any moment which is good for the film because it keep you grip to the screen just wait for the next scene to happen. Blake lively performance is perfect she show perfect survival instincts being alone trap on a small rock the tides coming in she has over 200 meter to the shoreline with a shark that can swim faster, she pull this off perfect with charisma, vulnerability, and resourcefulness that is ideal character concept for a heroine of this genre of film. With a bold and plucky attitude that seems to say, "gimme your best shot." as riveting to the points watching her scramble to stay alive, determined not to lose to what appears to be the very hand of Fate itself.This is how you make a shark film, kept the casting to a minim, cast a brilliant act or actress that can keep the concept going through the whole film just like this film you have the making of an outstanding shark movie that seriously made jaws less frighting &amp; step up the food chain intensiveness &amp; frighting moments that will truly make you fear the water again.This film seriously does this, its not only intense, bloody, foreboding &amp; thought provoking it seriously put the fear of the water back in the audience like jaws once did, i highly recommend watching this film as you wont be disappointed as there is a references to jaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deathly Shallows (Part 1)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every shark movie is inevitably compared (unfavourably) against Spielberg's classic 1975 tourist-muncher. And "The Shallows" is no exception. But while not a 10-star classic, this flick comes pretty close by being hugely enjoyable and having a lot going for it.Blake Lively ("The Age of Adeline") plays surfer and trainee doctor Nancy, still grieving the recent death from cancer of her mother and travelling to a remote Mexican surf beach where she has photos of her mother surfing while pregnant with her. While surfing alone, Nancy is attacked a couple of hundred yards from the shore by a Great White and severely injured. She has the choice of refuge of either a low rock or another less palatable floating object. Choosing the rock (at low tide) she is faced with the dilemma of both surviving her injuries and then being rescued before the high tide takes the rock and leaves her to the mercy of the ever circling big-fish.A big summer blockbuster this is not, with a total cast of eleven (not including a guest appearance of Steven Seagull (as himself)). But the small cast doesn't make it less gripping, and gripping it most certainly is, with tension building progressively (emphasised periodically by an on-screen clock) with the countdown to high tide.Blake Lively is an underrated actress and really delivers the goods here. And bearing in mind the problems that Spielberg had with his mechanical shark Bruce (named after Spielberg's lawyer) the appearance of the shark is limited to where actually needed, with Lively having to fill in the blanks with reaction shots. As your imagination is still far better than any special effects, this is hugely effective for certain sequences.The film draws similarities to another interesting entry in the "Jaws" genre ? "Open Water 2: Adrift" from 2006. In that film there was the same incessant threat of shark attack combined with the audience frustration that safety (in that case, the deck of their yacht, if only they had let a ladder down) being so near. Here the 200 yards to the shore is shoutable to but still 190 yards too far.The cinematography (by Flavio Martínez Labiano) is also just beautifully done with some stunning surf and underwater shots that not only highlight Ms Lively's lithely (sic) figure and her Californian surfing skills, but also the beauty of the 'Mexican coast' (actually Lord Howe Island in New South Wales, Australia)."The Shallows" was written by Anthony Jaswinski and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (the director of "Non-Stop", aka Taken 3.5). It comes with a truly impressive BvS quotient of just 5.9%! (see the bob-the-movie-man.com glossary!)So with all of this going for it, you would think that my rating is heading towards at least a 9. But all films like this require a satisfying denouement, and unfortunately this is where this one comes off the rails. It is just plain silly and, together with an unnecessary and irritating epilogue scene, diminishes what was on track to be one of the best films of the summer. So here's the "One Mann's Movies" solution:- Using Final Cut X, Adobe Premier or your favourite video editing suite, cut out the scene from 115:00 to 116:00 from "Jaws"; - Photoshop Blake Lively's face onto Roy Scheider's body. - Insert the finished clip into "The Shallows" at about 82 minutes in. - Enjoy a 10-star classic!This limitation aside, it's still worth your while hunting it out at a cinema near you, since the fantastic cinematography is best suited to a big screen.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

		<shortDescription>Watchable - Just.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to write a review about a shark movie whilst not comparing it to a certain "we need a bigger boat" classic. It certainly doesn't come close to that particular film - it's watchable; but that's about it in my opinion.The Shallows is unfortunately one of those movies which, once you have seen the trailers, you've pretty much seen the entire film. There's not a huge story-line involved... yes, there's the main character (Blake Lively - who is also very beautiful) coming to terms with her own past and decisions she's made.I felt that once the story got going, everything slowed down to a standstill; and I'm afraid to say that I started feeling bored - far from what I expected after seeing the trailers and hype.I'm not saying The Shallows is a bad movie - Blake does a decent job, the CGI/shark scenes/SFX are more believable than most films in this 'genre', and the acting isn't anything to complain about. Where The Shallows loses stars (for me) is just the fact that the story-line is very limited - it's more of a psychological survival battle than a hunter/prey type movie.To sum up - The Shallows is worth a watch. I wouldn't put it up there with the 'classic', but nor would I put it down with some of the worst shark movies I've tried to watch (you know the ones). Location and atmosphere all work (would probably be difficult to do a shark movie that didn't involve the sea tho' - although it's being done in one of those crazy ones!). I was very much looking forward to this film; am just a little disappointed there wasn't more to it - jump scenes, shark scenes and perhaps a slightly better story line.Finally...I wouldn't be surprised if Steven Seagull gets his own movie next year!Overall: 5/10... Not the best... but far from the worst.</fullReview>

Some beautiful shots with solid acting but the storyboard is just ridiculous and details such as wrong light for different times in the day are frustrating.

The seagull is actually the star of the show here and I was routing for him more than Nancy ! Some of the sharks behaviour was completely ridiculous........when has a great white ever jumped out of the water onto a pile of rocks for its prey ?! Just a completely unbelievable story that could have been so much better overall. On a positive note the cinematography was good as were 6 mins of the film........the other 80 were very disappointing.........don't rush to the cinema for this one, borrow someone's DVD if they buy it !!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think i'm fortunate in that i'm not familiar with Blakey Lively so my view of this film wasn't influenced by her image. i will reiterate what a previous reviewer said and with it, justify my 2 out of 10 rating when he said " god dam she look hot in a bikini." i hate to admit it, but slogged through this whole film thinking it could only be redeemed if she somehow lost her top. but frankly, that's all this movie has going for it. look out, spoilers inc.everything about this film is terrible. from the beginning opening scene to the final credits (i sat through it -all-) it was if i was watching a college film project made by an ambitious stoner, his entourage of two stoner buddies, his hot girlfriend, a neighborhood kid and a venice pier trained seagull.i'm convinced the people who compare this to Jaws in any fashion have never even seen Jaws or are somehow mistakenly thinking of Jaws the Revenge in which case i'll remind you that it's the one with Mario Van Peebles in it. the really terrible one.Soul Surfer is a better shark movie. Finding Nemo is a better shark movie. Little Mermaid is a better shark movie.this movie is just crap. the CG is well overdone and it seems the animation crew shared the same enthusiasm and skill you'd expect from a senior citizen inserting their 3.5" floppy disc, discovering the dial up glory of AOL online and creating their first Myspace page complete with "can't smile without you" MIDI soundtrack. temporary suspension of disbelief is required if you want to believe a shark is more interested in a struggling, hot blond than 2 tons of dead whale protein.complete disregard for the physics of tides if you want to believe that one minute you're catching rolling 8 foot waves with your bros in the surf and 10 seconds later, are chilling with your homies in glass calm water well past the surf break.it doesn't end. the ominous unnamed beach. the seagull. the go pro (and suddenly unattached helmet). the tide. the belief that nature ignores tides. and that buoy. just please, please don't watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic piece of wtf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this but.. This is one of the most ridiculous movies I've seen in a while. Left me baffled in disbelief. The protagonist is apparently Wonder Woman, or something, since she doesn't need any food or drink to survive for days. Neither does she seem to feel much pain or any side effects from gaping wounds, gangrene, and jellyfish stings, nor bleed to death from blood constantly gushing out of her wounds. In fact, after two nights, in this emergency state, she still has the strength and stamina of an Olympic athlete.The shark is similarly unrealistic in that it can apparently stalk people, eat an entire person within seconds before immediately moving to the next one, and rather circles a potential human prey rather than eating from a juicy whale cadaver nearby.You're better off watching something like "Sharknado" I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>such a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, This movie is the worst movie I have seen this year. I just saw Blake Lively in Cafe Society, and there she really could show what she is capable of. In The Shallows the director only showed us what a fine figure she has for her age. I was never afraid of the shark and sometimes laughed because it all was so ridiculous. With sky-ping and speaking to a camera the director wanted to give a modern touch to the movie but that was simply to fill the gaps of the story and nearly make me walk out of the theatre. I had to think a lot of Jaws, the movie of Steven Spielberg of 1975. Why are the old movies so much better than the new movies? Please stop with these nonsense and show us the old movies. I felt very sorry for Blake Lively that she had to appear in such a bad movie, where nothing happens. What a disappointment. The only good thing about the movie was that it not lasted more than 80 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blake Carries The Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's like saying Ryan Reynolds carried 'Buried.' When I saw the trailer, I had high expectations - and for the most part, 'The Shallows' delivered. A solid, but overrated performance by Blake Lively, and a nice slow pace. However, the entire film blows up during the final showdown. I kept reading about the whole buoy scene, and thought to myself - well, how bad can it be? Turns out, it's some of the worst collection of scenes in the last five years. It ranks up/down there with the 'Fast &amp; Furious' tunnel scene.Horror fans are so desperate for a decent film, it's no wonder they label this as the 'Jaws for this generation.' Yeah. It's not even close to 'Jaws' in ANY generation. 'Jaws' had superior acting to the extent of third man Robert Shaw's performance blowing any performance you'll see in 'The Shallows' out of the water - pun intended. And 'Bruce The Shark' is still one of the most frightening monsters in the genres history - where the CGI loaded nonsense we get in 'The Shallows' is borderline amateur, and reaches the point of hilarity.Random Ramblings of a Madman: I'm not going to compare the great 'Jaws' to a film that's not even as good as 'The Reef' or 'Open Water.' I enjoyed both of those films, by the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only have one thing to say for the opening of this review. Oh my God !!Hollywood just doesn't get it. No matter how many millions of bucks they keep spending, they just can't get a shark movie the correct way. They can't even get the shark right.There's almost no shark in this movie. We see more of a seagull on a rock than a shark. It's supposed to follow the Jaws recipe but it just doesn't get it right. Not showing the shark kinda worked in Jaws because they couldn't get the shark working and had to film it in a different way.I was very worried in the beginning. I saw a lot of smart phone moron type of characters but it went away after a while. I was really worried, I thought the smart phone moron will kill the shark using the smart phone. Maybe the production company paid a guy 20 million dollars to tell them you can't kill a shark with a phone.I was disappointed with the main character screaming abilities. Very weak screams and not really a true drive for survival. She looked like she kinda enjoyed being stranded on that rock with the bird. Her screams sounded like she had a fish bone stuck in her throat. No volume, no despair. No like.Ahh, the ending. The killing of a shark. The worst idea in the history of shark killing. I'm not really a fishing type of guy. But I bet those who go shark fishing, half of them were laughing and the rest of them just wanted to ask for their money back going out of the theater.Stiff and unsatisfying ending. A human being more specific a woman, dodges a shark coming straight for her, on the bottom of the sea. Yeah right.Last and least, I wasn't aware that there's any living thing that can chew and eat steel. That just doesn't happen. Ever. Yet we have a shark here who chews the crap out of all thing made of solid steel. At one point I thought the shark eats solid steel and will continue on chewing the rocks too.I give it a 4 star and not 1 since it did have it's moments here and there. But it wasn't great all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best shark movie since Jaws. It's thrilling, it's exciting and it has you on the edge of your seat. The story follows Blake Lively (who gives her best performance) coming to an island to deal with the death of her mother. She decides to go surfing and then she realizes she's not alone and that there's a shark who will stop at nothing to eat her up, She has just become the victim and the food of this shark. Now stranded on a rock and deciding how to escape it makes you wander how she will make it out of this alive.Blake Lively is just downright awesome in this role. Forget Gossip Girl, think is "acting girl!" The CGI effects of the shark are also really well done. You never knew when the shark was going to make his attack. The cinematography was also well done. The way the surfing and shark scenes were shot were brilliant. The direction was excellent also.We....The Autistic Reviewers (Jay and Nick) give this movie 4.5/5 stars. 9/10. It's so close to beating Jaws. It maybe another 40 years before we see another shark movie this good again. Go to the cinema and enjoy it! -Autistic Reviewers.</fullReview>

Suspense and more suspense, it was only that. A real life shark is bent on killing people like a serial killer! The shark patrols the area like a human antagonist in a horror movie looking to kill anything that enters the water when we would naturally expect it to, which creates one predictable bloody scene and then more and more. I felt like I was definitely obligated to give the main character special attention for her staggering effort to stay alive rather than being entertained by it. In this movie a shark stays in one area (Next to stranded Nancy) for a long time and is motivated to take her down and kills others in a very repetitive chain of events way. The film fallows a mind-numbing 'survival' pattern with rest periods between the gory stuff. In a sci-fi movie called 'Attack of the sabretooth' some genetically engineered cats are bulimic and throw up after they eat so they want to keep hunting the humans to eat more which is flat out ridiculous and funny. In this movie a creature is motivated to keep hunting the lead character in a supernatural way but it's boring supernatural.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very short review of "The Shallows" (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shallows" (2016) is a pretty good beach-themed horror thriller ? it's just overrated. I'd give it an 8 out of 10, and I'd easily recommend it to somebody looking for a decent, conventional scary movie. But I don't think it lives up to the hype.The movie works. The scares are there and, for the most part, they are stylishly and artistically rendered. I jumped a couple of times. My friends keep comparing it with "Jaws" (1975) or "Deep Blue Sea" (1999), but it really has more in common with the "Open Water" films of the early 2000's. It's a competently made, slow- burn horror movie with a man-vs.-nature plot setup that could happen in real life.But I doubt that "The Shallows" truly belongs on anyone's must-see list, and I don't plan on watching it twice. The story is a little thin. The movie feels padded with lengthy establishing shots and surfing sequences, and a belabored emotional backstory that feels tacked on. (I think this easily could have been an hour-long film.) The final action sequence is a little cartoonish, too. (C'mon.)I'm also perplexed by critics' praise for lead actress Blake Lively's performance. To me, it seemed really poor. (The exception is her reaction shots ? she shined when she was reacting to offscreen threats.)Anyway, do check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not horrible but close especially when comparing to jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, to all. especially real movie critics how dare you compare this to "Jaws"? I'm completely baffled! I saw Jaws as a child being born in 1970 and remember the hysteria, outside of a shark movie being new to the world probably causing much of the fears it was also plain and simple a really good movie! The acting was amazing, I like Blake Lively but there was nothing Lively about her in The Shallows and at times I felt she was sleeping through it. Honestly at times her lines sounded like she was in a b movie and yes she has great boobs and a nice butt but we saw less of the naked lady in jaws and thought we saw a whole heck of a lot more! Don't you all remembering for sure you saw a naked lady but when rewatching it was all in silhouette? That is true film making!The best parts of the movie were interactions with everyone but the shark. I really liked the dude in the truck, the boy, the surfers, did you forget about the dad and sis, yeah me too and then of course there was Steven Seagul the one character who really gave us suspense, come on, you know you were routing for him, I was on the edge of my seat, finally, for him and mostly cuz I didn't think she gave a crap about him! I woulda, oh yeah, no spoiler. Anyways, entertaining but sorry fellow critics and not sorry to the pro critics who should know better but this was nowhere near in the realm of greatness as "Jaws" I really wanted to like, love this movie but the heart, the adventure and excitement just wasn't there, not like Jaws so please stop comparing this to Jaws because there is no comparison. Not an awful film but nothing close to the still all out best film of my lifetime "Jaws"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Shark Film Since Jaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows (2016): Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra / Cast: Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Lozano Corzo, Jose Manuel, Diego Espejel: Easily the best shark thriller since Jaws. The title seems to symbolize decisions as in the ones going through that of Nancy when she isolates herself through surfing. She left the medical field when her mother died. Her father is frustrated in his attempts to convince her not to quit. Her younger sister looks up to her and desires to follow her in surfing. Her new found freedom leads to a whale carcass and that discovery leads to a shark attack that leaves a massive gash in her leg. She crawls upon a rock with a wounded seagull. Her world seems hopeless as the water gets higher. Her attempts to flags down a drunken guy on the shore ends with him being bitten in half. Two other surfers also end up as shark chow. These characters are flat with the exception of Nancy and Blake Lively plays her as risky yet intelligent. She is determined to survive and is involved in a gruelling climax where she realizes that she must kill the shark. This is director Jaume Collet-Serra's best work. The tension is real and the action is fast and swift. Its only drawback in comparison to Jaws is its lack of rounded characters. This gives Lively a grand opportunity to take centre stage as an actress since roles for women are far and few between. She proves resourceful when time is crucial. Its theme regards a tragedy that steers us back towards what we should be and where our true value lies. Then there is our passions such as surfing...but one can do without the shark. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and Tense Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking for suspense? This movie has it all and more. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. I was jolted a few times with surprises I didn't see coming. (Which is rare for me because I look for them coming.) There was brief character background which was just the perfect amount not to bore you and enough to make you empathetic with the main character.And the shark...superb graphics and very real looking teeth! You get to see the shark plenty and up close. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Blake Lively deserves an award for carrying this movie from beginning to end. You could see everything she was feeling by just the looks on her face. Absolutely worth seeing on the big screen. It was like I was right there. Blake's character was smart and thrifty considering she went out into the water with just a surfboard and then got stranded on a relatively small rock.Very gripping movie that shows how to be smart about doing everything you can to survive. Keep it together and think it through. The shark was smart too, however, and REALLY wanted Blake for lunch, or dinner...he wasn't picky. One scene shows why he might be a bit vengeful. He was terrifying. The most terrifying I've seen since Jaws.Kudos to all the people that put this movie together. And after it all, there is actually a story there. Top notch movie. No B flick here. You won't be disappointed. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this will be a short one but I still needed to write a review. I love sharks and don't want them disrespected like some Sharknado stupidity. The acting is right, the graphics are right, the plot is enough, the cuteness of her little friend she makes is cool, and the action was perfect. I gave this movie the all too elusive 10. Also, 87 minutes was perfect for all that you needed. I will buy the movie on Apple TV as soon as it's released. It's hard to compete with the original Jaws, but this movie does very well.

		<shortDescription>A Short Thriller That Will Keep You On the Edge of Your Seat (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my love and interest towards sharks, I was very much looking forward to this movie. Ever since the trailer was released I have been waiting desperately for the special date of June 24. So yes, I may be biased because it is a shark movie and about something I like, but in a seriousness, the Shallows is a good movie. Some may argue: "Oh, a shark that size would never be able to jump out of the water in areas that shallow," or "A shark would never stick around to make sure it consumes the last human in the area, and would not relentlessly continue to kill everyone that enters the water". Yes most of these complaints and arguments may be true, but that is just to drive the plot, for if the shark went away, that would be the end of the movie and hundreds of unhappy moviegoers would leave the theater asking for a refund and saying, "That wasn't exciting at all! She just disturbed the shark, waited on a rock for 2 days until the shark was gone and swam back to shore!"So without the great white's grudge for Blake Lively, who disturbed the shark's feeding grounds (A deceased 200 ton blue whale) there would be no movie, suspense, or action.Moving on, as for the movie, it was beautifully shot. The scenery was amazing, blue (it's an ocean of course), and colorful. The acting was laudable, for Blake Lively's performance was well crafted (It's very hard to act without talking much), and the other actors did fine as well.As for the shark, the CGI was overall very good, compared to other shark horror movies where the sharks are literally all animated as if they were in Pixar cartoons. Yes I'm talking about Deep Blue Sea. God, what an abomination of a movie. Anyways, a lot of effort was put in to creating the main antagonist, and for the most part, the shark was very believable, especially when it breached out of the water and attacked the two surfers, *shivers*.I only have three magical complaints for the entire movie, which unfortunately was 87 minutes long... eh I guess we'll add that as a complaint. The movie was too short for my taste. My first complaint was that I did not like when Ms. Lively was skyping her family and the screen of the phone was displayed like a hologram facing the audience. It was quite corny and found it to be light and unrealistic.My second complaint is that there was not enough exposition and the rising action and climax came too quickly. This would've made the movie longer, yes, and possibly more interesting. For instance, give some more backstory on how Ms. Lively lost her mother or if you don't want to extend the exposition, make other conflicts happen while she is stranded on the rock. Maybe a canoe can come across or a life raft and the shark eats it, I don't know! I am not a film writer!Finally, the ending! TOO PREDICTABLE! She kills the shark in the most insane way, although cool... COMPLETELY INSANE! She grabs a weighted chain, unhooks it from the buoy, and plummets down with a shark on her tail. Suddenly she releases the chain, after plummeting a hundred or so feet and the shark is impaled by the pole connected to the chain. Poor shark. What made me really want to see the movie was in one of the trailers, the announcer said "you have no idea how this will end", when indeed I did have the right idea... the shark dies and Ms. Lively makes it to shore safe. Throw a twist ending! Make it tragic. In order to kill the shark she must take her own life, so they both die, now that would've been cool.In conclusion, the Shallows is a remarkable film that has loads of suspense, thrills and action. I would definitely recommend it. but it is most likely a film you would only watch once or twice. Overall, it deserves a good rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have no decent expectations when you are going to see a movie to the cinema and if you do not care about your time at all, then you can watch this kind of movie. For me, this is one of the examples I will give to my friends when I will exemplify how to waste your time and not even enjoying. And I will recommend it to those idiots if I want to mock someone ;) But, 99.9%, I am a well intentioned guy, so I place here my warning: it's a waste of time and don't make my mistake by watching it to the end of it.

It will keep you engaged the whole time, and not in laughter or ridiculousness. No hot shot directors here with overgrown Kung-Fu sharks doing otherworldly things... no. This film looks real and is beautifully shot. Blake does a fine piece of acting, and the shark appears quite realistic. We need more of this type of filming. Thanks to the director for sticking to reality, because I'm sick of so many directors who've lost touch with the real world and getting facts straight. (ex: Mission Impossible 2... people jousting on motorbikes and leaping off of them to collide in mid-air?...absolutely awful!) If you love sharks, go see this movie because it's great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers. I really did enjoy this movie. I have only been to a few films this year in a theater. I don't go often because I find a lot of what's out there is total crap. But I digress.The shallows delivers a survival story of a determined young woman who goes to an unnamed beach on the coast of Mexico, and fights for her life. Blake Lively's performance as Nancy Adams is convincing and keeps the movie "afloat". Films like this require a strong lead character, and actor, or else it just won't work. Much of the film rests on Blake's performance, as most of the movie is the character Nancy stuck on a small rock. Blake doesn't disappoint. The rock plays just as big a role. Though lifeless and inanimate it serves it's purpose, Blake knew what to do, like when she worked on "Gossip girl" with Leighton Meester (hint hint hint hint hint hint). I found it harsh some critics who said Blake's performance was a surprise. She's a great actress, and this film shows she can hold our attention. She has that "it" factor that makes people like me-who seldom go see films in the theater-get up and open our wallets. I had a great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an excellent movie and I highly recommend it. It had all the ingredients a movie needs, imho. I liked the main character immediately and a credible and affecting backstory is created for her in a few key lines of dialogue: her beloved mother has just died of cancer and so she's visiting the beach her mother loved, as a tribute, and to try and overcome the overwhelming grief and lassitude the death has caused her--she's dropped out of medical school. She has a loving father, and a young sister who idolises her, to whom she is now sister-mom. So, from the get go, I wanted this girl to live, unlike the characters in other disaster movies such as The Green Inferno, where I couldn't have cared less who escaped or who got eaten... The setting for this movie is magical. As a keen surfer myself, I really appreciated the isolated beach location, the idyllic surfing paradise she's found. Great underwater photography. Watching, it was like being there. So, having a final, evening surf she discovers the floating corpse of a whale. A half-chewed whale... not good. She immediately realises the danger she's in, but it's too late. She gets attacked and then trapped on a small rock a few hundred metres off-shore. Great premise very well done. And then we meet the stand-out star of the whole movie. A small seagull who, because of a damaged wing, is also trapped on the rock with her. Joking aside, what great writing. Humanity and some humour is immediately brought back into a very tense situation. The plight of the bird mirrors that of the girl in many ways, and her humanity towards this small, damaged creature cements her as someone worthy of our respect. I was desperate for her to survive, which is unlike me as I rarely watch movies with female leads as I don't find their stories or worldview interesting. This girl is intelligent and feisty and through caring for the bird (perhaps becoming a substitute for the mother she couldn't save, despite being a doctor...) she finds a desperate will within herself to survive this ordeal. This truly is an enjoyable, tense, engaging movie. I saw a poor copy of it and will make the effort to go to the cinema and see it again when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Scary Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have liked Blake Lively. She can inhabit a character and give weight to the movies she has made, even when some of them are a bit hard to believe. She made the premise of being centered the reason to keep watching "Gossip Girl", and her elegance and poise were the reason "The Age of Adelyne" was something more than a trivial romance through the years, and she now takes on one of the biggest and scariest beasts in the ocean. She tops Dreyfuss and company in "Jaws" because she has to fight a Great White with pretty much whatever is available while she hangs from a rock and later on a buoy, pretty much fighting a losing battle until it becomes clear that she won't quit easily.It's hard to believe someone could fight and survive a situation like the one in "The Shallows". From its beginning, it becomes clear that the shark is quite a monster, and it is angry because apparently. Lively and company have invaded its eating grounds, and someone has done something previously which might be irritating this wondrous animal's temper more than it is necessary.Throughout the film, we are treated to Lively's independent and resourceful free spirit as she is currently dealing with a personal crisis. She has gone south to Mexico to visit a special place in her family's history, and at first, we are treated to some gorgeous vistas and camera work. There's some very good stunt work here, and at times, I was wondering how much of the work was done by the actress herself. She is in almost every scene, and she must spend all the time either floating or swimming underwater. There are some scenes that will make you cringe because of the way they are done. If you ever dealt with Jelly Fish and know the pain that can inflict, you will definitely be a bit on the jumpy side.Some of the work done with the "shark" itself is indeed very exciting. I love the way he attacks his prey, and though part of the suspense is how we never know when or where he might show up, we only need to know that it is angry and hungry. There were moments when I was uncertain about the resolution of the film because of the way the screenplay cleverly tells the story. Gasp! This one might have an epic battle between Lively and the shark, but the ending might surprise the audience.Be prepared for a good time in what it certainly is one of the best shark films since "Jaws".</fullReview>

The ending might be a little more sudden and random than what you wold expect, but it works within the just-under-90 minute running time.I wouldn't recommend it for kids younger than 10, as the climactic scenes might be a little too intense for them and as the main character lets out one f-word as she tries to scare the shark away. However, it doesn't have the gore you might expect in a film of this genre, and the rest of the language is fine, so it's definitely family-friendly for tweens and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a simple goal in mind (DON'T GET EATEN), The Shallows is the best shark movie since Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of a coincidence (or perfect timing) that The Shallows should come out during the same time as Shark Week on the Discovery Channel. Though I'm not usually one for nature documentaries, I might occasionally sit down for a bit to see what's going on with a great white or a tiger shark during that summer week. Like a lot of people, I find the idea of sharks in the water terrifying. The creatures are basically living dinosaurs with their only key instinct is to survive by hunting. The idea of encountering one while snorkeling still gives me nightmares.What's interesting is that out of the hundreds of shark movies that have been made for television and the occasional Hollywood produced features, the only genuinely good one happens to be the Steven Spielberg classic Jaws. When you really look at that movie again, it's nothing more then a B-movie that was simply done extremely well. Most shark movies will either just do Jaws again (with a lower budget and bad actors) or try to add scientific or science-fiction elements that give sharks a reason to attack people. The Shallows is a nice change of pace by going back to a simple goal in shark movies; don't get eaten.Off of the coast of Mexico, a medical student Nancy (played by Blake Lively) is being taken to a secluded beach by a resident who refuses to say the name of the beach, only calling it paradise. With her family back in Texas and her friend still at a hotel, she's making her surfing afternoon on her own. The majority of her day consisted of hitting the waves, calling her sister, and even meeting two other surfers. When she's about take one last surf before the sun sets, she encounters a dead whale?and a great white.The shark takes a bite of her leg and tries to pull her down, but she makes it to a rock formation where she makes a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. The distance to the beach is too far to swim without risking another attack and the other surfers have gone home, so she's stuck there with a hurt seagull as her only companion. Attempts to get the attention of a drunk and the returning surfers only result in them getting attacked by the monster. As time runs out on the increasing tide, she has to use her wits to save herself.I cannot believe that after forty years after Jaws, we finally have another good shark movie! The Shallows may be a simple film, but it takes it's simplicity to terrifying advantages and creates an open yet claustrophobic thriller. It understands that what we don't see is what scares us the most. Whenever we don't see the shark, we get to know a lot about Nancy and how she tries to use her studies of medicine and surfing to see if she can strategize around this animal. When we do catch a glimpse, they make sure that the shark is big, menacing, and ready for the hunt on it's human.The Shallows plays like a one-man show?or in this case, a one-woman show. The good news is that Blake Lively is an actress that can carry an entire movie. She may be pretty, but you can capture her thoughts straight through her eyes, even as the sun glares. Making her smart was one thing, but they found the right balance to make her feel vulnerable. The writing thankfully stays simple as they might give us more insight into Nancy, but the goal is still not being eaten by the shark.I'll give this nine surfboards with a shark bite out of ten. I highly recommend The Shallows as a small, but effective thriller. The summer may have gotten people to go to the beaches, but after seeing this, they may finding themselves staying out of the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Shark Thriller Since Jaws (1975)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and is the story of a young girl (college, to be exact) named Nancy, played by Blake Lively, who visits Mexico in order to go to a hidden beach that her mother used to go to. She's a surfer, so she goes for a surf, along with two Spanish men that were in the area. However, when the men leave earlier than expected, a gigantic great white shark attacks her, wounding her leg, and leaving her stranded on a small rock just 200 yards away from shore with no help in sight.After the disappointment that was Independence Day: Resurgence (2016), I wasn't too excited to go back to the theater, but I'm sure glad that I did. I was expected a decent, B rate shark flick with The Shallows, but I got so much more. Almost everything about The Shallows works on tremendous levels, and I was very impressed by the film as a whole. All of the acting was good (even though one of the two characters with the most screen time being a seagull), the direction was amazing, and the special effects were fantastic.Blake Lively does excellent in her role, playing a strong female character (which isn't a common phrase in most films nowadays) with a will to survive. Her conflict with both the shark, and to get the mindset of survival down, was near perfectly displayed through both the script and Lively's acting talent. The viewer really wants this character to win, and roots for her continuously, breathing a sigh of relief each and every time she gets to a temporary safe zone. Her acting was terrific, and I look forward to seeing her in future films.The special effects done on the shark are astounding, Each and every shot that the shark is in looks amazing, showcasing the film's great effects. Since the shot was in one of the trailers, this isn't a spoiler, but the shot in which the shark jumps into the air, grabbing a man in his jaws (no pun intended), and curving back down into the ocean looked absolutely incredible. Many other moments like the one mentioned are in The Shallows, which, alone, make this movie worth seeing.The direction, by Jaume Collet-Serra, is amazing, especially in the underwater shots. This man brought such a high level of suspense to this film with his directing capabilities. Almost every shot is present simply to prepare you for the next, and the next, and so on, until the suspense drops the floor from under you, and lets off the steam that it needed to. The jump scares can get a bit predictable at times, but aren't overused to the point of exhaustion like most "scary" movies tend to do with them.My only issue with the film was the exposition. We learn a lot about Nancy through some video chats and messages between her and her family/friends. This gets old after the first five minutes or so, and the restless audience really just wants to see a shark eat somebody. Although that sounds a bit unprofessional, it's completely true. Once the tension starts, and the shark comes into play, learning more about our protagonist no longer seems like a way to lazily establish the character anymore, it just feels like a break from the suspense, which is the exact way scenes like such should be filmed.Before my overall conclusion, I must give props to Steven "Sully" Seagull, the seagull who played the seagull. All joking aside, he did very good for a bird.Overall, The Shallows was a very pleasant surprise, and I'm glad that I watched it. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't have small children with them, because it can get pretty intense at some points in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>after just seeing Sniper: Special Ops, this is Steven Seagulls best acting in a long time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>that's right, I had no idea going into this movie that I would see Steven Seagal... umm, Steven Seagulls best performance in a while! His acting in this made me give this movie an extra 1+ stars! His acting performance was way better than the last movie I saw him in, Sniper: Special Ops (see my review history for that review)The entire film is set in beautiful scenery. Blake's performance was great and with such a small cast, the length of the movie was perfect!Most of it seemed realistic and possible although I did spot some unconvincing flaws throughout. Honestly though, after all these other failed attempts at shark movies since Jaws, I didn't go into this movie expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised! Def a must see summer movie!Oh, and Jaws' lil nephew did an OK performance in this one, but Steven Seagull did steal some of his thunder ;p</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing thriller and so, so much more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really have no words for this movie! Most of the action takes place in a very narrow scene (the sea, a woman, a metal buoy and a shark),and yet few movies have impressed me that much! With an immensely tense plot (allowing properly at times some reliefs to lighten the tension),a wonderful character you root for from the very beginning, spectacular special effects that emit the sense of peril without becoming gory, and an overall chillingly realistic approach to a (in fact) rather unrealistic situation, this movie grabs you from the start and never lets you go!!Nancy is a young surfer and a medical student who visits an unnamed beach, previously visited by her mother, now passed away by a terminal illness. Due to circumstances she has been left alone. She goes surfing and (minor spoilers...) eventually gets attacked by a shark who seriously wounds her leg, finding shelter to a small rocky terrain which almost completely submerges during high tide. Unable to contact anyone she must now fight for survival in what soon becomes a relentless battle of wills between her and the shark. She has to stay focused, mend her wounds, overcome the pain, hunger, environmental conditions and exhaustion, and use whatever insignificant means she happens to have to stay alive until she can figure a way out, as no one seems to be coming to the rescue.There are secondary characters in the movie too, but for the most part they don't matter to the plot that much. The film centers on her battle against the shark. Blake Lively shines as the leading protagonist who, despite impossible odds, never looses hope, never bends and never gives up. She gives up a tremendously reliable, realistic and vigorous performance, and rightfully gets credited for much of the film's success, the other parts being the tight plot, the excellent effects, an all- fitting music score, the cinematography, the seagull (!) and the overall direction, although the supportive cast doesn't fell short either.And above all, this movie accomplices a really great triumph: to stay away from ALL types of clichés. (Minor spoilers: Some elements, like her trying to send message to her family, are so gracefully done that can't count as clichés, just underline what a loving and caring person she is, making us root for her even more!). The ending (the final conflict) indeed criticized by some, does require some suspension of disbelief, but not really that much- personally I found it a lot smarter than from most movies of the type. The only thing I missed was some background for the shark, who seemed too intelligent and personally involved against young Nancy, almost depicting a grudge against her, since his actions were far from typical for an animal of his kind.All in all, this is a movie about the will to survive and the strength to overcome, wrapped around an action- packed thriller package, a truly wonderful combination. It redefines and uplifts the standards for shark movies, among which it sits right at the top, surpassing maybe even ''Jaws'' (which I just re-saw and couldn't believe how fake Its shark seemed), with its high production values. In conclusion, its one of the most suspenseful and interesting films I' have seen, surpassing any typical classification to a genre. Therefore, it should be seen by anyone who likes thrillers, adventures, suspense, shark movies etch, or who simply wants to watch a really good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't live up to its promise of an incredible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always remember the tagline for 'Saw V' being "You won't believe how it ends", despite it having the most tame and believable ending of possibly the entire series. A bizarre piece of marketing. 'The Shallows' promised a similar thing with the tag "If you think you know how it ends, you have no idea", or something along those lines. When you make a promise like that you really have an obligation to deliver on it. It didn't. I assume they were referring to the way in which the main character 'Nancy' eventually killed the shark. It was clever enough (despite being highly illogical and effectively impossible) and worked for entertainment purposes, but it certainly didn't leave me stunned, wondering how on earth they come up with this stuff.The movies run time was a short 96 minutes, and it really wouldn't have wanted to push more than that as things were getting a little tedious and monotonous by the end. It's a fun ride though. There are some decent shark scares and Blake Lively is a strong enough actress to pull off the emotional scenes and keep us caring about her survival. There was a real feel of 'Castaway' about it, with the sidekick 'Steven Seagull' even rivaling that of 'Wilson' (though I suspect not as iconic). It's a way to kill 90 minutes, but not a lot more than that. There are better films you'll see this year, and there are worse ones too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 stars for Steven Seagull. Other than that....if you saw the review, then you saw the movie. This was a cheap film, OK acting (by very few actors) but no story and boring as you know what. It was embarrassing to us Australians - Austin Texas beaches and Mexican beaches are not interchangeable with Australian beaches (this was filmed in Australia). Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful. Don't bother - wait unit free to air and then you can fast forward. I read someone else's review - "as good as Jaws". Are you kidding?? This movie was about nothing, was boring, boring, boring, boring, boring. Coast Qld Australia (so don't bother with the swapping of the beaches) . I was really looking forward this movie - greatly disappointed.</fullReview>

Starting from the size of the scar on her thigh to the fact that the shark actually kept coming at her after the first bite leaving a carcass of a whale. Fact: sharks don't like human flesh and blood. Shark going at the buoy... Seriously!!! The buoy fall on its side when one of the chain is cut!!! This doesn't happen. If the current is that strong it would shoot her off to the shore. More mistakes on the goofs section.Overall entertaining if you do not know anything about sharks or whales or the sea in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Revenant with a modern setting and female lead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While surfing alone on a secluded beach medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) suffers an attack from a shark circling the area. Stranded on a rock 200 yards from shore she must find help before it's too late.A film about a shark terrorising a beach. For some reason this sounds strangely familiar? There is a lot in this film that is different to other films like it. In fact this is more of a survival style film that at times feels like The Revenant with a modern setting a female lead. While on the topic of the female lead. Blake Lively delivers what could be one of the best performances of the year by anyone and could very well be in for an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a young woman who is stranded and alone in serious pain and scared to get back in the water for knowing that the shark is still around and the shore is too far away. With this comes a very clever and scary plot where you actually feel for the lead character and want them to succeed because of successful build up at the start of the film which for once isn't boring and doesn't feel unneeded. The film is very fast paced and tense which adds to the scare and fear factor and the intensity of the threat and its prescience. It goes by very quickly and is also very enjoyable in so many different ways. At just under 90 minutes the films does a really good job of not going on for too long, leaving you satisfied with all sorts of things like length, plot, narrative, etc,etc. It's also interesting and the plot adds to this with its fast pace and the lead characters quick thinking and initiative which just goes towards creating an even more intelligent and interesting yet entertaining film.Smart, very tense, scary and highly entertaining, The Shallows is similar to The Revenant but with a modern setting and female lead. Oh it might just be one of the best films of this year. **** &lt;-- Four Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a shark attack movie, it's got everything right. The camera work both above and below the water is amazingly good - clear and slows down when it needs to. There is a variety of situations so things don't get repetitive. The plot is kept believable and it's exciting scary and entertaining. Way above the cheesy movies we have had since Jaws.Blake Lively is likable, beautiful and believable as a surfer. She acts well and her pain becomes the viewer's pain. Can almost feel her ordeal as I winced every time she got her cuts and scratches. She is a convincing actress and suits the role to a T.Watch this on the big screen - it's terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shark Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of The Shallows (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Brett Cullen, Sully 'Steven' SeagullPlot: A mere 200 yards from shore, surfer Nancy (Blake Lively) is attacked by a great white shark, with her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills and survival.In 1975 Steven Spielberg introduced us to the first ever shark movie by the name of Jaws and over the past 41 years sharks have been taking over cinema, whether they're really disappointing or very good. This however is not disappointing and it has the same premise as Jaws because it is a woman vs. the Great White, king of all sharks. Blake Lively plays Nancy, a charismatic medical student from Galveston, Texas which is her best performance since The Town (2010), unfortunately she doesn't have a southern accent just the same as Boyhood (2014) when the family were from Texas but didn't have the accent.Nancy is on holiday in Tijuana, Mexico and she is just surrounded by a gorgeous beach and handsome men surfing, like Point Break (1991). However she is then met by an angry shark and has to swim to shore but unfortunately the shark is too fast so she goes to the next best thing, rotting whale flesh. The slow-motion during the surfing is very off-putting but unlike movies like the Transformers series and 300, it only has little bits of it which can be forgiven. The tension is a lot like Jaws and also has almost music but I could be wrong there. Nancy has the same survival instinct as James Franco in 127 Hours (2010) but instead it isn't man vs. really big rock its woman vs. really angry shark as said before. During her survival she has the most unlikely companion in the shape of a seagull with dislocated wing she conveniently names him 'Steven Seagull', at which you feel sorry for both the protagonist and the seagull because Nancy can't swim away otherwise she'll get chased, and the seagull can't fly away because of the wing. A good thing is that when she is isolated she not only thinks about ways to kill the shark but she also uses soliloquies to encourage her will to survive and that really adds a lot of tension to the film. Even though this movie is PG-13 (in America) it has a hell of a lot of blood and many jumpy moments. In its incredibly short run time it has plenty of tension, drama and well, shark related violence.This is a very rare treat because it is an enjoyable ride and isn't really disappointing like many other shark movies, and unlike those movies this has a plot, granted it's very short but it is very gripping. Before we get to Nancy against the shark we see a load of drama between characters like between Nancy and her family through face time, granted, but the drama is there. Unfortunately she also repeats the line "come back" from Titanic (1997). Her survival instincts are very strong because even though she gets battle scarred along the way her survival instincts are still very strong, also when the story gets to it's seat gripping part near the end, you feel like you are really there with her which shows just how long humans would last against a really annoyed shark. It is beautifully made and definitely Jaume Collet-Serra's best feature since well...ever! He really doesn't make many good films apart from Non-Stop (2014), but this will be remembered as his best movie. What more can you want? Well apart from a bloody great shark coming at your face.Apart from the really gorgeous landscape it also features a very beautiful woman in tight surfing gear so what more could a guy want? However there are loads of responses saying that this is just a popcorn flick, well no it isn't because unlike popcorn flicks this actually is very good, massively enjoyable and just immensely gripping. Definitely better than many other shark movies out there especially the Sharknado series! Well apart from Jaws that is! This could even be enjoyable with persistent watches which is a very good way to watch this film because at every moment you are at the edge of your seat. Especially when you hear the music 'oh god a shark is coming' you will be especially gripped you won't be able to let go for the whole run time. This is definitely one of the best movies to watch this year. Filled with suspense and memorable a film that is an absolute delight.Verdict: An enjoyable tale of woman vs. shark with a Jaws-like feel. A story of surfing and survival a very rare treat and definitely a lot more fun than the Sharknado series. Gripping and memorable. 9/10 fun and enjoyable just don't get eaten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Since Shark Night 3D &amp; Bait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from a late night screening preview of The Shallows &amp; have to say it was bloody epic fun!The film is basically about a young woman who is stranded 200 miles from the shore &amp; kept hostage on a rock by a 20ft Shark! The films premise is simple but has more skill than meets the eye!The kills were pretty decent as with the shark (which was CGI) &amp; the suspense in the film as a whole really drew you in I felt this as I kept watching &amp; waiting for something to happen as it did &amp; got better &amp; better throughout! The Shark was vicious &amp; really aggressive which made this film really good as I was a bit worried about how much of the shark would be shown in the film! I also liked the blood effects too &amp; was pretty decent for a shark film! The ending was truly epic &amp; something I didn't see coming! but judging by the scoring I knew something great was about to happen!I overall would give this film a 9/10 it truly was a really suspenseful film which loads of things going on! It kept you locked in til the end when it got going that is! I'd say this was best shark film I'd seen since Shark Night 3D &amp; Bait, both of which were epic shark films, even that of Sharktopus which was also a great shark film!I recommend seeing this film from the director of House of Wax! It was really that good! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constant mind-thinking ability is what you need when you're watching this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Shallows two times in a day. It's the greatest shark movie in my opinion. The VFX put into the movie is purely great, especially the shark. I can't name any movie that has the same astounding image of the shark which is apparently a colossal giant stalking a girl to an extremely eerie extent. It needs you to have a constant mind-thinking ability when you're watching, that's mainly the objective of the movie. This is not the typical shark movies out there (Please don't count Sharknado or any animal affiliation vs., those suck so bad you need a million punches hit in your face), the plot is highly interesting. To put it short, a daughter who is a med student visits her mother's favorite beach after her recent death. The beach is hidden in a secret location, which people seldom come about. Then, from nowhere, a mundane activity on a beach comes into a dangerous event when a man-eating shark (greedy too) coordinates a place for his own good coincidence luck.The final 20 minutes would consume you into the dark almost-stormy night. The dour tone in the background adds a more suspenseful imagery if you have the time to meticulously watch the movie, the double 10 mins would surely suck you into the world, thinking if you're that girl, what would you do?Highly recommend this to people who are loving the idea to generate powerful survival skills, if you love to surf or wander into the deep of the sea. Professional rating: 68% Amateur rating: 86%Let me remind you, I'm very hard to give high stars. 68% for the professional rating is already as pure as water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seamless Jaws of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solo character, Nancy, starred by Blake Lively, has made history in facing her fear in the shallows. Despite the simplicity of the film, it perfectly illustrates the abundance of ideas and genre of this motion picture, a thrill, from the beginning to the end of the film. It will get you on the edge of your seat, wondering what is going to happen next. Without a lot of script and characters, this film has successfully and poignantly portrayed the beauty of an island, a no-name island, with a shark lurking in the shallows. Every bit of the soundtrack seamlessly illustrates the motion picture. It is definitely a must to see it on the silver screen if you're a big fan of, first, Blake Lively; second, sharks; and survival of the fittest.</fullReview>

I've never liked sharks and I imagine I'm not alone but this movie takes certain liberties with what I would consider to be normal shark behavior... it's not a bad movie and it has some production value but some of the plot-points are ridiculous to the point of being funny. I still enjoyed the movie but maybe I was alone in being the only one in the theater laughing at some of the more horrible scenes, I generally care about the outcome of the protagonist in a given story however when the shark is just dead set on murdering you (just for the hell of it) then I'm left wondering how it is we arrived at this point... global warming perhaps??!See the movie, it was good... particularly her co-star Steven Seagull xD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Blake's, but she was highly commendable in this Jaws- On-Steroids survival thriller that reads as though it were based in truth. As a nursing school dropout haunted and derailed by memories of her moms inevitable demise, she's very good and so is the scripting. She was greatly convincing. Any shortcoming would be due the script. The surfing scenes were pretty good too, not overtly Hollywood, would have liked to have seen more. The faded split-screen for us on the phone was well done too. I love that drunk Mexican on the beach, he was great! 10/10! It doesn't seem likely that the shark would have been so focused on her given their behavioral facts. A shark chewing through any entire steel ocean buoy, for example, reaches hella far, even for the most aggressive species... especially when there's an uncontested whale buffet 100 foot away. Sure, she and others ventured into a feeding ground but why such focused aggression on her - venturing so far as to haunt her for days and take such pain to get her-?! Lots to talk about here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Hollywood obsessed with good looking models and even worse scripts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your an actor or not you may still understand where I'm coming from: So much film these days is noneducational and non entertaining and this shallow Shallows is no exception. usually down to script and cast.For whatever reason Hollywood is obsessed with making absolute nonsense that unlike the movies of the 60's 70's and 80's are becoming more and more sex orientated. I BLOODLY LOVE SEX.. However I don't bloody love the Keira Knightly thousand mile open jaw state repeated over and over to the point of boredom that nearly every good looking model Hollywood lead. It's so lame and so tiresome. People call this "Good acting ability" or "Believable performance ability" when it simply is neither good nor believable and the only entertainment if you like soft or hard porn is a female body adapting an entirely catwalk style facial and bodily performance. Who wants to look unsexy on screen?? Let me try to explain in a slightly more annoying clinical fashion so you can see where the tired audience is coming from.The Hollywood 1000 mile female stare: The jaw drops very slightly and shows the bottom third of the very white very, very healthy looking teeth or a very slight pout. The eyes are open wide, not too wide but wide enough for us to see that they're simply not effected by the salt water in the ocean. Normally the eyes are clear and the camera department take full advantage of the sunlight and iris colour enhancement before going through grading. Facial expressions or movements? They're really isn't one. It's supposed to be a sultry looking fear but it's essentially a pose IE the face doesn't express real fear but feigns it for an aesthetic sexual approval. How do we know? If your not into actor analysis take a look at Lorraine Gray as Ellen Brody in Jaws or Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood in Indiana Jones or Mellinda Dillon as Gillian Guiler in Close Encounters of The Third Kind. Without going into further pedantics with regard to facial and audible performance these actresses are all incredibly "BELIEVABLE" and "TALENTED" because we can realistically break those performances down and can easily scientifically ( without having to be a science wizard) break down the differences between honest human behaviour and bullshit Hollywood sexed up nonsense.If you want yet another boring Hollywood remake trying to take advantage of disproportionate pretty sexed up model performances instead of sincere performances projected from well written colloquial scripts and interesting stories then I suggest you wait for a TV release. MEMORABLE FILM IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND BECAUSE Hollywood CASTS MORE AND MORE SEXED UP AND 'COOL MODEL LOOKING PEOPLE' WHOSE PERFORMANCES ARE BY ENLARGE VERY UNBELIEVABLE WHEN COMPARED WITH ACTORS AND WRITERS WHO CAN PERFORM AND WRITE REALISTICALLY AND HAVE THOSE PERFORMANCES ANALYSED WITH A FINE TOOTHCOMB FOR THEIR REAL SKILLS TO GIVE PROPER SUBSTANCIATION FOR PEOPLE THAT KNOW AND ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT FILM BEING MEMORABLE. You'll forget this one in a jiffy but you might remember her arse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disposable summer horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharks are back in Jaume Collet-Serra's latest movie. Starring as Nancy is Blake Lively in a horror movie that goes by the name of 'The Shallows'. The movie starts out with the girl Nancy traveling towards the sea to go surfing at a, for her, important location. Her surfing trip takes a turn for the worst however when an enormous white shark appears that traps her on a tiny island.The story of 'The Shallows' is not all that original, movies where a shark is tormenting a group of surfers have come and gone in the past. In this day and age though where horror movies are trying to up the stakes at almost every release it was quite refreshing to see one that is as contained as this one. For the most part the movie features only one actress and the shark only really makes a visual appearance during some of the different jump-scares the movie has to offer. A lot of these scares felt very artificially set up however and only a few manage to create the necessary tension a horror movie needs. This tension fades quickly however due to the incredibly slow pacing of a lot of scenes. The performance by the movies main actress does not aid the horror aspect as she never manages to convince the viewer that her character is really frightened and in pain. I've never seen a character scream for help in such a unconvincing manner and when the movie has her break down and cry the actress has to hold her hands in front of her face to make this seem at least a little bit convincing.Riddled throughout the movie are some terrible attempts at gore, comedic relief and some very obvious attempts at foreshadowing which made quite a few moments very predictable. Though the underwater scenes were quite wonderful the movie overall is not all that well directed. 'The Shallows' is filled with a lot of terrible close ups of Blake Lively often times overly sexualizing her character. This even happens during some scenes where the viewer is supposed to built an emotional connection with the main character. The CGI is not all that great due to the movies low budget. During the different action moments and surf scenes it is very obvious that Blake Lively's face is plastered onto a stunt women causing a disconnect between the viewer and the character.In the end 'The Shallows' is a very disposable horror movie as deep as the title suggest. There was not one aspect that really stood out, though watching it wasn't a total waste of time as it was still an enjoyable (and sometimes laughable) movie to watch with friends.My Rating: 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance from Blake Lively against a terrifying shark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows was delightfully scary and riveting throughout the entire film. A few flaws I find that plague a lot of survival films have to do with that they are often quite long, and when there is a character in solitude, the lack of interaction with others can sometimes make a film boring or slow. This is not the case whatsoever in The Shallows which keeps the film a touch under an hour and a half. The entire point of survival films is well, that the protagonist survives, but despite that I was completely and utterly on edge during the vast majority of the movie. The race against time with the rising tide built up perfect tension, and I found the shark to be absolutely frightening! The concept of the story itself was original as well.I've been a fan of Blake Lively since she was on Gossip Girl and I think she has come a long way as an actress. Previously I thought she was good as the charismatic Serena van der Woodsen, but The Shallows is what really showcases her talent as Nancy. Even though she plays a similar charismatic fun-in-the-sun character, this time she is pretty much on her own as she acts almost entirely on her own throughout the entire movie opposite a CGI shark. That must have been quite challenging for her as an actress, and her performance was flawless. Dialogue was limited, but her range in expressions and emotions were certainly not lacking in the least.Nancy was an extremely clever character who repeatedly uses her wits in a setting that she otherwise would have had no experience with. She's a medical student who is able to apply her knowledge to help her survive a serious wound from a shark bite. This little bit of background knowledge helped round her character in a way that made sense.*****SPOILERS***** Although I think I would have enjoyed this film regardless of whether a man or a woman played the protagonist, that this was a female protagonist was just a little bit of a plus for me. As someone who has studied acting, I really appreciate it when films make some great roles for women. One thing I especially liked about Nancy as a character was that I really thought that someone else would save her in the movie. At any moment I was expecting a rescue helicopter to come save her, a pod of dolphins to come beat up the shark, anything. Instead she manages to outwit the shark and save herself.Although this is not the moment that kills the shark, my absolute favourite scene in the movie was when Nancy shoots a flare gun around the water of the dead whale and the shark is on fire for a brief moment. While the shark on fire was was quite a spectacular vision to behold and a truly great bit of CGI work, again I love how this showed that Nancy was truly a clever character for thinking about the oil that would have been coming from the whale.The only real issue I had was at the end when Nancy still has both legs. I really expected her to have lost the limb that was bitten. It was not a huge issue that this did not happen, but it would have made the ending just a little more powerful.I otherwise heavily recommend this movie, especially to fans of Jaws. I saw this with my boyfriend because Jaws is his favourite movie, and he really enjoyed it as well. As a summer flick it was a great thriller and I would definitely enjoy watching it again. I definitely plan to add it to my movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE SHALLOWS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'killer shark' horror flick, starring Blake Lively (Mrs. Ryan Reynolds!). The film tells the story of a surfer, that's stalked by a great white shark; just 200 yards from shore. It was written by Anthony Jaswinski, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra; who's also helmed such other horror flicks as 2005's 'HOUSE OF WAX' remake, and 2009's 'ORPHAN' (as well as three Liam Neeson action movies). The film has done surprisingly well at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics (and audiences) as well. I loved it.Lively plays Nancy; a medical student, that decides to go surfing at the same remote Mexican beach that her mother did, many years earlier, when she was pregnant with Nancy. Her mother recently passed away, and Nancy is thinking about dropping out of school (because of it). While surfing, Nancy is attacked by a great white shark (just 200 yards from shore). She then becomes stranded on a reef, with a wounded leg, where the shark continues to relentlessly stalk her. The movie is one of those classic survival horror flicks. It's cheesy (at times) and a little unbelievable, but it's still suspenseful; and a hell of a lot of fun! Lively delivers a great performance in it, and I enjoyed Collet-Serra's stylistic direction (the movie always looks beautiful). Even though it seems like it could be a rather slow- paced film, it never is (it pretty much flies by). I'd definitely recommend it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no close to the masterpiece that Jaws(1975) is. But The Shallows manages to keep you glued, the Mexico beach setting is presented well. Any fans of a good shark movie will find this entertaining.Nancy(Blake Lively) while vacationing, decides to take day of surfing, but long after discovers that she is not quite alone, when a shark nearly kills her, she finds refuge on a rock, and knows the shark is still out there, has hours begin to pass, she must keep her sanity, in hopes to stay alive and she outwit the shark, but will she? Blake Lively does give as pretty good descent performance, although in some scenes I felt they where trying to display some of her sexiness. It is pretty suspenseful moments with the shark, I also felt they was one scene that was paying homage to Jaws. It's not a classic, but a fun scary film that will keep you interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this films with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.I felt this on screen movie was better than the script which included a back story of Nancy's late mother. The movie touched on this but it wasn't littered with references like the script was. The movie flowed much better due to this.What "The Shallows" also got right was the reveal of the villain.The subtle references of what lurks beneath leads to a refreshing reveal - in which I must say is the best CGI incarnation there has been of a shark. Also, the shark, as the antagonist was directly set against the protagonist (Nancy). Again, rather than the usual mindless eating machine. But what the director got right most of all was the tension... no score - just the sound of the water. You are right with Nancy through all of her struggles and victories. No cut to "where's Nancy?" scenes showing bumbling friends etc.... Again, a refreshing change.The only thing which a found a moot point was the mystery of the location. It's referenced several times "what's this place called?" but you never find out, which kinds of defeats the object of it being referenced so many times throughout.You can tell the producers wanted a couple of "hollywood" moments in there which don't fit the tone of the story, but apart from that The Shallows is a fun film and definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what is driving these scores, but maybe it truly is the dreaded "sign of the times" when it comes to what people want in cinema. With that said, this scored a solid 3/10 for me.How did I come about 3? The director relies too heavily on cliché and tired camera work and heavy handed CGI. The story? doesn't get much simpler, it's melodramatic back story is loathsome.Welp, the first 30 minutes were actually tolerable. I blame that on the fact that the director hasn't been allowed to use his "toys" yet, that, and the fact the shark hasn't even been shown yet. The underlying "sense of dread" and tense is done remarkably well, as you know it's there and the surfers casual approach to the water kept you guessing when it would all turn to sh*t.(mainly, for me personally, because I am terrified of deep dark water and/or sharks).You can set a stopwatch to where the wheels fall off. As soon as the slow motion and the poorly done CGI waves start to fade out, the shark comes into play. Not only is the last half of this film an insult to the viewers intelligence, the director (whom I haven't even bothered to address by name...don't know, don't care) shows every level of an amateur who relies to heavily on tricks and gimmicks.When it finally gets down to a "one on one" with the shark, it's just plain bad film making.The shark CGI is awful. It is Sharknado 3: Electric Boogaloo worthy. This film also has a running time (if you remove the credits) at about 70-75 minutes. If you feel you got your moneys worth out of this steamer, then I probably have zero commonality in films. Sharknado did not take itself seriously, this film does.Coming in for an edit: go see 'In the Deep'. This film succeeds where this film fails miserably. Just viewed it and liked it a lot. These 8-10 ratings are ridiculous. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2932536/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very few decent shark films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until now, of all the shark movies that have graced the silver screen, there are only three that I happen to enjoy(Jaws, Jaws 2, &amp; Deep Blue Sea), one of which happens to be my favorite film of all time, that just so happens to be directed by one of the greatest directors who ever lived(the answer is obvious). After viewing The Shallows, I can safely say I have four shark movies that I enjoy. The film attempts to debunk and transcend the clichéd and tired tropes of previous shark films. Blake Lively portrays a woman named Nancy, and she does a good job with a very difficult role here. There's some context and substance you wouldn't expect in a movie like this. Although I will admit it was kinda slow, but as an audience member, knowing a little about her character held my interest and allowed me to feel enough sympathy to even care just a little bit. Not to mention she has no one to talk to for the most of the film.With a run time of less than 90 minutes, it's fast and brisk once it gets started. It's straight to the point and knows what it wants to be after learning some backstory of Lively's character, and meeting a couple of people who are most definitely shark food. Lively commands the screen and her survival instinct comes in play when she is being stalked by the great white shark. She eloquently conveys panic, fear, but also perseverance throughout, and by the end, there's something to admire about that no quitting attitude. She attempts to be one step ahead of the shark throughout, as she devises numerous of ingenious and risky strategies to prolong her survival time, but no matter what she does, she can't seem to throw the shark off-course. There's also a seagull you come to care for with a dislocated wing, injured by the shark that keeps her company while she is stranded on mini isolated reef island. Incorporating the seagull was a nice touch by the filmmakers. Speaking of filmmakers, I haven't enjoyed any of Jaume Collet-Serra's previous entries as a director. This is the first film within his resume that I happen to enjoy. Filmed in New South Wales, Australia, the film is gorgeous to look at and there are some excellent underwater camera work. He certainly knew to take advantage of the setting. Collet-Serra displays his ability to produce some tension and showcases his effective thriller timing. There are moments where one could expect and anticipate when that shark is about to jump into the frame, but even then it's still an excellent surprise moment. He also takes cues from Spielberg's Jaws, as the shark isn't showcased often, rather just in glimpses, which only makes the shark more frightening. When it is showcased, the cgi is handled with care. The shark looked great. Even after chomping on a few victims, that shark really had a thing for Nancy. In doing so, I got a sense that the shark had a personality of sorts, so another kudos for the filmmakers for incorporating that element. The Shallows isn't a game changer by any means, nor does it do anything entirely new, but it does exactly what it needs to do, and in the end its a shark movie we never knew that we needed. Perfect for summer viewing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows (2016) is a great film, it's a a very intense/suspenseful film to sit through. Blake Lively was so great in her starring role. She was so intense and very realistic here. The sequences that involve Lively and the shark are filled with pure intensity and are of a thrilling nature, as they should be. I also like how the beginning of the film is very calm and just normal, it's building up to the scariness and the suspense. Brett Cullen was good as the dad and the rest of the small cast is good I guess, I mean to be quite honest it's Blake lively that carries the film completely. But it's alright because she does it very very well. I most definitely recommend this suspenseful shark attack thriller! It's well acted, smartly written and filmed very well! I love that line too! F**k you shark! Get it girl! lol 8/10 for The Shallows</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This move is a gem!! The Shallows is able to create a very tense and frightening atmosphere, worrying when the shark will appear and threaten the main character. The suspense in this movie is beyond amazing and there is a constant sense of urgency and danger as well. The main character's life is always hanging in the balance and you never know if, or when, she will die. The lead is very likable as well, making you want to root for her, even creating a very cute and funny relationship with a bird. The camera shots are also gorgeous as well. The water and surrounding land is captured beauteously. Yet, the emptiness of the water creates a very unnerving feel and the placements of the few set pieces is unbelievable. Their is also a very strong theme of self-empowerment and finding courage in yourself. The movie is also able to jerk a few tears, which I did not expect. My only critics would be the slow start and weak backstory for the lead role. But, after the beginning sequence, I never left the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend The Shallows to anyone and everyone!! I love this movie!</fullReview>

While filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra captures the isolation in paradise with breathtaking camera-work by Flavio Martinez Labiano the stilted screenplay by Anthony Jaswinski is predictable right til the bitter end. Lively acquits herself well in her survival at any costs performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young surfer Nancy travels to a secluded beach in search of a secret spot that her mother had discovered years earlier. While paddling out into the waves, she is hunted by a great white shark and stranded on an embankment away from the shoreline. Alone and wounded, she attempts to survive the attack and get ashore by means possible, but such a short distance seems like a lifetime away......Many have said that this is this generations Jaws. Not its not, Jaws is this generations Jaws, and the next and the next, as Jaws is a timeless classic.Now, while this isn't of the same calibre as Spielberg's groundbreaking masterpiece, it's easily the best Shark attack film since Jaws, and will inject that same fear as Jaws does, every time you step into the ocean.It's a simple premise, Livlely gets bitten by a shark, finds refuge on a small rock, but the shark doesn't want just a small bite, he wants the whole Nancy, and to be fair, can you really blame the shark?Lively is wonderful as Nancy, almost channelling Hanks in Castaway, by making friends with a Seagull, and distracting herself by talking all things medicine.And it's a solid movie, short, scary, and featuring every trope you could think of in a film of this kind. The friendly surfers, shouting helplessly, the abhorrent passer by, and of course, the over the top final act.And this is what stops it from being one of the most exciting films of the year, because in an instant, it turns from a realistic, Open Water type film, to Deep Blue Sea, and although the it's an exciting finale, it takes away any sense of realism or danger that Nancy has.But other than that, it's an exciting time at the movies, and if you are travelling anywhere with an ocean view, I urge you to see this before.Obviously would make a great quad bill with Jaws, Open Water, and then Jaws:The Revenge, just to clear your head of all the serious sharks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was trying to kill a bit of time, hence the reason why I went to see this movie, not expecting much. I was actually surprised at the quality of the filming locations, the camera work, the special effects, and the lack of any serious plot holes or stretches of the imagination.A young woman goes surfing on a "secret" beach in Mexico and discovers that she has unknowingly entered into the feeding ground of a great white shark.The comparisons to *Jaws* will be unavoidable. I will not give out any serious spoilers here but the only thing that really let me down to any degree was the ending.

		<fullReview>With a cast of just a dozen, including a cute Red-billed gull, the film maintains a taut 86 minutes. Nancy (Blake Lively) gets the adventure of her life when she visits a cove in 'Mexico'. Secluded and lovely, it becomes the scene of horror and desperation.It's just another variation on Moby Dick. However, the cinematography and Blake Lively's performance overcame the lack of originality. Credit also goes to the rest of the cast.Lovely location cinematography, with excellent aerial and underwater photography. The weakest part of the film was its ending. Quite implausible.The lesson of this film is simple, "Don't leave home without your shark repellent!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie: The Shallows Feeling as the credits roll: Loved It, Scared to Surf, Good Movie. Movie Rating: 8.0/10 Soundtrack Rating: 7.0/10Watch in IMAX?: Not essential. Not filmed with IMAX camera's. Watch in 3D? Not essential. Not filmed with 3D camera's.Movie Review:I was immediately brought into the story as the main actress, played by Blake Lively, is on her way to a remote beach she had never been, but always dreamed of going to. Within the first couple minutes of the film, you're on the beach. There are very few actors in this movie, and so the story and what is going on is easy to follow. As far as a perfect "arc" goes, The Shallows takes you for a hell of a ride, from the first shot, to the last. I was scared. I knew the whole time what was initially going to happen, but not how it was going to happen (I'm sorry, if you didn't know already, this film is based on a shark attack(s)). It was riveting, suspenseful, and man, I've got to admit, Blake Lively was hot. If the storyline, music, and scenery wasn't already enough, you've got 90 minutes to watch this actress shine. And I mean shine.Though I love any film shot on a beach, and had a feeling I was going to like this movie, I am still slightly shocked as to how good The Shallows is. A simple storyline, with minimal to no graphics (Other than the shark scenes), this movie feels real. Nothing to distract you, other than Blake Lively, but she brings you right into the story. And the closer to the story you get, the scarier it is when the shark is lurking. Don't kid yourself, this beautifully shot shark attack movie has got it all. And though the sun is shimmering most of the time, it is a horror flick. So be prepared to jump. I am seriously not sure how much I want to surf again. I've already had a couple fears while in the water hanging onto my board, but this is to a whole new level. That being said, I was inspired at the end of the film, and will get back in that water again. Not to mention, Rob Stewarts documentary, Sharkwater. If you've been scared of sharks because of the media and movies like The Shallows, watch Sharkwater. It will change your view of sharks and you won't be scared of these beautiful creatures in everyday real ocean life.Go see The Shallows. See it in theatres. The Big Screen really allows the shark scenes to jump out at you, the music rumbles in the theatre, and Blake Lively gives a great performance. Awesome movie, great horror flick, and yet still makes you want to go to a remote beach. But maybe not jump into the water. . .Soundtrack Review: Original Music by: Marco BeltramiThere was nothing spectacular about the soundtrack, but it certainly played to the scenes very well. The composer created fear, love and every other emotion you were meant to hear and feel, perfectly. I would not buy this soundtrack to listen to for fun, but it melded with the story and movie fantastically. Overall great soundtrack for The Shallows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that Shallows is almost as good as Jaws. Plus, the incredible cinematography by Flavio Labiano is 100 times better than Jaws. I was IN that ocean -- the warmth of the sun, the coolness of the water, the sound of being underwater, the crash of the surf -- I never had so good a swim while sitting down! I am disappointed that so many critics turned up their noses. I guess they don't understand that a good Summer Movie is primarily FUN. As a woman, I winced a little at Blake's skimpy bikini, especially on that jagged coral. I was intrigued by her ingenious efforts to survive and defeat the shark. And I did fall in love with the seagull.Yes, the ending was pretty unbelievable, but so what. It was a gorgeous ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film, very engaging and thrilling. Has its heart-stopping moments, not least the one right into the third or fourth minute of it. Phew!Isn't without its flaws of course (such as, where did that drunk man's dead body disappear suddenly that the two guys who came back the next day could see it for themselves the danger attached with jumping into the water?), but the ending, the death of the villainous shark, is such a masterpiece that you easily forget the rest of the stuff.Despite all the praise and admiration, it doesn't go down as a 10 out of 10 film, not the kind of film where I would be saying that it was a never forgettable experience, or a once-in-a-lifetime one. It definitely was good, but somehow not up to some of the other experiences I've had in the cinema in the past. Maybe it was too short in length (87 minutes) and the thrill was too short-lived? Maybe. Although it's a well documented fact in my past reviews that I really dislike films too long in length, but since this was a film full of thrills and those heart-stopping moments and doesn't fall into the same category as many other films. But this is not a criticism of the film. There's not too much you can do with a shark in water.So, again, a good film overall and the performance by Blake Lively was pretty impressive. More of seven and a half than seven in my view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws started it all, followed of course by its three terrible sequels, and many movies about sharks have followed: Deep Blue Sea, Open Water, The Reef and Shark Night to name a few, oh, and crap like Sharknado, this was the latest in the trend, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan, Unknown, Non-Stop). Basically medical student Nancy Adams (Gossip Girl's Blake Lively) has travelled to Mexico to find a secluded beach to surf, she wants to find the beach that her mother, who recently passed away, found out she was pregnant with Nancy on. Friendly local resident Carlos (Óscar Jaenada) drives her to this beach, soon after arriving she is joined by two other local residents (Angelo José Lozano Corzo and José Manuel Trujillo Salas), and the three of them surf for several hours. Nancy takes a break from surfing to video chat with her sister Chloe (Sedona Legge) and father (Brett Cullen), the conversation about her mother gets her emotional, Nancy hangs up and decides to catch one more late afternoon wave before heading back to her hotel. While waiting for a wave, Nancy the carcass of a large humpback whale floating, then while riding her last wave her surf board is bumped by a large Great White Shark, she falls into the water and hits her head on a submerged rock. As Nancy surfaces, the shark bites her leg, pulling her under, but she gets away and swims onto the whale carcass, she stays there for a few, before swimming to a nearby isolated rock, and improvises a bandage using her surfboard strap and the sleeve of her wet suit to stop the bleeding. The two locals leave, unaware of Nancy's situation, forcing her to spend the night on the rock, with an injured seagull she names "Steven" (after Steven Seagal). The next morning, a drunk local man (Diego Espejel) is on the beach, Nancy gets his attention, but instead of helping her he steals her money, phone and backpack, and when he tries to retrieve her surfboard he ends up torn apart by the shark. Several hours later, the two surfers have returned, they get into the water before Nancy can warn them, the shark kills them, but Nancy is able to retrieve the GoPro camera helmet from one of the men, she records a message for her father and sister, and throws the helmet towards the shore. High tide is approaching and the rock Nancy is on will be submerged, she is able to time the shark's circling from the whale carcass to the rock, she manages to swim to the nearby buoy, through a group of jellyfish, which sting both her and the shark. On the buoy Nancy finds a flare gun, but she fails to get the attention of a passing cargo ship, she fires at the shark, which catches fire from the floating whale blubber, the shark dives to stop being badly burned. The shark then starts furiously attacking the buoy, ripping the chains securing it to the ocean bed, Nancy grabs the last remaining chain as it is ripped and she is violently pulled down, the shark chases her down at high speed, but she pulls out at the last minute, the shark impales itself on metal wreckage sprouting from the buoy's concrete anchor. The GoPro camera is found near the shore by Carlos' son (Pablo Calva), who brings his father to the beach, Carlos finds Nancy floating in the shallows, she is relieved to be rescued, and see Steven Seagull has made it to shore. One year later, Nancy has recovered, with a large scar on her leg, she is surfing in Galveston, Texas with Chloe and her father. Also starring Janelle Bailey as Mom, Ava Dean as Young Nancy and Chelsea Moody as Young Mom. Lively who has to carry almost the whole film alone does pretty well as the innocent girl trying to survive, it does use the elements we've come to expect from Jaws, but there is the right amount of uncomfortable bloody bits and tension, good editing and cinematography, and you do root for the heroine to survive against the monster, a cleverly constructed and enjoyable survival horror thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what you want from a Shark film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first time you see Nancy (Blake Lively) enter the water you are always looking around the water surrounding her expecting the Shark. The director has done some incredible work with the scenery and cinematography of this film.Blake Lively is great in this film considering she had to carry the majority of the screen time and the way she acts with the shark is great considering the shark was CGI. Her acting and use of body language really gives you the feeling of fear and you put yourself into her position and this film makes you think about what you would do in this situation.As far as the shark goes this is a brilliant, realistic shark that you really do feel is in the water surrounding Nancy. Not too big to be unrealistic but not to small to reduce the fear factor. Everything about the shark is great. The director gives the shark a personality of its own and it has different situations to act to.This film does a great job of balancing the gore, reality, characters personalities, attacks and for a film that is on for under 90 minutes, it keeps you on the edge of your seat for around 70 of those minutes.Only downsides would be that i would've liked to have seen more of the shark from a personal point of view because there is a good enough build up to expect a lot more shark screen time however all said and done an outstanding film that many can't fault and I would love to see another one like this very soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blake made probably her best performance with this role as she plays victim of shark attack. You can feel her pain and agony as she fights for her life while at the same time trying to stay as sane as possible. Movie on the other hand is a little slow at the beginning but then after some time it shows us real deal and why we came for the movie. Shark is frightening at some moments but at other you don't feel such thing as it seems more and more predictable. Some scenes can feel unreal as shark seems so violent and determined to get to her at any cost even when he need to go through steel. Surfing scenes were nicely done and slow motion at certain points is very well used but there is probably too much of slow motion scenes. Worst part of whole movie was drunk guy. First of all what was he doing on a beach that only some people are able to find, second when he listen Blake as she pointed him to bag but didn't listen to her when she said to get out of water he must be some greedy guy that has nothing else to do then rob people. Shallows is maybe Blake's way to more serious roles and it offers strong performance but lacks connection with main character and more scenes that are going to keep audience tense and in expectation of terrifying moments.

		<fullReview>On the good side cgi and special effects are well made and some of the images of the beach and the ocean are stunning. The acting is good giving a sense of immersion and overall the viewer definitely experiences the terror inflicted by the shark on the protagonist. The movie is a good survival story and i would recommend watching it. But i don't think it's a must see in a theater. You can totally watch it home and this is why:When i took a look at the budget before seeing the movie i knew they couldn't allow themselves to integrate too much action scenes including cgi. To counter this, they needed a very good script. This is where the movie falls short of expectations in my opinion. The story is much too simple to be the sole plot of an entire movie. To counter that a lot of emphasis is placed on the emotional side of the story. At some points it gets a little boring, you have the feeling that those simplistic scenes (budget wise) were thrown in solely to enable a minimal duration of 1 hour and a half long for the movie. I was therefore a bit disappointed and still hungering for more since not much is happening unfortunately, even with a quite short movie. But still i recommend watching it at home it's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Functional, yet underwhelming shark thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shallows" lured me in with a trailer that does no more than tensely establishing the setup of the film (instead of spoiling every major twist). I was hoping for a clear-cut, slow-burning thriller that plays out in a minimalist yet effective way. What I got was a film that works in principle and is structured rather well, but whose aesthetics and themes are way too blatant.There are surf scenes in a staccato of slow and fast motion, spiced up with soft-techno music, just to hammer home the fact that surfing is supposed to be 'cool'. The character arc of Nancy (Balke Livley) is simple to understand, yet the movie has to remind the audience at least three times quite obviously what its about. And even though the main protagonist looks sexy enough in her bikini and her skintight suit, the camera-work has to stress the curves of her body as to make sure that even the last male and lesbian tongue is lolling. (I have nothing against that, but after a time, the emphasized sexiness felt a little distracting). It seems this movie was made by Captain Obvious, but to my surprise, it was the director of "Non-Stop", "Unknown" and "Run all Night". Subtlety is not a language that "The Shallows" speaks. For me, these elements of the film didn't work that well, but they aren't terrible either.Apart from that, the film can be enjoyed as a nice little B-Picture. Some of the underwater and panorama shots look gorgeous, as does the location on which the movie was filmed. However, the camera work in the beginning is somewhat terrible; the faces of the actors feel too close and the scenes on the beach are more shaky than the scenes in the water. The Film manages to build some nice tension in the middle part and Nancy is quite resourceful and intelligent in her ways to deal with the shark. However, the movie wastes some potential in the finale that is just full of weird coincidences and unbelievable animal behavior.I enjoyed "The Shallows" for what it was and would recommend it to people who like the premise. It definitely has its strengths, but from the aesthetic choices and the way the film talks to its audience, it's clear that it was made with a teenage viewership in mind. And that's fine! However, I didn't enjoy these design decisions as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strong performance from Blake Lively</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much hype about this film as all I had seen were a couple of trailers before other movies in the cinema so I wasn't sure what to expect. The main attraction to this film was that Blake Lively was starring in it and also the fact that everybody loves a good shark thriller and there hadn't been any successful ones made in years. I would never have put Blake Lively as 'serious' actress but after seeing The Shallows I feel that she really proves herself as a well capable actress. Taking into consideration that Blake is the only actor with any screen-time bar a couple of minutes at the very beginning, she did an unbelievable job and I feel it was an outstanding performance reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Castaway and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant. Movies where there is one actor on screen for the majority of the running time with very little dialogue, are very tricky, as the single actor has to keep the audience interested on their own for the duration of the movie. Blake did this precisely and as an audience member, I feel like she really captured the authenticity of what we as humans endure, to survive and how adrenaline gives us our superhuman abilities in abnormal circumstances. I think Lively's performance is fair to compare to Oscar-winning actor's DiCaprio and Hanks as she did just as good a job but will not get the recognition she deserves. If it is the fact that she is a woman I do not know, but I feel her performance was flawless and proved that female actors are just as capable as men to carry an entire movie on their own.A flaw I found with the movie was the CGI of the shark itself. It looks fake and computerised which ruined the effects for me and I was taken out of the realness I had previously felt while. The special FX look like they would have been remarkable back in 2002 however, not up to 2016 standard which I found extremely disappointing. Regardless of that, something that did impress was the breathtaking cinematography of the waves and movements of Blake and her fellow actors being attacked by the shark as well as being pulled by the undercurrents of the water. This was true cine- magic and I found myself constantly asking '"how the hell did they film that?" throughout the movie.Overall, Blake Lively was really what did it for me and in my opinion it was a real breakthrough performance which put her up on a pedestal with the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Connolly, to name a few. Acting was consistent throughout and although the shark was not as 'real' as I had hoped there were still many jumpy bits that had me on the edge of my seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shallows, on the whole, is quite the success and can be celebrated for its originality in a summer season that has otherwise lacked it. It is definitely inspired by other shark- starring films (Jaws, of course, springs to mind) but avoids too many of the clichés and tropes. While contested by a certain feathered friend, Lively puts in a brilliantly powerful performance which is all strengthened by a solid direction and post-production efforts. Yes, I complain about the actual shark, but The Shallows is the type of small-budgeted, star and character driven box office affair that is slowly starting to disappear from cinemas, and this $17 million production is becoming more and more of a rarity and risk for studios who are now continually chasing franchises and tentpoles, meaning I can forgive the fact that not every crease is ironed out. It is a shame that these type of films are becoming less common in the cinema schedule because, as with the recently released Nerve, The Shallows is a wonderful summer popcorn flick.Summary: The Shallows is thrilling, taut and tense summer popcorn flick with a powerful performance from Blake Lively at the very front and centreFULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/08/the-shallows-2016- review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Shark attack survival tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My take on The Shallows (English) 2016: Survival flicks have always been my favorite. So thought recap some of my favorite survival flicks before actually reviewing the current one "Black Water" "Frozen (2010)" "127 Hours" "Burning Bright" ( I am taking "Cast away" " Life of Pi" " Gravity" in this list because of it higher production values). The Shallows is a solid survival flick which falls in line with the above mentioned movies. With that genre introduction let's see what the movie has to offer. Lone survival ? animal attack ? Thriller- Secluded place- touring/expedition gone wrong and off-course shark attack are some of the key words that can best describe this movie. Blake lively as Nancy goes on a relaxing holiday to a secluded beach and enjoys her freedom surfing where she encounters a shark attack and whether she was able to win the shark and get to the shore safely is the next 1 hour 25 mins movie in front of you. With the whole weight of the movie on her shoulder Blake Lively has given a solid performance in terms of her expressions, screams and courageous attempts acts. On the technical side the cinematography was so vivid showcasing the beauty of the beach in terms of its depth and color which actually sets the ambiance for the movie. VFX works were commendable. The best part of the movie the thrill element was kept intact ie the shark itself by not showcasing it every now and then ,we see it surface few times with a terror unexpected entry. Screen play and direction has went hand in hand. The climax was a bit soggy. Otherwise it was a worth watch. Highly recommended for those crazy Survival thriller lovers out there. I would rate it 7 on 10.- Sivakumar Balachandran</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woman against shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like James Franco in "127 hours" Blake Lively is making a statement with "Shallows": I am not just a pretty face. "The private lives of Pippa Lee" (2009) initially drew attention to Lively, although hers is a small role. "Green Lantern" (2011)is a big feature but the heroine's role is more decorative than anything else. "Savages" (2012), a slightly off-beat crime thriller gave her a chance to perform. Last year she had her break with the title role in "the age of Adaline", a melodrama. "Shallows" requires a different kind of acting: raw, basic, instinctive emotion. Even accomplished actors like Reese Witherspoon had to take this sort of challenge once, in "Wild" (2014). This is all willpower, tenaciousness against adversity. But unlike in these two other movies mentioned, the killing "nature" here is not just the elements, but a vicious, formidable adversary, a killer shark in its own feeding territory. There is of course the mandatory backdrop story, in this case a happy family with wonderful parents and an adorable little sister. The mother's untimely death after an agonizing fight against cancer devastated the family. Bitter at the failure of medical technology, Nancy (Lively) drops out of medical-school and makes a pilgrimage to an idyllic beach in Mexico that her mother had once shown her in pictures. Obviously, the attraction of a film in this genre is not in convoluted plots or clever twists but rather in depicting the danger, the ordeal and the survival (or otherwise). The success of "The shallows" is generally acknowledge by critics. I would only mention that the stages, literally meant, where this woman-vs-shark ordeal plays out are, in succession, the body of a dead whale (partly eaten), a coral rock that become completely submerged in high tide and a buoy that could be described as a miserably small metal islet that, even being metal, cannot hold its own against the shark's powerful jaws. Lively's mesmerizing performance, beautifully captured by a skillful camera, makes this 86-minute film well worth seeing.</fullReview>

That team certainly has the worse sense of timing - another film portraying their species in a negative light for the summer blockbuster season. 'Jaws' (1975) has a lot to answer for!At points this much leaner film gives Jaws a run for its money, impressive considering there is much less screen time and precious little in terms of plot or production design. The Shallows presents the shark as much more than a mindless, destructive eating machine. Here, it is manipulative, calculating and cunning, outwitting it's human quarry at every move.Lively is kept on her toes by this mighty fish and turns in a muscular performance in a film that will keep you squirming in your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average stranded at sea movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie skeptical because how many movies can be made were the viewer watches people trapped in the ocean with sharks after them. There have been a few. Most notably is the movie 'The Reef'. But i was surprised at how much this movie kept my attention. Now the reason behind the woman going to this specific secluded beach was meant to be heartfelt but it came off as a little cheesy to me. It was an attempt to give a logical reason why she picked that secluded spot. But you could tell right from the start nothing good was going to come from this trip. The shark was very elusive to the camera. This is not one of those shark movies where they let you see a lot of the shark. Mostly jump scares. What made this movie good was the tension. Needless to say the woman/victim gets trapped out in the ocean and realizes a shark is hunting her. She sees other people get eaten and killed and she knows she cant last long without some help or a miracle. So basically the movie is spent showing her survive the relentless shark that seems to be obsessed with her. At some point without ruining the story she is bleeding. So that adds a frightening dynamic to her already bleak situation. The real action doesn't come till you basically sat through the whole movie, but it is some what satisfying. If you like shark movies, this is better than some of the other straight to video fluff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent at best, The Shallows might just stand out in a summer crowded with unremarkable films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'So close yet so far' might be an apt irony to describe The Shallows, a B-movie horror-thriller that just manages to stay afloat. Just about, because the setup is quite ridiculous to begin with, yet visually arresting when required. It doesn't help either that the story is a no-brainer where almost every situation is force-fed via exposition. It gets to a point where the main character Nancy (bikini clad Blake Lively) says exactly what she is about to do, to let us know exactly what is about to happen. And we do.The situation has Nancy - a surfer babe on holiday at a Mexican beach ? stalked by a great white shark. The shark is both psychotic and very, very hungry. Amongst the many ironies in this film, the most obvious is the fact that she is just two hundred yards from shore. That's a short distance for her athletic abilities but also the death zone and probably where the film gets its title. Between the shark and the shore, Nancy finds herself stranded on a rock with time running out before the tide comes in. We know this because every ticking minute is flashed on screen thanks to her Casio Baby-G. Her watch, her knowledge as a medical student and memories of her mother fighting cancer sets the stage for what turns out to be survival against all odds.If this was a Spielberg film someone would have suggested a bigger boat, instead director Jaume Collet-Serra is content with staging all the action and terror in limited space and without lavish visual effects. Having previously directed that little 2009 thriller Orphan, Collect-Serra isn't new to the horror genre and it shows. There are some gorgeous underwater scenes, a lot of blood, tense moments of suspense leading to jump scares, and even a joke about a wounded seagull, but is that enough? Call it a fluke, and however middling The Shallows might seem at times, it could still prove a tad bit better than the horde of unremarkable films this summer. And like the title says, there isn't much depth but watching lively Lively is worth the time it takes to sink your teeth into this one; or the shark - whichever bites first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far-fetched, but still a tense and enjoyable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as shark movies go, The Shallows is definitely one of the better ones (although its competition isn't the strongest). As a pure thriller, the film works well in creating tension and suspense on multiple occasions, even with a few good jumpscares, whilst Blake Lively impresses in a very tough and physical role. However, its story is often extremely far-fetched, and means that the overall film comes across in a sillier fashion than it should do.However, let's start with what I liked most about this film. On the whole, director Jaume Collet-Serra does a very good job here. Throughout, there's a lot of good suspense that keeps the film moving fast, and on one or two occasions instils a little bit of fear too. Playing off of classic Jaws-like sequences, The Shallows makes the shark an undoubtedly menacing presence, and although it's not as terrifying as possible, I always felt that it was a genuine and strong enough threat to Blake Lively's character throughout.Also, Collet-Serra manages to direct the environment pretty well. The rock on which Blake Lively finds herself stranded for so long does feel claustrophobic, and the shark is always a looming presence, keeping the tension high throughout.It's a well-directed movie, apart from one detail that kept popping up and frustrating me as I watched. The location of the rocks within the bay isn't always consistent. At times, it does indeed feel just a short 200 yards away from the shore, and tantalisingly close for Blake Lively to escape, but at others, the rocks are visually more isolated and distant from the objects around them.I'd like to believe that this was done deliberately, to create a greater sense of isolation and peril, but the fact that I could clearly see that the rocks weren't always in the same place really bugged me throughout, and contributed to the film's rather far- fetched nature (which I'll get onto in a moment).Blake Lively also impresses here. Her character may not be given the most thrilling arc, nor did I ever feel much emotion as to whether she ultimately lives or dies, but when it comes to some extremely physical sequences, whether she's battling with the shark or escaping away, she does a great job, and makes the fight with the CGI sea creature fully convincing.I was surprised that there was so much to like about this movie, because I expected something far dumber. The only part of the film that lived up to that expectation was the story. It's by no means bad, and the tension of the premise kept me engaged throughout, but there are definitely moments where the film wants you to empathise a lot more with the main character, even though the screenplay just isn't effective enough to bring that across.What's more is that the final act of the film is, for lack of a better word, stupid. Again, I was engrossed enough by the tension that I still enjoyed watching, but the way in which the film draws to a close, and the way that the shark and Blake Lively finish their duel is frankly insane, and had me laughing my head off (along with several other people in the screening).Overall, however, The Shallows was a big surprise. Shark movies are generally terrible, and I had low expectations for this, so I was delighted to end up with a tense, entertaining, well-directed and well-acted thriller. It may sometimes stray beyond the bounds of logic, but it's an engaging watch throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent film with a good lead performance and some engaging scenes but too much CGI and a weak final act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Shallows' is the latest film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra - who brought you several fun Liam Neeson action flicks, including 'Non-Stop' and 'Unknown'. It focuses upon a young woman, portrayed by Blake Lively, who becomes stranded just a few hundred feet from shore when a shark begins to stalk her. The picture is a short 86 minutes, meaning that its limited premise isn't stretched out at all; the brisk pace allows for the story to be pushed as far as it can without breaking, leading to a lean flick that manages to constantly sustain the thin narrative. Overall, I liked it but it has several flaws - most of which are narrative based.I'll start with the positives. The shark itself is fairly well realised, especially during the first two-thirds of the film. It isn't actually on-screen in full for a while, and the majority of the time it lurks beneath the surface. This is a technique borrowed from 'Jaws (1975)', except this time it isn't due to technical constraints. It works really well and the flick is at its best when the shark is a threat but not directly present. The fin carving through the water and the looming shadow from beneath the waves both inspire a certain amount of dread, and the beast feels the most realistic during these moments. The other positive is that the direction is not only competent but also mostly satisfying. Aside from a few odd jump-cuts and an occasionally 'music-video' vibe, the direction shows the action cleanly and effectively sets up each individual confrontation. The use of wide- angles and sometimes sweeping camera moves emphasise the isolation felt by the character, making the situation both understandable and tangible. There's some great 'injury make-up' that looks realistic enough to inspire a wince, especially during some gruelling scenes where you can really feel the pain. The script is decent but not out- standing, working best when there isn't any dialogue; it is never dull either. There are also a couple of jump scares that are effective and the film maintains a taught pace too.Now for the negatives. The main flaw I have is that the main character isn't really that engaging or interesting. Her back-story is actually rather weak, coming across as generic and obligatory. It is also told through a series of text messages, photos and video-calls which pop up on the screen in strange ways. This is trying to create a specific style, but it is dropped entirely once the shark comes into play. This means that it feels out of place and ineffective, and you have to wonder why it was done in the way it was. I didn't really care all that much about the lead character, though Blake Lively does a good enough job portraying her. The performance works best when there is no dialogue, as Lively manages to convey pain and emotion through nothing but body-language. I felt her anguish in some scenes, and wanted her to survive, but the characterisation was pretty fragile. As I mentioned earlier, the direction is mostly good. However, there's a few early scenes focusing on surfing that feel more like an 'MTV' music video than a feature film; there's strange, misplaced techno music and excessive speed-ramping. The director also includes some out-of-place false jump scares which inspire groans rather than shrieks, some odd 'found-footage' sequences that break the flow of the narrative and an unnecessary tacked-on epilogue that feels redundant. The shark as a whole didn't feel like a huge threat either, even though it's dangerous nature is made clear early on. It doesn't seem fully palpable, especially since it's all CGI. It looks good when only partially visible, specifically when it is nothing more than a silhouette against the cool blue sea (a nice juxtaposition of calm and aggression), but is on-screen in its entirety a little too often towards the end. This means that, for me, the danger didn't feel as real. The final act is contrived and unbelievable, inspiring sighs rather than cheers, and it also feels a little coincidental. On top of that, the film has trouble maintaining a consistent tone and I honestly didn't find it scary or all that tense. Overall, 'The Shallows' is an enjoyable but flawed thriller that will keep you engaged throughout its short run-time; the physical acting is good, the predicament is prominent and the pain is tangible. The shark isn't that realistic when on screen, there isn't all that much tension and the final act is extremely contrived but I still liked the overall experience despite its flaws: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2016 has certainly given us some pleasurable slugfests thus far. Trump vs Hillary. LeBron vs the Golden St Warriors. Stark vs Bolton. Weekly Sunday Night Chinese Food vs My Aging Metabolism. And now we have Blake Lively vs Shark. A matchup that might seem more lopsided than the demographics of the Scripps National Spelling Bee at first glance, but will end up going a satisfying yet brisk 12 rounds. I won't say who is LeBron and who is the Warriors in this situation, but I will say that I've tended to root for Shark throughout his entire filmography?.. except of course when he's pitted against the lovable Ian Ziering. (btw ? I highly recommend Sam Donsky's brilliant celebrity profile of Shark on The Ringer.)This isn't to say, by any means, that this is a great movie, not even close. You will not see up close cutaways to Lively and Shark (with a grinning Ryan Reynolds in the background trying to hide his jealousy) during the Oscars telecast next February. Rather, it's a savory 87 minute, comfy excursion from DC swamp season. Yes it's cheesy, yes Lively has a few too many conversations with herself, but the suspense hits for the most part and I was actually quite impressed with a lot of the under water cinematography (although this may not translate as well on a smaller screen).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blake Lively Saves The Shallows!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blake Lively's performance in 'The Shallows' is very engaging. The movie is basically a one-woman show. Blake gives everything she has to make her fight for survival look realistic and she really does it great. Her performance elevates the movie above the usual mediocrity one is used to seeing in these kinds of survival movies these days. She's not only easy on the eyes in her surfer outfit, but she also acts realistically and makes you feel the character's pain.I thought it was a pretty decent and relatively realistic shark attack movie ? up until the finale that is. Just before the final fight against the shark, there is an under-water scene involving glowing jellyfish, which just seems completely unrealistic and out of place to me. That scene is something for a sci-fi movie. Then there is the final fight in which the shark is killed in the most ridiculous and unrealistic way imaginable. The payoff in this otherwise decent movie is just laughable and something I would have expected seeing in a Sharknado installment or something.It's too bad that the movie doesn't hold up until the very end, but it is still a rather decent survival movie. Watch it for Blake Lively's great performance, if nothing else.</fullReview>

Most of them were over the top regarding the shark. What we have here is the fight of human against shark and it do has the creepiness of Jaws. The way it was shot looked great, the use of picture in picture when using the phone or the underwater shots in slo-mo when they hit the wave boarding it all looks great. And even as it took a while before the disaster comes in it all worked out fine. It's really after a while one person (Blake Lively) against the monster. And knowing that the tide comes in is the main reason what makes this flick a suspenseful flick.The effects are really great, all fish looks like the real stuff, the shark attacks do look like the shark from Jaws and the wounds on Blake also looked real, yes, this one I did like.

		<fullReview>I'm coming from the perspective of a shark movie nut. So my review is for those who share this strange obsession!I really enjoyed this film - and by enjoyed I mean it really did what a good shark movie should. Have you sitting there covering your eyes moaning "no no no, I can't look". And yet at the same time make it less drawn out than many do which was refreshing and all the more engaging. Some other positives: -Beautiful setting -Not nearly as cheesy as most shark movies -Decent lead acting and focusing on her as a human being rather than as a sex object which is unusual and refreshing. (By this I mean Blake is a beautiful young woman, but there was a minimal amount of sexual emphasis on this beyond the obligatory bikini boob shot at the start.) I REALLY found this great and such a big step forward! It sets the tone of the movie at a far higher bar than the usual flesh feast shark movies do (HAR HAR) and helps make the whole thing much more believable and serious. -It's scary, did I mention this?! -It felt pretty original as far as shark movies go, with a smart female protagonist and a simple storyOkay so the only bad thing and the reason it wasn't a 10/10 for me: -Just to unrealistic - I don't want to spoil things so I won't go into detail but I feel the story went just a bit too far in the shark's actions. If it had kept to erring on the side of realism it would have been all the more thrilling and in the end make the difference between a shark movie vs. a psychological thriller that isn't in any form unbelievable or silly.Ultimately though I'd 100% recommend this film to any shark movie nut. And to those who aren't, it's worth giving it a go as it's a cut above the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texan Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) is a medical student vacationing in Mexico. Her friend abandons her for a guy. She wants to surf the same isolated beach as her late mother did many years ago. She gets a lift from local Carlos who doesn't tell her the name of the beach or doesn't understand her question. She is joined by two local surfers. She video-chats with her sister Chloe and then her father. She goes out alone, plays with dolphins, encounters a dead whale, and gets attacked by a shark.Blake Lively has not been my favorite actress. She always seem like the SoCal girl no matter what the role requires. She's a beautiful woman but she has never struck me as a complex actress. Recently, she has gotten better. This one continues her recent uptick. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has cut his teeth on tight thrillers and horrors. He's able to squeeze out a small compelling little thriller out of Lively. The setting looks beautifully tropical. This is not anything ground breaking but it does work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While i know some shark movies can be cheesy and others can be fan favorites such as the classic jaws and another favorite of mine deep blue sea. The story follows med student nancy adams played by blake lively who visits the island her mother went to when she was pregnant with her. As a way of coping with her mother death, nancy decides to surf and i will say the cinematography captures the island quite well particularly the beach. However nancy day of fun turns into a nightmare as she encounters a shark which soon turns into a battle of survival. The film despite being only 86 minutes long captures nancy terror and determination to survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shallows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to compare The Shallows to other horror films such as Open Water, Open Water 2: Adrift and Black Water, not only because of sharing aquatic settings and minimum casts, but because they all handle themes of isolation, discouragement and search of internal strength, generally inspired by adverse circumstances which put men and women in conflict against nature. In The Shallows, said circumstances include a fierce shark determined to devour a female surfer who got stranded on a rock in a short distance to a beach she can't reach due to the wounds she suffered during the shark's first attack... and because it doesn't stop stalking her cautious attempts to escape. The idea is simple, but screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski expertly complicates the narrative with multiple variables which make a positive or negative influence on the main character's tortuous experience. Needless to say, I won't mention those variables, but I can say that The Shallows cunningly avoids any monotony in order to become a clever and fascinating horror film full of suspense, exciting action and excellent special effects which keep themselves into the limits imposed by the PG-13 rating, but not losing any impact because of that. The direction from Jaume Collet-Serra (making his best film so far, in my opinion) is fluid and economic, and it is supported by perfect cinematography which captures even the most agitated scenes with clarity and visual beauty; we never lose the notion of time and space, something which is essential for us to get hooked on the main character's experiences. Speaking of which, Blake Lively brings a very good performance in that role, naturally expressing the fear and anguish her character goes through, as well as the machinations of her brain to escape, or at least improve her chances of survival. Needless to say, The Shallows should't be taken as a documentary about marine fauna, because the behaviour of the shark doesn't correspond to any zoological reality; but I didn't care at all about that. It's a movie shark, more "monster" than "animal", and I was perfectly capable to accept that. I have said in other occasions that the best horror movies are the ones which have an interesting story even from before the elements of the genre come in; however, The Shallows is an exception. The horror is the only thing defining it, and that was enough to keep me hugely entertained. I enthusiastically recommend it both to casual spectators and fans of the "man (or woman) against nature".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blake Lively's acting, which is both traditional and physical, is one of the dishes which sells this film, and the star supporting actress is the camera which is her accurate and loving slave. Every muscle she moves is captured on celluloid as if you the viewer were next to her in her adventure. When I was watching this movie I had to convince myself that I was there and the shark was not CG, and that was by no means difficult to do. Several horror films have successfully managed to capture sexy underwater images but none have done it quite as well as this movie. Oh and I forgot about all the thrills and the suspense and the blood, and the music and the involving script and the differing supporting characters within the plot. In terms of longevity it is gore and sexualisation that makes a film memorable and film makers who do not realise that are na?ve; as I write the ONLY 7 films to have been released in that category in the last 18 months are Ex Machina, It Follows, Fifty Shades Of Grey, Crimson Peak, Conjuring 2, Neon Demon and The Shallows. As a group beat those if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know most of you are shocked that I titled this review "Better than Jaws". To understand this, keep reading.I went last month to see The Shallows. I'd seen a lot of advertisement online and thought that it looked like a decent movie. I went with my family and after a bunch of X rated, horrible advertisements (that we needed to walk out of the room for) we finally saw the movie.There have been a lot of leading ladies in Hollywood lately. Blake Lively doesn't disappoint. She is one tough chick in this movie. I liked the backstory and the graphics were GREAT! There wasn't a lot of dialog in this movie but honestly, it really doesn't need it. The shark was scary and the action scenes great. I liked that it wasn't overly gory but it wasn't fake-looking. The shark's habits were just like those of a real shark - they did their homework! All in all I left the theaters highly satisfied. Here are the things I think needed some work.1: Why would Blake swim TOWARDS a dead whale and hang around it? Has she never watched Animal Planet? Shark week? JAWS? Even I know not to go near a half-dead, bloody whale in the ocean. It OBVIOUSLY would attract sharks. And, wouldn't there be MORE sharks?2. The ending. As soon as she speeds down to the ocean floor (which was NOT shallow), I just knew she had the bends. It was kind of fantastic to have the shark spike itself. 3. WHY WOULD SHE GO BACK INTO THE OCEAN. AND WITH HER SISTER!? I know I would be scarred for life. But even if she does face her fears and go back into the ocean, wouldn't she leave her sister on land so she would be safe? You know, someone to call for help in case another shark chased her on a rock again? I just knew a shark was going to pop out at the ending and attack the sisters. Was that a hint to a "The Shallows 2"?I liked this movie a LOT. I would say absolutely watch it. I wouldn't let a kid under 10 watch it. And if they scare easy or if they've watched a Jaws movie and had nightmares don't let them watch it.ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>take away the thin plot line and mediocre digital effects there is little left other than an attractive woman in a bikini fighting for her life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the scariest movies ever made, Jaws (1975) made sharks one of the most feared creatures on earth. Its director Stephen Spielberg was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of terror himself, who understood that what is not seen can be far more terrifying than what is obvious. Like many shark thrillers, The Shallows (2016) continues the tradition of demonising sharks and goes one step further by adding a favourite sub-genre for the male gaze: the bikinied woman in danger. Lest anyone suggest there is misogyny or voyeurism in keeping a woman exposed to a marauding shark for almost an entire film, the story is marketed as a feminist triumph of survival.It is a one-woman show with a simple plot line that spans two days. Medical student Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) travels alone to a tranquil but isolated beach looking for solace while she considers giving up medicine. The photography beautifully captures the tranquillity, the rolling waves, the glistening skin, and the menacing shadow of something big just beneath the surface. She catches a few waves, meets a couple of regular board riders who eventually go home, and she is then stalked aggressively by a massive great white shark. Thanks to med school, she is able to use a fish hook and earring wire to surgically stitch up a gaping thigh wound that was the shark's entre, all while bonding with a lonely seagull in her existential struggle for survival. With no help possible, she must out-manoeuvre the beast or be served up for dinner only a hundred metres from the beach.Digital effects have revolutionised movies and when done well they make the impossible seem real. But when not done well, it is hard to take a movie seriously. This great white shark resembles a blow-up toy and its repeated munching on the steel buoy defies even animal logic. The predictability of the story is forgivable; after all, you do not see a movie like this without sensing how it will end, but the repetitiveness of the attacks is wearying. Back to misogyny and voyeurism: when you take away the thin plot line and mediocre digital effects there is little left other than an attractive woman in a bikini fighting for her life. The real hero of the film, however, is the triumphant designer of Nancy's bikini: whatever mauling she endures the bikini stays in place. The title of the film describes its content perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intense movie, one that is well worth the time to watch. There are two main characters, the surfer and the shark. They are in a struggle for survival. One of the reasons why the story works so well is because of the way the shark is depicted. Here the shark is shown to be a territorial creature whose area has been encroached by humans. That intensifies the conflict between the surfers and the shark. Blake Lively gives a strong performance as the surfer who unwittingly invades the shark's domain. She is in virtually every scene and carries the movie. The only problem with the movie is the way it ends. At that point the movie opts for a more conventional ending of the story, which, given the nature of the interaction between the two protagonists, is contrived. The ending will not be revealed here. However, it does bring the story to a close, albeit in a way that does not keep open the option of a sequel, at least one involving that particular shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This shark will swallow you whole.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Shallows' presents a new and different take on animal horror/shark movies all together. Even though it's a refreshing take it still forces you to suspend your disbelief a little too much.1. The premise is simple enough as young medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) travels to an exotic and highly remote beach to surf in honor of her late mother. Things go array when a Great White Shark marks the beach as his territory. The story-line alone sets the film up as more of a survival flick which is to it's benefit. Not only is it about surviving the shark, but the elements, hunger and dehydration. With the setting being along the Mexican coast and a beach in Pacific waters, means the days are hot and the nights are cold.2. Although there are other actors in the cast, the focus it mainly on Blake Lively, so it's up to her performance to carry the film. Safe to say, she delivers one of the better performances of her career thus far. The only other name actor in here is Brett Cullen, who plays Blake's father, but he is only briefly heard during phone conversations. There are moments where Nancy suffers brutal injuries and it's to Blake's credit that she performs to where the audience can feel her physical pain. Early on it's established that she's a strong-willed woman, so she never actually breaks down to a high degree throughout the film.3. For the first half, there is a clear reason why the shark is present, as well as to it being so territorial, making it that much more dangerous. The attacks are truly terrifying and brings back that sense of "fear of the unknown" and "what lurks beneath", just as 'JAWS' did. However, when the second half of the film approaches, you honestly do have to suspend your disbelief just by how non- realistic things become. The shark holds a grudge against Nancy and goes at her with a vengeance, something no shark in the real world would do, especially after feeding.4. I do give a lot of credit to the cinematographer just by how many gorgeous shots and proper use of the camera, especially filming out at sea. Everything has a nice set-up, but for some reason, things take a turn into pure action. I was hoping the film wouldn't wander into a territory such as 'Deep Blue Sea', but it eventually did. It gets a little too ridiculous when the climax arrives, so the film loses the good momentum it had prior to that.Not saying this is a bad movie by any stretch, and I know audiences are gonna love it. All I'm saying is to prepare yourself and expect things to test the limits of reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This time is. . . incidental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to be reviewing a movie involving a shark trying to eat people, comparisons with a certain early Steven Spielberg film are inevitable so let's get them out of way. Despite featuring a beach setting and that, almost mandatory, dorsal fin, this is a different animal than Spielberg's suspense masterpiece. It does feature a shark but Jaws this ain't. What we have is a shark attack flick updated for the millennials. The setting is cleverly simple. In an unspecified Latin country, a young medical student and surfer goes in search of a secluded, "secret" beach where her mother had found some sweet swells years before. She finds the spot before the opening credits finish and then it's time for some skillful aquatic camera work coupled with some gorgeous beach shots that make you wonder why the hell you never took up surfing anyway.The film gets big props from me for not spoiling everything on the trailer as is Hollywood custom by now. Our heroine meets some locals with dubious accents, barrels and rolls to her heart's content and, despite a running time of only 86 minutes, you're left wondering when Mr. Bitey is gonna show up. But show up he does and the film does a very good job of further distinguishing itself from that other shark movie by keeping the action mostly in and around the water. The movie becomes a cat and mouse game and the fact that land and salvation is always, agonizingly within sight serves to ratchet up the tension.Director Jaume Collet-Serra manages to keep things interesting despite the sparse setting and Blake Lively makes for a likable heroine. Watch her get up close and personal with said shark and suffer thru some Rambo-esque self-stitching. The film does suffers from some movie tropes like getting cell phone signal even in remote locations and electronic batteries that never die that are to its detriment but it is entertaining for the most part with perhaps its biggest flaw being an ending that borders on sci-fi channel territory. It is a perfectly serviceable summer flick even if it won't make you quite afraid to go back in the water.Parent's Brief (Spoiler Alert) Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 86 minutes On Sex and Violence: No sex or nudity. A character is shown in a bikini. There are scenes with blood, a character receives a gashing wound on a thigh and a character is bitten in half off screen but the 2 halves are shown briefly while character is still alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure why people are making a big deal about this movie. Shark movies are a dime a dozen. The plot of this movie is basically 127 Hours meets Jaws. The movie isn't bad but it just isn't worth watching on the big screen if you can help it. There are so many hot actresses in Hollywood but not enough of them can actually act. I feel Blake Lively agreed to star in this film just to prove she can actually act. And good for her for doing so. Personally, I already knew she was an above average eye-candy actress but just in case some of you didn't, she made this movie just for you. The film is emotional but doesn't hit you over the head with it a million times just to make a point of it. The special effects and shark are well done. And the plot is simple but entertaining. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I really like the previews for this movie, and was really excited to see this movie. But the director made this Great White way to aggressive. Up until we see Nancy's intentional and very scary attach was really liking the movie. After that the shark started to become fake. 1) True Whites will stick around area's wear there is food, and that whale carcass will provide food for days, but the shark will typically stick with that blubber for days, not bothering with drunks, or surfers. 2) Because of the whale carcass, the white will NOT put its self in jeopardy for food. The shark is scene doing this multiple times (almost beaching his self in the coral and eating the damn bu-wee)3) Whites in Mexico have not been known to breach this behavior has only been seen in South Africa. 4) Yes, the way this white has attacked its pry it could easily kill a human, but when a white attacks the first bit is known as an exploratory bit and 99.9% of the time when it bits a human it spits it out. So with that being said yes Nancy was 200 yards off shore, yes the first attack would of been horrible but what how that would of really gone is shark attacks Nancy, Nancy comes to the surface terrified, Nancy goes slowly gets herself safely back to shore the white shark goes back to eating his blubber rich whale carcass. Movie over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Shallows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaume Collet-Serra is a capable director when it comes to keeping an audience involved and beguiled. I enjoyed two of his movies starring badass muse, Liam Neeson (Run All Night and 2014's Non-Stop). Now using lots of close-ups and plenty of slow motion shots, he wistfully reboots Jaws for the umpteenth time. Jaume sprinkles upon us, a little bit of Spielberg's monster hit, a little bit of Cast Away, a little bit of Open Water (2003), and a little bit of "The Raft" segment from 1987's Creepshow 2. The result is The Shallows, a conventional yet predictable flick that's stronger than most Peter Benchley sequels and a hundred times better than the critically panned Shark Night (I would hope so).With a spike in real-life great white attacks being posted all over social media these days, "Shallows" comes off as sort of relevant if not psychic. All I gotta say is dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun dun dun dun (ha-ha).Filmed in Australia (which stands in as Mexico), distributed by Columbia Pictures, and clocking in at a paltry running time of 87 minutes, The Shallows is very small scale. With only 4 actors/actresses plus Sully the Seagull, it relegates as a one-woman show. The cinematography by Flavio Marinez Lebiano (he shot 2011's Unknown) is bright and gleaming despite the film's first act which feels like fodder for the tired, MTV generation. And of course there's nods to 1975's Jaws (as mentioned earlier). You have lead Blake Lively pointing a gun at a big ass shark saying, "f*ck you" (Roy Scheider says, "smile you son of a bitch") plus an obligatory cage match reminiscent of what Richard Dreyfuss went through 40+ years ago.In jest, "Shallows" isn't epic, won't blow your mind, and won't reinvent the "don't go into the water" wheel. It will however, somewhat channel your faith in the survival of the human spirit. The simple concept is there for the taking: One surfer girl, one monstrous "sea dog", mano a mano, and only 200 yards from shore. Heck, I'd pony up 5-10 dollars to see this thing at the local cineplex. Wait, I already did.Anyway, the story is as follows: Texas-born Nancy (played by Lively) is a medical student who loves to get on her board and carve up some bodacious waves. In the wake of her mother's death, she decides to go to a secluded beach where her mom once surfed after finding out she was pregnant with Nancy. Nance gets a ride to said beach from a local named Carlos (Oscar Jaenada). When she asks him what the name of the place is, he simply says it's "paradise". Nancy then runs into two other locals, surfs a few ripples with them, and after taking a breather, decides to go out for one more ride. Big Mistake. A great white shark is lurking in the water and it intends on attacking and killing Nancy if she doesn't get to land first. Serra films some excellent, initial surfing sequences whether it be the stunt people doing some tube riding or just barreling down the point break. And as for the ocean water featured in The Shallows, well it's beautiful in its midnight blue state and boy is it darn clear.Now performance-wise, I think Blake Lively does a decent job in "Shallows". Her Nancy gets put through the wringer whether it be her tearing some flesh on corral, getting stung by a jellyfish, or initially getting wounded by the shark thus spurring the notion of gangrene setting in. Nancy is obviously a goodhearted person and Lively channels the character well. Her virtuous voice and wholesome looks are a plus not to mention her ability to naturally convey fear, hope, and pain. Now do I think Lively can carry a movie all by herself? Yes, but only if it doesn't surpass an hour and a half.As for Jaume Collet-Serra's streamlined direction, well he keeps things moving despite a slight level of implausibility. For instance, Nancy stands on a small rock to try and avoid getting eaten by the shark. Huh? You'd think said shark would be able to just easily rise up and snatch her. On the other end of the spectrum, Serra effectively implores tactics to help Lively's persona fend for her life. You have the use of her necklaces and earrings to repair a wound, the timing of her stop watch to see how fast the menacing shark swims from point a to point b, and documentation on a helmet camera so that someone can call for help and save the stranded Nancy.In truth, the only thing I wish Jaume would stop doing in his films, is to use visible texts, visible skypes, and visible emojis as plot devices in order to tell his story. It all seems tired by now and rather clichéd. Oh and did I mention his ending to "Shallows" (spoiler)? Well it's pretty unjust in scope. You're telling me that a giant shark is gonna bite the dust after running into a couple of steel rods. Ten minutes earlier, that same shark was lit on fire and still galloped ferociously towards Lively's Nancy. Like I said unjust.Overall, The Shallows is passable entertainment that you'll probably forget about the minute the end credits roll. No matter. After seeing the disaster (ha-ha) that was Independence Day: Resurgence, I sort of needed this change of scenery. Rating: A "waving" 2 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic story, great effects, entertaining shark film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the loss of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach. Hitting the waves Nancy finds herself being stalked by a great white shark.With a broken surf board lying near by a young boy finds a Go-Pro helmet cam and we get to see a recording of how its owner met their demise. We're then introduced to Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) bouncing around in a vehicle in the middle of nowhere, with the feeling we're in a torture tourist film. However, thankfully this is a killer shark film. Interestingly, director Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan, Unknown) quirkily shows her social media texts and photos as a wipes on screen. Played by Óscar Jaenada , Carlos the broken English local (who does not kill Nancy) drops the surf board touting tourist off safely at the beach. The perfect body, on the perfect beach, with the most perfect waves and scenery sets up a false sense of security.It's not long before Nancy encounters some surfers who warn her of a strong current and rocks. It not just abs, bikini and cleavage. Surfing film fans may find the first minutes particularly interesting, its wonderfully shot as they surf the waves off the beautiful beach. In addition Collet-Serra makes full use of the unorthodox novel way (breaking the third wall) of the videophone calls and watch face projection on screen. These shots set up the family dynamics, back-story and elapsing time to hold attention and keep momentum. The proceedings are enhanced by Marco Beltrami's (World War Z, The Thing 2011) score. But this is all inconsequential as deep down you're waiting for the shark to strike.After a dolphin appears to break things up with a jump scare, Collet-Serra is wise to get to the great white quite quickly with an excellent shot of the sharks silhouette through a huge wave hot on Nancy's heels like something from a Steve Alten novel. When the water turns red - the survival story beings. The Shallows doesn't present great shakes in term of story, it's a basic don't get eaten tale reminiscent of Open Water (2003) and The Reef (2010), person verse nature. The Shallows offers big budget set ups and thrills with a whale carcass and buoy being bashed by the great white, the effects, bruises and bite makeup are finely done, there's also plenty of blood, severed limbs and bites on display. There's a solid performance from Blake Lively who is focal throughout. But the star of the show is the shark, when it breaks the water it's exceptionally realised, it feels and looks for the most part scarily real. This is not a Syfy channel special effect, this great white is unnerving and frightening.There are calm before the storm moments where Lively's Nancy befriends a seagull, tends to her wounds, talks to herself, the night time shots are particularly eerie as she silently stalked. Inevitably each chance of rescue is thwarted by the tenacious killer. With a handful of shark attacks littered throughout there's enough moments to maintain interest. Dehydrated, no food and losing blood writer Anthony Jaswinski's offers part an endurance test story as well as a creature feature. As Nancy goes from salvation points, through the salt water, rock to rock, there's plenty of tension as she times her swims in an attempt to out manoeuvre the shark. The slick editing and Jaswinski's story brings the film full circle playing against expectations and with sleight of hand you're into the unknown, with Nancy's fate up for grabs in the closing act where she faces off with the extremely aggressive predator. With high- tides, jelly fish stings, storms closing in, flare guns, Collet- Serra keeps the thrills coming until the end.Refreshingly it doesn't rehash Jaws. Shark fans will no doubt get an uneasy and unsettled kick out of some of the elaborate stunt setups. With its small cast, excellent lead, beautiful location cinematography, if you're into stranded swimmer shark films you can't go wrong.Overall, a fast paced, grounded shark attack film and a recommend bite of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shallows: Disappointing but still fresh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into the theatre, my expectations were high in regards to the movie "The Shallows", starring Blake Lively, and she didn't disappoint. But still, I was expecting a great thriller that would live up to the ages and I got instead a good summer blockbuster. Like I said, Blake lively is really good in that role as you can feel her hurry and her distress for the entirety of the 86 minutes of the film. The movie is a little slow on the start but when the pace speed up, you can expect some good jump scares. The story is little short and that is really what hurts the film, some major plot holes being really obvious, although the CGI shark is really impressive and gives cold sweats at times. Overall, a great cinematography (good job Flavio Labanio) and a 127 hours-type of feature (really good at being a small scale movie) help "The Shallows" being a fun ride, but no more. *******/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Dumb Summer Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put up the spoiler warning even though I think it would be pretty hard to reveal much of anything that was not in the trailer. Yeah it has a beautiful woman in a bikini for almost the entire movie but it could hardly be called titillating since she bloody, bruise and sunburned most of the time. Being nearly naked adds an extra element to her vulnerability and lack of resource to keep her from being part of the food chain.Blake Lively does a great job of keeping things interesting with little dialogue other than talking to herself and a seagull.There are a couple "we need a bigger boat" moments that come mainly at the end it it starts eating through metal. I don't think I'm willing to see it again to try to comprehend all the crazy action that lead to the ending but it seems like the could have come up with something better.Some pretty intense gore and one F-word for a PG-13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Love Letter to "Jaws"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shallows" (2016) is a shark based thriller that manages to be unique from past shark films, but also pays homage to where this genre has been. From the beautiful scenery to the high tension, I have not felt a film come so close to what Jaws (1975) did in a long time.First off, the camera/editing work in this film is so beautiful I would often times find myself caring less about where the shark is, and instead being distracted by how stunning everything looks. The colors are so vivid, the camera moves with the ocean and wind, and the scenery is often breathtaking.Of course once the shark attacks, that is when the suspense spikes. Nancy (Blake Lively) is our main protagonist as well as our eyes and ears. We feel her fear, pain, and courage throughout the film. Blake Lively gives her best performance to date showing a strong, determined woman who has many layers of emotion. This film proves that she is a lot more than a pretty "Gossip Girl" (2007-2012) TV star.While the film has a few flaws with the CGI, it mostly goes by unnoticed. Learning from "Jaws" this film took the approach to show less of the shark until the end of the film. This is a smart approach because it creates more tension and mystery about where this shark is, and causes greater frights when he appears.I also really appreciate that this film used modern scientific knowledge when it comes to sharks, showing that it isn't just some psycho killer after humans but instead a complex hunter. It showed that sometimes we are at fault for making ourselves prey, which is a very different standpoint from what "Jaws" took.Don't let this modern outlook fool you, though. It is very much a scary Great White shark and the characters are in a lot of danger throughout the film.One complaint I do have is that towards the end of the film, the action and writing feels very different compared to the first 2/3rds of the movie. It seemed a little too fast paced compared to the rest of the film, and the build up didn't quite pay off in the way I expected it to.If you are looking for a suspenseful summer movie or are a fan of the shark thriller genre, I highly recommend seeing "The Shallows." It might just be my favorite shark movie behind the original "Jaws."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Summer Popcorn Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Shallows", starring Blake Lively-Gossip Girl_tv, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies; Oscar Jaenada-Cantinflas, The Cold Light of Day and Brett Cullen-The Dark Knight Rises, Lost_tv.This is a shark vs girl movie. And lets be honest. Sometimes, it's not all that realistic. But, it is a great summer popcorn movie! Blake plays a Baylor medical school dropout from Galveston, Texas that is trying to deal with her mother's death. She decides to go surfing on a beach in Mexico that had special meaning to her mother. One of the reasons she dropped out of school was her mother's death and Brett, her father, tries to convince her to go back to school. Blake loves to surf- she lives in Galveston, remember?-and after catching a ride with Oscar to the beach, she is soon out in the beautiful waves and discovering that she is not alone. A great white shark is in the shallow waters of the little cove she is in and after narrowly escaping the initial attack, she makes it to a little group of rocks and corral that is sticking up out of the water, about 200 yards from shore. Only problem? The rise and fall of the tides! So she has to devise a plan pretty darn quick and that is where the suspense comes in, in spades. And it was also pretty fortuitous that her mother taught her to never give up because in a fight against a great white, what chance does a person have, either strength wise or in out swimming one? The only advantage would be in being resourceful and maybe out smarting them-using the old brain and never giving up. It's rated "PG-13" for bloody images, intense sequences of peril and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 27 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uummmm... Okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love sharks and will watch a shark movie, even one as silly as Sharknado, a movie by a group of filmmakers who know it's a silly movie and that we won't take it seriously. But come on...This movie had promise. When I heard about The Shallows, I thought maybe someone, after all these years since the granddaddy of all shark movies hit theaters in the 70's, would finally put out a shark flick just as good. Then, I watched it. Meh.I'm an author, myself, so I can accept that a lot of times, in order to tell a story, the storyteller has to toss in a bit of fiction with fact to make the story as interesting as it can be believable. Such as the method in which Chief Brody kills the shark in the movie version Jaws. A sensational, though unbelievable, ending. (in the novel, the shark just rolls over and dies due to the massive amount of injuries it sustained during its fight with Brody and Quint)However, in The Shallows, which is set up pretty well in the beginning, begins to take a bit of a nosedive near the end of the 2nd act. This shark has stranded our heroine on a rock and now, anyone who comes out try to rescue her is killed, as if it's trying to keep her isolated. I'm pretty sure sharks don't work like that, but again, it's fiction.But what really got me laughing in the theater were the scenes when the heroine is trying to stay safe on a metal buoy. First of all, she has to get through a large curtain of jellyfish, which she uses as cover from the shark, because even sharks don't like to get stung. But that's what happens when it tries to come after her. But she gets stung, as well. Plus, the shark bit her pretty good earlier, slicing her leg open so by now you'd think her leg would be practically useless, especially for swimming in the ocean against swells and current. She hasn't had a bite to eat or drop to drink in over 24 hours, she's been abused by the sun, etc. yet she manages to swim like a champ for about 40 yards from a rock to this buoy right before the shark catches her.And then, she shoots the shark with a flare gun she finds on the buoy and this seems to just make the shark hate her even more. Now, it seems it's out for revenge. Again, I'm pretty sure sharks don't work like that. But... fiction.BUT THEN... this shark begins to EAT THE METAL TOWER on the buoy in order to get to her. It chomps away at the stuff like he's Pacman and the metal is just a bunch of power pellets. CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP. Okay, as far as I'm concerned, fiction or not, I had to call BS on this one. I mean, I've eaten corn chips and had a stray sliver stab the roof of my mouth, which made me slow it down on the nachos a bit, but wow, you'd think this buoy was made of gummy bears the way the shark tears through it. It's made of metal! He's like Roboshark!He backed off immediately when a couple of jellyfish hit him, this shark's mouth doesn't seem to get stabbed with a sliver of steel anywhere.And then the way she kills this monster is truly more unbelievable, and far less sensational, than Chief Brody's method. How on God's green earth (or blue ocean) do you successfully dodge a shark, that is right on your heels and behind you (you can't see it), under water the way she does with a nearly useless leg and no fins? A shark's reflexes are incredible, ESPECIALLY UNDER WATER where it lives 100% of the time!This movie had promise and potential, but I had to give it a 5. And you can thank Blake's nice little butt for that. It was nice to see how close they could get the camera to her butt to try to distract you from all the WTF moments to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blake Lively in a Bikini! Apparently there's a shark in it too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ShallowsThe best shark movie since Jaws? A bold claim but then again think about it there haven't been that many great ones since Jaws to be fair. The Shallows is a good movie in its own right. Blake Lively is proving to be as talented as she is beautiful. She really does carry this movie . The sight of her in a wetsuit and bikini is worth the admission price alone. Was there a shark in this movie? I never noticed. The premise is simple, her alone against a great white shark. While there is a small supporting cast it is Lively that has all the screen time. So the story goes Blake's character is visiting a secret beach told to her by her now deceased mother. She decides to do a spot of surfing only to wind up on the menu of the large Great white that inhabits the area. After being attacked she takes shelter on a solitary rock with the beach just 200 yards from her grasp. There is no way she can get there without been gobbled up. And so the tension builds. The director does a good job at keeping the audience on the edge of the seat and the lead actress is very convincing at conveying her peril. It Just so happens she is a medical student and is able to deal with her injuries, which is just as well or the film would've been half as long. Woman goes surfing. Woman gets bitten by a shark. Woman bleeds to death. The end! The movie is filmed beautifully with clever use of integrating technology to further the story. The director did this on his other movie Non stop with the texting scenes on a mobile phone. The scenery is gorgeous and I'm not just talking about Miss Lively. Crystal clear waters. Panoramic views of the beach paradise. There's some wonderful shots too in this movie. A particular one where she is surfing and the shadow of the shark can be seen in the waves behind her. This is rather terrifying just like in Jaws where we only catch glimpses of the nasty fish before the full reveal at the end. Cinematography is good a specific scene with jellyfish merits this. The CGI shark is one of the best in modern films. With a $17 million budget you can see where the money has gone. The upcoming Meg movie has an estimated $150 million budget so the giant shark in that better be damn good. As with most films of this genre they get more ridiculous as they go on resulting in an absolute stupid ending that nearly spoilt all the good work the director and lead actress have accomplished up until the movies climax. I'll not give the ending away but it is so ludicrous it could have been lifted straight out of Jaws 4: The Revenge. That movie for me probably being the worst movie ever put on film. Anyway that's the only negative I can really find with this funfest nail biter of a movie. Sure the whole story and probability that the shark would stick around just to eat her when there is a juicy whale carcass yards away maybe unrealistic. As is the notion that the beast would still be hungry after chowing down on two surfers a drunk and copious amounts of whale blubber. However forget all that sit back and enjoy. I will be purchasing this on Bluray as I think this could have been a worthy sequel to Jaws unlike the shower of sh*te we actually got. Just one more thing, Ryan Reynolds you are one lucky S.O.A.B!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Little Summer Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scenery was beautifully shot, great cinematography. Glad I gave this a chance. On the edge of my seat the entire time and did not want to leave my seat. This movie isn't for everyone. If your like me, a thriller horror lover, then this might be a great summer beach thriller to watch. Background story was settle and not forced. Blake Lively was incredible in this. I look forward to seeing her as a lead in future films. Glad to see Óscar Jaenada, adorable and charming. One of my favorite foreign actors. I can't compare this to Jaws, because I have not seen the films. I tried watching them but could get passed the first 20 minutes of the first film which was made in 1975. I heard great things about it but I just can't seem to finish through this classic. Maybe because they are outdated. This is probably a modern version of Jaws. The shark was a ferocious. There was gore but not so extreme and still disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure it isn't "Jaws" still it's a pretty good shark thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like shark movies pretty good as I'm a big "Jaws" fan like most so anytime I see a shark in a movie I try to watch it's just something about a great water and deep water when they both surround a human it's so common to be found with fear and drama so when it's put on the big screen it entertains.This story sets around a woman named Nancy(Blake Lively)who takes a trip to a private secluded like tropical beach to just get away and relax and enjoy some free downtime of fun sun, surf, and riding the waves of the deep ocean. And the sea sure is full of jellyfish, dolphins, and other sea creatures yet most of all the murky waters inhabit the big great white! Soon others swimmers leave and Nancy finds herself all alone and matters become more complex when she's stuck on an island beach type rock that's 200 yards away from the shore."The Shallows" then takes a journey of the will to live it's clearly a game about endurance and mental smarts and the wit and the need for escape as it's a game of cat of mouse between Nancy and the great white. Some of the ocean wave and shark attack scenes of the film are top notch shots with great camera work which is a treat to this survival tale of the desire to live and return to the open land of life and freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off great, but unfortunately can't keep it up until the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decent little one-location thriller, but it's one I wish were just a little better than it is. Blake Lively plays a surfer who gets stranded on a tiny island that will be gone as soon as high tide comes in. Circling around her is a massive great white shark, which has already made a nice gash on her leg. This starts off excellently, with some truly awesome surfing footage and beautiful cinematography. The set-up is chilling, and the shark is nice and menacing - that is until we start seeing it a lot. As the film goes on, it can't help but give us a lot of shark. I don't mind the couple of aerial shots where we see the behemoth in its shadowy, underwater form. Sure, it's ridiculously huge there, whether from the refraction of the water or just exaggerated from Lively's perspective. No, we start to descend underwater and we get plenty of clear views of a CGI shark that doesn't really move like a real shark (it never really behaves like one - one wonders why it wants Lively so bad when it has an entire, bloated, dead whale not putting up any fight just a stone's throw away). What harms the film too much for me is the climax, which is eye-rollingly silly. I also could have done without the sequence with the cartoonish borracho, too. It felt like that was added late to extend the runtime a smidge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Jaws, but Also Not Bad...minus the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The terror of the deep! An maw of endless fangs! There are endless descriptions for a way to describe a shark, the aquatic predator that we devote a whole week of cable programming to. Tonight we get the latest addition to the shark attack suspense genre entitled the Shallows. In today's modern world, shark attack movies have been trailing down the ridiculous path. It makes one wonder if we will ever get a serious shark flick able to compete with Jaws? So what is the verdict of this film? As always read on to find out. THE GOOD ? Beautiful scenery ? A good portrayal of living to your limits ? Decent suspenseThe most majestic thing about the shallows is the beautiful scenery of the film location. Beaches with brilliant white sands lace a crystal clear lagoon, where reefs of varying hues make for a stunning view under the calm sky. Those who appreciate exotic lands and kicking visual effects will be happy with the high definition wonders on the big screen. Most guy audience members though will enjoy a different type of scenery in the form of Blake Lively navigating the waters in a fancy bikini. I think the camera men had a fixation on her behind, because the camera had a fixation with posterior end of our blonde heroine. With the visuals behind, the Shallows has painted a vivid picture of someone on the brink of death. Lively's character is pushed to her limits, forced to use ingenuity (and her convenient medical training) to survive on the desolate rock she is trapped on. It's intriguing to see all the things she dos to get back to shore, as well as see how her body changes as its exposed to the elements. Are some of the things over dramatic or convenient at times? Yes, but hey you sometimes have to stretch the truth when facing a gigantic, man-eating shark. Nevertheless, much of this movie's appealing factor is the suspense, as Lively's character tests luck and skills while traversing the reef. While seeing the same thing gets a bit dull (not to mention predictable) at times, the editing and music will build up enough tension to have many on the edge of their seats. I admit once or twice they led me into uncertain waters, unable to deduce what the fate of leading lady was.THE BAD ? Repetitive and drawn out at times ? Overdramatic moments ? The endingWith survival movies, comes the expectation of slowness and the Shallows is no exception to the rule. Her battle against the shark is somewhat exciting, but that suspense starts to wane as she does the same thing over and over again. The movie has plenty of "close call" moments, often involve our bikini clad warrior falling into the water and flailing about before the CGI monster attempts to devour her. Between those moments, it's a lot of her just sitting on a rock, staring into the waters as she dehydrates in the sun. If that sounds exciting, then your heart will be pumping with glee. In addition to the repetitive scenes, The Shallows also dove into the overdramatic depths. Blake Lively does her role well, but the director had a thing for overdramatic flare. From slow motion diving under the waves to the super molasses like movements through the water, it's all drawn out to fill more screen time. It was the drawn out editing that probably gave the movie a majority of its length and it added very little to the story (which you've gotten like 70% of the movie from the trailers. Oh well, you get your 90 minutes worth. Perhaps the cheesiest part of this movie though?is the ending. Okay, shark movies only have a few alleys to traverse in terms of the finale and many of them are melodramatic and ridiculous. This one though, well it was a little too much stretch of the imagination to stomach. After all the realistic survival instincts, our director/screenplay writers decided to defy physics with the dramatic climax that felt more of a quick wrap up. My fellow audience members all agreed on this, and wondered why such a hasty ending was their solution. It lacked emotion. It lacked satisfaction! And?it defied physics to my understanding. Oh well can't get them all right, but we can certainly do a little better than this. The VerdictWhen you go to see The Shallows, you are going to get exactly what you expect. It's a simplistic shark survival film with a pretty woman to fill the silver screen. Lively does a great a job with the center role, and she sold to me that she was suffering. Yet it was not enough to save me from a little boredom brought on by the repetitive fluff editing put in. Chances are you've seen about 60-70% of the movie from the trailers and unfortunately the ending doesn't pack the punch. Oh well at least it is only 90 minutes right? Is it worth a trip to the movie theater? Nope, but definitely catch it on shark week when it is sure to premier. My scores are: Drama/Horror/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifetime Network makes a shark movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SHALLOWS is not hindered by its script. Or by its star, Blake Lively. It is hindered by the poor execution of its director - Jaume Collet-Serra. The story of a young woman struggling against a vicious shark is ripe with possibility. Not to mention, Collet-Serra need only look to the great predecessor of the genre, JAWS, for direction. Unfortunately, Collet-Serra falters with the rules of basic filmmaking, editing, and shot composition. These directorial botches render the presentation of The Shallows as stale, motionless, dull, and downright irritating. As far as main character's backstory and motivations, Collet-Serra takes moments of poignant potential and clumsily portrays them like a Lifetime Network movie. **SPOILERS**The generic presentation of Blake Lively as a sex symbol is God awful. As she preps to hit the water on her surfboard, there's a B-grade montage of her sexy surf bod. This includes close- ups of her cleavage, behind, and spicy hot bikini - accompanied by a 2002 WB inspired soundtrack. It's too bad Collet-Serra (and his producers, who I assume are to blame for this lethally banal onslaught) couldn't abide by the less is more principle. Even the reveal of that James Bond heroine (wearing a bikini and holding a coconut) in Dr. No seemed graceful compared to The Shallows.As I mentioned before, The Shallows is an editorial mess. At one point, there's a standard shot of the hero bobbing on top of the water, the audience frightened what lies below us. But, then there's a random cut to an overhead helicopter shot, which suddenly pulls us out of the moment - which I think is trying to show us the shark's massive domain - although the character is stuck on a tiny reef - a couple hundred feet from shore.As for the shark itself - it's an embarrassing 3D composite that looks more like a cross between Cloverfield and a 747 jet. As I was watching Lively fighting for survival against this War of the Worlds beast that happens to have a fin - one that gobbles a fellow surfer like Godzilla - I thanked the Gods of filmmaking that decimated Spielberg's mechanical shark and forced him to rely on the basic elements of suspense to create a masterpiece in JAWS. Please note, I'm not some snobby, pretentious film purist, or the type of person that would actually utter the words, "I could make a better movie for that." Not sure I could. However, I think there's a time and place for visual FX. I think visual FX can be extremely useful. However, in the case of The Shallows, we're displaying a shark - a creature that is scary enough as it is! If the VFX house that worked on The Shallows lost all the composite footage, the film would have been blessed. If you're looking for a good shark flick (else than JAWS), I highly recommend OPEN WATER. It's 3000 times more captivating, frightening, and bone tingling than The Shallows - probably because the filmmaker employed actual sharks and gracefully handled a taut, thrilling script. If you want to see how you handle one character versus nature, go back and view CAST AWAY.Ted's Grade: D plus.</fullReview>

You see, THE SHALLOWS was released by the propaganda arm of the Japanese government, Sony Pictures. It's carefully crafted to make ALL Americans as terrified of ANY sea critter and in favor of totally sterile tsunami trash dump radioactive oceans as "Nancy," who's bedeviled by a completely implausible shark, harassed by a sea gull, stung by jellyfish, and barfs up a crab during her time on screen. One has to admit that THE SHALLOWS is very effective at accomplishing Japan\Sony's nefarious goal, but so was the late film director Leni Riefenstahl in promoting Adolph Hitler as an All-Around Good Guy in her 1930s flick, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. Hopefully, Sony's TRIUMPH will be short-lived, if more films such as THE COVE come out to document Japan's on-going Holocaust being waged against this world's friendly Flippers and our other Friends of the Deeps. If you have a mind strong enough to withstand media manipulation by the strongest Disinformation Service on Earth, go ahead and wade in THE SHALLOWS at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spanish helmer Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed Liam Neeson in "Unknown," "Non-Stop," "Run All Night," and has plans for another film with Neeson entitled "The Commuter," must have felt that pitting his favorite Irish actor against a ferocious Great White shark would be unfair to it. Instead, Collet-Serra has "Age of Adaline" actress Blake Lively contend with this colossal Carcharodon carcharias in "The Shallows," an entertaining, often suspenseful, but largely improbable B-movie survivalist saga. Summer movies are typically sprawling, impersonal, and larger-than-life blockbusters, about clashes between titans and extraterrestrials, such as "Captain America: Civil War," "X-Men: Apocalypse," "Independence Day: Resurgence," "Warcraft," and "Teenage Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows." Although Collet-Serra's film boasts a pugnacious predator roughly the size of a medium class submarine, "The Shallows" remains more personal in scope than traditional summer fare. The exploits depicted in this Sony/Columbia Pictures release do not pose a threat to civilization as we know it. Indeed, the events occur in relative anonymity without television networks broadcasting them as they unfold. Ultimately, nobody knows what is happening until the action concludes. Aside from Blake Lively, "The Shallows" features only seven actors, six relatively unknown males and one female confined to supporting roles. Not only does Lively play a sympathetic character, but also you cannot take your eyes off her while she is locked into life-and-death combat with a tenaciously toothy terrornaut that doesn't know when to quit. Comparably, "The Shallows" reminded me of the grim finale in Ridley Scott's classic, 1979, sci-fi shocker "Alien." Virtually the entire crew of the ill-fated, space merchant vessel Nostromo had died in a fight with an indestructible space monster whose blood was as corrosive as acid. The last survivor, sexy Sigourney Weaver, had slipped into something comfort to go to sleep for the long voyage home when she discovered to her horror that she was sharing her escape spacecraft with that fearsome fiend. Similarly, after about fifteen minutes of watching shapely Blake arrive at a remote stretch of scenic beach, strip down to a bikini, and plunge into the bay for a little surfing, the infamous shark shows up without fanfare and turns out to be quite the scene stealer for the remaining 87 white-knuckled minutes. Essentially, what Jaswinski and Collet-Serra have wrought amounts to a synthesis of "Jaws," "Blue Crush," and "Soul Surfer." Nancy Adams (Blake Lively of "Savages") has just withdrawn from nursing school. The gruesome experience of watching her long suffering mother succumb to cancer has devastated her. Nancy just wants to retreat and ponder her future. She remembers her pregnant mother told her about a secret stretch of beach in Mexico that she had gone to while she was carrying her. A friendly native gives her a lift in his battered pick-up truck through the jungle to the beach, and the beach looks like a dream with its azure skies, creamy surf, and faraway islands forming a barrier against the ocean. Initially, Nancy came with a girlfriend, but her girlfriend left her for a cute guy. Alone but content, Nancy swims out into the secluded bay and encounters two other surfer guys. Their English is as insufficient as her Spanish, and they share some waves before they leave. Later, Nancy spots a gigantic rotting whale carcass and investigates it before making her final surf for the day. As she is riding the crest of a wave, a Great White shark smashes into her and knocks her off her surfboard. The shark chomps on her left thigh, but Nancy finds sanctuary on a small outcropping of rock fewer than 200 yards from shore. The sinister shark cruises in circles around her like a war party of Apaches rampaging around a wagon train of pioneers in the Old West. Nancy uses pieces of jewelry to stitch up her chewed up thigh, but she fears the onset of gangrene if she isn't rescued soon.Talk about a tight-spot! "The Shallows" never wears out its welcome. "Kristy" scenarist Anthony Jaswinski and Collet-Serra observe all the standard conventions of vintage suspense thrillers. They corner our valiant heroine in one frightening predicament after another, and she must rely on her own savvy and stamina. Occasionally, when Nancy cannot outwit her adversary, the filmmakers create obstacles that the shark cannot overcome in its ravenous lust to make her into mincemeat. At one point, a steel hook embedded in its jaw gets snagged on a buoy, and the Great White wallows turbulently before it dislodges itself and renews its attack. At other times, the shark deals with marine life such as a school of jelly fish and the craggy underwater terrain that thwarts its momentum. The irony is that our heroine is--as the title indicates-- in shallow waters instead of far out in the briny blue deep. The Great White shark appears sufficiently menacing, and computer-generated visual effects are top-notch. The predator's initial appearance through a wave is ominously dramatic. If you've seen the trailer, the scene where the Great White lurches above the waves to gobble a surfer is sensational stuff. The whale carcass that our heroine initially takes refuge on until the shark forces her to abandon it looks pretty realistic, too. The shift into tone and atmosphere from harmony to heartache for Nancy is very palatable, too. Although this woman-in-jeopardy nail-biter is set Mexico, the filmmakers wound up lensing it on location in sunny Australia. Mind you, "The Shallows" doesn't surpass Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" with its atmospheric music and ensemble male cast. In a scene reminiscent of the "Jaws" finale when Roy Schneider fires a rifle at the shark that kills it, our heroine appropriates a flare pistol and fires it at the marauding shark. Characterization remains on the lean side since Blake Lively's solitary surfer is the only three dimensional character on display. Nevertheless, just as "Jaws" exploited our anxieties about splashing about the sea without a second thought, "The Shallows" may make you think twice about wading into surf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blake Lively gets her butt kicked on a surfing trip when she encounters a shark with the nastiest attitude.So I hope you like Black Lively, because you'll be spending ninety minutes or so with her as she attempts to survive in the water with a shark circling her, waiting to kill. If you don't like Lively, I think this movie will change your mind. She's really good in it, and really good at sucking you into the turmoil she's going through.The shark itself was a great visual effect. It movies (for the most part) like a real animal and it's nothing but scary when it attacks.The Shallows keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next and how is Lively going to escape from being Shark meat. Towards the end, it felt like the filmmakers ran out of ideas to do that, but overall it's worth sitting thought most definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel to Jaws.....finally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very reluctant to see this movie...after all we have had so many cheesy shark attack movies. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised! The location and cinematography were beautiful, the CGI shark was scarier than Jaws and we had a woman heroine! The battle of survival between surfer Nancy and the shark was very tense and thrilling. Blake Lively carried this movie....her acting was really a revelation; her facial gestures spoke volumes at times. There was even humor...Steven Seagull was perfectly cast...LOL!!!!! What a refreshing take on an animal attack movie: a smart sexy woman with a desire and the ability to survive. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This creature feature is not Jaws but it's definitely packs the thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have wondered if the shark-thriller genre would ever get revived again. After the remarkable success of Steven Spielberg's Jaws back in the mid-70s, there led a long string of shark flicks, both in the theatrical and Made-For-TV category, tried to emulate the arresting value of the summer masterpiece. 'Deep Blue Sea', 'Shark Night', 'Piranha', 'Shark Attack', 'Sharknado', the list goes on. None of which managed to pull to the genre to the surface, or even reach remotely close to the heights of 'Jaws'. Jaume-Collet Serra, however, surprises us with a spine-chilling shark thriller that shows though the genre may have sunk below the surface, it's not completely out of fuel yet. Supplemented with an engrossing script by Anthony Jaswinski and an ambitious performance by Blake Lively, this survival thriller is an unexpected thrill ride. Blake Lively plays Nancy, a Texas medical school dropout vacations to a Mexican beach to surf, contributing to the memory of her late mother. Below the clear sunny skies and the warm temperatures, what can possibly go wrong? That is until a great white shark arrives and sinks it's teeth in her, leaving a bloody gash on her leg. Stranded on an isolated rock 200 yards away from shore, Nancy must put her intelligence to the test to survive while figuring out a way to make off the rock surrounded by the shark who desperately waits to have the poor girl for lunch. Jaume-Collet Serra, director of films such as horror-thriller 'Orphan', the cheesy but entertaining thriller 'Non-Stop' and the tense actioner 'Run All Night', acquires a true sense of suspense and tension in this survival flick, and though the film doesn't go down without it's blemishes; the result is surprisingly effective. The film stars Blake Lively who takes on a daunting task of carrying the movie on her shoulders with not much support other than a few minor characters who each only get a finger scoop of screen time. And much with great effort, she succeeds. This actress shines in her role and quickly grows into a character you come to care for. From the effectively constructed suspense and the tension that pervades in the woman's desperate battle against the terrifying sea creature in the means of life or death, you genuinely fear for her survival. Every time you see a underwater shot hinting a close proximity between the main character and the shark, it leaves you squirming in your seat, and scenes don't need a suspenseful music score to complete the scariness. Though the film moves at a steadily slow pace and borrows a few elements from Danny Boyle's '127 Hours' such as the main character recording a message for her family via video camera, it delivers just about everything it needs to make a purely effective fare. The Shallows is no Jaws, but it is a thoroughly entertaining and heart-pump thriller that packs plenty of thrills. While I can't say it completely revives the shark genre, it shows the category is safe from it's grave. Those looking for a scary, suspenseful good time, this one if not The Conjuring 2, makes a good summer pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jaws" for the 21st century... both terrific and terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shallows" (2016 release; 87 min.) brings the story of Nancy (played by Blake Lively). As the movie opens (following a pre-credit scare), Nancy is in a pick-up truck being driven by a local towards a 'secret' beach in Mexico (the local refuses to give the beach's name), where Nancy's mom went all those years ago when pregnant with Nancy. Once at the beach, Nancy is ready to go surfing, the only other people being there are 2 local guys also surfing. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Jaume Collet-Serra, best known for the recent Liam Neeson action movies Non-Stop and Run All Might. Here he takes a tougher challenge, namely how to bring a great white shark attack survivor-thriller in a way that makes it original, believable and entertaining. It is hard to believe that the original movie in this genre. "Jaws" is now over 40 years old. Let's get the obvious question addressed right away: is this movie terrifying? The unequivocal answer is a resounding YES. There were quite a few scenes that I could barely look at the screen, hiding my eyes. One of the biggest lessons we learned from "Jaws" is "less is more", and Collet-Serra basically follows that formula, as we don't really get all that many open looks at the shark up close until very late in the movie. Also helpful is the outstanding photography, which is pure eye-candy from start to finish (the movie was filmed entirely in Australia). Last but certainly not least is the strong performance by Blake Lively, who is by herself for much of the movie. This role might very well catapult her to the top tier of actresses, at least financially. Bottom line: I head seen the trailer of "The Shallows", and the actual movie lived up to my high expectations, and even surpassed them. The perfect summer movie: both terrific and terrifying at the same time."The Shallows" opened wide this past weekend. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. Box Office Mojo has reported that the movie grossed much better this past weekend than had been projected, but that doesn't surprise me. This movie is bound to get fabulous word-of-mouth and this will play very nicely in theaters in the weeks to come. If you loved "Jaws". you will liked this one too. "The Shallows" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Successor to 'Jaws'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows is a perfect example of how to make a perfectly competent and thrilling shark movie from the moment the camera opens onto the beautiful Mexican beaches to the very end once the last of the credits has rolled. The cast (which is very small, good for this kind of movie) is led by a beautiful Blake Lively; none of the others are of particular significance. Lively stars as Texan medical student Nancy, who has determined it's time to take a little R &amp; R and takes a trip to a idyllic Mexican coast. Before long, however, she becomes the victim of a shark attack and, alone, save for the company of a seagull, the movie is a harrowing tale of man, er, woman versus nature at its finest. Lively proves to be a great choice as the lead. She has a charisma, vulnerability, and resourcefulness that I believe is ideal in the heroines of this genre of film; bold and plucky, she manages to keep a smile on her face (much of the time), with an attitude that seems to say, "gimme your best shot." It is riveting to watch her scramble to stay alive, determined not to lose to what appears to be the very hand of Fate itself. This movie does what any shark movie that is worth its salt does best, that is, besides possessing a great number of fake-outs and an ominous, looming score, it contrasts the beauty of its surroundings with the horrors that lurk beneath. And the location is part of what makes this movie so very, very good. If it weren't for the shark, I'd want to dive right into those cool, blue waters. The cinematographer does a wonderful job of showing how indisputably beautiful the Mexican coasts are (and how unforgiving). The shark itself is a CGI spectacle, looking just like the real thing. And while it lacks the threatening presence of Jaws, it nevertheless makes for a wonderful foe for Lively. It is intelligent and *seems* to be gunning for Lively, its determination unsettling and beyond natural, dare I say, purposeful. And though there is one moment which I believe "jumps the shark" just a bit, it leads to one of the best, kick-ass endings I've seen in recent cinema. My only major complaint is that during some of the early surfing sequences, the action goes from slow to fast to slow again one-too-many times, and some of the beginning scenes linger a little too long. But these are easily forgettable, as the rest of the film's 87-minute run-time is unrelenting intensity from the point where the camera emerges from the murky depths in classic, Jaws-like fashion. THIS is the Jaws sequel we should've gotten. I *do* recommend wading into The Shallows.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good popcorn movie, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of movie that requires that you cannot judge it in the realm of realism. I thought the movie did a great job making you feel uncomfortable with some of the physical horror, it had good surprise scenes that made the audience scream and it did a good job making you feel for Blake Lively's character (Nancy) and hope to see her find a way to shore. To be safe, I'd warn that the rest includes SPOILERS as it touches on aspects of the movie that were not completely shown in trailers. The things I didn't love about the movie included:* Effort to allow for dialog with Nancy talking to herself as a patient was a bit contrived. Not horrible but not great. *I am not a marine biologist by any means but I find it hard to believe that any shark would be drawn away from a whale carcass by a few surfers. At some point the shark would get full and no longer chase prey. The attempt to give the shark a reason to hate humans because of the embedded hook fell short in my opinion. *Again, as a non-marine-biologist, I found it extremely hard to believe that a whale carcass that had been present for less than 24 hours would create enough of a blubber-slick to allow a flare to create a surface fire. *The hardest thing for me to accept was the way that she killed the shark. Maybe it's no more difficult to accept than Brody killing a shark with a giant power cord. But there is no way that that tiny chain would pull Nancy down to the sea floor faster than the animated shark could swim. It was fun to see shark death but I would have preferred to see her release the chain and slowly get closer to shore when the buoy was pushed in by the waves.All in all, I do not regret investing a few dollars and a couple hours to watch this. They kept it simple and it was generally compelling. That said, if I see this movie playing on TV in the future, I will not be drawn in to watch it again.</fullReview>

I think that if this is the future of summer blockbusters, i might never go to the movies again.I really hope the Jaume Collet-Serra directs another movie after this one. This poorly put together film really embodies the situation Hollywood is in. Nobody's coming up with original ideas, so companies are just putting together poorly done films while trying to capitalize off of trends, in this case, shark week.

		<shortDescription>Stupid and not very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought The Shallows was a pretty disappointing movie. Part of that was due to Blake Lively's performance, which was bad overall with some fine moments from time to time. I feel like the main reason why most people are praising her performance is that she is a very nice and beautiful person. Some people are probably too afraid to criticize her acting because of this, fearing possible backlash. Her character was also not very well written and rather cliché. She has the most overused backstory in cinema right now. Now this is such a big deal because she is pretty much the only character in the movie. Every other character has no more than 10 minutes of screen time. So when your movie focuses a ton on a very uninteresting character played by an actor that isn't that great, your movie is in deep trouble. Another thing wrong with this movie is the amount of stupid things that happen to advance the plot. Like for example, when Blake Lively's character is surfing, she literally sees a dead whale in the distance and approaches it. Like, how stupid does someone have to be to think approaching a large floating thing in the water that has seagulls flying around is a good idea to approach when you're surfing. A couple other things don't make sense, but I don't feel like getting into detail about them because it infuriates me greatly whenever I think about them. Another problem is that because the character is uninteresting, I don't give a crap about her. That makes the scenes much less tense. "Intense" is definitely not a word I would use to describe this movie. There some scenes with mild tension though. Oh,and this movie also uses cheap jump scare tactics. You know, the whole 'loud noise whenever the creature attacks' tactic. Hollywood really needs to stop doing this. I'd say one of the redeeming qualities about the movie is the cinematography. I thought the camera work was well done. Overall the movie looks visually good, except the special effects. Particularly, the shark. The CG looks bad a lot of the time. I'm pretty disappointed that they didn't use practical effects. There were a couple moments where they could have used something practical for the shark. But no, that would be too much effort.Overall, The Shallows was a bad experience to say the least. I had hopes that the popular claim that this is "the best shark movie since Jaws" (some, like IGN, saying it's actually better than Jaws) would be true. Unfortunately, not only isn't it even comparable to Jaws in terms of quality, it is definitely not even close to being the best shark movie since Jaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual masterpiece but extremely unlikely as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows is another entry in that genre?a "survival thriller" about an epic battle of survival taking place between an American woman, Nancy Adams (Blake Lively), and a vicious shark. The Shallows is categorized as a "suspense thriller," and suspenseful it certainly is. It has certainly taken the lessons of Jaws and made them his own, understanding and employing to great effect, the power of the shark's-eye-view of a human frolicking on the surface of the water. On top of that it adds a lot of lush and masterful cinematography. This is a movie, of course, about a lady-surfer and you would expect a certain amount of lady-surfer-in-her-bathing-suit images but the main fact here is that the images The Shallows serves up aren't just remarkably sexualized, they're also remarkably violent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another summer blockbuster from a contemporary Hollywood devoid of imagination and ruled over by businessman only interested on box office numbers. That being said, you know what you can expect from a movie like this. An average script at best, tedious and unimaginative directing, poor editing, an OK performance by Blake Lively which actually is what holds the movie together, a huge CGI shark that doesn't convince (they should have used, at least, a mechanical shark on the closeups). The score doesn't even pop up and sometimes it's distracting and even annoying. Those are the ingredients that make up this thriller we've all seen before and forgot a week later, at best. With some moments of entertainment that will keep the average viewer interested but fail to build up enough tension to leave us on the edge.In sum, not worth your money nor your time. But if you want to insist on a new shark movie, you should instead check "In the Deep", that came out about the same time and was totally overshadowed by this one, but actually delivers far better thrilling moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unexpected Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows doesn't have a whole lot of story to it, unsurprisingly. It's the latest in a line of "stick a reasonably famous actor in a single situation by themselves and see what they do" in the likes of Buried and Phone Booth. Nancy's mother has recently passed away after a losing battle with a terminal illness, so Nancy has gone to Mexico in search of a secret beach that her mother went to decades before. Her friend's bailed on her so she's left to go there by herself, where she enjoys the sun, sea, and surf, meets a couple of guys, and then gets bitten by a shark trying to catch one final wave, leaving her stranded on a rock not far from the shore. The next hour is Nancy trying to survive and get to safety with this shark patrolling the waters around her.What the movie lacks in story it makes up for with unpredictability and tension. Of course Nancy eventually survives, but it doesn't look good at times as she's left with a massive gash in her thigh, and this gigantic Great White can obviously swim quicker than she can. Not to mention the distinct lack of food and water around her.It's not exactly a scientifically accurate movie though. Let's be honest, shark attack movies don't work if they're scientifically accurate. I found myself a number of times wondering to myself whether a shark would really act like this. There's a recently deceased whale a few yards away from Nancy, so why is the shark bothered about her and not just gorging it's face on the meal lain before it? The movie also takes place over a couple of days, would a shark really be that bothered for so long? And let's not mention the climax, where suspension of disbelief is absolutely necessary. The Shallows uses this scientific inaccuracy to it's benefit though in giving us a companion for Nancy in the form of Steven Seagull, a wounded seagull also taking refuge on the rock. Steven acts far too much like a dog at times, but I honestly didn't mind because it added some levity to the situation and gave Nancy something to bounce off. I mean it's not like Steven ever talks or anything, it never goes that far, but his presence was definitely welcome and added a nice little dimension to the survival aspect.Blake Lively actually does a satisfactory job as Nancy. I won't sing her absolute praises because it wasn't a great performance by any means, but it was certainly good enough, and probably the best I've seen from her. It's easy to see why she was cast though. She's not exactly the greatest actress in the world, but she's certainly very attractive, and the movie capitalises on that maybe a little too much, giving us close-up shots of her undressing to her bikini and getting ready, and lingering on her boobs maybe a little too long. It just undermined her whole femme fatale angle of self-empowerment and 'hey look, women can fend for themselves'. I wouldn't go so far as to say it ruined it, but it was definitely noticeable.For me though, the biggest surprise of The Shallows was it's visual quality. Going in, I figured this would just look like any other generic Hollywood production, but I was pleasantly surprised by it's simply fantastic cinematography befitting of the industry's top talents. To find it shares the director and cinematographer of Liam Neeson Taken knock-offs Unknown and Non-Stop just surprised me even more. The choice of slow-mo is a bit hit and miss, but I dig it so I didn't mind so much. Case in point there's one of Blake Lively just looking around, her wet hair spinning round her face. Why they felt that needed slow-mo I have no idea. In contrast there was a fantastic slow-mo close-up of Steven that hasn't left me since I saw it.The CGI deserves a mention as well. Of course they couldn't get a real shark in, so it had to be entirely rendered on a computer. If I didn't know better though, I would've thought it was a real shark. Everything from it's skin texture to it's movements is absolutely bang on. I wouldn't say The Shallows is a terrifying movie, but the realism of the shark almost makes it one. The use of the shark is actually quite sparing as well, as it gradually gets revealed to us, and we pretty much only see it as and when Nancy does, so mostly a fin with a large dark shadow beneath. Of course there's a few moments of disbelief, like when it grabs a surfer by jumping out of the water to bite his torso, and the climax doesn't hold back in it's shark presence either, but generally it remains a mysterious monster just lurking out of sight in the water below.I definitely made the right choice last night with which movie I should see as The Shallows was a surprise hit. It kept me on the edge of my seat and looks absolutely great. It also has a great message of female empowerment bubbling beneath the surface, even if it was kind of undone by pandering shots of Blake Lively's body for the male audience members. It's not an accurate representation of shark behaviour, but it's not completely off the mark either, it'll just require you to have a dose of suspension of disbelief to get full enjoyment out of it, which is fine because it's a movie, not a documentary. This isn't an episode of Shark Week. I give The Shallows a thoroughly engaging 8/10, with the visual element being what edges it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic example of what might be called minimalist cinema - a minimum of locations, characters, dialogue and plot - but it works really well. Virtually all of the film takes place in the shallow waters off an idyllic but isolated beach in Mexico (actualy shot in Australia) as a female American surfer (played by Blake Lively) finds herself terrorised by a huge shark with only a small rock for refuge. Think "All Is Lost" meets "Jaws" with a flavour of "127 Hours" and you'll have the idea. Lively does really well to hold the movie almost single-handedly, while Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra does an excellent job maintaining the tension and serving up the action for an economical 86 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Shark Movie Since Jaws, which really doesn't say much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't let the headline fool you, I loved this film.Its been over 40 years since Steven Spielberg brought us the original summer blockbuster Jaws, and made millions of people terrified of sharks. Since then, film hasn't been kind on the shark genre, which even Jaws had its disasters. My top three Shark movies going into this were as follows: Jaws, Jaws 2, and Deep Blue Sea. When the thirds a dumb guilty pleasure, it really shows how sub par shark films have become since the first Jaws burst onto the scene. As such 'The Shallows' has instantly jumped into a solid second place on my personal preference. This film was great. Two things that have let this genre down is the fact the plots are to over the top and about the sharks, and characters have been to vanilla for us to care about. This film rectify's both these missteps in glorious fashion. Firstly, the main character, played brilliantly Blake Lively, is someone you can get behind, and believe in her capabilities, actually caring for in the process through just a couple of simple scenes. Minor character development spoilers here. Film making 101 is you have to make a character fit the story. This film needs a surfer who can survive by herself when injured and can think on her feet. They establish in two quick scenes (in the truck and during a phone call) that she is thinking of dropping out of medical school cause her mum died of cancer and she has lost belief in it, and the father establishes her mum was a fighter. Thats it, immediately you believe she's capable of guerrilla treating herself once attacked, you see her family and get the relationship straight away, making her a believable protagonist we can root for. She just felt like a real person.The second point makes this plot simple, like a shark movie should be, a surfer accidentally stumbles into a sharks hunting ground, (thats right the shark is actually attacking for a reason other than just because), and is stranded adrift a reef within that hunting ground. Thats it. It's a simple suspense film, and my god does this film do that well. There are no real cheep jump scares, as they let the visuals do the talking, and you watch this person struggle internally to survive on this rock with her little companion Steven the Seagull, who at times made the film amusing, but that was more than welcome in the tension that drives the film, as you can't have your audience tense the entire time. The suspense is done very well in this film and while I am taken out of the film occasionally, it keeps pulling me back in. The Shallows does something every shark film seems to fail in. Less shark. You hardly see the shark at all, there is a beautifully shot scene where you see its silhouette in the wave before the first attack, and when we do see the shark for the most part it looks good, apart from one of its kills. You only ever see the shark kill once person on screen and that works to the films credit. It know's when to show the shark and when not to, brilliantly replicating the atmosphere of the original Jaws movie. The cinematography, lighting and soundtrack build the tension, and when the shark does show it is earned. The cinematography is beautiful in this film, it is so good to look at, and the shot mentioned earlier to the surfing montages are a highlight. That being said the film had short comings. There is an obvious shark bate character clearly their to enforce the threat, i can be repetitive at times, and like I said the seagull did take me out of it occasionally, but I loved that seagull all the same. Also, a couple of characters do approach the situation a little to stupidly. If you like simple films, in only a couple locations and also are a suspense junkie then this film will definitely satisfy. Think 127 Hours but instead of a boulder its a shark. The finally alone is worth giving the film a watch. Definitely check it out cause in this mediocre summer blockbuster season, this film is a breath of fresh air, and deserves more recognition. 4/5</fullReview>

Amazing music and cinematography to settle a mood. Steve the seagull had a very important role as well I just need to look more. Okay a lot more.Bad: The final conclusion was absurd and was so clearly rushed. I also want someone to explain how she set water on fire. The ending was mediocre as well. Due to it's very small scale the supporting cast (EXCEPT STEVE) don't feel useful or have meaningful personalities. Best Part: The final tense scenes on the buoy were gripping and had me on the edge of my seat. Really good except the abysmal final kill.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shallows doesn't, by a long shot, redefine the horror-thriller genre, or do anything massively original or unique. It is by and large a pretty standard monster/caged/escape movie, except for a crucial difference from the vast majority.Blake Lively is outstanding. Whereas the usual star of movies like this is just a young, naive and attractive actor, Lively shows real character depth, knowledge, compassion and likability. Although the back-story of her med-school and deceased mother are spoon-fed to the audience, her emotional responses to the heavy-handed dialogue feel genuine, honest and organic, and this is the main reason why the movie works - we actually care what happens to her when the fish hits the fan.Clunky exposition aside, the first two thirds of the movie are great. The warmth of Lively's character shines through, there are some exhilarating surf scenes, one or two gratuitous anatomical shots, and a mysteriously menacing villain lurking beneath the waves. The trouble with the final act is, as always, the audience has paid to get a good look at the baddie. And I wish I hadn't. The animation is quite poor on the close-ups, and the motion of the shark chewing on chunks of metal are closer to Sharknado than Jaws. This is especially disappointing because the glimpses we get of it earlier in the film, it looks pretty decent - as does most of the other CGI.The Shallows is nothing new, but what it does, it does very well. Simplistic, streamlined writing and cut-to-the-chase drama makes this a tense and unnerving 90 minutes, with a fantastic performance by Lively in the central role. "Best shark movie since Jaws" doesn't really say all that much, but it definitely hits the nail on the head.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what I expected...in a good way tho.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen the trailer for this film then you should already know what to expect; girl goes to beach, girl encounters shark, girl fights shark, girl wins. The film won't surprise you with a plot twist ending or tug at your heart-strings until and cant hold back the tears. Nor will it make you leave the theater saying "that was better than I thought". This film is exactly what you think it is, Which is why you should absolutely go see it. The film doesn't attempt to be something that it's not, and I love that about it. The script and writing is good, not great, the acting is solid, not phenomenal, and the editing and sound are slightly above average. Overall, Blake Lively did a fantastic job; she didn't "over do-it" and you can tell she is really coming into her own as an actress, the CGI shark looked extremely realistic, and the cinematography was beautiful (especially the scenes of the beach and the waves). You know that feeling of satisfaction you get when you buy something or go somewhere and it's everything you expected and nothing more? It's sort of comforting knowing that your expectations have been met. As uncertain as life can be, having a little bit of assurance in knowing what's about to happen is actually kind of refreshing. That's exactly how it feels to watch this film. You know what you're getting and you're totally OK with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is "The Shallows" a thriller that you will remember for ages? No, but it's a decent popcorn movie. Probably one of the most entertaining summer films of 2016 that is full of suspense and horror avoiding the bloodbath and the bad special effects. In spite of it's flaws, the movie will keep you on edge for most of its running time as director Jaume Collet-Serra, builds suspense with simple methods. He makes a thoroughly enjoyable thriller that reminding us that it's still not safe to swim in the ocean. Blake Lively delivers a solid performance and in a few words there are better killer shark movies than "The Shallows" but this film is good enough to be worth watching. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie That Could Have Been Something Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a shark fanatic (thanks, Jaws), I was excited to see The Shallows. When I first saw the trailer, I thought the concept--more 127 Hours than Jaws--was interesting: A single person, alone on a rock, trapped a mere 100 or so yards offshore, in shark-infested waters.Most shark movies follow the Jaws formula to a T: Shark attacks a bather, someone in position of authority decides something must be done and the beaches should be closed, someone of higher authority thwarts that attempt, more people die, our hero finally has to confront the monster. But The Shallows produced a new and fresh take on the same old fish tale. The first half of the movie is similar to Open Water, relying on tension and little fanfare. Then, the shark explodes onto the screen for a few moments, and the movie suddenly becomes a high octane thriller. Basically, though the shark is the main antagonist of this story, all the scenes with the shark in them are much less interesting. I was more engaged with Blake Lively and that damn seagull. She was likable, and I bought into the survival story and was really rooting for her.There were moments, when The Shallows relied on suspense, that the film become Hitchcockian in tone. We know the shark is out there, but we can't see him. The second we do, the suspense dies instantly. Parts of the movie were small and intimate, much like an independent film. And those were the strengths.But it almost feels as if the director wanted to do a mash up of a simple suspenseful stalking movie, combined with elements of a survival movie. And again, all that worked for me.But the sensationalism of the shark stuff was over the top in my opinion. It gave the movie an uneven feel. It was, at times, both a suspenseful stalker type movie with survivalism thrown in, and, then, seemingly out of nowhere, it became an over-the-top summer blockbuster type movie. It gives it the look of a movie where director and producer didn't see eye to eye. It really seems like the shark action sequences were forced into the movie. They just didn't fit the overall tone. That's this movie's biggest downfall. Yes, the shark has to be there, yes he has to be dangerous. But the way it is presented through the film needs to fit the overall tone of the movie. At one point, the shark eats three people in the course of-- what?--an hour or so? So what was set up, was a small movie. An intimate movie. Something closer to The Blair Witch Project or Open Water, but what we got in the end, was something closer to Friday the 13th.This movie could have been so much more, by being so much less. Excess is not always best. In all fairness, The Shallows could have been much worse too. The things that did work, worked well--well enough that with some inventive direction, could have carried the film by themselves. But alas, the over the top violence and sensationalism trumped suspense and creative storytelling, which downgrades The Shallows from something special and unique, to just a "good" movie.The locations were beautiful, and seeing them in 4K HD on a huge screen was quite impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shallows stars Blake Lively and is directed by the same man who brought the world Orphan and Non-Stop, 2 of my favorite suspense thrillers of modern cinema. So, naturally, I really wanted to like this film. And I was disappointed. A young girl who just recently dropped out of med school decides to travel to a small beach in Mexico that her mother loved. It's the perfect spot for a surfer like herself to catch some great waves. But, after everyone else leaves, this woman receives a nasty shark bite and barely escapes. She is now stuck out in the ocean, bleeding, about 200 yards from shore with a nasty shark swimming in her way. The girl must try to stay alive using her medical knowledge and her will to survive as she travels from small surface to small surface with a seagull with a dislocated wing keeping her company hoping someone will come save her. Now, this movie has a good premise. Isolated, tense, all the things that make a great thriller. And Blake Lively acts well in this movie. Throughout it you feel her fear and her pain. Everything she does has an element of excruciating pain. The way she plays the character, you want her to survive. And the shark looks really good. It's CGI rendering was well done. The sound design in this movie is excellent. You are transported to the beach with each wave crashing or bit of water lapping up against something. Really this movie fails due to its script. The lines feel forced. Like they shouldn't be included most of the time. All of the actors do what they can with them. But really, they are just unnecessary. As a matter of fact, this movie would be better told, in my opinion, if they had stuck to a 90% visual only movie, with only one scene getting lines. Another problem was the pacing. A thriller should keep you enthralled beginning to end. At only an hour and eighteen minutes, this film didn't. There were moments that were seriously intense and scary. But there were also moments where things seemed to come to a feeling of dullness. In conclusion, The Shallows had potential, and some of it payed off. But the parts that didn't really ruined the experience for me. Still, I'll give this movie a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't as good as I expected it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows was less than I expected. There was no one thing that really stuck out to me that made me like the movie. The performance by Blake Lively was just OK and that is not acceptable for it to be a movie that centers around her. Most of the screen time is taken by her but at the same time you don't feel much of a connection to her. She wasn't necessarily bad, she did a good job playing a surfer terrified for her life but besides that there was nothing else to her. It was essentially family drama and surviving in the shallows, there was nothing else to her. I would have liked to see better character development because you really don't know much about her. Other than that there isn't anything else really wrong with the movie because she is the movie. Like I said she takes up most of the screen time and during that you don't feel any connection to her. There were some good things though. In my opinion, the shark looked pretty real along with the other animals she sees. Along with that is that most, if not all, the scenes are shot beautifully. All the shots are pure and you can tell they took the time to think about lighting and things of that nature in this movie. I expected a little more out of The Shallows and if you want to see it I suggest waiting for it to come to DVD. It wasn't horrible but I would not suggest paying more than $10 to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cujo with a shark. Nothing like Jaws.This is a well-made movie, mostly well acted, definitely well-filmed; and despite the inevitability of the ending, it manages to maintain a good level of tension throughout. The biggest problem is the concept: there are just not a lot of things to do with one woman trapped on a rock for 90 minutes. The filmmakers do an admirable job of it, and it doesn't get tiring until the climax has almost arrived.What you end up with is a movie that is perfectly acceptable to sit through, but of which you will never, ever think or speak again. The sort of thing you'd happily watch if you couldn't sleep and Shallows was on late night TV.Just need to kill 90 minutes? Great way to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Nothing but spoilers here)1. Why would a shark be so interested in eating the humans swimming around when it already had enough to eat for weeks in the dead whale? 2. Why did the camera-helmet wash ashore when the surf board stayed off shore for a full day? And while we're at it why didn't the dead whale wash ashore?3. If you stipulate that the shark actually prefers human meat to whale why wouldn't the two surfers satiate his appetite for at least a couple of days or even more? After eating two surfers it still wanted Nancy. There would be no room in his stomach, literally for at least a week.4. And with the dead whale sitting around and two surfers in his stomach would the shark still be willing to bite into steel three or four separate times losing teeth in the process? 5. And what happened with the retracting buoy chain? It pulled her to the bottom, with her intentionally letting that happen. What made that happen and how did she know it would? And if the shark didn't stab itself what was going to be her next move down there at the bottom? Totally in the shark's element?So I couldn't accept what was happening. The shark was a very human invention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I signed up for this account just to post a review of this movie. I give it a solid 7 out of 10. The reason I signed up to give a review of this movie? It could have been a slam dunk 10 out of 10... If not for the last 15 minutes.The ending lacked the same fervor and caliber as the first 90% of the movie. They did a lot of things right- they kept the shark to a minimum, they built suspense. Blake was amazing- she carried the movie, and I never felt bored. She was the only main character on screen for the whole time- and she never disappointed me. ***BIG SPOILER ALERT WITH THE ENDING***The end? Ruined it for me. From out of nowhere came really bad CGI, and an incredibly unrealistic ending. The first part of the movie made this worthy of an impending Oscar. The last 10-15 minutes, the ending- sucked. The ending would have been better if they left things unresolved, had her eaten, or just left her on the rock.I could see Lively winning a best actress award, and the movie winning best picture- If they followed through on the first 90% of the movie.The ending ruined this movie- but I still recommend it because of the fact that 90% of this movie was pretty good.I'm a nobody, I have zero experience in the film industry- I could have written a better ending on my lunch hour than they gave to the public. All in all, it's a 7 out of 10. Could have been a 10 out of 10 though- and that's frustrating. They should have panned out with her on the rock and left the viewers to their imagination. That might have made this movie Oscar worthy.</fullReview>

Him Surviving made it all worthwhile. :POn other notes, I was a little nit picky on a small thing. (Makes me sound like a tight ass, I know. But it crosses my mind and I wonder.) I don't really understand the water levels. (I'm not talking high and low tides . I get that) During the film I get a little thrown off on the depth of the water. One time I feel its super shallow, and the another deep in a similar spot. I understand that there could be sand banks an rocks, but sometimes feel Blake's in shallow-sh water and we get a below shot in the water that perceives to be a lot deeper. I'm not a surfer. So I can't complain. Fun movie though. Are you likely to forget it when a new highly anticipated blockbuster comes out? Probably. Will you still remember Jaws? Yes. Do you hate me answering for you? Probably So... If So.... Shark bite me.</fullReview>

She and she alone, apart from the pretty scenery is the only saving grace of this film...and it saves it just enough to not say I want my 2 hours of my life back. Blake Lively is simply stunning here, visually in terms of her natural beauty, sexy in terms of her bikini close up shots throughout, but most importantly, her completely convincing acting job here ... i didn't really know anything about Blake going into this movie but boy is she on my radar screen now. Her performance in this film was truly very good and very believable. She really is what kept me in that theatre. Her truly gritty, very realistic range of emotions in this film are amazing. I really felt close and caught up in her dilemma and she comes across as actually going thru this for real...very very fine acting job. Wow.The shark? Typical CGI stuff...similar or close to what you may remember from "Deep Blue Sea" , maybe a notch better? The shark was too big for the bite on her leg though, which, while bad, indicated a much smaller shark mouth that the hulking shadowy brute that looked like the size of a small Korean submarine. The ending is pure entertainment and completely unbelievable and unrealistic. However, I recommend the film just to see Blake Lively in case she's a new item for you...otherwise, skip this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a little about sharks, and a little about Great Whites. Generally Great White attacks are juvenile sharks that make a mistake. Humans simply do not have enough fat content to make it worth while for the sharks to eat humans. All through the movie I had to keep reminding myself this is fiction, get through it, and not remind myself that this is totally unbelievable and stupid. The acting itself was good, I just have trouble with the subject matter. I know this is fiction, but good fiction is at least loosely based on reality. For me the movie takes itself much too seriously, great blow em up movies have a tongue and cheek to them, saying we know you know this can't really happen. For a teenager or the uneducated this would be a great movie, but for me not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As shark films go, this one is pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw a preview of the Shallows, I got excited because there really has not been a quality horror/thriller film involving a shark in quite some time. I really enjoyed Open Water, despite its poor dialogue and mixed quality acting, but its been over a decade since that film came out. For most of its 90 minute running time, I can say that the Shallows is an intense man(or woman in this case) versus nature film and proves that Hollywood can still make a quality shark film.When watching a shark film it's impossible not to think of Jaws, but I was surprised that Cast Away was the next film to come to mind when watching the Shallows. Blake Lively's character, Nancy, like Tom Hank's in Cast Away, is stranded on an "island" (really a rock) with no human contact. Like Cast Away, Nancy is given a companion of sorts, an injured sea gull. The relationship is shorter in this film than Tom Hank's relationship with the volleyball but it is nice touch and provides a little bit of humor in an otherwise humorless film. The character also learns to be self-reliant and overcome great obstacles to survive. This makes the Shallows fundamentally different from Jaws and makes the film unique in its own right.One of the best things about the Shallows and what makes it so intense is the use of a timer. It reminds us that Nancy is battling so many obstacles to survive and she only has a limited of time before the tide comes in and her little "island" will be underwater, and she'll have nowhere to hide from the shark. Her dilemma is being injured and going against an animal that can swim faster than a healthy person. Personally, I found it clever how she was able to get from the "island" to the bell buoy.Unfortunately, my praise for the film ends when Nancy gets to the bell buoy. The last 10 minutes of the Shallows are the perfect example of a screenwriter who has written a good script but can't figure out how to end it. The screenwriter obviously wanted to end the film with Nancy surviving and killing the shark, but had no idea how to do it. So we get a ridiculous ending that is reminiscent of the Jaws sequels, particularly Jaws: The Revenge. The Shallows bordered on being a very good film with me, but because of this insane ending it's merely a good film.Nevertheless, the ending doesn't damper the fact that this is still a well-made little thriller. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the overhead shots of the beautifully clear water. Blake Lively's performance is the rock that holds the film together, she makes Nancy into a credible, resilient character who uses all her knowledge and resources to survive. I've always found Lively to be a beautiful woman but I have never seen anything where I found her to be a good actress. The Shallows changes that, if Lively's performance wasn't as convincing I don't think the Shallows works as well as it did.Overall, I would recommend the Shallows as well-made summer thriller that will at least make you a little cautious when entering the ocean this summer. It's not on the level of Jaws as far as shark films go and I was disappointed with how it ended, but it's still well worth watching for the thrills it provides and for Lively's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shallows (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a pretty dismal summer movie season with more unwanted sequels than one could imagine (who really wanted Now You See Me 2?), so it's a bit of a breath of fresh air when a fun and simple shark thriller rolls into theaters, and a surprisingly decent one at that. The Shallows is about Nancy, played by Blake Lively, a med school student and recreational surfer who travels to a secluded beach in Mexico where her late mother once surfed when she was a baby. Her alone time is ruined when she gets too far from the shore and a shark attacks her, forcing her to take refuge on a rock. Stranded two hundred yards from the shore, Nancy has to outwit the shark and try to get back to her dad and sister before becoming shark bait. In a year filled with pretentious sequels coming 15 years too late, watching a good old-fashioned non-pretentious thriller will come to a relief to many. It never takes itself too seriously, although never venturing into camp territory, and it stays suspenseful for its brief 87 minute running time. There's even a little bit of good gore thrown in there too. The Shallows is more of a survival thriller than Blake Lively vs. The Shark, so it's more suspenseful than brutal and intense. Luckily, Blake Lively gives a great performance as Nancy, a resourceful and insanely likable heroine. She's the only face on screen for about 80 minutes of the film, so it's good that she made her presence likable. The Shallows is a pure popcorn thriller: suspenseful, taut and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and terrible - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pluses:Location photography is wonderful. Blake Lively is easy on the eyes and has some good moments acting wise. The Seagull steals the movie -- best character and best character arc by far.Minuses: 1. The Seagull is the best character and has the best character arc in the movie 2. Overdirected in all the wrong places 3. Doesn't establish the water as the threat rather than the shark (a la Jaws), so all the tension lets out the moment the shark drops under the waves 4. CGI overkill. Clever mix of CGI and practical effects is the key, why does this simple equation still elude so many directors?? 5. Blake Lively also has some very bad moments acting wise. Mostly when it comes to moments of peril. Part of this may have to do with the fact that a portion of this movie was shot in a giant pool. If you want to do this right, go Revenant with it and stick her out in the ocean. It would have informed her performance more. 6. Not shot entirely in a real environment. So many scenes were clearly shot in a tank with the backdrop put in digitally. The scenes that are actually shot on location feel much more visceral. Had the whole movie been that, this likely would have been a different review. 7. Terrible terrible script!!! This was a Blacklist script? Seriously. Unless someone went through after the fact and tagged on a bunch of unnecessary plot arcs and hack dialogue onto a brilliant script, we may all have to reassess Blacklist's veracity. This is absolute garbage. Had this just been about a surfer chick nursing her grief with a world tour trip to all her late mother's favorite surf spots who then runs afoul of a rogue shark things would be fine. But no, there is this added on backstory of her dropping out of medical school, and a stock father and sister who spout inane expository dialogue. For what? I don't care whether she goes back to medical school or not. Completely unnecessary and offers no stakes. And the last scene of the flick is teeth clenchingly bad. The absolute worst kind of wrap-it-all- up-with-a-bow happy ending nonsense that is the hallmark of terrible movies. 8. NO STAKES. Nothing builds from one moment to the next. There are just sporadic moments of watered down shark attack mayhem interspersed with indulgent and unnecessary slo-mo shots of Blake Lively looking off into the horizon.9. Inconsistent physical state. One scene Lively is close to death with sores on her lips and eyes burning red from dehydration. The next scene she's swimming with Olympian vigor and her complexion is vibrant and crystal clear. Never once did I fear that the elements might kill her before the shark did. 10. Stalker level overkill of T&amp;A. Can't believe I'm complaining about this but by the 10th time the camera was crammed up Lively's butt or down her cleavage I was over it. Give us one or two shots to show off her body and move on. She's beautiful and deserves the attention, but when bikini shots outnumber shark shots in a shark movie you've gone too far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nancy Adams go to a solo surf vacation to a beach where her mom used to surf in Mexico. But as the movie's trailer and promotion materials simply put, now there's something different on the beach. Bitten and having her body giving in to gangrene, she fought alone in avoiding the shark which is determined to eat her. But at the end she gains the courage to fight the predator back and win her life.As you ca see, I've decided to shorten my plot summary part for my movie reviews here as it would help me finish these posts quicker, LOL. Back to topic, The Shallows (2016) feels like a mix of a few different movies altogether. You'll definitely feel the Jaws (1965) mix, some degree of All is Lost (2013), and a hint of Soul Surfer (2011). But the thing is, having signatures of all those movies together didn't really help this movie's creators on how to incorporate them well and creating something new to see.We still get the usual dose of sex appeal, like if the audience are those who will only see this movie for Blake Lively's body. Also story- wise, the movie didn't really build it's background well. The buildup that's supposed to ground Nancy's will to fight, that she lost her mother and she's currently distancing herself from her family, didn't really connect to the story as a whole, as they're not well reinforced. The whole deal with the ride and the surf just takes the movie into a very slow pace that it got very hard for the movie to suddenly jump into the thriller parts.Speaking of the thriller parts, you don't get a fair amount of suspense from this movie. The thriller is mostly anticipation mood buildup where the saddening things mostly happen outside of the camera angle and we'll only see Nancy's reaction to it. There's just small amount of real shark fight moments that arouses our adrenaline. But in my opinion, the movie did well enough in setting up the flow after the buoy sequence kicks in. And the ending is something that is out of the classic shark movies.The acting overall is just a standard level performance, as it's all Blake Lively's scenes and she performed just at a standard level. The CGI feels quite nice as the movie adds in the nice placement, duration and camera angle considerations to keep the CGI just out of the keen eye's ability to discern it.My say for The Shallows (2016) is a 6 out of 10. Is it recommended? I think so, but only if you watch it for free, LOL, as the suspense level isn't as satisfactory as expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best thing to do with a teed off shark is to give him his space. Bad day at the office, toothache, who knows. The shark in "The Shallows", however, was a sociopath, and a single-minded one at that. He wanted to devour Blake Lively, and spent the whole picture devising just that.The plot of "The Shallows", as you probably guessed, is reed thin and that the director was able to squeeze 87 minutes out it is a tribute to his ingenuity and imagination. Blake Lively is excellent in this movie that has only 4 actor credits, and she carries most of the picture by herself.It is pretty scary, although it relies on several jump scares, but it cannot hold a candle to the granddaddy of all scary maritime movies - and that would be "Jaws". Now THAT was a scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Shark attack movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer shark terror movie has a long tradition, from classics like Jaws to one of my personal favorites Deep Blue Sea. The Shallows exist near the bottom of the list with Blake Lively fighting for survival after a shark. Lively stars as Nancy, a medical school student who has decided to take off from class to travel after the death of her mother. She seeks out the Mexican beach her mother visited when she found out she was pregnant. It is an isolated location and when Nancy's friend excuses herself due to a hangover, Nancy proceeds to go alone. Nancy shows off her surfing skill to a pair of surfers, one of whom wears a head cam to record his stunts. There is a prologue that introduces the threat with this head cam and the shark that doesn't show up nearly early enough. These shots give a bit away that didn't necessary add much to the story. Nancy stays out later than the other surfers and paddles her surfboard towards the carcass of a whale.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Shark Movies Out There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows (2016) *** (out of 4) Nancy (Blake Lively) heads to a secluded beach in Mexico that her mother had visited years earlier. The plan is to surf and reflect on her life but soon she's fighting for it when she's attacked by a Great White shark.THE SHALLOWS has been called the best shark movie since JAWS and it's easy to see why so many people are falling in love with it. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has certainly created one of the more memorable thrillers of the past few years and while there's a lot of scenes with the shark the director also manages to build up suspense without seeing it. This is certainly a movie where the director has full control of the experience and he really delivers a nice little gem.The greatest thing about the movie is certainly it's suspense factor. Going into the movie you already know that there's a shark that is going to attack so this immediately gets you ready for what's to come. What works so well is the fact that everything goes as you'd expect but at the thirty minute mark things take a bigger turn and we get several more twists and surprises. I'm obviously not going to ruin them here but there's no doubt that there are several scenes that will have your stomach in a knot as you wait to see where the next attack is going to come from.The director delivers all sorts of great excitement and there's no doubt that the shark attacks are wonderfully done. What's so great about them is that the shark looks 100% real and there's never any feeling that you're watching a CGI shark like DEEP BLUE SEA or some other crap movie you'd see on SyFy. The movie also works whenever the shark isn't attacking because the director builds up such a relationship between the viewer and the Nancy character that you can't help but feel suspense even when the shark isn't there.Lively turns in a very good performance as she perfectly hits on several emotional marks. Oscar Jaenada also deserves a lot of credit for the few scenes that he is in. There are a few flaws here and there, including a horrible ending but there's no question that THE SHALLOWS delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>127 Hours recreated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I flash you back to 2011, the release of 127 Hours, starring James Franco... Huge success, multiple Academy Awards nominations, and an overall immaculate film on so many levels. Back to today, the release of The Shallows... At first glance is what seems to be an on the books horror, is much much more. The true grit and perseverance of Nancy (Blake Lively) to survive and live another day is an emotional roller-coaster to say the least. The constant thrills, and suspenseful moments are satisfying not only to the eye, but to the ear; with superb sound effects, and overall work in the sound department. Although it may seem lacking in numerous areas, and may not be a "flawless" film, it is indeed an exciting one However, when I attended; I saw it directly after "The Conjuring 2", and it was hard to compete. Nonetheless, this film is an enjoyable one, which has issues; such as lack of plot shifts, lack of character development, and an overall "theme", but is a riveting story that makes you constantly question how/if Nancy will make it out alive. VERDICT: I give it a 7/10, purely because for the duration of the film (1 hr 26 min), I didn't leave impacted by the film, nor did I find anything "gratifying" about it. With that being said, it was a fun time, and an exciting film at that. AGE REC: 12+; not a whole lot of swearing, just blood, and some rather gruesome scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to watch a GOOD shark attack horror/thriller that has a well crafted story, good character development, and much better acting then watch Jaws. The Shallows is more than not worth your money, but it's not worth the time of the movie. This should have been made for TV, how it got the big studio budget it did is a mystery to me. The movie starts out seeming like it may have a prospect of being decent. Even the first third of the movie has you thinking it might have been worth the price of the ticket. The movie continues repetitively and underwhelming until the last quarter of the movie where the eye-roll worthy action starts. The movie is marketed as "you'll never expect how it ends" which I can't decide as being completely false advertising or a spot on description (I truly didn't expect the film to end as lazy and terrible as it did.) And then the last scene of the movie might as well be an insult to anyone going into the theater expecting to see a horror film. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this movie got 7 out of 10 stars is beyond me,the scenery was nice, but it was worse then open water and about as boring and drawned out that it could possibly get. Basically it contained 4 characters which all die but one person of course we know who didn't die. The ending was even worse when she kills the shark by guiding it to its death when it gets stabbed by the buoy pipes. I had waited a while to see this movie and was really disappointed, at one point the two guys come back and she is screaming shark, shes on the rocks and they ignore her, morons get in the water and soon enough are eaten. So then we are subjected to blake talking to a seagull and timing the swim, evidentally she knows the sharks swimming routine.I have really nothing more to say but have to keep writing because of the limit, let's just say I wasted 1.5 hrs of my life to route for a shark</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie was an hour and twenty minutes of a woman screaming on a rock next to a seagull. Second of all, the seagull was the best character and he was the real hero of this movie.If you're down to watch 10/10 seagull acting, dramatic zooms on a seagull while squawking, a legitimate argument between a grown-ass woman and a seagull, and the grown woman attempting to eat a raw crab and then vomiting and the seagull walking away like "bitch i'm done with you" then this is the movie for you. (i've given you the highlights)This movie is not for sharks at all. The promos for this movie paraded around the idea that this movie was for the sharks and how sharks are so misunderstood. This movie did not a damn for the cause against shark finning or the mass murder of sharks. The movie really didn't do anything to try an negate the usual demonetization of sharks. Honestly saying once in the film "i swam right up on his hunting ground" does not change that the rest of the film was spent treating the animal as a monster.The only thing the movie attempted to do in favor of sharks was that it portrayed sharks with the intelligence that they do possess instead of just brainless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so i'd imagine this will be Billed as 'Jaws for the 21st Century' and to an extent i can understand why. However back in the Early/Mid 70's not a hell of a lot was widely known about Shark behaviour and as a result many had an irrational fear of these big Fish, so along came Jaws which played on and to a great extent intensified those fears and a Horror classic was born. Sadly for this Film, the public now have access to as much information as they can digest, much more is now known about Wildlife and their behaviour and so the irrational fear which was present in the 70's is now replaced with a certain respect for Sharks and someone failed to inform the makers. Shortly after the Shark attack - within 5 minutes - i'd given up caring what happened to this Woman. I was hoping the Shark was going to finish her off quickly and end this poor attempt at a suspense/thriller/horror.</fullReview>

The shark CGI was god awful, and the whole movie built up to a climax that just came out of nowhere and made 0 sense. Granted, some of the cinematography was very well done and the concept for the story was a good idea! But, the execution just wasn't there. All in all I would say save your money.</fullReview>

Even had a couple of throw backs to Jaws including one scene that clearly mimic'd the musical score and action. Does Steven Spielberg know this?I liked the cellphone scenes but I've never gotten reception in a secluded spot, let alone a jungle/beach in rural Mexico. Gosh, and those international data charges. What was she thinking?I'd rate it a 7 but what person goes off to a secluded beach by herself in another country in real life? An idiot. Sorry, but I've traveled a lot: One does not go off on their own, to an unknown location, without a check in time, or a confirmed ride unless they're an idiot. Uber, please...didn't you see the jungle you just drove through? Of course not, you were looking at your phone.There is one scene that is just so fake it's hysterically funny. That made me downgrade the movie too.But, complaints aside, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and out of the water this summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shallows lacks real depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shallows is a mixed bag of entertainment. At times it feels like your on the cusp of entering the Syfy movie of the week with cheesy CGI and questionable acting and at other times you feel like your watching a genuine suspense thriller.The biggest reason for this back and forth is chiefly due to Directors Jaume Collet-Serra execution of the story. Overall the film is visually beautiful, but scenes tonally shift from one shot to the next. In the first half of the film the shark is seen only in shadows or in a quick cut, and that builds up a lot tension and dread. Yet as we move into the 2nd and 3rd acts; too much of the shark is seen and you begin to lose the suspense because the shark is now literally front and center. Your attention now turns to how the CGI shark looks instead. There are some interesting visual choices on how the characters communicate with each by phone, but it does feel a bit gimmicky.The story is the familiar man (or this case woman) vs nature scenario which is a solid foundation to build a film, but on occasion the plot tends to veer into some questionable Syfy movie of the week territory like finding safety on top of a dead whale :) Blake Lively does a fair job of playing a woman at a crossroads in her life. A subplot involving her relationship with her family is only so-so, where she really shines is are the scenes where she is trapped on this tiny exposed reef. On her own and wounded, isolated by a great white circling around the reef just waiting. You feel Blake's pain, stress, fear, and eventual will to survive all taking place on this one spot. Before and after this though Blake's performance doesn't really stand out.Last but not least is arguably the star of the film, the CGI shark. In short it's not great (no pun intended)and as we move into the final confrontation, between human and shark, the CGI really is at it's worse. CGI shot of Blake's face on an actual surfer is also iffy.The film again has some genuine thrills but not a lot and it's not excessively gory. Also even though the film is just under 90 minutes, it does still feel a little long.I give it 5 stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What was once in the deep is now in the shallows"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clocking in at a quick 87 minutes, The Shallows never strays from what it knows it is, a heart thumping survival flick. The plus side to the film is that it deals with a shark and Blake Lively in a bikini for the majority of the film. Still having difficulties with the loss of her mother to cancer, Nancy decides to put her medical schooling on hold to go globe trotting to a beautiful island her mother once went to. The perfect place to be at peace, surf and try not to get eaten by a shark. Nancy soon finds herself stranded on a rock, 200 yards away from the shore. With the shark circling her and the tide coming in, she only has so much time before hers runs out. Ryan Reynolds, not too long ago, did a one man show in the film Buried. Now it's his wife's turn as she has to hold this film on her shoulders. Can she carry a film? When most of the shots of her lean more towards eye-candy, I'll say she serves her purpose. But, I don't want to undermine her like that. She was surprisingly good in The Town and I really like the film The Age of Adeline. Her she is relegated to screaming, talking to herself and at the end of the day....look good. She does this and while she doesn't blow anyone away with her acting abilities here, she manages to do the material justice. Is the film scary? Not really, but it does have at least one good jump moment. I didn't feel the dread as much as the filmmakers would have wanted me to. The tension on the other hand, is indeed there. How is she going to make it out alive? Will she? What will be left of her is she makes it to the shore? A lot of questions will run through your mind when she is stuck on that rock. The Shallows is essentially a B-Movie with a Hollywood make-over. The main draw of the flick is the shark, not much else. The film tries to give a bit of depth to our lead character, but it's extremely cookie-cutter at best. Her family drama stalls the film a bit, which is a bad thing when the film is so short. Chalk that up to mediocre writing. Unfortunately the film has some pretty awful CGI that takes you out of the experience. Specifically, I caught myself laughing at moments when Lively was "surfing", yet it's clearly someone else and her face CGI'd on top. Then the shark itself is hit or miss. When it jumps out of the water to attack people, it's laughable. Yet when it is underwater and we see it from above, it's really menacing. The film excels with the make-up though, creating some great work on Lively for her injuries. Horror desperately needs to go back to basics, cause it works well. With a goofy ending, The Shallows falls a hair short of being a classic shark flick. It's a decent summer film that will keep you thrilled no doubt, but it will have to sit at the back of the bus with Jaws driving and Deep Blue Sea sitting near the front.</fullReview>

I am not a prude by all means, but how many butt shots do we need to see to get the idea? With so few characters it gets boring with her moaning and grunting during the whole movie. It was like the movie with Robert Redford where he was the only person in the movie and all he did was moan and grunt, that also was a horrible movie in my opinion. It starts out really slow and there are several suspenseful moments, overall it was just dumb. It has not comparison to the 1st jaws movie. I honestly couldn't wait till it was over.

		<shortDescription>a shark attack thriller cooked better than most, with a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the thing: shark movies are like chicken nuggets. Ever since Steven Chefberg directed Jaws and delivered to the world the ultimate delicacy - like getting chicken nuggets cooked by the top folks at Tavern on the Green or something - there's been a steady diet of crap nuggets, and I don't just mean McDonald's, I'm talking about the tiny McDonald's nestled in the most crime-and-poverty filled portion of a major city with workers who haven't been paid a decent wage in 30 years. In other words, so many shark movies suck or, at best, try to make themselves parodies of sucky movies (which may end up sucking anyway) like the Sharknado movies. So when one finally is cooked up like this (ie Chik-fil-A) and filmmakers get something made with some competency and attention to suspense and gives an actress the total show it impresses. But if it's a chicken nugget from Chik-fil-A, isn't it still fast-food?OK, enough cheesy critic-metaphor. Simply put, this isn't the best shark movie since Jaws, not close. But since Open Water? Sure, I'll bite, no pun intended. What director Jaume Collet-Sera does, from a script by Anthony Jaswinski, is take a semi-Cast Away approach to the shark movie. We get a surfer in Nancy (Blake Lively) who as "movie-luck" has it (when the time comes) has medical school experience (though, as we're told through conversation-exposition early on, didn't finish), but as luck wouldn't have it she is basically the only one left at a so-called "secret" beach - she never even finds out the name, darn it - and there's a shark prowling in the shallow part of the waters. She finds a modicum of shelter on a tiny rock, has to do her best to heal a bitten-into knee, and figure out just what the hell to do from here. Swim to shore? Fat chance.In the sense of isolation I'm reminded of Open Water, but that was differentiated by being a bunch of sharks. The Shallows brings us to having just one, and it's one of those Megaton Will Kill Anything That Moves sharks that Jaws etched into people's minds and has been ripped off ever since. One of the things I appreciate about this approach is that the threat is real for Nancy but it's not something that is too unbelievable; she gets bitten, but it's not fatal (at least, not for someone who, yes, conveniently, knows what she's doing to heal herself). Other movies make it seem like a shark eats everything right away, but often when people get bit in real life it's more traumatic and dangerous by having just one limb or something like it as the injury. When the filmmakers make it all about the step-by-step telling of what this woman will do, or try to do, or won't be able to do, it fires on all cylinders and Caulet-Serra and Lively make a strong collaboration in showing this woman's fight for survival.The issues for me come with certain parts being silly, and the tone is a bit like whiplash; one moment may show the CGI shark jumping in the air and getting an unsuspecting surfer in its grasp (or, more specifically, when s*** finally gets real in the last ten minutes and it takes a final turn that had me laughing, uncontrollably), and then another moment will show a difficult decision Nancy has to make, like having to swim through a pocket of jellyfish to get a head-star, and it becomes far more nerve-wracking due to this being more relatable as a real threat (at least for me, having encountered this in going in the ocean more than sharks).There's even one point a character who, believably or not, does something on the beach that straddles the line of being a serious "oh, come on!" dramatic moment and being funny. But a lot of this in the Shallows does come together into a cohesive whole: Collet-Sera may like his slow-motion shots (or Snyder-esque slow-to-fast-to-normal speeds) with surfing and some tense moments, and yet for little aesthetic tics that don't work he has Lively at the center and gets to create real suspense and real terror out of what could be just a situation. It's more than that, and I appreciated it being focused when it needed to be and only going for the occasional cheese, not the full block of it, to bring it back to food metaphors again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action but a failed script and rushed product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ill start with my first question, why call it The Shallows? Shallow means "of little death" wouldn't that mean that she could just stand up and walk to shore? If you wanted this movie to make a little sense, you'd call it The Buoy! The beginning of the movie had me worried that the entire writing team all bent over, squatted down and took multiple deuces all over a piece of paper. Her name? Nancy? its 2016, show me anyone born after 1990 that is named Nancy. The med school/deceased mother backstory allowed viewers to become more attached to her, and in turn, made her much more prepared for the situation she was in. The acting was lame and i don't think that the writing influenced her role as much. i know she is a bad actress and was only on screen to look phenomenal. Anyway on to the few good parts. I loved the final shark scene that was interesting. The only thing i can say about the other shark attacks, well actually, all of the shark attacks, is to show the people getting ripped up. I know its gory and sounds disgusting but maybe if i saw those 3 Mexican's get ripped to shreds i would give this movie a 5 or higher. Due to the lack of detailed attacks though, ill leave it at a 4. I liked the wide eye cinematography and birds eye view but the consistent close camera and shaky, unrealistic gopro was hard on the eyes and had me reorienting myself throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to pick a favorite genre, thriller would be right up there with the rest of them. And although I'm not a horror guy, when the genre spins more into the thriller realm it usually means good news for me. The Shallows is the big horror-thriller of 2016 and even though it has a weak third act, I ended up enjoying the film a lot more than I expected to.Surprisingly, what I loved most about this movie had nothing to do with the shark, but everything to do with Blake Lively. Although the dialogue given to her via Anthony Jaswinski's script is pretty weak, Lively's physical performance does way more than any of the words coming out of her mouth do. This isn't meant as a detriment to the film, but it's probably more of a film you'd like watching more without volume.Which brings me to the next great thing about The Shallows, the cinematography. The beautiful Australian beach-side they filmed at gave Flavio Martínez Labiano a lot to work with, but I also gushed over the way he shot the night scenes along the beach. His visual flare also bled into the many shark attack scenes including one very impressive longer take that brought me right into the ocean alongside Blake Lively.Where The Shallows fails is in the final act. Even with the so-so script and the knowledge that sharks just don't attack people, I completely bought into the story. But as much as I like the action in the last segment, the logic is kind of thrown out the window. There are also a few attempts to pull at your heartstrings that fall flat. It's hard for a film that is only 80 minutes long to encapsulate the right amount of character depth, but I would have liked that aspect of the film to be handled better.So overall, The Shallows is better than I thought, but it could have been pretty great. I can't say any shark film will ever be the next 'Jaws', but with better attention to detail and less focus on getting the right camera angles of Blake Lively's assets, it would have had a stronger impact on me.+Beautiful landscape to shoot+Lively's physical performance+Decent amount of thrills-Average script at best-Third act falls apart6.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! In The Shallows, this chick goes out to the middle of Secret Beach, Mexico, or some other country to surf off the same beach her now-dead mom surfed when she found out she was pregnant with our protagonist. Her useless-as-a-bowling-ball-bat girl friend decides to romantically pass the morning with some absolute stranger after getting puking drunk the night before. So she heads to the beach with a nice guy named Carlos who gives her ride with no strings attached. She is counting on her friend showing up later and then having a ride back to whatever-the-country beach town/resort/3rd world latrine hole they are staying at. She arrives by herself without a flotation device and heads out. The only two people there are a couple of Spanish-speaking surfer dudes who would like to have sexual congress with her but, hey, the surf is good. They leave and she goes out into the surf entirely by herself. What a complete invitation to some sort of intimate relationship with the shallow, blue sea. If you have seen the preview you know some of what is involved. Pros: Man, does she have a nice backside. She is in a bikini the entire movies. She's got nice but obviously re-upholstered frontal assets that look just like every other set of fake invitations, so yawn. But dat caboozzz. CGI is pretty good. Movie is pretty good. Did I tell you dat cabooz is really good. Cons: Doesn't know if it is a survival movie or a science fiction movie. Score: 3.5 blouse fillers out of 5. Have to give it a four in the ratings.</fullReview>
