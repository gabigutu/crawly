		<shortDescription>Excellent War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well done to Paul Gross and the cast of Hyena Road for creating an authentic Canadian war movie. Being a Canadian Army officer, I had to go see this one in the theater. It was an opportune time as I was able to go with my son, a 2nd year economics student home on his Fall break. The movie was entertaining, emotional and educational. Hyena Road weaves the perspectives of war fighters into an telling story of the character of the Canadian experience in Kandahar Province. It keeps you engaged throughout with a mix of action, soldiering and the very human dimension to conflict. "Inside the wire, we think about what to do outside the wire. We get it wrong fifty percent of the time which means we get it right the other fifty percent of the time" and " We have to remember that the end state is not for children to fly kites" were themes that stuck with us as we drove away from the theater. Thanks Paul,Major Brian Taylor, Canadian Army</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film. See it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is excellent film about modern warfare with convincing battle scenes, ramped up tension and incredible locations. Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Very hard to tell in Afghanistan as Canadian soldiers do their duty, to little effect. In my view it is a superior film to the much hyped American Sniper. The performances were all very convincing and Paul Gross's direction was swift and to the point. The atmosphere of working in a very foreign land for the Canadian soldiers is very apparent. I found I cared about what they were doing, as I was frankly trying to figure out their mission. If you enjoyed films like Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker, you should see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the film to be somewhat adrift as far as the theme and the storyline. There didn't seem to be much of a resolution, rather a way to end the film. If it's supposed to be an analogy of the current situation in Afghanistan, well we get that "It's not one war, it's a lot of little wars" message earlier on. It would make a superb pilot for a series centered around the Intel guy (Paul Gross). I found the scenes within the CP interesting: radio procedure has changed dramatically in the 40 years since I was in the infantry. But the only scene I found totally authentic was the "dance in the desert" scene. This sort of thing does happen spontaneously within a tight knit group. And the patrol procedure and snipercraft were off in my opinion. The "Ghost" character was my favorite. I liked the fact that no subtitles were used and that, like the soldiers, we had to listen to the interpreter. I would liked to have seen his character developed. The artillery scenes were authentic and dramatic, but it was the only time I've seen the gunners get a target round on the first shot. The small arms combat sequences were excellent. Total confusion like always. All in all, I enjoyed it, and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding portrayal about the war in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Gross has written an amazing story, using Canada's involvement in the Afghanistan wars, as the vehicle. As a Canadian I couldn't help but be drawn into the events that occurred in the film. I have no doubt that, while the story and characters are fictional, the feelings and actions are real. Gross' ability to intertwine the politics of the Afghanistan people, the requirements of our military contingent, and the costs of war were exceedingly well done. I want to acknowledge the military presence of all the European countries and the United States who were there as well, and I can imagine that similar situations occurred. Paul Gross is Canadian and this film is definitely a Canadian perspective. You have to see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Gross made an OK war film with his first feature Paschendale - but with Hyenna Road he has take a great leap forward. The story revolves around a sniper company in Afghanastan -- they're good at what they do and think they understand the moral complexities of war. To them it's a black and white, right or wrong endeavor - little do they know how wrong their assessment is -- Gross forgoes the normal tropes of war films and introduces us to the new, complex and nuanced realities of the fight - and boy what a fight it is -- The action sequences are a genre junkies wet dream but they come suffused with moral complexity and nuanced performances from a wonderful cast of largely unknown actors. For the nationalist there is of course Paul Gross as his usual Captain Canada and there are wonderful cameos from Alan Hawco (Republic of Doye) and the great unsung Clarke Johnson (Homicide) though it is (stage actress) Christine Horne who steal our hearts and makes this a five hankie film.Hyenna Road should be on every school syllabus and reminds us - like Gross's previous work - just what it is to be Canadian. That said, an international audience will find it appealing as an action flick and for the counter-point it provides to American Sniper.I saw the gala at the Toronto film festival an urge all to -- GO SEE IT - when it opens in their town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyena Road: a new Black Hawk Down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is catching, engaging. Characters are nice and well played: a sharp sniper unit, a beautiful lady captain, bad and good Afghans, a smart intelligence officer? in the end I felt a little bit Canadian (at least in the heart) myself.The title road perhaps actually exists, or perhaps not, it's not clear. The Toronto Sun says that 'Hyena' is one of the nicknames of a road Canadian troops built in Kandahar province during the war...In any case it's not Ridley Scott's but watching this film I had the same feeling of true war (true fighting) I had watching 'Black Hawk Down'. And, although due, this is a big compliment nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still shaking. I found certain parts of these movie truly intense. At one point, I was sitting close to the screen. when a bomb exploded as I was reaching for my drink. For a second I thought the front of the theatre had exploded. For those who think it was boring it is probably because of your age. Not everything in life happens in 30 second sound bites. Sometimes it is necessary to actually pay attention and listen to what is happening in a film to understand it. I am very proud of our troops who are dealing with this situation and at the end I actually had tears in my eyes. I haven't had that reaction to a movie since I saw Dumbo as a kid. If you want to see a true picture of what is happening over there go see this movie. I guarantee it will stay with you for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie about Canada's involvement in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Gross took a few risks in making this movie about Canada's military campaign in Afghanistan's Kandahar province--"the birthplace of the Taliban" and pretty much a hornet's nest for the tiny Canadian NATO force that tried to secure the region for five long years.The movie is thoughtful and subtle, rather than offering beginning-to-end war movie entertainment, and it focuses on people and some of the impossible personal and professional choices they're forced to make in complex and unforgiving situations--on both sides of the cultural divide between occupier and occupied.In this the movie isn't afraid to show that some of the all-too-human choices turn out to be the wrong ones, or that the protagonists can declare personal guiding principles and then contradict them in their professional response to circumstances.For the most part, the movie avoids setting up two-dimensional characters in a good guys-bad guys scenario; however, it failed in this respect regarding the Taliban, who were reduced to nonentities worthy only of being killed wholesale--much like the Somalis in Blackhawk Down.As in Blackhawk Down, and a slew of similar tales about recent Western military action against foreign countries, Hyena Road treats the local resistance to foreign occupation as almost an affront to the well-meaning efforts of "our" noble warriors. But presumably it wasn't made for Afghan audiences.To fully appreciate the movie, it helps if you know something about Afghanistan's past forty years of foreign military occupation and civil war, and also if you know something about Canada's military--where the personal and the professional are never far apart. I believe this quality is one of the things that makes the Canadian Forces so good in the field: they're not trained to be machines; they're trained to be fully human warriors--which I felt the movie illustrated very well in the relationships between the Canadian protagonists and the veteran Afghan fighter, with admirable understatement by Mr. Gross.Hyena Road is less entertainment than it is an education about aspects of personal warriorship and about Western nations' activities in foreign realms most of us know nothing about, but about which many of us hold strong opinions nevertheless (oh yes, and the action scenes are pretty riveting and authentic-looking!). I think Paul Gross succeeded very well in what he set out to do with Hyena Road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In top of all afgan/iraqi war movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its a very well built movie with a cool pace. Enjoyed every minute of it. I liked it most, because of its much complex and deeper plot than usually in war movies. Ending was really sad, like last time i think when i saw Bambi lost its mother i guess...OK not that sad, but dramatical at its best (for a war movie anyway) Im placing Hyena Road in top 5 of all iraq/afgan war movies. So if you like Zero Dark Thirty, Hurt Locker, Charlie Wilsons War and Green Zone im sure you'll love that one too. So thanks Canada, this is how you do a war movie, and this is how most of them should be done! PS, when i read all those previous reviews written by canadians, it got me even more emotional. So many many thanks for all the emotions :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I figured going into the movie, once I saw that it was a Canadian flick, that the typical cynical movie expectation would be the outcome. I figured I would end up turning it off once I saw the typical low budget, bad acting, political correctness that seems to be Canadian cinema. NOT A CHANCE! This movie was fantastic! The actors did a terrific job. The whole Hyena Road deal was a little thin but it made it up in other areas like the complexities of middle eastern culture, history and honour. It showed the Canadian forces as true professionals that they are. The narrators voice seemed a bit out of place but most of the information provided gave perspective and background and the narrations were infrequent. Afghanistan is certainly not a place for the faint of heart and this movie showed why. This showed as a big budget movie. I have already recommended this movie to several colleagues and friends.WELL DONE Mr. Gross!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hyena Road": Canada isn't just for limp maple leaves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that makes "Hyena Road" excellent is that the film continues a cinematic and literary tradition of the Canadian ability to fight back, of intelligent opposition. In popular literature this goes back as far as Robert Service. In film it goes back to the (serious) Royal Mounties movies and to such Hollywood blockbusters as "The Wild North" (1952) and Stewart Grangers' character of Jules Vincent. Because Canada has become such an appendage to the USA in modern times we forget how outstanding the fighting ability of these people and their institutions can be. I do Not write this as a Canadian, mind you. But as an objective, non-Canadian who was very impressed by the combative intelligence and cross-cultural savvy of "Hyena Road". This is a sleeper. This is a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hyena Road (2015): Dir: Paul Gross / Cast: Paul Gross, Rossif Sutherland, Allan Hawco, Christine Horne, Clark Johnson: Canadian soldiers are finally praised and highlighted in this well produced war film set in Afghanistan. The soldiers are struggling to make a road and losing civilians constantly. The atmosphere is hostile but director Paul Gross does a fine job at not only showcasing Canadian military in action but also the state of people living in the area. One interesting character who surfaces is a guy called "the Ghost" who seems to pull high ranking despite living in a hut dressed in robes. The enemy fears him and luckily the Canadian military commander, played also by Gross, is able to gain access and form a communication as to their next move. There is a love story featured between one of the soldiers, an excellent sniper, and a female back on base whom he ends up getting pregnant. This is the film's one weakness for it is easy to predict that death will separate this union. Gross previously teamed with fellow Canadian Leslie Nielsen to make Men With Brooms, then he made another war film called Passchendaele. Here he amps it higher with explosive action that never goes too over the top. Gross leads the troop and he is improving greatly as an actor. As the commander he seeks best possible measures that are sometimes intersected with hostility. While American war films have dominated the box office for years, it is great to see a film celebrate those of the Maple Leaf who have risked their lives to pave a smoother road between us and those whose environment warrants little peace. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyena Road Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan (Rossif Sutherland) is a Canadian sniper who tries not to think of his targets as human. He's also in love with his colleague, Jennifer (Christine Horne) who together try to lessen the constant danger that comes with their jobs. When Ryan and his team Travis, Hickie, and Tank (Allan Hawco, David Richmond-Peck, and Karl Campbell) are surrounded by the enemy, they take refuge in a small village. In this village, they meet a legendary former mujahid known as the Ghost (Neamat Arghandabi), who saves their lives. When Ryan tells intelligence officer Pete (Paul Gross) about him, Pete insists on meeting him. He agrees to help them but the kidnapping of two girls from his village threatens to complicate their mission.If you didn't know already, I am a Canadian. This film depicts (more or less) our army. Maybe it exaggerates the level of our involvement in Afghanistan but it probably would have been a very boring film otherwise. I have seen a lot of war films but I don't think that I have seen any Canadian war films (because all of the others are predominately American) so this would be a first for me. It ultimately makes no difference what country the film comes from. For a war film, the story isn't too original here so don't expect any surprises in this one. I found the pacing in this one to be a little weird where character seemed to alternate between being out of their base and engaging Taliban and being within the base and just talking to each other about things. I was hoping for a little more fighting because the moments when the characters were within the base to be quite boring because I did not particularly care about the characters besides the character of Pete played by Paul Gross since I thought he had the most depth when compared to all of the other characters who had little to no depth and I enjoyed his interactions with his Afghani friend Abdul (Hekmat Bavari). It's funny that this is the case seeing that Paul Gross wrote and directed the film. I thought the war scenes were well done in that they were well shot and I liked the sound design involved. They also did a good job capturing the tension involved with being a sniper and the uncertainty after things went wrong (and they sometimes did). Despite the base scenes being boring and not caring about most of the characters, I still thought Rossif Sutherland was okay as Ryan, albeit being cliché almost the entire time. Christine Horne as Jennifer was okay but I didn't think her character was necessary to the story (except for something I will not spoil) as it did not add anything to it and her relationship with Ryan did not work seeing that they had no chemistry together. What annoyed me was during certain scenes involving conversations between Afghani characters, there were no subtitles so I had no idea what they were saying. The only time I did was when there was a translator in the scene. I found the tone of the film drastically changed near the end which did not make sense to me. Overall. this comes nowhere near the great war films but it should moderately entertain.Score: 6.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

I guess the bad rating for the movie is based on too much military talk and not enough shooting and blasting everything like those boring Hollywood movies with the same endings. This movie is unexpected and is truly great. Would watch this any day over some random Hollywood movie which are all boring and easy to predict what happens and most importantly who survives in the end.

		<shortDescription>Canadian army finds confusion of loyalties and hatreds in Afghanistan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last line is the key, spoken by narrator (and writer, director, star) Paul Gross: "As the Afghans might say, 'You have the clocks, but we have the time.'" Might say, that is, but probably won't ? they keep their secrets. Hyena Road is about the gap between the modern Western understanding/army and the mystique of the ancient remote Afghanistan. They have a large, eternal history, whereas we have our short history and technology. So that's where modern armies go to get confused and die. The mystique extends back far beyond the Canadian and American mission, back past the defeated Russians, even back beyond Alexander the Great. As the latter discovered, even the sand there is hostile.This is an expertly made war film, in some ways typical of its genre. The sudden battle scenes are punctuated by throbbing local music, with the occasional reminder of our rock. Our heroes are a small unit who endear themselves with their comradeship and humour. They face terrible attacks from a horde of unidentified insurgents. As the enemy sweeps out from the dunes they seem a force of nature attacking what we consider to be the agents of civilization ? as the Indians attacked our settlers, the Axis our Allies, the Cong our forces in Nam. Our wars always seem to be Our Culture against Them Savages. Their films simply reverse those roles. Yet in some ways this film is very different, fresh. These are Canadian soldiers we follow, not the usual American, so the unit has a consistency the tradition of the US Melting Pot eschewed. But we swear as much. And we fight as bravely. Even a love affair breaks out, with the predictable hope and doom. If the affair seems implausible from the perspective of military rules (of engagement?), it serves a larger thematic purpose. It reminds us that the war does not erase normal human emotions, normal urges, and the hope for a future. So if the dad-to-be dies, the abducted little Afghan girls are found among other caged children and released to what we would like to convince ourselves will be full, normal lives. Unlikely. The film's key insight is the humongous gap between that culture and ours. We have the impressive technology that shrinks space and has unprecedented destructive capacity. But that's no match for that much older culture with its unfathomable ways of thinking, alien values, indecipherable loyalties, and the prime force and result of such a long history, resilience. They take everything that we ? and time ? throws at them and carry on. The elder with unmatched eyes has a perspective our normal ones can never have.The title refers to the road the Canadian army is trying to build to ensure the transit of forces and supplies. It will serve the people as much as the army. It's so important the insurgents are determined to destroy it. The formal opening ceremony is supposed to forge a partnership ? but it blows up in the Canadians' face. In that world of tribal confusion and hatreds all partnerships may prove a forgery.</fullReview>

I give it a rating of 7 because the efforts made in the movie was more then most top rated Hollywood movies would make, when it comes to war movies, about Afghanistan. The choice of locations were amazing, no way Afghanistan would look anything different. Director's work was super.what let the movie down was, choice of actors, especially the choice of actors playing as Afghans. I think the only best choice was the "Ghost" as to me he is more look like, talk and act like Afghans would. the rest might have been wrong choice. some even spoke Arabic while acting as afghans. However this is a big problem in movie business world because of luck of good cultural advisers, therefore I still give it 7 because the story and cinematography was much more closer to the reality of Afghan war.</fullReview>

It does not truly capture the afghan experience...but that said, this is a truly excellent war film.While it may not have found the "truth" of the Afghanistan War it certainly has given the viewer a rarely captured taste and feel of the modern soldier in any modern conflict.The story is simple but brilliantly told. Sutherland's character is real in every way and you are given the chance through his portrayal, to feel the conflict both internal and external.Gross has done a wonderful job here and please don't let the inaccuracy (inherent in every war film) detract from a masterful directorial and acting effort.BC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Movie About Canadian Role in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had it all .... drama, humour, terror, violence, empathy, compassion, tension, love, heartache, it had it all. And it showed a realistic storyline about how Canadian forces had to deal with a very difficult situation in building a road through a heavily mined enemy territory and the varying elements of dealing with the Afghan culture in doing so. This is the best Canadian movie I've seen so far. Highly recommended. I believe it should be a candidate for movie of the year. I saw the Martian. This was better. Paul Gross does a fantastic job with this movie. For Americans who are always used to the American perspective in war situations, this should be a refreshingly different perspective. The war in Afghanistan combined the forces of the US, Canada and others. In a very complex situation, this movie does very well to represent the daily life and horrors of modern warfare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but only just, as a movie; more suitable as a TV special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can tell a lot of effort went into production, and a sincere effort was made at authenticity...but still comes off as a movie that doesn't take itself very seriously, played by actors who take themselves perhaps too seriously. At times I wasn't entirely sure this wasn't a deliberately tongue-in-cheek drama with the aim of a little awkward comic relief; however, neither one works well as it is neither here nor there. Perhaps soap-opera-ish would be a good descriptor in terms of overall production value, not content per se'.The combat scenes, while not poorly acted or choreographed, still come off as a little bit staged. Sometimes it's just the little things, like uniforms not being quite dirty enough after soldiers were supposedly rolling around in the mountains for a few hours; sometimes the mountains look a little bit more like the Arizona Rockies than Afghanistan. Sometimes The Afghani villagers look a little bit too clean, well fed, and smooth-skinned to be actual Afghani villagers. The way the Taliban swarm en-masse, hail-mary style is just not how they tend to move tactically in the real world. Like I said, the little things. the sniper scope reticle they give us a peek through is, thankfully, not the usual nonsense with all sorts of colors and numbers and flashing lights, as is seen in some movies. it's not the standard Mil Dot reticle, but at least it's half believable.Ultimately, on a budget, just so much can really be put into production. overall, not a terrible movie, perhaps as an amateur military historian who's watched more than my fair share of combat helmet cams, I'm a bit more tuned in to the minutiae. So be it...overall, I'd give it a 7 for effort, and a 5 for final product, so at 6 I think is a fair score.</fullReview>

I now realize that no country is alone in this fight against terrorism and we must continue to oppress any threat to anyone's freedom, whether it be an individual or a country in whole! This Movie brought that to light by showing the ways of the Taliban people and how they have no regard for their own countrymen, only in what makes them richer!

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric Arghanistan Combat Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Passchendaele" actor &amp; director Paul Gross' Canuck military actioneer set in Afghanistan "Hyena Road" is an above-average combat movie with sturdy performances, solid production values, but its standard-issue message that 'war is hell' is its only drawback. Donald Sutherland's son Rossif Sutherland plays Ryan Sanders, an officer in charge of a team of snipers while Paul Gross casts himself intelligence officer Pete Mitchell. Sanders believes that one shot can make the difference, but Mitchell has a more cynical attitude to warfare. Everything revolves around a high ranking officer's decision to build a road through the Kandahar Province. The first scene, where Sanders and his team drill a Taliban fighter who is trying to booby-trap a road, is riveting stuff. After they perforate the Taliban fighter, the poor slobs slumps down into a kneeling, prayer-like position. As our guys withdraw, they notice some curious looking spots on part of the paved highway running through the barren desert setting. Sanders orders a sniper to shoot at the spots, but nothing happens. When the sniper fires an incendiary round, the entire terrain vanishes in a huge explosion. Sanders and his team scramble out of the area and soon find themselves pursued hotly by several Taliban fighters wielding AK-47 assault rifles. Our heroes make it to the refuge of a house after a Taliban with an RPG accidentally blasts a hole into a doorway in the wall surrounding the house. According to Sanders' description of the man in the room with them where they hole up, the individual sounds like a legendary freedom fighter known as 'the Ghost.' Meanwhile, back at headquarters, Mitchell listens intently to Sanders as he describes their benefactor, and Mitchell is convinced that this is the same native who help oust the Soviets from Afghanistan. Mitchell wants to recruit the Afghanistan man to the cause. At the same time, few know Sanders has been having a secret romance with a headquarters communications officer Jennifer (Christine Horne of "Survival Code") who fears that the brass will learn about their romance and cashier her. Jennifer and Ryan agree to keep their affair off the grid. The conflict intensifies not only when Jennifer discovers that she is pregnant with Sanders' child, but also when Sanders plunges back into the desert to kill more enemy. The violence is sporadic, but graphic. Heads are shot off and drenched with gore. Comparisons between "Hyena Road" and Clint Eastwood's "American Sniper" are inevitable. Nevertheless, despite its romantic subplot, this is a movie worth watching with a downbeat finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was pretty damn good, but then I like war films where the protagonists aren't always flawless and righteous no matter what they do -- morally ambiguous is what I'm going for here.. Mostly the story revolves around the military aspect of building the title road, from the snipers and soldiers on the ground laying protection and scouting, to command relaying information and shaking hands, to intelligence playing chess with what information they have. From my understanding at least some of the footage was taken on a trip to Afghanistan, and it seems most of the cinematography was adjusted to match that, which while irritating at times did add to the overall effect. On the other hand, while I'm sure such things happen on base, the romance subplot was unnecessary as it added nothing but some melodrama to the plot. The narration, while somewhat informative, really did feel out of place, as I don't care about Alexander the Great's story; if they wanted it there for background than it would have been better as a story in dialog. Those aspects aside, I found this much more palatable than 'American Sniper', a film which gets worse the more I think about it.Source: http://www.megashare-viooz.net/hyena-road-2015.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Canada's Hurt Locker?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Hurt Locker and Kilo Two Bravo, it is Canada's chance to create a 'war is hell' movie. This one takes place in Afghanistan, and follows the plot of Canadian soldiers trying to navigate the politics and dangers of creating Hyena Road which is supposed to be a major blow to the Taliban.Let us start with the good. The lead actor, Paul Gross is good as always, playing both narrator and sage to the chaos. His role is the best part of the movie, and he is often able to use humour and subtlety to convey the mood of the film. Clarke Johnson (Canada's adopted son, best known from Homicide Life on the Streets and The Wire) is dreadfully underused, and is really only a cameo. The other actors are fair, but often can't make much out of a very cliché and limited script.Also good is some of the early action. Smaller engagements look and feel authentic. Snipers with sighters taking range and careful considerations is interesting and dramatic. What is not good is the larger action sequences which seem forced and choppy. We will see enemies miles away, suddenly to appear all around our heroes. Hurt Locker was good because the very little action was so realistic and limited that it was dramatic. The blend of action feels more like Fast and The Furious than Generation Kill or Hurt Locker.The bad. Plot and flow are enemies to this movie just as the Taliban are supposedly the enemies to peace in Afghanistan. Maybe the director wanted us to get a glimpse of 'life' in their world, but the audience does not get a sense of conflation of war, but frustration and boredom at a snails pace plot, and confusing at the what is supposed to be happening.Overall, as a piece of Canadiana, Hyena Road was worth a watch. It is fun to see Canadians in the field, both bad and good. It is also nice to see some diverse actors and some point of view from Afghan residents. This is not a good movie, but a pretty bad movie with some very good things in it.If you are a Canadian history nut or a hard core Paul Gross (or Clark Johnson like me!) you should see this, otherwise there is very little reason to watch this. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Canadian film telling a Canadian story in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm Canadian and this movie was written and directed by a Canadian depicting Canadians in Afghanistan and filmed in Canada with a cast of Canadians telling a uniquely Canadian story from a Canadian point of view.Canadians don't often get the chance to tell a Canadian story but when we do its just different as we depict, show and describe ourselves and events diversely as we think and behave in a unique way, that only we get.It's not a typical American war movie where technology guns and bombs shock and awe you with F-16s, bursting bombs and massive body counts and the good guys triumph.It's So worth seeing! This Canadian really enjoyed the story and I'm so glad and thankful that it was told and told by a Canadian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a true pacifist who believes that war should be a thing of the past I have a morbid fascination of war movies.A good war movie is one that makes you see and understand the utter folly of war. Hyena Road is a perfect example of a good war movie.The futility of war and in this case of the crazy undefined one that has been raging in Afghanistan for decades.The story line is solid, the characters are real people. Rossif Sutherland as Ryan Sanders the patriot who believes that in war there are good and bad people. Paul Gross as Pete Mitchell the cynical intelligence officer that believes that he knows what needs to be done, and who has dissected war as a conflict of interests by many parties.The friction of the impossible situation the characters are in is well presented by all the cast.The slight romantic sub story is just another facet of the stupid mad situation all the characters are in.The photography is vivid and true and the movie moves at just the right pace between the basic humanity of all the characters and the very well made realistic scenes of combat.All in all an excellent film that stands true against most of the American war movies of recent years that are only propaganda. Here the point that war is senseless and only inflicts harm directly on the people or indirectly on the society of all involved.Undoubtetly a pearl of Canadian Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Afghanistan Up Close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask most movie goers about war movies and you'll find that they think the only people involved have been Americans and those they are fighting against. They forget that other countries have been involved in all major wars. HYENA ROAD takes a look at the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and looks at it through the eyes of another fighting force, that of Canada. Jokes have been made at Canada's expense but the fact of the matter is that they've been involved in most major wars as much as any other country (another example was THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE which showed how the US special forces were trained and combined with the Canadian team in WWII).HYENA ROAD takes a look at the current war through the eyes of three main characters. Ryan (Rossif Sutherland) is the head of a sniper team for who the war is cut and dried. Those are the bad guys, we are the good guys, we take them out, period. There are no gray areas. They follow instructions and feel every stop of the way that they are fighting the good fight.The second set of eyes on hand belong to Pete (Paul Gross, the writer and director as well), a member of military intelligence who fights the war as a game of chess, moving players from one spot to another, using every piece of data to make a decision. Pete realizes that there are more things going on that a straight out frontal assault. There are decisions to be made based on the customs of the land and the players involved. Of the three characters Pere probably has a better idea than most of what is happening and will happen.Lastly there is "The Ghost" (Niamatullad Arghandabi). The Ghost was a fierce fighter during the Afghan war against the Russians, a living legend whose stature among his people is highly regarded. In hiding for years Pete wants to find out why he has returned, if he is there to help their cause or that of the enemy. As the story plays out it seems their connection is for the better. But more is going on beneath the surface here.The three stories overlap when Ryan and his team bring back information on the fact that the Ghost is in the area. Having no idea who he is they are contacted by Pete and he fills them in and works with them to set up a meet. When the main bad guy Walid shows and abducts little children the team wants to take him out there and then but Ryan stops them from doing so. Their frustration is palpable and a confrontation with Pete inevitable when they return to camp. But as Pete sits down with Ryan to explain the situation, to let him know that the long game is more important, it doesn't set well with Ryan or his team even though they understand.For the team the line has now been blurred. What is the right thing to do? Who are the fighting? And what plans are in store for both them and the Ghost? While watching the film you begin to understand all the planning and moving of soldiers that are necessary to achieve the final goals of the military but you also witness the fact that other players in the game, mainly the Ghost, have motives and moves of their own. And the main pawns being played by both sides in this game are Ryan and his men.Not only is this movie interesting for the sake of looking at the war from the perspective of the military of another country, the story that it all centers around is fascinating as well. Far too many think of the people of Afghanistan that live in the hills as simple peasants but the truth is they are more shrewd than some give them credit for. They haven't survived for the centuries that they have by being just goat herders. This film treats them as opponents worth of stepping up to the chess board placed on the table by Pete. There are moments in this film that will disturb viewers when they see how children are treated and sold by callous villains. There are moments that will offer glimpses of violence of soldiers in the field that are realistic and gruesome. There are moments of concern you will have for the different characters involved in this story. And in the end you'll leave this film knowing you've seen a war film that tells a story, tells it well and is more realistic than most. This one is worth taking a look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling Canadian Film on the war in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true war film; it starts out with some serious and well realised action and manages to maintain the calibre throughout. It is set around the work of a sniper an intelligence officer and the locals. Set in Kandahar province where the Canadian Army fought, along side her allies, to secure the area for five years. It deals with the violence, corruption and the human side of the conflict and is all done within the microcosm of the effects this has on those involved.It was written, directed, and stars Paul Gross and whilst I generally feel that you should never be so involved in a project there can be exceptions and this is one of them. The acting is all above average and the special effects are very convincing. It also manages to keep up the tension levels throughout. The relationship angle could have been stronger but the overall package somehow makes up for any perceived shortcomings.It is in English with some Pashtu but that is not translated and for the context of the film does not need to be. If you are a war film fan or just like a story about ordinary people coping in extraordinary times then there will be a lot here to find of interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slightly Above Average War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hyena Road follows a group of Canadian soldiers as they search for a supposedly legendary man living in Afghanistan in the hopes of using him to achieve their own goals. I liked a handful of aspects of this movie. I thought that some of the conflicts introduced throughout were good, particularly one involving a love interest, but that one aspect in particular wasn't ever really that important. It made sense why it wasn't so important, but nonetheless it felt like just a way of making the characters more relatable than an actual conflict within the story. The action sequence at the end was pretty good as well, and the visuals were pretty cool too. Everything else is pretty average. The rest of the action scenes aren't really any good, and the acting is just okay. Paul Gross, the writer, director and star of the show stood out as being a particularly poor actor. I can't say that I'm surprised though for some reason that I can't really explain. The aspect of searching for this legendary Afghan warrior dude was kind of unique, but it was far too out of place to be considered a good thing. Considering everything else was treated with total seriousness, suddenly throwing in some supposedly invincible legendary warrior dude was just too dang out of place. The end was pretty stupid too. Sure the action was better, and I liked how the movie handled how dramatic some of it was, but in the end it was pretty dumb. Of all the war movies I've seen, this is one of the dumbest (not as dumb as Fury (2014) if you ask me) endings I've seen. In the end Hyena Road is okay. There are good parts, and there are bad parts, but most of it is just okay. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action but lacking everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dialogue in this movie wanders knee-deep in cliché, the camera work is mediocre, the costume design sloppy (I almost thought the movie was a comedy when the Ghost was introduced), the plot has major holes, and the only decent performance comes from actor Christine Horne.That aside, the flick works as a war movie with a little less "'Murica" than what you usually get. Of course the baddies never hit anything but apart from that the combat scenes have a realistic feel to them and are therefore able to bring a little bit of tension to the whole thing.So if you're gonna watch this just for the action you'll get some value for your money, if you're looking for any form of artistic skill you'll be left disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth the Tunnel Toll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a US citizen who travels to Canada about once a year to check out a Canadian content movie that sounds of interest. I'm not a huge fan of war movies to begin with, but thought I'd give "Hyena Road" a try. It wasn't as horrid as "Passchendaele", but still left a lot to be desired.Much of the dialog was hard to hear and/or comprehend. Rossif Sutherland, in particular, failed to impress and needs elocution lessons if he wants to star in any future films.The movie was meant more as a "day in the life" movie than a scripted plot, which can be fine. It seemed that given that, we really didn't need the romantic subplot yet again, which Paul Gross seems to feel is essential in any film. It ruined his first war flick, and was unnecessary in this one.The best acting in the movie was done by Christine Horne. She was very good. I also enjoyed the "Ghost" and "Cleaner" actors. As previously mentioned, I did not care for Rossif Sutherland in the first outing I've seen from him. Everyone else did a decent job, but nobody was outstanding. That sums up my thoughts on the movie.Decent, but not worth the money to see it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The smartest war movie you'll ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the smartest war movie ever. You actually learn a lot about the afghan conflict, and shows just how complicated things can get there. The acting is great, the story superb, and even if you are not Canadian you end up truly feeling sorry for their losses. It shows Hollywood that yes it is possible to make a patriotic movie which does end up being cheesy, misleading, or plan stupid.I cannot recommend enough this flick if you like smart movies. You'll learn from this movie more about that conflict that watching years of CNN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Canadian "US Sniper" style war flick.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hyena Road is a Canadian "US Sniper" style war flick. Its replete with the usual black and white "we are the good guys" simplistic nonsense, that conveniently overlooks the key question; why are Western forces present in a country like Afghanistan? What you get instead is a tale of good Canadian solders versus the bad old Afghani "insurgents". There's lots of tough guy swearing, apparently the more you say "fuck" the tougher you are or, at least, sound. The storyline is a loose affair that wanders around looking at the soldiers various engagements in the field. Its day in the life stuff and if you like military tales of this variety, you could do worse. The acting is reasonable and the characterizations, not too over the top. All in all a rather shallow watch, that fails, like so many in this genre, to ask the hard questions. Five out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uninspiring, Confusing Mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie really wanting to like the film. I strongly support the Canadian film industry, however, Hyena Road was a disappointment. The start of the film was exciting and well paced despite being pretty predictable, however it was the middle of the film that fell off the tracks. It was boring, confusing, and overall pretty flat. Many of the plot developments were pretty predictable and the characters were flat, like really flat. I began to become confused as the story went from dialogue scene to dialogue scene which became boring and repetitive. I had no connection to the characters and couldn't tell you anyone's name. The end attempted to get the wheels spinning by using love to get the wheels going, but it was very cliché. The action scenes were sloppily executed as the camera was awkwardly shaky. Storm troopers look like marksmen compared to the dreadful aim of every foe until the final battle. The movie was boring, cliché, and overall a very uninspiring film that attempted to capitalize on the market for patriot acts.</fullReview>

WE DON'T HAVE ANY INVESTMENT IN THESE LAME CHARACTERS! WE DON'T CARE WHEN THEY ALL DIE AT THE END! This movie is super boring. Basically nothing happens except at the end and at the beginning. The action scenes are poorly directed with shaky cam and quick cuts. The story is okay but nothing spectacular. This movie is the pinnacle of generic! EVERYTHING IS CLICHÉ AND BORING IN THIS LAME MOVIE. The girl is pregnant- predictable. The main character sacrifices himself-predictable. Not only that but the characters are so lame that I don't even remember their names after a few hours. DON'T WATCH THIS LAME GENEIRC MOVIE.</fullReview>
