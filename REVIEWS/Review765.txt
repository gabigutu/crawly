		<shortDescription>Clown has a unique premise, but its execution leaves a lot to be desired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you aren't bothered by clowns, you have to admit that a killer clown is a pretty creepy idea. I mean clowns are always around children, they have a pale face, goofy hair and bright welcoming colors, masking the homicidal tendencies underneath. I always thought it would make a good movie idea, and Clown is about the closest we get to that. It's less of a killer clown story as much as it is a possession movie. This particular clown suit does not come off. If someone puts it on, it fuses with their skin while the demon slowly possesses them. The demon is a cannibal and only eats children. 5 children to be exact: one for every month of winter, or so the lore goes. It's an interesting take on the killer clown notion and I usually like Eli Roth so I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, Clown misses the mark in almost every way.It's an Eli Roth movie so of course there's lots of blood and gore, which is fine. Eating kids is also inherently disturbing, even though the killing is not shown on screen you do see a lot of children's guts, blood and body parts. The thing is, it doesn't really add anything to the movie. That's mainly because the movie doesn't build up much tension in the first place. It's slow to start - the dad is the one who puts on the costume to surprise his kid at his birthday party, but he falls asleep in it and when he wakes up, he finds that the wig infused with his hair and the costume is indestructible. The psychological aspect of this is interesting for a while, but it never goes the extra mile. Everything we see here has been done to death already. Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialogue and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie.This movie has every horror cliché in the book. The jump scares in particular really detract from the movie's atmosphere. It sets a dark tone at the beginning, and even more so when the psychological elements start dripping in and the dad questions his sanity as he discovers more about the suit, but every once in a while someone will pop up behind someone else and the music will be LOUD for a second as if it's supposed to scare us. No, it doesn't work like that. All the good build up in the first two acts are dampened by these cheap scares - they give no time for tension to build before throwing another one at you, and it's just annoying after the first couple of times. The dialogue doesn't help either. Neither does the acting. Peter Stormare is great as usual but he doesn't get that much screen time. It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of kids in this movie and kid actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland kid trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland kids.The clown itself does not disappoint. It does look genuinely creepy, and the costume and make-up are very well done, but sadly that doesn't make up for a bad script and poor direction. It just has no style. It's really by-the-numbers horror with an Eli Roth tinge. The worst part is, it isn't even scary. If you're a fan of Eli Roth then you might get some enjoyment from this, but if you aren't a horror fanatic then don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable cheesy fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Clown! A complete surprise for me, came out of nowhere, when I was the poster I was expecting nothing but a class C kind of horror, but boy was I wrong!What makes it so much fun? The transformation itself is simple and brilliant! They take their time but they make sure to always keep you interested, waiting to see what happens next, how things will evolve and so on. Clown is a natural movie, they didn't bother into too much gore, nor nudity, but instead they actually focused on the story. And I have to say, it was a good one, effective and sometimes haunting!It is a sure thing that most horror fans out there will dig this on for sure. Without saying too much about it, if you liked movies like Rare exports or Sint, this one you'll enjoy even more because in my opinion, it is better! Clown, simple and effective!Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well I enjoyed this messed up movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never again would I look at Clowns in the same way after seeing this movie but that get's me thinking, when did I like them in the first place.The story to Clown is about a father discovers the clown suit and decides to wear it for his son's birthday party. However, he soon discovers that the suit turns the wearer into a killing machine.Clowns never scared me because I always know it's somebody else in cheap looking make-up trying to make you laugh but really they creeping us out. I have seen many movies and TV shows with scary looking clowns in it and yes I can see why people are scared of them but they never took a big effect on me, until I sawed this and for now on I will stay far way from clowns if possible.You can hate or like the film Clown if your a horror fan or not, for me I like my horror movies best served cold and freaky, and Clown to me isn't a bad flick. I can see a lot of effort went into the make- up and the design of the monster clown.To those who have seen the movie did you think for a second that Eli Roth directed this movie, yes I know he stars in the movie but the movie has that style look to it that Eli Roth himself would use and I'm saying that has a positive.The acting in the movie was surprisingly pretty good from Andy Powers and Laura Allen. The directing as well was pretty good from other horror movies today. Normally I don't like over the top gore in movies as I think it's a cheap way to get 18 rating or if your American Rated R, and to be honest I didn't get that in this movie for most of the time you don't really see much of guts flying everywhere but most of the after math of what happened.For problems with the movie I have some like: The characters in the movie are mostly forgettable and I'm not talking about Laura Allen or Andy Powers characters, I mean the other supporting or the background characters that always seem to get screen time which they shouldn't because they stupid and dull to watch.The movie dose have some clichés that really stick out and I thought we are already pass some of the clichés when it comes to horror movies today, but luckily after a while the movie forgotten the clichés as it went on. Oh remember when I said some of the acting was good well the kid actor was a bit noticeable that he's trying to be scared but I didn't buy it not for one bit.Besides that Clown overall isn't a bad flick, now some people may not agree with me and that's fine you got a opinion and that's awesome I'm not going to be like those dick heads that start yelling at you for nothing. Well I enjoyed this messed up movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good splatter body horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated this movie only six out of ten due to the too linear and predictable plot, but it would deserve more than that. Everything starts when the main character finds a clown costume and wears it for his son's birthday party. The troubles begin when he tries to take it off. The wig has become his own hair and the cloth seems glued onto his skin. After a while he discovers that that's not a costume but the hair and the skin of an ancient child-eater demon which has already started to permeate his body and his soul. *SPOILER* He obviously starts killing and eating several kids before he gets stopped by his own wife while she tries to save their child who was about to be eaten by his father-demon-clown. *END SPOILER* The good thing about this movie is that it manages to create an anxious atmosphere and it makes you feel afraid to get your body hurt. You'll start thinking about being in something that gets stuck on you, changes and disfigures your body and your mind. There's also a lot of good old splatter scenes where you'll see half-eaten kids and regurgitated human bones. A particular note goes to the kids' playground scene, where the director manages to convert a funny and colorful place in a horrid and spectral hunting field.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing on many different levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Clown after seeing the trailer, the concept seemed pretty original and interesting and I liked what I saw. If you felt the same way, I would highly recommend that you give this film a watch. In the end it surpassed my expectations and left me feeling pretty disturbed. The acting from the leads is solid, Andy Powers especially is fantastic as Kent and carries the earlier parts of the film with a really good performance. Laura Allen is also very good as Kent's wife Meg whose journey through the film is in some ways as interesting to witness as his own. Some of the supporting cast are admittedly not fantastic, but that doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. The film is generally well-paced but suffers a little during the middle where it seems to stall, don't worry if you feel this way because it soon gets going again and when it does, it really does. Some of the scenes towards the end will stay with me for a long time. Clown is dark, disturbing, original and striking. One of the best horror films of recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HOLY CRAP!!!! BETTER HIDE THE KIDS!!!! I watched this movie not expecting much given the title. Boy my wife and I were in for a Surprise!!! This was the best Horror movie I have seen in a while. This movie went well beyond our expectations.This was a "Gutwrenching" wild ride of a true horror.I still cannot believe the carnage done to those sweet innocent kids!!! I also found the story regarding the "origin" of "The Clown" an interesting touch.The title although appropriate weakened my expectations a bit, so perhaps they should have used a better title.This movie would have given me nightmares forever if I had seen it as a kid!!!!! The acting was more than top notch, in that their reactions to the horror before them was believable on so many levels Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hurts to say ? Eli Roth is no longer a 'go-to' name for me in horror. Ouch. Go back a decade ago and I didn't think that possible. I was present when he brought Cabin Fever (2002) to Toronto and again in 2005 when he introduced his Canadian audience to Hostel. I met Eli a few times since and I think his knowledge and enthusiasm for horror is outstanding.But since 2007, Eli has focused himself more on acting (Inglorious Basterds) and producing (The Last Exorcism). Since then, the quality of the projects that bear his name on the film's one sheet has been sub-par. The Man With the Iron Fists (2012), The Last Exorcism II (2013) and The Sacrament (2013) were all throwaway entries on an ever expanding filmography. And don't even get us started on Netflix's timewaster series Hemlock Grove.So when I saw the DVD cover for Clown with Eli Roth's name above the title, it was hardly the seven letters in the actor/producer's name that had me walking out of the market with the disc under my forearm.Clown has an intriguing premise. A demon possesses a clown suit and morphs anyone who dons the outfit into killer that preys particularly, yet not exclusively, on children. Andy Powers plays Kent, the unlucky son-of-a-bitch that adorns the found garment to appease his son Jack who is awaiting a cancelled clown at his backyard birthday party. But after applying the suit and make-up, Kent finds the outfit impossible to remove. He also finds an increasing appetite that is appeased when a child is devoured while straying from his campgrounds.Kent attempts to remove himself from his family life and seclude himself to where he may be a lesser threat to those around him. But as the demon begins to take hold, Kent's cravings for violence extended outside his given will and even the help of someone who has history with the suit, Karlsson played by the always reliable Peter Stormare, might not be enough to help stop the demon's rampage on the youth of his stalked community.I was intrigued by the idea behind Christopher D. Ford and Jon Watts' screenplay and the idea did feel fresh and at times inspired. Jon Watts does double duty behind the camera and executes the fine line of dealing with a serial killer of children with diplomacy. But it's the diplomacy that grounds the film from really taking flight. Unfortunately, the kills are largely off-screen with only the bloody after affects represented after the deed is completed. I am sure this was done to keep censors edit happy but if the gore was to match say, Eli Roth's Hostel II, in this format, we might be talking about Clown being the horror movie to see if 2015. A particular chapter where our morphing demon ends up at a ChuckeCheese was a particular waste of a fantastic opportunity to showcase unmuted violence in an extraordinary setting.Still, Clown was an above average horror film for its ilk. It follows some of the horror film handbook 'To Do's' that are as aggravating as they are accepted, but there is enough freshness and commitment to the overall goal to keep Clown's head above the recommendation waters.And now back to Mr. Roth. Although Clown is hardly Silence of the Lambs it does provide a definite upswing on the Roth career chart that was beginning to resemble my investments circa 2009. Let's hope the momentum continues and I can update the first sentence of this review in short time.www.killerreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Spoiler alerts here! This movie was a good horror movie and playing on a character that a lot of people have phobias about makes it that much better. At the start, I was honestly feeling a cheesy, B movie type with a possible special appearance by the Dwight Johnson or Dolph Lundren :) The gore in the movie was top shelf and watching it with my wife and daughter (who are both scared of clowns) made it that much better and they absolutely loved it! And my daughter still slept in her own bed. I honestly don't know if there has been a horror movie with the main character of a clown that has been this good in the last 5-10 years, if I'm wrong please let me know of such movie. It was awesome how the story jumped feet first into the plot. Would love to see a prequel if it's done right .....Loved the gore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory grim clown horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The perfect dad dons on a clown costume which he discovers only to find that he is unable to take if off with terrible consequences.Relative unknown TV actor Andy Powers is excellent as the lovable dad who becomes a killer clown. With lots of welcomed grim exposition, it has horrifying background to the clown legend and costume. It's explained convincingly by Karlsson played by Peter Stormare, the brother of the deceased previous owner of the costume. Eerie from the outset Jon Watts and Christopher D. Fordit's screenplay is played as a straight bloody horror thriller with touch of dark humour. Never before has a children's ball pool or the tunnels of a play area been so scary. What sounds like a B film with its outrageous crazy concept actually works in this modest budget production that has Eli Roth on board as producer. It goes from one gloomy odd set up to the next giving it a dream like surreal quality and it gets graphic as Kent tries to remove his costume, goes on a killing spree and begins to regurgitate body parts.Despite Roth's involvement it's very much director Jon Watts film who offers creepy, slicing, gore, demons and clown creatures with some interesting shots, even a bird's eye view car crash feels different from the standard affair put on screen. All the cast are effective right down to the child actors and Laura Allen is great as Meg, the protective mother fighting for survival.Taking a leaf from IT's tale and channelling Pennywise clown it's also has the psychological element of Magic and is reminiscent of in places of recent Stitches and American Horror Story Freak Show to name a few. That said, it stands on its own two feet with plenty of original ideas. To Watt's and team credit the effects are outstanding, including and not limited to dismemberment, amputation and Kent becoming a child eating clown.Clown is a fast paced solid grim possession horror with a splatter/slasher element that never takes it eye off the story. It's probably the definitive clown horror and naturally those suffering from coulrophobia should avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Ride and Twist to the Clown Genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie last night. I'm a sucker for a good clown movie, I'm always searching for something that tops Penny Wise, which scared the crap out of me back in 1990.I will start out with I LOVED THIS movie. It doesn't top penny wise but it puts a good twist to the clown genre. It comes in at close 2nd place! The movie starts out fast, you get to grab all the details up front within the 1st 10 minutes. It actually gets pretty funny after right wards then it gets real from there on out. It does have 2 slow spots, it rolls pretty fast. The clown looks awesome! you get to see it develop throughout the movie, which is a nice slow burn. Its just not like BAM here it is... its a slow progression. It doesn't look like Bozo the Clown with blood, it looks like a real monster, which was awesome! I've read a lot of reviews on how parts of the movie are not realistic. I could see 2 parts, but you know, its a fictional movie.This does have a feel of a fast paced Sci-Fi channel movie in the beginning, but then it starts to rev up into a real movie.The ending is really predictable, but its a good ending, its not confusing, it ends on a good note. After you watch that movie, your clown phobia will def take new heights.If you want a good scare, with a few laughs, this is it for you. I watched it on a big screen, Oppo blue ray, with a nice surround sound. Oh man! it was great!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining clown slasher...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as clown slasher go, I rarely see any true effort put into them - especially these days. "Clown" is actually a pretty refreshing entry in the genre - being clearly of modest budget, yet still managing to come across as a professional looking flick with an unusually likable cast of characters, a reasonably memorable villain! There's also a few decent and relatively gory deaths, cleverly themed after traditional clown tricks.The gore level in this movie is extremely high. Every kill is based upon a trick that a clown but all with the intention of making your skin crawl. It won't be to every one's taste, as limbs are literally ripped from bodies, heads kicked of.think that most will enjoy this movie knowing ahead of time that it's a gory slasher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being the source of many childhood fears, there's a surprising dearth of solid killer-clown movies (I can think of "It" and "Clownhouse," and that's about it). I was curious to see what a modern horror movie would do with the concept and came away satisfied with this little shocker, which uses the clown concept sparingly throughout and thankfully keeps clown-related humor to a minimum. Instead it concentrates on developing its central characters more than is usually expected in these films, as well as exploring the origin of clowning and how it pertains back to the film's story. There's a lot of exposition needed to further the plot but the filmmakers never lose track that the audience would rather be shown something instead of being told, so the film manages to establish and sustain a sense of dread and inevitability throughout. A surprisingly solid slasher that could easily become a franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a boring, typical horror movie, instead I was really surprised, in a good way, by this film. The script is not that bad,pretty original, and it keeps you wanting to see more, to see how it will end. The acting is good, great performance from the main actors. Better than the score, I saw a lot of worst horror movie this last year. It was fun and worth watching. Not a masterpiece but highly enjoyable. I was thinking oh, no, another clown horror movie, but actually is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. Highly underrated on IMDb, I recommend you to watch it, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected, despite how silly it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit more entertained by this one than I expected. I guess it's due, mainly, to the fact that it takes the concept of demon clown transformations completely serious. Does that mean it's GOOD? Nah, not really. But a killer clown flick not being totally played for laughs isn't too common. Plus, you thrown in a handful of splattery kid murders and, hell, I'll accept whatever ridiculous clown lore bullsh*t you can toss my way.A guy fills in as a last minute clown for his kids birthday party, wearing an old clown suit he found at a dead dude's house. The next day, panic begins setting in when he finds it virtually impossible to remove the articles of his clown ensemble (rainbow wig, red nose, makeup, suit...) as they have adhered, seemingly permanently, to his body. He seeks the help of the former owner of the costume who explains that the only way to intercept the demonic metamorphosis that is taking place is to either decapitate him or feed him the proper number of children..."Clown" offers up a fairly unique (though seemingly unintentionally goofy...) 'body horror' premise that contains a nice amount of practical effects - many of which are pretty decent - and the cr?me de la cr?me: a bloodbath at Chuck E. Cheese! I must say, the kid killing in this one is on par with another psycho clown film, "Sloppy the Psychotic".So, while I can't say "Clown" is anything all that groundbreaking, but I'll give it props for keeping with a more serious 'tone' in the midst of horror-comedies being the familiar go-to these days - even through all of the silliness and retarded 'clown mythos' - and for having the balls to slaughter little kids. I'm being generous, here, but I'm giving it a moderate rec. Also check out "Stitches" if you dig f*cked up clowns.More of my reviews @ http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2014 has been a pretty week year for horror movies..until clown! This movie has it all! Great effects, acting, story, makeup, unintentional humor, and most of all, its scary! Most horror movies people act pretty stupid, in clown they act believable. The thought of unable to take off a costume is scary. Its unclear if he can go to the bathroom, but we hear his stomach grumbling quite a bit.Its hilarious when Stormware's character says "Oh sh--!" b/c the clown is waking up from being drugged too quickly. The death of the pet dog is a great effect as well as scary. The effects of the Father turning into a clown are great. All the actors did a great job.I'm not sure why this didn't get a wide release at the theaters. Maybe because its very dark. But if your into scary, dark horror movies then sit back and enjoy. A movie like this has been long overdue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched clown last night and it's haunted my thoughts all day! I just came across the film by accident and when I seen it was an Eli Roth movie I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. I actually think that I held my breath for over an hour, and when it finished - I wasn't able to fall asleep. The story is about a dad who puts on an old creepy clown outfit for his sons birthday party. He realizes after that it won't come of, and tries desperately to cut into it (slashing his own wrist). His wife tries to help and ends up ripping his red nose right of his face. I think this is when I started to feel uncomfortable. He starts to transform.. Into an evil clown. The effects are great and I really like how the story started straight away - he literally puts the outfit on during the first two minutes of the film and things just keep getting darker. As the clown outfit becomes more restricting and you find out it's actually turning him into a demon... Who likes to eat children. At certain points in the movie his wife tries to help and save him. There's also a great bit when he decides to cut his own head off, but things don't go to plan. The character really does become creepy and sinister. You don't normally see little people getting so gruesomely murdered in a movie. It was very well done and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this great horror slasher movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest horror film from producer Eli Roth, who also has a cameo appearance playing, you guessed it, a clown. CLOWN is a film almost entirely bereft of ideas and originality. The whole storyline is that a guy transforms into a demonic clown. The problem with this is that it's just not significant or involved enough to sustain a feature length film, which is why it worked much better when I saw exactly the same storyline in one of the stories in anthology horror film SCARY OR DIE.CLOWN has a low budget, grungy look and the lack of money is often apparent. The lead actor, Andy Powers, contributes a passable performance, but his character is never for a moment likable or interesting outside of his affliction. The reliable Peter Stormare (FARGO) is much better but limited in support. There are thematic links to the likes of THE FLY, but for the most part this is just an excuse for the infliction of pain in lots of mild gore scenes. Sure, there's the odd imaginative idea here and there - I love the rainbow brain splatter - but they're lost in a mire of inanity and sub-par film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had the baron of blood, Eli Roth, decided to helm Jon Watts' inferior 'It' project, then we could have had eyeballs gauged out in fear, fingernails cracked, and many a bodily 'oops' while our arses dropped to the sticky cinema floor. Sadly, nothing that terrifying ever crosses our screen. However a commendable job by Roth to slap his portrayal of 'Frowny' on the 'Clowns to Make You Sh*t the Bed' wall of fame, but no praise can be bestowed upon Peter Stormare's useless yet 'horror movie correct'character, nor the emotionally detached log, being Kent/Frowny 's wife Meg (Laura Allen emitted no care for her on-screen husband and neither did I). Watts clearly had no idea at what pace he wanted to obtain around Kent's transformation (Suddenly... The costumes stuck! - He's had that bulbous nose for a month now - A hobgoblin appears)combined with miscasting and concerning reality checks (who could possibly sleep wearing a full clown costume?, nose and all!)diverted Clown off its hoped for path of extreme 'Roth' gore and that one scene where Frowny visits the strippers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grim &amp; Bloody Horror Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haerd about this film a while back &amp; have been looking forward to it ever since it's release. The film has a pretty basic setup. A loving father Kent finds an old clown outfit in the attic to substitute for a clown that is doubled booked &amp; had to cancel! The party goes down well with Kent as the clown replacement. But after waking up the next day, he finds he can't take off the suit &amp; tries fanatically to cut, slice &amp; rip off the outfit to no avail. His wife Meg tries to help him as he runs away &amp; tries to figure a way to get the suit off. She eventually finds &amp; tries to help him but he escapes!The film goes at rapid pace from drops of blood to buckets as Kent begins to change into a blood thirsty child killing demon! Which in the middle of the film, by Karlson is explained that the suit is skin &amp; hair of an ancient demon that kills children!The back story of the film was interesting &amp; fitted in well! Unlike others which have a back-story that's just "Thrown In" &amp; makes no sense! The blood was top notch &amp; didn't fail to amuse! The theme of the film it'self was dark &amp; gloomy! Which I felt really added to what was going on!You really do begin to feel sorry for Kent as things go from bad to worse in seconds! But after a failed suicide attempt (which involved him accidentally killing a prying child) he eventually gives in to the demon &amp; devours the him! Grim as F**k!The scene in the play area was well done! Again grim &amp; dark!However the ending I wasn't entirely bought by! I mean it ended well but Meg had to kill her husband who was possessed by the demon! She wasn't the one bit sadden &amp; sorry for doing this! It seemed like a difficult decision, sacrifice her son &amp; her husband will be free or kill her husband &amp; let her son live! But why couldn't she just find a random kid to sacrifice to the demon clown? The ending would've been better had this been the case! Overall the film is pretty good! Gory, dark &amp; grim in so many levels! Though the ending wasn't exactly a great one, the film as a whole is pretty intense! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Effective Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be put off by the seemingly ludicrous storyline, what starts off as looking like a comedy/horror cornball piece, actually develops in to a rather good horror movie. I was apprehensive when first watching this, it could have gone either way, and 15 or so minutes in I was thinking, "This is gonna be dumb!" But surprise surprise, it takes some very dark turns and becomes a very enjoyable out and out horror storyI don't think I'm giving too much away by saying (This all happens in the first 10 or so minutes) Son loves clowns, Father running late for birthday party. Clown booked for party cancels at last minute. Wife calls the Father. Father working in old house and finds trunk with old clown costume and decides to step in.One of the things that makes this film, apart from the on the nose acting, is the clown costume itself. It's not bright and garish, a la Stephen Kings Pennywise, but understated. There is some humour, used to good effect towards the start of the film, but not too much and it never falls into the trap of relying on the humour, which would have been so easy with a clown based horror film.Despite initial apprehensions, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it's one of those goodies that catches you by surprise every so often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it an absolutely disgusting notion that I liked a movie about a clown who eats children?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Jon Watts made a little low-budget drama called "Cop Car" which received fair reviews from critics. "Clown" was his other film; a film universally panned by critics as something akin to hot garbage and produced by Quentin Tarantino's forgotten stepchild, Eli Roth. That said, is it an absolutely disgusting notion that I liked a movie about a clown who eats children? Synopsis: A man finds an old clown costume and wears it for his son's birthday party. In the morning he can't seem to get it off. And when he tries, things get bloody. Layered atop this plot line is a really creepy eastern European clown origins story, which is actually more frightening than most monster movie horror origin stories."Clown" isn't without flaws (shocking, I know). Basically everything Roth touches tries to be funny and just isn't. And much like many B-movie horrors, this film suffers from a reaction problem from the people being perused by the titular monster (in this case, the reactions from friends and family are curiously calm) but that can be attributed to the level of actor used in this.On the plus side for novice horror fans, much of the violence here is not as gratuitous as I would've imagined (as far as violence towards children is concerned) but more importantly, every kill is extremely well choreographed; not overly campy or silly, even with visible budgetary constraints. In fact the direction is the best aspect of this film by far, really elevating the more unbalanced and underwhelming melodramatic material in the 2nd Act into something visually disturbing and half-way scary.Final Thought: Not going to lie, there were some quite disturbing and morbid sequences involving suicide (the best filmed suicide of 2016) and child consumption, which I rather enjoyed. But all that is an acquired taste.</fullReview>

Well 1 maybe or 2 or even 3 it was disgusting more than scary I don't recommend this movie to anyone that's in love with horror movies like me! I am a 13 years old and this movie wasn't even that scary!! I gave it a 6 because the graphics was good, the actors, and the clown looked great. It would be a really great movie if they added more horror clips! So what more do I have to say..? Oh ya if you are really scared watching horror movies and it will be your first time well.. You can watch this one.. But if you really like horror movies you can watch the grudge!! Its really scary!! I watched it when I was like grade 4 or maybe 5 with my cosines and it was way too scary LMAO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me with a lot of changed concepts of "clowns".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Some spoilers are added to my review!** I never knew the origin of clowns and was wondering if there is any actual fact to the version this movie states? Overall it was a very good gore flick and the premise was great. I have never been a fan of clowns and although I do know they are just make-up and ridiculous costumes, they still gave me an uneasy feeling. Now my whole concept has changed and I for one find clowns a thing to look at with more of a "pondering" thought of what is under their whole premise. I did however especially like the comic way in which the suit is trying to be removed. It began as comical and slowly moved to terror for the wife and son. Like others have said, the transformation from a subtle dad in a clown suit to the final version was very good. Slow and constant. It did keep me awaiting what was to be next. The special effects were very well done and obviously a lot of time went into the end results. Throughout the whole movie I was held firm to my screen. A very good horror/gore film. It may have been a "B" type movie, but it definitely surpassed this in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst Horror film associated with Eli Roth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would preface I had just watched Cabin Fever (2016) reboot. Albeit it was not directed by Roth, just written, his name was plastered ALL over it--- and that was a baaaaaaaad movie. I choose to watch this film over great deliberation, and I'm glad I did. In saying that, this film was actually pretty decent. It was sort of dumb near the middle and towards the end, but I kind of expected that going into a clown-horror film. The way the film was setup as well as the character(s) background(s) was very believable. I could care less what would have happened to the wife, but she sort of rounded out the story and made you care about Kent (main character). There were many horror elements throughout the film, but I wish there was a little less blood in some of the scenes. Not that many jump- scares. That horrifying moment "the cure" was realized/discovered was pretty wicked. I don't know, I thought the film was really original and really stepped up the horror genre, it was pretty good in that aspect. Some of the dynamics of the film sort of contorted and didn't make sense near the end, but in all the film didn't disappoint. It was entertaining, much like a clown. I will say though that old man was pretty bad ass. Honestly I love the old man vs. horrible monster (or just external battle) trope. Best. Thing. Ever. Reminded me of The Strain (sort of). Just seeing an old man wield a meat cleaver is pretty awesome for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clown has a solid concept, and initially, it would appear as though it is following through with it; unfortunately, about halfway through the film disappointment kicks in.I was expecting something along the lines of Contracted (which if you haven't seen, you should consider instead of Clown). What Clown delivered was a good idea supported by a decent beginning rounded out with a campy B-horror second act that ruined what could have been a solid film.Don't bother. Eli Roth's name has lost the star power it once had around 2007. Clown has its entertaining moments, but in the end it misses the mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ClownImagine that you put on this clown outfit, and then it never came off. Not only that but it slowly turned you into a demon. Oh yeah and, you no longer want food, but instead you feast on children. Premise for horror movie, check.The problem is that this film fails to deliver scares. That being said I'm not personally afraid of clowns but I can imagine that this film might scare those who are. A majority of the film is gross-out, Stephen King's least favorite type of horror. This is partly due to Eli Roth.Jon Watts did a wonderful time directing the film for his first time. Not to mention that he's also slated to direct Spider-Man: Homecoming. He also co-wrote the movie which like many Eli Roth films has great character development.Andy Powers plays Kent, the husband, turn clown, turn clown-demon. He plays a realistic approach to what lengths anyone would go to to prevent all of these horrible things from happening to you. Laura Allen plays Meg, the wife and mother who has a small arc but isn't truly used in the film till the late second and third act. Some might see the lack of her use in the first act as a flaw but I see it as focusing on developing the Clown character. Which was needed.Peter Stormare, Gaear Grimsrud from Fargo, plays Karlsson in a storytelling role that I wont spoil for you. His first impression is hard to forget and I'll leave it at that. He's by far the best and most talented actor on the set.Verdict: Not scary, but a good story. I suppose that counts for something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Interesting Ideas But a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clown (2014) ** (out of 4) Kent (Andy Powers) is a real estate agent who receives a call from his wife Meg (Laura Allen). She tells him that the clown that was supposed to appear at their child's birthday party has backed out. As luck would have it Kent finds a clown outfit and puts it on. He eventually shows up to the party and saves the day but the next morning he realizes he can't get the costume off. Soon he begins to realize a deadly secret with the costume.CLOWN ended up getting released overseas long before it was shown in America and it's easy to see why it didn't get too much attention here. There are some smart ideas in the movie and I'd argue that there were some effective moments but sadly the film is way too uneven to work. It's really too bad because I think a few changes and we could have had something much better.The biggest problem I had with CLOWN is that it played too safe. The film could have worked as a dark comedy with this killer clown going around eating children. The eating children is something in the film so don't think I'm just making that part up. If they didn't want a dark comedy they could have turned this into an extremely dark and sinister movie. Neither of those approaches were done and instead the film plays it safe by staying somewhere in the middle. There are a few comic winks at the viewer during the start of the film with the more graphic stuff following.The graphic stuff does include the killing of children but this here is play safe with that type of thing kept off screen. I really wish director Jon Watts had given this a more European feel and made it go for more shock value. I thought Powers was good in his role as the father and Allen was also extremely good in her part. It's just too bad more wasn't done here because the idea of a clown outfit that has a connection to a demon is a good idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, very unsettling and disturbing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'CLOWN': Four Stars (Out of Five)An indie supernatural horror flick, co-produced by Eli Roth. The film was written by Christopher D. Ford and directed by Jon Watts (the duo also teamed together on last year's 'COP CAR'). It stars Laura Allen, Andy Powers, Christian Distefano and Peter Stormare. The movie tells the story of a man that puts on an ancient clown costume, for his kid's birthday party, and then can't take it off. He becomes possessed by it, and starts having sinister urges. The film is based on a fake YouTube trailer, that Watts and Ford put online (in 2010). In the trailer, they claimed that Eli Roth was producing their movie (even though he wasn't involved with it yet). Roth was so impressed by this, he decided to co-produce the film! I really enjoyed it. Kent McCoy (Powers), and his wife Meg (Allen), are hosting a birthday party for their son Jack (Distefano). The clown that's supposed to show up, for the party, can't make it. Kent, in desperation, puts on an old clown costume, that he finds in the basement of a house he's selling. He then goes to the party, in the professional clown's place. Kent's a hit with the kids there, including his son. Then he falls asleep, while he's still wearing the clown costume, after the party's over. The next day Kent can't take the costume off, and strange (nightmarish) things begin happening. The movie is creepy, very unsettling and disturbing. It's also really funny, in a very darkly comedic way, and Peter Stormare is classic in his role. The special effects are impressive, and the directing is more than adequate. The film's concept is also brilliant, and I can definitely see it becoming a popular franchise; with many sequels to come (deservingly so). The only real complaint, I have with the movie, is it's pacing; it could have been trimmed down (at least a little). Other than that, it's a pretty entertaining 'fright flick' experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8E1WKbyL3YM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK horror movie, Not scary but creepy and pretty messed up altogether.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world's greatest dad does not want to disappoint his kid on his birthday, so when the b-day clown cancels, he goes through the closets of a home whose owner just past and finds a clown costume to wear. Only now he can't take it off.The movie kind of reminds me of Kevin Smith's Tusk (not as good, however). It's the same odd disturb feeling. This guy has to live his life in a clown costume. It's seems funny at first with his fellow co workers laughing at him and his father-in-law now having the best visual reason as to why he's not good enough for his little girl, but then you don't know how to feel as he attempts to take it off and the only thing that's happening is that he's hurting himself. Than it takes a turn for the more disturbing with this whole back story how evil real clowns are and what it will take to get out of the costume, and how far this clown's wife will go to get him out. It does mess with your head.Eli Roth produced or executive produced the move and it does have his style all over it. Clown, tends to poke fun at the cheesy horror clichés, almost banging us over the head with the Stereotypes and Archetypes of the horror genre, but I have to admit those moments do make the movie more fun during slow paces when you realized that some one made a feature length movie about a guy stuck in a clown suit.It's not scary, but a little distributing, and it works just enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth that makes you feel that you did not waste your time watching it</fullReview>

A movie that showed a similar horror twist to the genesis of Santa Claus. In the same year, "SINT" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167675) had is appearance and tels the "true" horror story of Sinterklaas. You might even say "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" fits into this collection.

		<shortDescription>A Very Nice Attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, too, had seen many advertisements about this film and never thought it would be released. I caught it the other night on On- Demand. I was not disappointed...well, not too much.The film tells the story of a family devoted father who has called and "rented" a clown for his son's birthday. Unfortunately, the agency has had a mix-up and Kent and Meg think their son will be hugely disappointed. The father (Kent) finds and dons a clown suit, and it looks as though the birthday celebration will be saved. Are they in for a surprise. You see, Kent did not actually find a clown "suit." What he found, as we later learn, is the actual skin and hair of a horrible demon; a demon whose appetite can only be satiated by eating children.I liked "Clown." However, with just a few minor tweaks, it could have been one of the scariest films released in a long time. Instead, the first part of the movie seemed very slow to me. I also did not understand why suddenly everybody turned on Kent. It seemed the father-in-law despised him, for reasons never explained. Once Kent's actual transformation finishes, this is a ghoulishly dark film.Rated "R" for horror gore and violence, please take this little warning to heed: "Clown" is NOT for children. Some images and the demon frightened ME. So, please parents, if you choose to let your children watch, I suggest you at least watch with them. More of a 6.5 movie than a 6. A very decent try.</fullReview>

And I have to admit, I never thought I'd like the movie the way I did. I thought it'd be just another slasher and wasn't really expecting something that takes its time to explain the plot and is actually suspenseful and keeps the tension from start to finish.The acting is more than decent and one bad decision is the starting point of it all. Though who'd have thunk it, except for the viewer, that one should not just put on things. Especially when you have a time and money issue. So everything is well thought of, even if the movie is kind of off. And it is mean and violent too, so nothing for the faint of hearted, even if the drama at the beginning might suggest otherwise ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Eli Roth's movies (Hostel, Green Inferno) I was expecting good things and I wasn't disappointed. Okay a killer clown who prayed on children isn't original but the scripting was good and the lead cast had great roles and good acting.Clown is based on a family realtor father Kent, his wife Meg and their young son Jack whos just about to 7.The movie starts with Jacks birthday his celebrating his 7th and is obsessed with clowns. They hired a clown entertainer but unfortunately he was double booked. Looking like the party will be cancelled Kent found a clown costume in one of the homes he is trying to sell an wears it.Straight after the party he doesn't take it off, its when hes trying to go to work the next day it doesn't want to come off. Struggling he still attends his job and uses tools on site but to no help in taking it off. Getting frustrated his wife uses her dentist tools to pull the nose of leaving a huge sore.No one believing Kents worries he goes to the house and tries to track own the previous owners. He comes across a man called Karlsson who insists he doesn't touch the outfit, but telling him what he has done they meet immediately.We find out the clown many many years ago was a murderer of children who feasted on them over the winter. Karlsson tries to kill him as the demon already has taking over but fails. Kent now fully taken over is causing chaos around the town and parents are running scared over their children.Out of all the horrors released in 2014 this is one of the better ones should of been rated a lot more than some of the over hyped media ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On and off again this threatens to become a film where a deranged clown plows through the neighborhood, the story certainly has that 80s horror ring; someone has put on a demonic clown suit that he can't take off. But it never really becomes that film.Which makes the middle point where he's slowly being dehumanized while we run around for a lot of plotting about where he is and can he be saved in time a drag of thankless seriousness. Maybe this is me, but this seems to promise demented gleefulness the kind of which a horror fan turned filmmaker is likely to do, muddles the promise with what on paper may have seemed like "drama" that would add "depth", then rushes through a few scenes in the end, reminding of what it never really did.Oh there is a gnarly monster, blood that gushes in a couple spots but it's not really driven by the kind of energy that would whip it all up into more than a story. Truth be told, I can never muster enthusiasm for horror that is scripted along to be "coherent"; at some point you have to let go and make it happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't too many clown films but this ranks as one of the finest in that subgenre. It has a really original and interesting take on terror origin of the clown and makes it something entertainingly creepy to watch. The storyline is well executed and follows the other trends that make Eli Roth films great fun to watch as a horror fan. There's plenty of gore and twisted violence, but it's always managed to be incorporated into a context that adds rather than just distracts from the plot in some way. There's enough films out there that offer nothing but violence in place of a storyline, and this one manages to harness violence in a very creepy and effective way towards the tone of the film.As horror films go, this is one of the most memorable that I've seen in a long, long time and as I write this I am unable to think of any other recent horror titles that were as memorable as this, in terms of the overall scare factor and anyone that manages to somehow find an original take on anything in the horror genre deserves points.I saw this film about a month or so ago and as I've only just signed up to IMDb felt that this should be one of my first recommendations as it really has stayed with me and I've recommended it already to plenty of people via word of mouth.If you hate clowns, this film will do bad things to you But if you love horror then get all over this! It's amazing and since seeing it I've been checking out other works from the director and am loving them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the loin of Cloine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eli Roth presents an intimate trip to coulrophobia-ville in the wackiest of fashions - fashion being the key word in that an accursed clown costume morphs its host into the parabolic Nordic demon 'Cloine', renown for chowing down on a child-per-period of a wintry season. It's ingredients: a classically Cronenbergian concept come carnivalesque, add two stock cubes of 'An American Werewolf in London", the "Insidious" voracity of King's Pennywise in 'It', combined with a foolhardy idea from the second series of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Halloween' (a conjectural plucking from the 'Whedonverse"), whereby characters meld with the attributes of their stereotypical trick or treating attire subject to some eerie, nineties voodoo-hoodoo. Voila, pastiche ala peckish, peccable, polar-paediatric Dummo the 'Clown'. This lacing of intertextuality and emulation might sound a sleight of hypocritical, yet it actually works in the films favour in creating a spicy referential humour to a narrative that was - without a doubt - never going to work otherwise. It is, after all, about a man's absurdly ill-fated transmogrification into a demonic clown.Embarking en-route to a subtle humour to partner such an imaginatively offbeat yet lucrative body-horror hypothesis, 'Clown' relegates gesticulative puns to a minimum by abstracting normative routines and functions in insinuating a farcical (though realistically pragmatic) depiction of 'clownification'. Simple tasks such as having a shower, going on a school run or going to work in clown attire are worked into the feature to provide an outlet to snicker at the audacity of the concept itself, and acts as a realisation made by the filmmakers that humour is a welcome prerequisite to accompany such preposterous notion. Watching our clown-contaminated protagonist tackle his stuck-fast red nose, reappearing make-up and transmuting wig (to actual perms of hair) boils up a recoiling deadpan comedy none the more summated by Dummo's botched suicide attempts in forestalling the cometh of the cacodemon. Rambunctious chuckles in cahoots to a grimace, the rainbow coloured blood spatter that proceeds a gunshot through the mouth - and a trip to the local hardware store to build a self-decapitation machine - is indicative of a harmonious equilibrium made between horror and humour.Entrenched from the off to progress with the plot rather than loitering a slow-burning build for character development, perhaps the narrative rushes into causal linearity too quickly as most of the protagonist's brood are rendered depthlessly lean and subsidiary (or less) to the macro and could have helped in filling a few plot potholes. Nevertheless, the barmy 'Clown' posits an original concept within a parodic wrapper and entertains throughout - even if it is a tad 'The Fly' off the wall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer it interested me, but didn't clue me in on what a great story this film actually has. As far as I know, this is a film with an original story. I won't ruin anything of course, it's better to find out for yourself.One of the best parts about this film is that there is no slow beginning, or slow anything to be honest, it starts pretty much as soon as you begin watching it. As the film progresses the story line begins to unfold, presenting a new tale unlike anything I have ever seen. I was fascinated by it and was enjoying a lot of what I was seeing.It had it's cliché moments, which everyone expects in a horror film so it's not a bad thing, however it doesn't offer anything new except a great story line. Sometimes it felt a little cheesy, but only close to the beginning. There were several scenes that made me uncomfortable, but I was never disturbed or scared unfortunately.It is a one-of-a-kind film and I highly recommend it to anyone. It is mediocre, only in the way that it doesn't offer anything new in the horror field. Typical gore, violence and mild humor. I would have given it a six if it wasn't for that reason. All in all it's a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky little horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been watching Eli Roth's horror offerings ever since he grossed the world out with 'Hostel.' Granted most of his work post that little gem have been a little below par, but I still have hopes that he'll return to form. I wouldn't say 'Clown' is exactly memorable or a classic in its genre, but at least it's a step in the right direction.The clown due to entertain at a child's birthday party lets the family down. Luckily, the dad has access to a home up for sale and all of its contents. There, he finds an old clown suit and puts it on in order to entertain the kids. This is all well and good... until he finds that he can't actually take the thing off.Most people would say that it's a pretty horrific prospect in itself to be stuck in a grubby old clown's suit for the rest of your life. However, what's really bad, is that it starts affecting his mood... with murderous consequences.Normally, there's already some ancient monster running around, so it does make a bit of a change to see a loving father slowly changes into the monster in question.The acting is pretty standard all round ? nothing special, but nothing bad either. Plus there is a kid in the film. Kids can be hard to watch at the best of times, let alone in a low budget horror. I'm pleased to say that here the boy is tolerable enough not to spoil the entire film. There is some gore, but not much - don't expect a major 'gore fest'. The 'horror' of the film is in the make-up ? which is pretty nasty during the final act.'Clown' is nothing special, but, if you're a fan of the horror genre, it's certainly watchable and different enough to raise itself ? ever so slightly ? above the piles of forgettable films in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Send in the cloyne.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the entertainer at Jack's birthday party cancels at the last minute, his loving father Kent (Andy Powers) steps up to the plate to play Dummo the Clown, putting on the costume he finds in the basement of one of his properties. But after the party is over, Kent discovers to his horror that he cannot take the costume off: the wig, nose and hair are stuck fast. Tracing the original owner of the costume, Kent learns the terrifying truth: the clown outfit is made from the hair and skin of a Scandinavian demon that is slowly taking control of his body.This is not the first horror film to exploit 'coulrophobia'?the fear of clowns?but it is the first one (to my knowledge) to try and create a mythology that explains exactly why the colourful circus performers might give so many people the shivers. According to Clown, their origins can be traced back to Iceland, where a white-skinned, red nosed demon known as a 'cloyne' once terrorised locals, feeding on children during the winter months.This fanciful explanation for the strange phobia makes for a fair amount of demented fun, director Jon Watts delivering a film that effectively blends the disturbing with the darkly humorous, offering up a satisfying dose of gore in the process (including the gruesome demises of several minors?a cinematic taboo that is still rarely broken). There's a noticeable lull in the action towards the end of the first half, as Kent endeavours to find out more about his mysterious clown-suit, but the pace picks up again after the poor sap's unsuccessful attempts to end his ordeal by blowing his multicoloured brains out and rigging a pair of rotary saws to slice off his head: the second part of the film sees Kent paying a visit to the bully who has been pushing Jack around, stopping off at a Chuck E. Cheese to find another young snack, and eventually returning back home, where his wife Meg (Laura Allen) puts up a valiant fight to protect her son.Other fun moments include a cool decapitated dog scene, a desperate Meg offering up a trusting young girl as a sacrifice, and the tragic ending in which Kent's torment is ended via a hefty swipe with a sledgehammer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All this because they couldn't get Stitches to do the show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT Stitches Killer Klowns from Outer Space Vulgar Shakes the Clown And now Eli Roth's Clown They're creepy, fore hire, and always expressive. Clowns freak people out and these films capitalize on that experience. Eli Roth has given us a new chapter which is enjoyable. Kent puts on a clown suit to fill in for a performer who was double booked. Problem is, this clown suit is actually demon skin and it won't come off. As Kent tries cutting, sawing, and suiciding himself out of the costume, he finds that his hunger is growing and that Peter Stormare wants to decapitate him (which is better than the woodchopper). Kent's wife tries her best to understand, but by the time Kent eats his fourth kid, it's time to kick a little clown butt. The acting is mediocre, but this is a horror film from a guy who's capitalized on gore porn... so I don't think it's that big of a deal. The story is not so terrible. I like the mythology of the clown being a demon that lures kids away to eat them. The makeup progression works well and there's a couple scenes where Eli Roth shows talent for creating tension without throwing a bunch of guts and blood in your face. That doesn't mean there isn't gore, but he's actually got some skill when it comes to making a scene work. I look forward to his future movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Successful Gamble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A loving father (Andy Powers) finds a clown suit for his son's birthday party, only to realize the suit is part of an evil curse that turns its wearer into a killer (Eli Roth).When it comes to the plot of a clown suit that turns its wearer into a demon, there is a lot of room for failure. The idea is a bit cheesy, and it becomes a bit more cheesy when you add in the back story that "clown" comes from the word "cloyne", some sort of Scandinavian demon. In such films as "Rare Exports", they successfully tied Santa Claus to the Krampus, but had history on their side. Could "Clown" succeed? In short, yes. We get a fast-paced horror story, with excellent effects and more than a little gore. Some of it a little nasty (which we have come to expect from Eli Roth-connected features), but nothing so over the top that it is repulsive. And there is no cheesiness. Some very, very dark humor, perhaps (the rainbow blood is a nice touch), but this somehow managed to stay serious and actually believable.Well done, everyone. You gambled, and the gamble paid off. Hopefully this movie gets the attention it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a Nightmare Played Out On Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eli Roth's Clown is most certainly one of the most messed up movies I've seen in some time...I'm talking Meet the Feebles level messed up. The movie begins with a father putting on a clown costume for his son's birthday party because the clown they had hired was double-booked and couldn't make it...only to find the next morning that the wig had replaced his real hair, the nose was attached, and the suit was stuck to him like skin. This is only the first five to ten minutes. From there everything gets progressively worse and more bizarre. Jon Watts manages something that very few directors are capable of doing, creating movies with unpredictable outcomes. Altogether too often I can predict the specifics of what is to come by the halfway point of a movie, if not nearer the beginning. That is the curse of those who watch too many movies and television shows, and read too many books...especially those who are creatively inclined themselves. All of that goes out the window with Roth's movies themselves, so it makes sense that something he'd produce would be the same way. The most predictable one was Hostel, and that still wasn't entirely telegraphed. I won't waste my time trying to describe this story, other than to say that it is sincerely the sort of thing that can only be defined as someone's nightmare displayed on a screen...it really feels like a bad dream that you'd wake up from, only to be unable to fall asleep again out of sheer discomfort. At times it seems like it should be funny, in the same way that Cabin Fever mixed disgusting horror and humor into something spectacularly filled with black comedy, but it's really not...and that somehow strangely manages to make it funny in a sense, albeit a perverse sort of funny that is really not funny at all. I don't know if I can say I loved this movie, because I don't know if that is a possible feeling anyone would experience after seeing this...but it was terrific. I may never watch it again, but I don't think that I would need to because I will almost certainly never forget any of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What begins as wardrobe malfunction escalates into the stuff of childhood terror. Clown is no laughing matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie might just ruin someone's childhood. It transforms what could have been trivial concept into a particularly eerie showcasing of an individual's deterioration. The character development hides a few fascinating twists, they adapt to the malady with surprisingly convincing reactions. It appeals to the curiosity of audiences as they are more invested in increasingly insidious transformation of once an ordinary man.Kent (Andy Powers) is a real estate agent who finds strange clown suit on one of the houses he sells. Serendipitously or not, he needs a clown to entertain his son's birthday and takes it upon himself to don the costume. Later on he discovers that the suit is something much more sinister than he previously thought. This concept of a man becoming more disfigured physically and mentally has been done in The Fly, Clown uses the same allure quite effectively.The cinematography doesn't uses overwhelmingly terrorizing atmosphere, instead the first act is shot in simple manner. As it escalates, both visual and practical effects are becoming significantly darker. Much of the visual rests on the make-up and believable costume, the presentation of titular character is commendably persuasive. The clown could've been silly, but it retains and even enhances its creepy visage throughout the nasty phases of transformation.The actors perform proficiently as well. Andy Powers looks normal which makes his personality change more drastic. Laura Allen as Meg, his wife, is not the usual damsel-in-distress. While she finds his husband's ordeal to be perplexing, she must decide on difficult choices, Laura Allen displays the torn motherly role with powerful conviction.Clown delivers a compelling horror tale by turning an elementary subject into the stuff of children's nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tears of a clown......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little boy's birthday party gets ruined when his entertainment cancels. His father finds a clown suit and becomes the new entertainment but something doesn't seem right about it.Soon he discovers there is an evil curse and it won't come off.......I had many reservations about watching this film. Simply calling the film 'Clown', felt like a cheap shot, after all, many people have a great fear of the titular character, so it sounded as inviting as a film called 'snake', 'heights', or 'spider'.And plus, the fact that it had Eli Roths' name plastered all over it didn't do it any favours, after all, the man hasn't some anything of any relevance since Hostel.But, it's a surprisingly solid horror, solid enough to become a cult movie in years to come, and one of the best b-movie horrors in the last twenty years.Because it doesn't try to be Meta, it doesn't try to reference any other horror movies intentionally. Basically it doesn't do all that wink wink stuff to the audience that most horror films do now to try and distract the audience from the poor end product.It's just a nuts and bolt horror movie about a man who puts on a suit, and the suit begins to take over him. Now if this was Venom in Spider-Man 3, that movie would have been something.So the film is straight-forward. The first act focuses on the fear of claustrophobia, and him being unable to get the suit off. The second act focuses on change, as the suit becomes the man, the killing starts after he realises he cannot end his own life.Plus the second act features Stormare, who is basically in the film to provide the exposition and the origin of the clown. And predictably, clowns are born of evil.And then the third act is totally bonkers, the change is complete, and the film has nowhere else to go, so why not go all out bonkers?It's a fun movie, really minimal on humour, which is surprising for a film with this subject matter, and it's very dark, in the sense that children are the main focus of the Clown.Although it looks a little on the cheap side, its a surprising gem hidden in all the dirge that gets released in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smarter than most killer clown films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies have made something of a comeback in the last few years. After studios realised they'd ruined the slasher reboot into submission the space was open for some creative old fashioned spook stories like 'Babadook', new takes on the classic home invasion flick like 'You're Next' and suspenseful chase movies like the wonderful 'It Follows'. 'Clown' is a return to the transforming body horror nightmare.The plot is simple, but well told. A hardworking father fills in for a clown at his sons birthday party only to discover that the costume won't come off, worse yet, it seems to be filling his mind with bloodthirsty urges and making him spit out teeth. What follows is a slow journey as he slowly looses his mind and people around him loose their lives. The reveal of the clown suit and its horrible purpose is fairly flat, but I'll take it over any of Stephen Kings 'it was a thing from another dimension' cliché.What makes the movie actually fun and quite special is the main performance. Andy Powers feels natural as a parent, and horrifying as a monster. The scenes of him trying desperately to make a curious child get away from him feel like a dark take on someones horrifying urges. The supporting cast is also great, with the panicked wife, and surprisingly good child actors all coming in well. A lot of slow horror films tend to let themselves down on the gore, but Clown delivers on that too. Since the Clown is mostly out to eat few children you'd be forgiven for thinking it would be a cutaway film, but there's tons of well done gore effects.Whilst it never quite reaches the heights of the other films I mentioned, its a fun horror film I fully intend to see again. It's getting a bit of a beating for being even remotely connected to Eli Roth, but ignore that and enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a decent clown movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is something I have waited ages for, a decent movie about killer clowns. Ever since I was little I have been scared to death for clowns, but I still hadn't seen a decent movie about clowns. Sure, there is It, but that clown turned out to be an alien spider something, and I didn't really find it scary either. There's Stitches but I honestly thought that was a pretty bad movie. There is also this awesome clown scene in the movie Amusement, but unfortunately that was only one scene and the rest of the movie turned out horrible anyway.Here's what Clown is about: A loving father finds a clown suit for his son's birthday party, only to realize the suit is part of an evil curse that turns its killer into a killer.Clown is based on a short fan movie that was once made, and people seemed to like it so much Eli Roth decided to turn it into a movie. Oh wait, did I forget to mention Eli Roth produced Clown? I know that many people dislike Eli Roth, but honestly I don't think he's too bad. Perhaps Cabin Fever wasn't the best movie around, but I can't say I hated it. Besides, I kinda liked Hostel.The movie might have a bit of a strange concept of a suit that turns it wearer into a killer, but honestly what else might turn a human into a clown-suit wearing killer? The curse is a nice story for it I think, it's definitely a better story than the standard reason why some characters become mass-murderers. Besides, I was already very happy that there was finally a full clown movie that's actually decent and somewhat scary.You might have noticed my phrasing there when I said that it was 'decent'. It really is a decent movie, I can't say this is a incredible movie with many new ideas and insights, but it's just a nice and decent slasher. I think this is one of the few slashers in the last couple of years that actually tries to be original and actually somewhat succeeds at that, so that's already quite the head start for Clown.The make-up is done very well in this movie, at first when the plastic nose is stuck to Kent and his wife rips it off - ouch, that looked quite painful. The transformation of Kent is looking awesome as well, at first he just starts to look a bit messed up, but when his transformation is finally done he is looking very scary I think. Perhaps one of the scariest clowns I have ever seen. The gore is pretty awesome as well, ripped off children bodies, brains splashing around, and lots, lots of blood!Decent acting, Andy Powers did a fine job as the messed up clown. Laura Ellen played okay as well, by the way - how much is she looking like Malin Akerman?! I was convinced at first it was Malin Akerman instead of Laura Ellen. Of course there's also a small (tiny) role for Eli Roth as a clown, really only for a second he shows up though.I thought Clown was a fine and nice movie, it had some great gore and nice looking make-up. The acting was decent and overall I thought this was a nice slasher. I'm also very happy that finally there has been released a good murdering Clown movie because that has been ages since I have seen one. Clown is a hundred times better than Stitches, even though Stitches tries to be funny (and fails at it) and Clown is more a serious type of movie (as far as Clown murdering movies can go serious). Even if you're not a fan of Eli Roth, I suggest giving Clown a watch, I definitely had fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ciller Clown from Another Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy crap. When I saw the "fake trailer" for this years ago, I was quietly thinking: YES, YES, YES, YES. It helps that there has been an onslaught of waaay too many haunted house/ghost stories that has dominated the horror marketplace the last decade and this preview, despite being fake, was the horror I wanted to get back to.Mercifully, Eli Roth saw this trailer and ran with it to make his own Clown. I'm sure as heck glad he did.This has to be one of the most fantastic, scary, gruesome and fun horror movies I've experienced in probably two decades. This would've been perfect for me to see when I was much younger when I couldn't stop watching enough horror movies. Though?the images and deaths on screen most likely would've given me nightmares and scarred me for life. So, um, I guess I take that back. It's probably best I see it now, as an adult.A last minute birthday party clown cancellation causes Dad to don a very old clown costume and perform at his son's birthday party. Unfortunately for him, and well, many others, the costume, wig, makeup, etc, won't come off. Worse, he's progressively growing into the legend behind the outfit.Heath Ledger's Joker has to be my favorite clown, though he was pretty sadistic, purposely chaotic, a thoughtless killer and without an ounce of remorse. THIS clown?makes Joker sane. Regardless of this being an Eli Roth production (and vision,) you would still not expect the victims of this movie to be who they were: kids. In fact, in most of these types of movies, namely A Nightmare on Elm Street, they barely ever showed any younger victims ? all late teens to twenty-somethings. This movie?well, yeah, the targets were what clowns were invented for and there is no holding back.Fortunately, most gore and violence against the kids was off-screen and what was left on screen was like the rest of the movie: homage to 1980s horror, as in gore splattered on objects to indicate, though avoid showing, a horrible death. I had enough and seen too much violence against kids/babies from sick and unwatchable films like A Serbian Film and the abomination, The Human Centipede II. Yes, here I was shocked when the kids were gonna get it, and yes, it was still gruesome and absolutely frightening, but I was pleased with the lack of unnecessary images of their demise as this would never happen anyways.Man, I loved this movie. As stated above, this homage to 1980s films is exactly what I've been looking for and gave me faith in Hollywood that they still know that horror isn't exclusive to ghosts or haunted places. Or possessed dolls. Oy vey!* * *Final thoughts: I highly recommend this, if you can get your hands on it. My friend purchased this from overseas, and I think that's all that's available right now. Shame this hasn't come here wide. I suspect, even when they made a horror out of the evil spirits genre and they believed in it, they're getting shut down because America doesn't want the classic horror any more. They just want their ghosts. Sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps you have nostalgic memories about attending a circus when you were young and you had fun while watching the clowns act. My advice. Don't watch "Clown" because these idyllic reveries won't be the same anymore. And also, were you scared of clowns and thought these were horrible impersonations, you definitely shouldn't watch. I guarantee you the phobia will grow out into clownish proportions. For me who has no emotional connection with clowns and enjoys a ghastly horror, it's mandatory to watch this movie. Just one thing worth knowing. If you're wondering which movie is shown in one particular trailer and the thought of plagiarism comes to mind, I can tell you that this is a fake trailer created by director Jon Watts. The moment Eli Roth saw this trailer, he couldn't restrain his enthusiasm and the only thing he wanted to do was to turn it into a feature film with himself as a producer. Although Kent looks rather ordinary as a clown in the initial stage, the final transformation ensures a grim and frightening character. He can join the club of creepy clowns like those in the movies IT (Stephen King) and All Hallow's Eve (A trashy tale, but with an ultra-scary clown as main character). I am convinced that there exist other horror movies with a creepy clown in the lead.The trouble starts when Kent (Andy Powers), a real estate agent, is forced to replace the clown who was booked to perform at the birthday party of his son Jack (Christian Distefano) and whose schedule got mixed up a bit. Luckily he discovers a complete clown outfit in the house of a client, in a chest that is chained to the wall (what a coincidence). Kent appears at home dressed as the clown Dummo and ensures a spectacular birthday party for his son. The next morning, however, he comes to the conclusion that he can't take off the costume: it seems to be merged with his own human skin, the wig is suddenly his natural hair and he can't get rid of the clowns nose despite all efforts. Ultimately he discovers that the costume is made off the skin of an evil demon, called "The Cloyne". Kent gradually transforms into a bloodthirsty Killer Clown with an insatiable appetite.The initial idea isn't so bad, but the final result is a bit too soft in my opinion. But rest assured, there are plenty of "suggestive" thrilling moments and gore scenes, but it's never straight-in-your-face horror violence what you'll get to see. And yet I enjoyed watching this film (despite the linear storyline with a predictable ending). There are some funny moments, like the clumsy way Kent tries to get rid of the suit and the sublime decapitation mechanism Kent designs, which provides a very different outcome. There are also some subtle fine details elaborated, showing that the makers have looked further than their (red?) nose. Just as Derek in "Afflicted", Kent is unable to take his own life. The only thing that was added to this fact was the confetti. Quite funny and a proof that creativity was indeed present.There are some gruesome scenes (for experienced horror fanatics still a bit soft) and the atmosphere is sometimes really unnerving. The part that takes place in the indoor playground was extremely thrilling and creepy. You can be sure that you'll be looking at a ball pool in a different way from now on. For me this was the most magnificent moment of the entire movie with claustrophobic images in a labyrinth of corridors, shown in an explosion of colors. But as mentioned before, the central theme around which everything revolves, isn't explicitly portrayed. If you want to promote a creepy and gruesome horror movie, you have to have the guts to handle this in the whole story. Now the most gruesome scenes are handled off-screen and your imagination has to provide the missing images. The inner struggle that Kent should engage with the demon, who tries to change his personality, takes up a large portion of the film. Perfectly outlined but maybe it was still a tad overemphasised. Most horror fans will say that the transformation unfolds way to slow and that they rather saw Kent appearing as a bloodthirsty killer clown much sooner.In terms of performances, there is no one who excels or disappoints. Andy Powers (unknown to me) manages to show the creepy clown in a convincing manner and with its various facets : entertaining, sad and desperate, resisting, fighting and finally sneaking around as a maniacal killer, looking for victims to satisfy his hunger. Laura Allen plays the desperate wife Meg who (obviously) must face the ultimate confrontation with her "transformed into a not so cheerful clown" husband. Christian Distefano evolves from a clown lover to a frightened little boy who eventually throws his plush clown in the bin. Who wouldn't ? The most amusing supporting role is played by Peter Stormare as the pretty disturbed Karlsson. The Swede Stormare is such an actor who takes care of small roles in many films (The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Armageddon, Bad Boys II, Get the Gringo, The Last Stand, Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters ...). His contribution in this film is of greater importance."Clown" has its good sides and lesser sides. Unfortunately, there won't be much publicity about this film and most likely you'll only see it on DVD. The idea and the development of the theme about the clown is rather successful, but the final result is still just an average movie. I enjoyed myself while watching it, but I'll still go to a circus without any worries or fear. And I'm surely not going to run away in a panic when the clown act begins.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "evil clown" figure is quite popular in horror cinema. The weakest examples portray the clown as a simple slasher murderer (Stitches, Amusement), while the more ambitious ones explore the primordial fear these "happy" characters wake in many people (Clownhouse, Killer Klowns from Outer Space). Unfortunately, Clown belongs to the first group, because I found its screenplay poorly written, specially due to its excessive use of absurd coincidences to impulse the story. Example 1: when the clown doesn't arrive at his son's party, the main character decides to disguise himself to save the situation... and he immediately finds an old clown disguise at the abandoned home he's selling; what a luck! Example 2: after noticing the strange effects of his clown suit, the main character looks for answers in a disguise shop, and during his FIRST attempt, he discovers the name of the ONLY individual in the world who could explain what is going on. And that's how the film proceeds, abusing from casual encounters and very convenient circumstances we have to swallow for the story to work. Besides, Clown attempted to make a "character study" during the main character's physical and mental collapse; however, Andy Powers makes a weak work in that role, and he isn't able to bring any credibility or emotional depth to the transformation. And Laura Allen also lacks of conviction as his wife Meg. An ambivalent aspect of Clown resides on the selection of victims; some might find the clown's actions too disturbing, while other ones will appreciate the challenge of a taboo which is still present even in the horror genre. Personally, that aspect was indifferent to me... even though (slight SPOILER) the film includes a horrible scene with a dog which decreased my enthusiasm, which was already lukewarm, even more. With a better developed screenplay and a director with genuine vision, I think Clown could have been much better. Unfortunately, its general clumsiness and bad performances avoided me from feeling any interest in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I do not go out of my way to review movies that I don't like. And, I have made a STRONG point of mentioning MANY times in my reviews, that I do not feel it is fair or helpful to come here and trash a film simply because you do not like that particular kind of movie. That doesn't really help others to know whether it is a 'Good' film or not of it's type. That is primarily why we come here...Well, this one just reinforces the reasons why I personally despise Eli Roth. So far, from what I've seen from him, the ONLY thing the guy has 'going' for him (if you can call it that) is that he likes, cold, sadistic, brutal gore and violence. Now... Before you say, 'Hey, the movie is ABOUT a Killer Clown, you Dickweed!' Yes, I know that... :) However, there are Killer Clown movies and there are Killer Clown movies (a more profound statement I have never made...)So, the dilemma that I find myself in is this... I frigg'n LOVE Killer Clown movies, but I completely LOATHE Eli Roth. So... I figured that at least I would watch the movie and give it a chance. Okay, I did... Now, do I choose to review it...? Well, firstly, I would not come here and take a dump on this film JUST because it is presented by Eli Roth (after all, he didn't direct it) But, after watching the movie, I felt that I could come here and honestly give it what I felt was an OBJECTIVE review based SOLELY on whether I thought that the film was well done or not, regardless of Roth's influence. So, that is why I am writing this.FWIW, I FULLY agree with the reviewer Andrew Gold (May 2015) I thought he really nailed it. He focused on the fact, and I agree, that the movie itself simply doesn't build any real atmosphere and doesn't really involve the audience in the characters or even the story very much. Here is a direct quote which is right on the money, "Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialog and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie." And one more that pretty much sums it up, "It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of children in this movie and child actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland child trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland children."There you have it. Even completely ignoring the fact that Eli Roth has anything to do with it, and giving all the stupidly done gore a pass (most of it was just bloody NAUSEATING, NOT scary...) and just looking at the film as a film... In my lowly and wretched opinion, it just wasn't that involving, it wasn't really done that well, the acting was below par for everyone, and last but not least it just simply did NOT entertain. I don't know about you, but I watch movies to be ENTERTAINED. And yes, I understand that people are entertained by VERY different things. A case in point, I do NOT at all like Torture Porn. Thus my strong dislike of Eli Roth and his 'HOSTEL' like pedigree. HOWEVER... I appreciate the fact that many others truly do get off on stuff like that. Okay, fair enough... So, therefore, I wouldn't come here and deliberately give 'HOSTEL' or 'SAW PART "x"' bad ratings and reviews just because I do not like those kinds of films. BUT... I DO indeed like Killer Clown films, so I feel that I can come here and objectively write about how good or bad of a Killer Clown movie THIS film is.This movie not only did not do much for me personally, but I also found it's tone blandly mean-spirited and NOT, I repeat NOT entertaining in the least. It is my personal feeling that people like Eli Roth just simply have NO bloody idea how to make a Horror film that ENTERTAINS. One that disgusts, sure. One that disturbs, yep... You know, it kind of reminds me of Stephen King's style, which is why I stopped reading him LONG ago. People like this seem to have only ONE note, ONE tone, ONE dimension, and that usually is just being coldly mean-spirited, and using gore and brutality just for the sole sake of it. Hey, if that is what does it for you, then fine, maybe you'll like this one... Now, before you all hang yourselves... just ONE more thought, if I may please... Take James Wan, for example. And YES, he did direct the first 'SAW' film. However, just about ALL of his subsequent movies are genuinely involving, VERY well constructed, scary, and fully entertaining. They are FUN movies! And I LIKE fun movies... Just one example that stands in STARK contrast to the 'style' shown in this film here.So, the bottom line I would say is this... If you like straight-up brutal, meaningless Horror films and you are not that particular about the acting or tone or the finesse of constructing an atmospheric mood, then you may well like this one. But, for the reasons that I have gratuitously stated here, if you are like me and you want some true atmosphere, believable characters, or creative style in your Horror films, and if you like FUN movies, then this one will likely leave you flatter than Chaz Bono...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential and then laughed at it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be honest here. I was actually KIND of excited to see this... thing. I thought it had potential to possibly, and I use that work generously, put fear back into a horror movie circled around something to do with a clown. Sadly, that's not the case.Clown starts off way too fast, almost giving the impression that it NEEDS to get you into it because it knows that the rest is just a straight up flat line that has some originality, but none at all at the same time.Honestly, I enjoyed the back story behind the clown and thought that it was a bit of a fresh take on the subject, but, that is ALL THAT I LIKED. Acting was not that good. It had some redeeming qualities, like the blatant Loomis-type character. I kind of liked him, although he was never used the way he should have been used.A lot of the story that didn't involve the clown was lazy and just stupid. Nothing else to say, just... God awful.Overall, this movie is kind of like a smart kid who dropped out of high- school. It has potential, it just doesn't care and laughs at anything that shines light on the fact it has potential.4/10. I was hopeful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are reasons why people are afraid of clowns, this movie doesn't exactly represented much of it, it is more of a creature feature that could have been anything else, but there are still reasons to fear this kind of monster. Clown is ludicrous, but that is already expected to a movie about a killer clown. No matter how much grim the titular monster is compared to Stephen King's iconic villain, Pennywise, the movie still manages to bring some twisted self-aware humor among the gross violence. It doesn't offer beyond the total horror, but then, all of its scares already made it enjoyable enough.Clown didn't have to wait for an exposition to move along with the plot, after the birthday party, the main character is already consumed by the clown costume, leading to a number of unpleasant scenarios of wounding his own body and having strange behavior, with the other characters being amused and terrified by it. When it introduces the origins of the clown, the movie becomes full bonkers, even with the seriousness delivered by one of the characters. But it never really underestimated the concept, while it's still utterly ridiculous, the movie goes deep within the terror; when the main character is gruesomely transforming into a monstrous clown and the probability of him harming others, especially children.The plot doesn't lead to anything else compelling other than its horror movie roots, but the movie already did a solid job at moving its story forward and building what's worse to come. The only mess comes around at the third act where challenging dilemmas are continuous until the film finally decided to give up, it's both overlong and anti-climatic. But none of that matters if you're already having fun with the craziness, in fact, this is a horror film that rarely stops at subplots. The acting is solid for a horror film, they come with a natural reaction to the horror they face, except for Peter Stormare, but his campy acting fits perfectly in this environment, anyway.Clown is an effective scary clown movie, in spite of turning its monster into a literal savage beast instead of featuring what people would normally fear about clowns, like a disturbing vintage makeup. But that makes it easier for most audience to be sold by its creeps, if they can stand the violence. This is not one of those indie-horror films that has a hidden meaning behind, this is an outright horror that constantly shows a lot of tension and violence. Even when it sometimes take a joke about its premise, it still makes us take its terror real seriously. We see a nose being torn off, teeth falling apart, brains that are made of candy(?), etc. Those are the weirdness of the film, and as horror movies go, this is an immediate pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few movies that terrify me. I've seen almost any horror movie I can get my hands on. With that being said, Clown left me disturbed.Beyond disturbed.I'm not scared of clowns. At all. But this clown took me to a new level of terror. It was psychotically scary. Watching the changes and the feeling of seeing someone trying not to change. And whoever does not think so, does not understand the fear aspect of horror movies.It wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it left me uneasy and wanting more. Good job to Eli Roth and crew.

The story is well written and managed through the movie. The possessed suit works very well as you can really follow how demon is taking possession of the husband, with some gore but still with a dose of humor. I felt a kind of Stephen kind touch in the development of the story.The role of the wife is OK I guess, but having Peter Stormare was definitely a big plus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So a man puts on a Clown suit to surprise his son for his birthday and finds he can't take it off. Soon the suit begins to take over and change him making him want to do bad things. When I first saw the trailer for this I thought it looked a bit like that episode of The Simpsons with Homer and The Wig, not a particularly original story line, but.....this film was a serious surprise. I was actually expecting a tacky B-movie but this delivered in every way possible, it even has a great story, something else I was not expecting. The acting was great from a relatively unknown cast. It doesn't rely on CGI, extreme gore or even surprise jumps, it's just a simply awesome film. If you're a horror nut and you don't like this film then, i'm sorry, but you're not a horror nut.</fullReview>

The story line was great and had us on the edges of our seats the whole time. We couldn't believe that these kids were actually getting killed either. It shocked us to the point where we thought we understood why this movie was practically unavailable and unheard of in the US. It wasn't cheap jump scare scary either. It was literally bone chilling and amazing. We're going to go see this movie in theaters for sure. I'm so excited. I literally just made this account on IMDb for this post and rating.

		<shortDescription>Dear lord is it predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is simple and easy to understand. It's the execution and actors that in the end totally ruin this otherwise decent idea of a movie.The actors deliver a (mostly) decent job at trying to make the movie entertaining, however they fall flat when it comes to the child actors. I know they're not close to being as experienced or talented as the adult actors and actresses but holy f*ck were they horrible and annoying.The monster isn't particularly scary either. It's a run of the mill rubber-monster with too much gore and blood and too little attention to detail.*spoiler* Worst of all are the characters themselves. You kind of feel for the "main" character that puts on the suit and goes through all the sh*t that comes with it, however the female lead I absolutely cannot STAND. She's annoying and just plain stupid. The grandfather character goes into the same category. The actor doesn't help with the fact that he delivers his lines terribly.In the end, it was a predictable movie without a whole lot of substance and just too much focus on those fake "jumpscares" where they set up an atmosphere of "You're going to be spooked in a second" where after it's a main character jumping OUTTA Nowhere to scare the main protagonist for no reason WHATSOEVER. I hate when they do this in movies.Sorry to say, but I can't give this more than a 3/10. The only saving grace was that the production value in itself was decent.</fullReview>

Then the clown entertainment falls through and the loving father looks for the alternative and decides to do it himself ultimately donning a found costume. After the party things change.Throughout the first part of the film you feel sad for the father as he knows something is wrong but no one will believe him. Then he begins to change and starts having disturbing cravings and feelings and you really want him to overcome what is happening.

		<fullReview>I love the opening. Images of clown toys and a clown cake being shown along with a cacophony of children screaming. Best way to start a clown movie!The acting was great and believable, and the film quality was obviously high quality. Which is a breath of fresh air after watching some of the other clown horror movies. I just have to say that Kent is a complete moron and deserves everything that happens to him after he dons the clown costume. Like, for real, who just walks into some guy's house, goes through his stuff, and puts on an antique looking clown suit to wear to your child's birthday? (This happens within ten minutes of the movie so hopefully I'm not spoiling anything that wasn't already in the film synopsis). Also, if the chest is chained to a wall, it is probably a good idea NOT to open it. There is some bad juju that comes along with messing with stuff that has been chained to walls, because they are probably like that for a REASON. But, I did like that the initials were KC (KC = Killer Clown). This movie was amazing, and I strongly recommend watching it. The only thing you might be wary of is that it depict very brutal death scenes involving children and that may hurt the sensibilities of some viewers (just thought I might warn you).**Minor Spoilers Below**The wife was a moron. That poor old guy told her countless times, "Don't trust your husband" and then she acts all surprised when her 'husband' betrays her. Like, yes lady maybe that is why the old guy kept telling you not to trust him!The kid is an absolute genius, and honestly if it weren't for his words of wisdom the mom would have probably ended up doing something that would have allowed Kent to escape and then her and her children would have been doomed (I'm counting the unborn as one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that didn't really scare me, because it felt like a horror-comedy, albeit a dark one. It is very similar to Drag Me to Hell in its style, and DMTH is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The difference is that DMTH is full of effective jump scares from start to finish, but Clown has very few jump scares, few of which are effective.I watched Clown for a second time and again for a third time and it started to grow on me. What made me really love this movie is that it starts off as a family movie, which is in contrast with the amount of gore you get later. The kills were funny rather than disturbing and not explicit enough for gore hounds, but I think it was intentional to be consistent with the style of the movie. There were a couple of scenes in the beginning of the movie which gave me an uneasy feeling (without giving too much away the thing with his wrist and his nose). The idea behind the movie is very original. I found myself really enjoying watching the gradual transformation from an ordinary man to a demon over and over again. The demon in its final stages had pretty scary looks. The back story about the origin of the clown was also really interesting and made me want to search the web to see if it was true. The last time I did this was with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to see if it had really happened. After watching this movie for the third time I decided to add this to the list of "The Best Horror Movies I have Ever Seen" on IMDb. You can check the list out here:http://www.imdb.com/list/ls008343902/?publish=saveI recommend this movie to horror movie fans who liked the style and tune of Drag Me to Hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Clowns" is a very nicely done horror movie from Eli Roth. Though not yet released in the US, it is available from Amazon.co.uk, so those out there with Region Free players, send in your orders. Pennywise is nothing compared with the Clown in this film. The film starts nicely enough, with little Jackie's birthday party. This year he wanted a clown for his party. Who knew clowns would ever double book. Never mind, Dad to the rescue. He's a Realtor who finds an old trunk with a clown suit in it. Dad puts on clown suit and saves the party. But all too quick we learn that something is wrong with this particular clown suit. To give away anymore would be criminal. The actors and actresses are mostly unknown, but are totally believable in their roles. The exception being Peter Storemare, who turns in a really cool, and slightly unsettling performance, let's just say he's not very good with kids. Some very typical Eli Roth humour shows up in a few places. And Eli himself makes a cameo appearance as "Frowny The Clown", a TV show that son and father are watching at the beginning of the movie. I give "Clown" 10 out of 10, because it was fun to watch and scary as hell. Especially if you hate clowns and are as scared of them as I am. Possible Spoiler Alert! Kudos to the makeup and FX guys. The final version of the clown is really terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eli Roth being involved in a horror flick always got my attention. Being known for gory flicks i always want to watch his flicks. But here he didn't direct this horror but played the freaking clown. And he did well but the movie itself never got my by my throat. It wasn't that bad but it is a bit too long for me and naturally a clown being involved you will think of It (1990). The flick itself started off rather good but it's after a while that it dropped a bit for me. We do know that something is wrong with the clown suit but to figure it all out and to watch for the transformation it took way too long. Towards the end naturally it delivers the gore and horror but for me it was a bit too late. And the ending is so open that a second flick can appear when this one becomes a hit. Eli Roth as a producer here have left me with a bitter feeling,Make it a 20 minutes shorter and it would have been a good flick.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this at Frightfest Glasgow 2015. Naturally I was a little intrigued by Eli Roths name being attached to this title, although I'm not that big of a fan of his movies, I think he seems like a cool guy. Anyhow, he just presents this movie, and has a super tiny role, that you likely won't even notice if you don't know where to look. This story seems kind of fresh, you haven't seen exactly this a thousand times. And I think the first half, or the first two thirds of the movie is the best. I was kind of waiting for it to really get crazy, but it didn't deliver perfectly. The effects are pretty good, and it has some decent gore. The acting is pretty good, and it's always nice to see Peter Stormare. The movie has some funny moments, and is a quite nice blend of scary and funnyish.There is something lacking though, it sort of flats out towards the end. But that might just be my taste. I think it needs a second viewing. It was definitely a Frightfest high light. I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer clown on the loose!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film by Eli Roth. That credit itself is scary enough to make you want to watch a horror movie. So, did this movie live up to the name?Yes and No. Yes because it was a very interesting take on the origin of the clown and the whole history behind it's eventual transition to the modern day version. No because it could have been fleshed-out a little more. Anyone who's watched movies by Eli Roth knows, that he very rarely holds back. However, I couldn't help but feel that this whole movie seemed a little restrained. Almost as if he was trying to make a movie that wouldn't offend the oversensitive - but come on, Eli, that's why we have Disney. The atmosphere through this movie ended up feeling like Hannah Montana on acid.So the story revolves around a father (Kent) who wears a clown outfit for his son, Jack's birthday. The laughter turns to horror though, as that night, when Kent tries to take off the outfit, it just won't come off. Kent decides that it's not such a big problem and sleeps it off in the hopes that maybe when he wakes up, all his problems will have magically been whisked away. Much to his dismay, this proves to be far from true as the next day, he tries to remove the costume again, without any success.What we learn through the course of the movie is that the outfit, is not really an outfit but the skin of a demon which is slowly turning the goofy and terribly wooden Kent into a demon obsessed with eating children. That's right, a demon who goes after the one thing more scary than demons. Children.Being an Eli Roth movie, you can expect violence and suspense. I have to say though, the whole effort just felt very forced and the only notable performance came from Peter Stormare (who plays a man named Karlsson and happens to be an expert on clown-related horror) Peter, seems to have become an expert at switching between the role of protagonist and antagonist. It's not awful but it's not good either. It doesn't seem to have any goal in mind. It's as if three drunk people got together and said "I know, let's make a movie about clowns. Also, let's make sure it isn't really that good" So it ends up landing in the "Meh" pile.Would I recommend it? Well that depends... Did you lose a bet? Are you looking for ways to waste your time? Do you have a clinically diagnosed obsession with clowns? If so, then look no further! This is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honk if you're Horrified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure it was possible to milk anything watchable out of the depleted "killer-clown" trope, especially after American Horror Story: Freak Show seemed to have set the bar rather high, despite the Freak Show season itself in toto ending up as foul curds on the floor of high camp.Stitches, from 2012, is an underrated gem that managed to massage the wheezing heart of clown-themed gore, if by no other means than amping up the gore to a near parodic, and delightful, level.Clown comes from the hirsute production mist of Eli Roth, seldom a good sign and always good for a superfluous cameo from the Eyebrows himself. I once wrote somewhere on here that after Inglourious Basterds, it was hard to tell if Roth was better off behind the camera rather than in front of it.The awful but watchable-if-bored Cabin Fever was perhaps inspiration enough to let others handle the specs and stretch out the acting chops, while Aftermath showed that Roth definitely had a charm made for the editing room. I'm not sure where that leaves his role in Basterds, outside of the possibility that being surrounded by true talent, in front of and behind the camera, creates skill via osmosis, or else simply keeps the weaker gazelle better hidden from the jackals. Green Inferno was supposed to settle this bet, but here we are.....patience wearing thin.Luckily, Roth keeps his presence minimal in Clown. His importance as bankroll is accented by the fact that Clown is actually quite a good film without him. A bit unsteady, clichéd in parts beyond the simple clown motif, but blessed with top-shelf makeup/design and genuine scares.Coulrophobics will have plenty of nightmare fuel, as the clown is a horrifying creature, starting off as a generic creepy bozo and ending up as a truly frightening, child-devouring boogeyman made all the more horrifying by ruffles and a multicolored Harlequin suit saturated with gore.I even enjoyed the back story on the history of clowning. I haven't researched this to know if the true origins of clowning are as portrayed in the film ( I find clowns and clown history boring to the point of self-harm) but if they are true I would like to research more.This inspiration alone makes the movie worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the idea of Clown since seeing the first trailer and I was curious to see how far it would go. With Eli Roth behind it I knew it wouldn't cop out easily, but I was afraid it would go overboard. Luckily neither happened: Clown is funny, scary, interesting and bewildering all at once. It pulls no punches, but doesn't go for sneaky sucker-punches either. The plot plays out at a good pace, the characters feel real enough, the acting is solid and the ultimate transformation is certainly memorable.This is not a gore-hound film, nor torture porn. It doesn't pander to specific subsets of the horror world. Instead Clown simply plays the cards it was dealt with great effect. It is true that the movie doesn't quite hit the lights, but it is far better than so many higher-profile horrors we've seen the past year or so.I really enjoyed Clown and I hope to see a sequel!</fullReview>
