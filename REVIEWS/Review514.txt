		<shortDescription>It's good. Better than "fine" but not "great".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat the best part of this movie is the acting: Teller and Hill have great chemistry on screen. Jonah does a particularly good job at playing the "guy you love to hate". I can't attest to the faithfulness of their portrayal of the real life people since I don't know anything about them. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.The marketing for this movie was, unfortunately, deceitful: the trailer made it out to be this upbeat, funny, over the top comedy - which it's not. In reality the movie has a much slower pace, not a lot of situational humor and is certainly not filled with hilarious quips (the bulk of which are in the trailer). This is not to say that the movie was bad or not at all funny, it just wasn't what I expected (and I am sure I'm not alone).My final critique will go unnoticed for the majority of viewers but I found it personally offensive so I have to report it: some of the movie takes place in Albania, only the set for Albania is actually Romania. Which is fine, I understand that they probably did this for practical reasons and as a Romanian movie goer I just have to accept it (we all recognized it immediately though). However, at some point in the movie an "Albanian" woman says something, only she says it in Romanian. This may not seem like much but it totally took me out of the movie and ruined the experience for me. I find it completely unacceptable that they could not hire an Albanian to say those few lines. The two languages might seem interchangeable to the rest of the world, I am sure, but that was very much NOT the case for me and everyone else in the theater.I am a paying movie goer as well and I expect to be just as entertained as everyone else. This is, of course, not the first time that I've seen this in a film. But when a producer does something like this it shows me that they don't respect their movie, so they can't expect me to.My rating, however, is not based on this final bit of criticism. I gave it a 7/10 for slow pacing and lack of humor, which is the opposite of what I expected.I'd still recommend it, just don't expect to be blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolf of wall street meets Lord Of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like wolf of wall street, I believe you are gonna like this movie too, even though it not have all the funny moments. The plot is similar a nice guy (Teller) find a way to make money doing stuff located on the line of legal and illegal. The music was well chosen for every scene, acting (specially from Hill and Cooper) was outstanding. On the contrary if you though that Wolf.. didn't show enough all the people who suffer from their actions, and that the movie glorifies bad actions and the eternal search for money, you will not like this movie. It all depends in the end of your personal standards of what can be made fun of, and what subjects are too controversial (in this case, war, guns and arms dealers) to have a good time with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye opening - very interesting and funny look at arms dealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is eye opening, relevant and very clearly told with a humorous tone through the serious subject matter. This is based on a true story with some fictionalized elements to make it entertaining. A massage therapist links up with a childhood friend who is a small time arms dealer. Very interesting to get a look at the legal but morally questionable world of arms dealing. I thought this would be a juvenile buddy movie with a bit of war thrown in but it isn't.Jonah Hill has some funny lines and he does a great job with the over the top character but he can be subtly sinister when he needs to be. Miles Teller plays his character sympathetically and I liked him here. Quite different from the rather annoying characters he usually plays. Bradley Cooper who produced the movie and has a small but pivotal role and he is effective as an arms dealer.Quite a transporting experience as the action takes you from Miami to Jordan and Iraq with some funny situations there and Albania.Watch this movie. It deserves to do better than it has so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another disappointing summer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for the 'The Hangover' trilogy.Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy. Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the viewer's interest back.The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've probably turned out roughly the same. The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the 2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid film, but lacks originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is definitely worth the watch. Jonah Hill and Myles Teller both shine superbly in this film, and Bradley Cooper has some genuine mystique about him during his performance. However, this is the second film I have seen this year, that seems to try and recapture the brilliance of Martin Scorcese's 'Wolf of wall street'. What I mean by that is both this film and 'The Big Short' take a complex real life event, that not a whole lot of people fully understood, and made a film that took time to make light of the scenarios, and tried to explain them to the audience in a common way. This film does it well, and beats 'The Big Short' as it was definitely the easier film to follow. However, it does use a lot of comedy aspects from 'Wold of Wall Street'. You compare Jonah Hill's character Efraim to Donnie his character from TWOWS, they are exactly the same for the first half of this movie. Also, this movie makes light of a very serious real life scenario, and felt to safe considering the context. It's to light hearted and the only real drama or tension comes from the two friends. On it's own this film is highly re-watchable, and that's down to the lightheartedness, but take a second to stop and think about the real life story, it feels to lighthearted. With Wall Street it worked because all the characters were terrible people, so it was funny to see them mess up. Here, Myles Teller plays a very likable character, and with some of the sinister characters, this film needed to feel more threatening. However, credit is where credits due, the film did a great job of breaking down how arms dealing works, the same way TWOWS did for stock brokering. and the tone just felt fun, and made it easy to watch. To use wrestling terms, the heel turn seemed a little off, and needed more build, and also just the amount of similarities to TWOWS, from the way they close it out, to Jonah Hill's performance, just the narration by Teller, these films are almost parallel, so that holds this film back from being truly great. But, the funny thing is, this film works. Hill's performance as both a comedic and dramatic actor is fantastic, he balances the two so well. If you haven't seen TWOWS, your going to love this move a hell of a lot, while the film lacks the risks to make it an instant classic, and is to lighthearted on the seriousness of this real life industry, its still fun and re-watchable, and the script and how this film flows just makes it enjoyable viewing. I know I have talked long about the lack of originality, but honestly besides that and the lack of tone, or pushing the boundaries, the film does its job well. Hill and Teller have great chemistry, and I could go back and watch this over and over again. The effort to make people aware of this event can not be faulted, and they made arms dealing and the art of war a lot easier to understand that Big Short did for the financial crisis in 08. The sinister tone to end it, was definitely a tonal shift, but I won't spoil it for you here. I'm just going to say, you will have fun, if you're a fan of TWOWS or similar films, or you really enjoy Jonah Hill or Myles Teller, they deliver. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars. If it pushed the boundaries more, and had more originality I would have given it a 4.5 which I only reserve for great movies. As it is though, it's a re-watchable, fun, well acted, educational film. And you won't even know you're being educated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd say it's perfect save for minor nuances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a very good screen adaptation based on true events story.The only downside of this movie is that it has unnecessary family drama. That dramatic wife nagging BS is really annoying. The good thing there is not a lot of it. Thank you, Jesus.But the movie itself it's so good, that when the dramatic fill-ins stop, the movie brings itself up and keeps with the pace.The dialogues are written perfectly, with just enough irony and humor not to sound cheesy.There is not a lot of action but each action scene is really well made. I'd say a perfect combination for such story.One of the best components of the movie is the perfect sets for scenes. Loved the scenes in the Middle East and Albania. Albania looks foggy, shady. Really nice. Doesn't look faked or overdone.I'd say every scene was nearly perfect, except the family drama scenes.But I still give this 10\10 for gold effort.When the movie ends. You seriously want it to continue. In fact it calls for part two. May be it could be done.This movie is a real surprise. Didn't expect this to be that good.The whole structure of the scene sequence is perfect. Nothing is too short or too long. Not a second wasted on BS(except the family drama).I have to mention that the foreign characters don't look fake or lame. Even English speaking Albanians look quite genuine and it is believable that they actually could speak some English to get by. It's really important because usually the fake foreign characters ruin the hell out of the movie. Not here. Everything was made really well. Filmed well. Sounded well.Sound track is in place. Music is highlighting the scenes not dominating. Everything in the right place.I'd say it's one of the best movies this year even though it might not look larger then life.The story is told in a believable way. Characters are well acted.Respect to main lead actors. Very good choice for actors.This movie reminded me of classic 80s movies of the same type. It has a touch of Spies Like Us(with Chevy Chase) or even Stripes(with Bill Murray). Obviously nice shout outs to Scarface.Overall this movie should be put on one shelf with other good movies that you may watch once in a while.Respect to the director. 10 out 10.Watch it. I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is definitely style over substance, but it is enjoyable and worth a watch despite having little staying power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'War Dogs' is the latest film directed by Todd Phillips of 'Hangover' fame, a comedy/drama starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller as a pair of amateur arms-dealers. The film is loosely based on a true story, even featuring a cameo by the actual person portrayed by Teller, though it takes several liberties with the source-material. The feature isn't as controversial or important as it perhaps thinks it is, but it is still mostly entertaining with good performances despite having little beneath the surface. The movie spends more time trying to create a style then it does trying to inject the story with substance, and as a whole suffers for it. The narration is very expositional and feels lazy, not to mention that the film freeze-frames for no reason other than for Teller to get his voice-over out, and the semi-frequent use of stock-footage gets a little annoying as it feels rather out of place. The other thing that got on my nerves was the intermittent quotation title-cards, used as unnecessary chapter breaks. These short asides were never needed, their unnecessary nature compounded by the fact that they always contained a quote that would then be said in dialogue just minutes later. They also didn't separate distinct parts of the plot, such as time-jumps or location-changes, and thus beg the question as to why they were included. The stylistic choices hark back to 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' and 'The Big Short', but they never add up to something unique and instead feel like re-treads; the elements never feel consistent, meaning that the film itself comes across as poorly disciplined. The story is interesting most of the time, and the two lead characters provide engaging screen-presences, though the film does drag its heels in the second act. As a whole it feels a bit too long, lacking in a proper finale and leaving us with a relatively weak conclusion. There isn't really any danger and the characters tend to enjoy what they're doing. In the end, it all seems mainly inconsequential as it is mostly consequence-free and focused on frivolous antics; it doesn't get as deep into the ethics of the situation as it should, leading to a light and fluffy affair with little staying power. The other issues with the story are that it is generally unmemorable, spends too much time on set-up but not enough on pay-off and features weak characterisation.Other than the two leads, the other players don't have anything to do ? even Ana de Armas' character is only included to provide a motive for Teller's protagonist to do what he does. It's a shame as there are some great actors here, the best performance is given by Bradley Cooper but he is barely on-screen. Thankfully, the two leads are good. Hill delivers another diverse dramatic performance that proves he can really act, while Teller is solid as essentially a surrogate for the audience. The script is decent, featuring fairly naturalistic dialogue and some witty banter. However, I didn't find the film funny at all. The audience I saw it with laughed consistently while I barely cracked a smile. It didn't take away from my enjoyment, but I feel as though it works better as a drama than a comedy. That's why it is a shame they went for style and humour over depth and emotion, I think it would have been a much more engaging film if it was a little darker and more contemplative. Technically speaking, everything is good here. The direction is competent, bordering on proficient, but it is unremarkable on the whole and goes largely unnoticed. The cinematography is clean, crisp and efficient. The movie feels tangible from start to finish, with real locations being used frequently and the occasional action being shot neatly. The music is a slightly underwhelming, lacking in an original score and flittering between licenced pieces frequently. The choices are quite generic and have been used before under similar circumstances, but they fit the scene they're in and never detract from the experience.Overall, 'War Dogs' is an enjoyable film that is a clear example of style over substance; the performances are good, the script is entertaining and the plot is mostly engaging but a lack of depth hurts the staying power of the picture. It is unmemorable and unimportant, but a decent time and worth a watch once: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is that even legal??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hangover/Due Date director Todd Philipps makes a film base on the true story of young, entrepreneur gun-runners David Parkouz and Efraim Diveroli who managed to secure a ridiculous contract to supply arms to the afghan army via the pentagon. Miles Teller plays the struggling and ambitious David who bumps into his childhood buddy Efraim played by Jonah Hill who is somewhat of the opposite, a loose cannon, fearless and a little trigger-happy. Now, Efraim has found himself a little niche in the market, the market of arms dealing and strikes up small deals with the US military. David needs a job to support his expecting girlfriend, the stunning Ana de Armas who looks a little like Penelope Cruz only more beautiful and has one of those exotic accents. Efraim sees an opportunity for David and the two team up to what leads to the deal of the century for all parties involved. Now, the film has plenty of other film references most notably Scarface, even one of the promotional posters is a respectful nod to the DePalma/Pacino's film. But it's actually Lord of War Efraim is a huge fan of in real-life and it's probably more like Lord of War than Scarface, yet it has tinge of Pain &amp; Gain, another crazy true story movie. Maybe it's Miami? But it has that vibrant and funny yet serious storytelling style that makes the film almost unbelievable and shocking. The rest of the cast does include Bradley Cooper who also produced the film, playing the harden, borderline war-criminal, pretty much the Branson of the arms market and someone you don't really want to be messing with. There's Kevin Pollack playing the bankroll and an awesome cameo of venture capitalist playboy millionaire Dan Bilzerian. It's accompanied by a great soundtrack with tracks from 50cent, Beastie Boys, Iggy Pop, UB40 and CCR but the awesome score threw me completely thinking it was Harry Gregson-Williams or Steve Jablonski, no, it was Cliff Martinez with those ambient sounds. The film is highly entertaining, funny in parts but this is not a comedy; its perfectly paced with some great scenes like the duo gun-running across the triangle of death and some nice camera work. However it's not to epic portions, not that it should put anyone off watching this, it's still a very watchable and enjoyable film and I don't think they could have done it any better. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for a slick story, good editing and a great score/soundtrack to boot. 78% 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A success story that makes you think and reflect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a message therapist who goes broke because his business venture of selling luxury bed sheets does not work out. He is recruited by his childhood friend to make big money by bidding on military contracts."War Dogs" touches on a mysterious aspect of the world which is not often talked about. Therefore, the story is already intriguing, and I want to find out what happens to the two guys. What they do might seem questionable to some, and their subsequent success gives much food for thought. The ending makes you think and reflect on the fine line between right and wrong; and how people can get caught up in their successes. Another god aspect is that despite the subject matter, the story manages to be funny yet still remains dramatic enough to be taken seriously. I enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No top dog, but certainly no runt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An odd dog which can't decide to be either dramatic or comedic at certain points, especially the cannabis scenes that felt phoned in. Obviously to cash into the Superbad angle the trailers an executive had in mind. The bookmarking chapter-headings damaged some flow, but heavily reminds the viewer of its Rolling Stone origins. The only female role is disgustingly bland but other supporting roles - Bradley Cooper, Kevin Pollak and Gabriel Spahiu - made up for that shortcoming. Jonah Hill proves he can play sociopaths as much as dorks, displaying his Moneyball dramatic ability. Miles Teller is so-so, but his character is so written blandly as an audience surrogate that he can be forgiven. It also glosses over details of the 'Arms &amp; the Dudes' source material, probably because a Hollywood executive didn't want to accidentally create a How-To guide (nothing new - Fight Club's Hollywood adaptation omitted elements of its home-made Napalm recipe). Honestly this is not Lord of War, but this is no amateur hour. The film-making itself is solid enough to keep interest in a by-the- numbers script, making it better than it really should've been.</fullReview>

He drives this movie and gives every viewer something different to think. Apart from the usual 21 and 22 jump street we are all used to seeing him in, which are good films by the way! We see him play a much more serious role in this film! and he smashed it! Cant top Wolf of Wall street of course. As for Miles Teller he also did very well in his role, i don't know a lot about the bloke but i know he played a part in the latest Fantastic Four which was a shambles!

		<shortDescription>Not a Comedy, but Still Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War Dogs follows two young stoners as they weasel their way into the arms business and somehow manage to land a $300million military contract with the government, supplying guns, grenades, and ammunition to the Afghan army circa 2008. They find they have to cut a few corners and forge a few documents to make sure it all runs smoothly, which it does, until it doesn't. Based on a true story, a lot of the broader strokes are public record, but being a movie, certain events have naturally been added or embellished to make them a little more interesting (no-one wants to watch two stoners sat in front of their computers for two hours).First thing I have to note is that the marketing lies. It lies really hard in order to get your seat in the cinema. The way it does that is by painting a different movie to what you get. In some ways it's understandably easier to market this film as a comedy, especially when you emblazon Todd Phillips' and Jonah Hill's names all over it. There are light-hearted moments and the odd joke, but almost every humorous moment is packed into the trailers. War Dogs is a drama/thriller first. This isn't a criticism, I'm just trying to manage expectations. Don't go in expecting The Hangover with arms dealers, because that's not this movie.That said, War Dogs plays a lot like Wolf of Wall Street meets Lord of War (the latter of which the real Efraim Diveroli was apparently obsessed with at the time). Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same character he did in Wolf of Wall Street as well. War Dogs plays out as a fundamentally anti- war/anti-military movie though. That's the only message you can really take from it as it highlights how ridiculous the whole situation is. These are two stoner kids running Barettas through Iraq, to be greeted with stacks of Hussain's billions just sitting in a warehouse, paying for the US invasion. When they inevitably get busted for fraud, David Packouz suffers only seven months of house arrest, which is nothing. A patsy he may have been, but it hardly put a dent in his life considering how serious his crimes were, and that's because the military was willing to turn a blind eye to the Chinese ammunition they were being sold, because it fuelled their war for a discount price.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are pretty great though, even if they do just play to their typecasts. As I mentioned, Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same love-to-hate character he did in Wolf of Wall Street, only fatter, and ever so slightly more of a douchebag. He does it well though. Alarmingly well. His weight and his high-pitched laugh are used to comedic effect (if that's the kind of thing that amuses you, the group of lads sat behind me sniggered every time Hill laughed), and in a way to mock the real Diveroli, but largely holds no factual accuracy (Diveroli is actually quite well-built). Miles Teller plays his everyman out-of-depth character really well as well, with a beautiful young wife and baby daughter on the way providing him a motivation for getting into the business in the first place. Teller's Packouz is our character to root for, painted likable if slightly inept. Ultimately though, it all works because Teller and Hill share a fantastic chemistry that is both engaging and entertaining.War Dogs isn't a must-see movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's not particularly original, it's marketing was a massive misfire, and his underlying message is a little haphazard. That said I can't say I found myself bored at any point in the film's runtime. The acting and character work was done really well, and the story balanced out it's serious moments with light-hearted humour just enough without bowing into full-comedy mode. I give War Dogs a respectable 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Dogs: an entertaining, exciting, and rarely funny true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miles Teller and Jonah Hill star in the remarkable true story of two young arms dealers who became way over their head when they try to snag a $300 million dollar deal. Todd Phillips who brought us the Hangover trilogy gives us a reveal of how much money is invested into the US military, and it can be easily intercepted by two twenty something year old's.Watching Jonah Hill and Miles Teller felt like these two had been working together for years and therefore another successful duo seen on screen this year. We witness the events through Miles Teller's eyes as David Packouz a former massage therapist who jumps from his hollow career to the dangerous arms trade. Though Teller's performance is standard he effectively acts to be the average Joe in the scenario and guides us through the story as the narrator and helps us relate to the character in the situation. We may not totally approve of what this pair are doing we are in favour that Miles Teller ends up okay.But at the heart of it is Hill's performance as the Scarface impersonating money thirsty gangster Efraim Diveroli. Hill gives us a great performance unseen by any other young actor trying to be a rich arms trader, but unfortunately carries a very annoying laugh throughout the film.Also making an appearance is the always charming Bradley Cooper who passes the torch to the aspiring dealers in providing his assistance in the trade. Although his appearance is brief he still gives us a dangerous Robert De-Niro style meeting.War Dogs although based on true events is a surprisingly entertaining and an easy to watch experience. However the film does juggle with its serous dark themes and comedic moments which doesn't quite reach what it wants, as what you get are rather hit and a miss jokes that don't work at the right times, but what you do get are effective jokes that takes a breather from all the seriousness which is much better. This also only really takes place during the middle of the film and from the beginning and end we have the more dark atmosphere of what's going on.All in all War Dogs is entertaining and fascinating in revealing its true story and I'm sure won't let anyone down, but it does not quite make a good balance in humour and drama. 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but structure is very unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic structure of this movie is something we have seen before in movies like "goodfellas" and "wolf of Wall Street". It's basically the same the main character as a narrator. The movie starts off somewhere in the middle for a brief scene to show you what to come and then goes back to humble beginnings. And the structure goes on the same so if you have seen those movies then except the same kind of film. Despite that unoriginal I still enjoyed the film. The acting was solid Jonah hill delivers another solid performance adding to the list of his good performances. And young miles teller shows he can act with this and his previous movie "whiplash". I was afraid of the movie based on the trailers being just a silly action movie but I was wrong although it had some action it was mainly an interesting story excited well. If you are fans of goodfellas and wolf of Wall Street you will enjoy this because it is very similar with a new story to tell about shady young stoners attempting to screw the government in the arms industry. I do recommend this. Parents beware there is violence and drug use are the main causes of this being rated R</fullReview>

Packouz (miles teller) shines in the dark gritty true story and Diveroli (jonah hill) is brilliant as the shady friend that will stop at nothing to make money. The two friends reunited at a funeral and through desperation Packouz agrees to go work with Diveroli on becoming arms dealers for the U.S army. The story is told well and keeps you on edge of your seat. This film reminded me of the Nicholas cage film Lord of war from 2005 which was also about a arms dealer, but as much as i enjoyed that film War Dogs is much much better. With a brilliant Bradley Cooper in a supporting role War Dogs is one of the must see films of 2016.</fullReview>

We are in January, 2008", when we see a guy, Dave Packouz, thrown out of a car and assaulted by what look to be kidnappers. When then move back to "Miami Beach 2005", as we see Dave struggle to make end meets as a licensed massage therapist. Then one day at a funeral, Dave runs into his old buddy Efraim Diveroli, who has recently moved back to Miami. Efraim, a small time arms dealer, can use Dave's help with the arms bonanza that is the war in Iraq. Before we know it, the two are starting to sell arms to the Pentagon. At this point we're 15-20 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie, based on a Rolling Stone Magazine article, is directed by Todd "The Hangover" Phillips and equally as important, produced by Bradley Cooper's production company (Cooper himself also plays a small role as another shady arms dealer). The movie is divided up in 7 or 8 chapters (I didn't count them exactly) such as "All money is made between the lines", and "When does telling the truth help anyone?". Miles Teller (from "Whiplash") and Jonah Hill are David and Efraim, respectively. Teller looks so young! Hill on the other hand seems he was made to play this role. The movie is billed as a comedy, and yes there are quite a few laughs to be had, as the absurdity of the situation lends itself to easy laughs, There should've been a serous undercurrent as well, about the flood gates opened by the Bush administration to fill billions of dollars in war procurement, enticing second and third tier companies and scammers to get a piece of the pie. (A recent book called Consequence by Eric Fair goes into that aspect as well, and it is not a comedy). last but not least, there is a smorgasboard of music placed throughout the movie, from CCR's Fortunate Son to the Who's Behind Blue Eyes. to Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows (playing over the end credits)."War Dogs" is now into its second week, and it did okay at the box office in the first week. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, not poor, not great. I heard a lot of chuckles throughout the movie, so that was a good sign. Bottom line" "War Dogs" is a funny movie with some great performances but lacks the seriousness to be a heavy hitter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining couple of hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this on a whim knowing little about it. What I saw was a fast paced 'unbelievable' story that is apparently based on fact. The key actors all played their parts extremely well. Not a weak performance from anyone. The two leads Miles Teller and Jonah Hill make the film as you liked THEM (to begin with) but not what they were doing. The honesty of the narrative as our chief protagonist (David Packouz) slips further and further into moral turpitude is both refreshing and humorous. This once again indicates to me that there are no morals when it comes to big money (a Pentagon-inspired market akin to the Stock Exchange) and its' corruption so admirably defined in 'The Big Short', 'The Wolf of Wall Street' etc. Government waste laid bare. Corruption, dealing with 'enemies', the list goes on. Not only an entertaining couple of hours but also a depressing reminder of what makes the world go around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie that made me think!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie I saw in the theater last night. Jonah Hill gives a manic and amazing performance and the woman who plays Isa is really good too. There movie I think centers on money and friendship and war and really makes you think about how personal values shape your loves and losses in life. The tension is thick and that makes it a good film. Some characters are flat and I think Bradley Cooper could have had much more screen time. If you like crime thriller type stories this is your movie. It was boring at the end but parts of it really gripping and lots of humor as well. I think the film took on too much narrative type story listing events and could have just let go more and let art speak for the details or look them up later online. I think the facts were to heavy handed presented and that bogged it down. The foreign minor characters were brilliantly played. Definitely a film about the Ugly American. Well played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is a funny business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of War Dogs (spoiler free).*** (3/5) Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, Bradley Cooper.Plot: Two men who were best friends in high school decide to reunite and become arms dealers, but as their life they get a deal that could possibly be the best deal for them, however this deal could be a big mistake for these two.War Dogs is sold as a comedy. Yet it is the most serious adult war comedy out there. After director Todd Phillips' made an impact in the comedy world with the Hangover trilogy yes even the clunky, unfunny sequels. This is quite a challenge for him as he tries to create grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong leaping on one of their faces. Yet he succeed with a sort of funny adult war story that has a few laughs sprouting every now and then but it is mostly serious. David Packouz (Teller, still keeping his master performance from Whiplash in play) is a man who wants more from his life rather than being a salesman of expensive Egyptian sheets and his life as a licensed masseuses, until he sees an old friend from high school Efraim Diveroli (Hill) and they get back together again. David and Efraim are now friends again and Efraim introduces him to his job and he is instantly jealous of his life. Although this feels much like the Wolf of Wall Street especially with the narration this mainly comes from David this makes the whole experience a whole lot better.As the story goes on the comedy standards get better and funnier and this also makes for fun dialogue, mainly said by the two lead characters. However the two lead actors are both ten years older than the characters they are playing yet with their riveting performances you seem to forget that. It's also filled with pretty good action although not as good as a Scorsese masterpiece but the pacing feels the same in this and the pacing is spaced out to show that the director certainly didn't rush to make this feature. There is pretty good action not much in terms of violence but mainly from the use of guns, and also the funny one liners each of the lead roles come out with. In one scene when the two friends go to Albania a country literally torn by war they have to deliver a ton of ammo in a very short time but as this goes through David has to stay there alone while, Efraim gets drunk and also he does the most sinister thing ever which will probably end their friendship, however Efraim realizes his mistake and tries to make it better, without success. There are even emotional standards in the film. Although filled with masculinity apart from the one woman Ana de Armas' Iz who is David's girlfriend but that is all the femininity that this film has to offer so mostly men. Especially with Bradley Cooper's top arms dealer Henry Girard's random outburst "See this is why I like arms dealing - no women." Although apart from all the funny outbursts this peace of comedy is mostly serious, with a much similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot another comedy about a war torn country and the lead role goes there to try an sort things out. So essentially based on the Hangover series and yes even the Wolf of Wall Street, this shows to be a film that is based around war time can serious and funny at the same time.Verdict: Buoyed by riveting performances and pretty action, this proves that Todd Phillips can do grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong.6/10 Rude and laugh out loud funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - so if you didn't see this and don't like spoilers - close the window because I am about to totally ruin it for you. 'I'm not a bad man but in certain situations I have to ask myself - 'what would a bad man do' - yes it is not even over yet and I am reviewing it.Full disclosure - I found the girl attractive - I think her name was Iz or something. She added to the plot - if not only because I thought she was kinda cute. Thanks to the directors for throwing her in there - would have been nice to see more of her... Keep that in mind for next time. But really - why was it good? It seemed like the kind of movie where all the good parts are covered in the trailer - like the movie 'Ted' - but unlike 'Ted' - they bits in between were interesting too. You go in knowing they are going to get some like 300 million dollar deal at some point and drive through the triangle of death - but still the entire process is interesting to watch. I have to admit I was shopping for leaf blowers on my other screen but still I think I got most of it so here we go...Poor pathetic guy driving even more pathetic car earning a living rubbing old people for money.... Disgusting but could happen. Slightly less pathetic friend shows up from Jr High - two of them get in slightly less pathetic car to go buy some narcotics. Get had - shoot gun in the air - next thing you know pretty much they are selling guns to people. So I might have missed somethings - but the first big deal is with the US government where somehow 2 guys with a fax machine and a PayPal account are talking directly with a commander in a war torn middle eastern country... Not sure it really works like that or if the guy in the middle of the desert really has a Nokia 6500 flip phone - but we go with it. They fail to deliver because FedEx does not go there or something - so they get on a 23 hour flight to some country I never heard of - hire a 12 year old to translate and the next thing you know their guns show up at the hotel valet with a guy who is willing to drive them 800 km across the desert to this commander who I think when he hung up the phone with them 8 weeks ago said he was dismissing them for cause.... I guess that takes more than 8 weeks....So they take some selfies - collect $3 million in US currency - and board a US bound military transport plane - I sure that is all easy to arrange. Back to the pretty girl in Miami - cool - need to look up her real name and see if she has done any other stuff I could look at...Now the poor guys have $3 million dollars - and want more - lots more... So they go to Vegas because that is I guess where you go to get more money - meet some random dude who essentially writes out the deal of the century for them...Someone how they spend money they don't have yet to buy some nice things - then find out these bullets are made in china which I guess is not good. Next thing you know they have an assembly line of local workers who I don't think ever got paid and in the end report them to the authorities.... Now - I get the need to pull in a profit but pay the poor people repacking your bullets the measly $100k you owe them - for goodness sake - really - they need the money to eat. So the one guy punches the other guy in the nose then the FBI collects them up. In the end the random guy from Vegas shows back up with a suitcase full of money - because I guess that is what you get after someone kidnaps you and beats you up over a misunderstanding...Bottom line - if you like the trailer you will like the movie - at least I did. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War Dogs had me captivated at the way the events unfold, as we see two arms dealers try to score big. The movie tells a good story and keeps you curious on how events will turnout. The down side of this movie is we have seen such on screen pair before and while watching you have this striking feeling that the more outspoken carefree character will mess up everything for the partners, so there is no element of surprise when it finally happened.Everyone is always aiming for that one big score, but sometimes the price to pay for that score can eventually make the score a useless endeavour. That was what this movie had to deliver as we watch two childhood friends form a company AEY, which deals specifically in arms deals with the U.S. Pentagon.The movie has one of the best performances I have seen Jonah Hill pull off, he was a master of character shifts in this movie playing a greedy and intelligent Efraim Diveroli. Jonah Hill deserves all the praise he is getting for his performance and even more, as his presence takes the movie which could have been done better into what is enjoyable.War Dogs is a biographical crime drama directed by Todd Phillips. The movie plot is based on a story published in Guy Lawson's 2015 book Arms and the Dudes. Although the movie is biographical many of the elements and happenings were fictions, just wound together to make a more compelling story.What these two 20 something friends did rocked the U.S. Army and caused it to review its procurement dealers and measures.The movie is narrated by David (Miles Teller) who is a licenced massage therapist. David is tired of giving massages to old people for a living, and tried his hand on selling bedsheets to old people's home, but the business failed and David was to lose all his savings. When his old time childhood friend and bad influence Efraim shows up at a burial of a mutual acquaintance, the two hooked up and tried igniting their past fun days. After hearing about David's predicament and his unborn child on her way Efraim asked David to come join him as an arms dealer. Their work together made them enough money to buy houses and live a good life, but they always wanted more and decided to go for a big score worth $ 300 million.The problem is, they had to fool the U.S. Army to get away with it.A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War Dogs is the astonishing true story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who sold weapons to the US military and became caught up in the Iraq and Afghan war. Incidentally, it's 'astonishing', but not pleasingly, more in a 'how can they get away with it' way.Director Todd Phillips (known for the Hangover trilogy) makes a good step towards drama, but there's no denying the useful touch of comedy dotted throughout the movie. Most notably, casting Jonah Hill, who has now definitively proved he's not just a comedic film star, but can play serious roles too. Miles Teller is decent, but his character never particularly develops, he just stays the same for most of the duration. I was impressed with Ana de Armas too, after a fairly shallow role in Knock Knock, she provides a lot of the humanity here - although the writing really doesn't offer her character much depth. Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, does just about enough for his name to be on the posters.The best thing about War Dogs, for me, was Groth's editing - it's fast and flashing and churns through the early parts with solid montages and complimentary music. The script is natural, quick and funny too, though the issue with it is the resolve. After watching bad people do bad things, we want to see justice, which I felt wasn't delivered properly - maybe the movie is trying to be cool, but it ended up being cold.War Dogs is entertaining and punchy, but perhaps drags a little near the end. Despite Hill's hilarious laugh, I didn't enjoy being in the company of these characters enough.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>selling weapons is not nice kids business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'War Dogs' is the second movie 'inspired by a true story' that I have seen in the last 24 hours, and is actually the one that I liked better (the other one being 'The Infiltrator'). Its film-making style (director Todd Phillips) and its comic thriller approach fit well the month of August. If I am to chose one easier entertainment with no super-heroes or space-ships, and yet a film that raises serious issues this summer, I will recommend it (but of course, I did not see them all).I am not sure if 'War Dogs' will make it to too many Jewish film festivals, but the two lead characters are Jewish or better say one nice Jewish kid (acted by Miles Teller) and a one Jewish trouble-maker kid (acted by Jonah Hill) who meet about one year after high-school. The bad guy is already in weapons trade and he easily convinces the good guy to become an associate. It's the Bush-Cheney period, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan need arms, and the government seems to have privatized at least part of the guns and ammo supply chain and opened it to free competition. A golden business opportunity for many, including the couple of young entrepreneurs who start small, win bigger and bigger contracts, break more and more moral rules, laws and trade restrictions, move into bigger offices and houses, and ask themselves less and less questions about what is right and what is wrong to do in such business.The film is fun to watch. There is no great characters development, the characters are from the start to the end what they seem to be when they show up for the first time, but they are enjoyable, and Jonah Hill at least does here his best role on screen to date. Bradley Cooper also shows up in a small but key supporting role. Story telling has pace and humor, although I could have given up the off-screen story telling which tries to provide the personal and somehow moralizing perspective of the good guy. It seems to be a returning fashion in the American cinema which I frankly dislike. It usually hides lack of skills in setting the contest and telling the story, but it was not the case here.It's the final titles before the credits, the one that usually relate the characters on screen with the reality of the 'true story' and show the real faces of the 'heroes' that we have seen acted on screen, that made me click. So these guys, who sold lethal weapons that caused death in the battlefields of Iraq or Afghanistan, who tricked the government and the individuals fighting for what they believe is a just cause got a few years in jail (one of them) and a suspended sentence (the other one) and they are now selling their story in books and movies? Something is broken in our justice systems if the 'war dogs' selling illegal weapons to the conflict areas are not punished. This film is not a masterpiece, but at least it causes to some of us to ask the right questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for HBO for this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tepid, funny at times, thriller about two criminals that attempt to defraud the US during war time. We get incredibly overweight Johah Hill back on the big screen playing a character of almost multiple personalities that has zero moral integrity. Miles Teller, who is trying to remain relevant in Hollywood, plays what seems to be a lesser evil person (and the somewhat moral compass of this story) but his character also agrees to defraud the US government. Hollywood seems taken with making movies about massive scum buckets (see Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short, etc.) These two guys are certainly near the top of that list. Regardless of these characters lack of morals, the story is moderately interesting and has a few exciting scenes. If you stumble across it on HBO in the future and there is nothing else to see, it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat Funny, but Riddled with Clichs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn't fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clichs, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you're trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.War Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill's performances are great in this film.While Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you've seen it before. That shouldn't be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it's characters into clichs, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could've been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.Above that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it's a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it's intended mark on both ends, in that it's not as funny as it'd like to be nor is it as damning. In the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it's not really that, if you're expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it's not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on clichs, stereotypes, and doesn't offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn't supply a ton of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like an odd pairing of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a war pic, but real great pic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, It was a lot more serious than what I expected after seeing the trailer. It's not the first time I've seen either Miles Teller or Jonah Hill in something more dramatic, I just may have assumed their first real outing together in a movie would be more of a straight up comedy.Semi based on a true story of two young guys from Miami who became arms dealers, Miles Teller narrates the story of how David Packouz teamed up with this best friend from the tenth grade, Efraim Diveroli and got in too over his head.I was expecting more comedy from the two rather than just two young stars being entertaining. The movie is not disappointing with the team of Teller and Hill. If you are a fan of either one of these guys you are going to love the film.Jonah Hill gives a performance that seem to be something between what he did in 21 Jump Street and the Wolf of Wall Street. The part just fits him so well as he plays a con man who tries to be everyone to everything on the outside but is really evil in the inside, and no matter how much you discover about his evil, Hill still makes the character likable.But the likability is more met for Miles Teller, who Hill is supporting with greatness. Teller plays the sympathetic role of a man whose lost in his life at a time when his girl is about to have a baby, and he needs the money.Director, Todd Phillips weaves a story about how people have profited from the war, and done bad things to profit from a bad war. It's almost like the Big Short, with it's explanation about how the arms game really works, but I always felt that the actual story was getting overshadow by the personalities of the two stars worthy of watching.But overall, It is a very funny film and very entertaining, thanks to the Hill, Teller combohttp://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'War Dogs' Proves Life Is Often Stranger than Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy crap.That is my summary of War Dogs. The movie was produced by Todd Phillips?director of the Hangover movies?and Bradley Cooper. The truly crazy part, though, is that War Dogs is real-life. It's a story based on actual events, but if you didn't know that it wouldn't seem much different than one of the Hangover movies.The movie focuses on a two twenty-something friends in Miami Beach who become international arms dealers. Their company?AEY?leveraged a federal website to find and land lucrative contracts with the Pentagon. Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller) eventually landed a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military, but government corruption and some illegal decisions on their part proved to be their undoing.All of this went down only a few short years ago. Diveroli and Packouz?as AEY? were able to take advantage of an initiative implemented by the Bush administration to expand federal contract opportunities to small businesses. In 2011, however, the two were convicted of multiple counts of fraud. Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison, while Packouz was sentenced to seven months' house arrest.If you want all of the salacious details, read the lengthy feature article in Rolling Stone written by Guy Lawson. It was this article that first caught Todd Phillips attention and led to the War Dogs movie project.In a Q&amp;A following the screening I saw, Phillips and Cooper shared some of the back story and their experiences making the movie. Phillips said the project was built around the idea of Jonah Hill starring in from the beginning. In fact, Phillips said that he had actually been trying to work with Hill for years?revealing that he originally tried to get Hill to be in The Hangover as the younger brother. The role was eventually re-imagined as an older brother and given to Zach Galifianakis instead.It seems like a brilliant choice. I don't know how Efraim Diveroli acts in real life, but Hill seems like a natural in the role. Miles Teller also does an excellent job as Packouz?the character through whose eyes the movie is told.If you've seen the Hangover movies, you know how that group of friends manages to get into a lot of trouble resulting from a series of comical errors and bad decisions. That's pure fiction, though. Phillips relayed the story of how he first learned about and became interested in this story. "I remember, I was literally flying to Bangkok?we were shooting Hangover 2?and I read it in Rolling Stone just like anybody. I just couldn't?the thing that attracted me is I couldn't believe it was real, honestly. It just felt like it was one of those, um?you know, if it was a piece of fiction in The New Yorker I would have said, 'Oh. That's a cool story. Cool characters. But, it's so unbelievable it kind of doesn't work.'" The Q&amp;A moderator asked, "Bradley, when you found out about the story, was there anything that really surprised you? Where you were just like, 'This couldn't be true'?" Cooper replied, "Oh my&nbsp;God. Where do we start?" Granted, this is a movie that is "based on a true story", which means that there is some artistic license and embellishment for the sake of entertainment. Phillips stressed that this is not a documentary, but also shared that Lawson?who is more familiar with the story than just about anybody other than Efraim and David themselves?expressed that he was pleasantly surprised with the journalistic integrity of the film.War Dogs is an excellent movie. The acting is exceptional and the story is engaging. It is 114 minutes of entertainment that will be worth every penny you pay to see it. The fact that it is somehow a true story of two anonymous young men doing something extraordinary is just icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "War Dogs", starring Jonah Hill-The 21 Jump Street movies, Django Unchained; Miles Teller-The Divergent movies, Footloose_2011; Ana De Armas-Hands of Stone, Exposed; Kevin Pollak-Angel From Hell_tv, End of Days and Bradley Cooper-Joy, All About Steve.This movie is based on a true story about 2 young men-in their earlier 20's-living in Miami Beach, that sold guns &amp; ammo to the American Allies in Afghanistan in the 1980's. Jonah and Miles play the 2 childhood friends that get into the fascinating world of gun running. They started small and worked their way up to a $300 million contract with the U.S. government. Ana plays Miles wife. FYI: the real life person that Miles is portraying makes a cameo appearance in the movie as the guitar player in the old folks home that is singing, 'Don't Fear the Reaper' by BOC. Kevin plays a small businessman that backs the boys-financially-on some of their deals in return for a cut. Bradley plays another arms dealer that does business with Jonah &amp; Miles. Bradley is on a 'Watch' list, so he can't do business with the government himself. Some parts of the movie are interesting, some are predictable. There are lots of recognizable music in the soundtrack; I remember hearing songs by Vanilla Fudge, Aerosmith, The James Gang, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Wolfmother and The Who. It's rated "R" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 54 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Illegal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "War Dogs", Jonah Hill's Efraim says, "Just because it's not legal, doesn't make it illegal." Director and writer Todd Philip's "War Dogs" is smart, hysterical, and ultimately sad. It is based on a true story about two twenty-somethings (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill), who win a $300 million U.S. Government contract to supply arms in the War in Afghanistan. Phillips wrote the screenplay with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic based on a "Rolling Stone" article by Guy Lawson. The bizarre truth trumps fiction. During the Bush Administration, the "Cheney Law" allowed for small independent contractors to bid on U.S. Government armament contracts. Often these contracts were for weapons that were illegal or not readily obtained. So essentially the system is rigged; it encouraged entrepreneurs to leverage the heavy lifting of the arms black market. The Government doesn't care as long as they get their weapons, but just don't get caught. This is a big "but".Phillips brilliantly captures with hypocrisy and whimsy the turmoil engulfing his guys, David (Teller) and Efraim (Hill). The dudes openly chose this work, and the possible consequences. However, the money is not easy to dismiss. In an Albanian warehouse David and Efraim verify that the $100,000 additional cost will result in $3 million more profit. Hill provides the right arrogance and paranoia in Efraim, who loves living large. Teller reminds of a young John Cusack. He is the decent everyday man caught up in overwhelming circumstance. Teller as David is knowingly seduced by the dark side, and he shows remnants of his noble conscience. Here that makes a difference for us. David is also beholding to Iz (solid Ana de Armas), his girl friend and mother of their child. Iz seems to believe whatever benefits her?perplexing to David. Bradley Cooper has a showcase role as slick arms dealer Henry Girard. Cooper amazingly balances Henry's ruthlessness offset with a weird code of honor. Cooper's performance punctuates a theme of the movie that things are not always what they seem. "War Dogs" is visually stunning. There are magnificent aerial shots of the Jordan desert as the dudes cross the "Triangle of Death" to deliver Berettas in Iraq. The scenes in dark and cold Albania express the starkness and emptiness of the mood. The visuals enhance the exacting details of Phillip's story. Predictably, "War Dogs" is a cautionary tale. However, it is told with wit, humor, and a sense of compassion. The hypocrisy lies within the system. And here are two guys making a fortune. Teller, Hill, and Cooper are great. "War Dogs" is worth a watch and more thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War Dogs is the definition of 'okay'. It's not terrible but its nowhere near good. It lacks its own identity and the filmmaker struggles to know what it is trying to say, trying to do, or trying to be, including its approach to storyline, the characters and the genre. It doesn't work as a comedy, or a serious drama, and doesn't handle the content well enough to call itself a satire. Still, it has decent performances and isn't too troubling, even if it reminds me of the horror of The Big Short. I am still a little flummoxed as to what the film is/was trying to say, even upon reflection but perhaps that's just my understanding of it. It's a film that will work for some more than others but when you have free tickets, you wouldn't turn it down.REVIEW: http://bit.ly/2bGrDxb</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hill has put the weight back on. If you are board, start counting the "F" bombs, it could be a record number. The movie starts with a flash back and it is so long in returning to that scene you almost forgot you were watching a story in flashback. There are anti- Semitic overtones that are not subtle.Forget the flaws and enjoy a well told story that takes you to interesting places. There is comedy, action, and some serious issues. The performances are serviceable but nobody works too hard. It was interesting to learn that one of the individuals that the story is based on does the folk singing in the home scene. The movie plays well on the big screen and comedy works best in a shared audience experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the hell out of this. This is really just my cup of tea. After reviews came out I was a bit skeptical, but after seeing it I really don't get it. This was a great film. I had a total blast.This film reminded me a lot of Pain &amp; Gain, as many others have compared it to. I love crime flicks like this, that deal with excess and the American dream. I think this film is a great satire, and love when it tackles the absurdity of the whole situation. A character tells another he's on a terrorist watch list, and doesn't even bat an eye to it. Sure we've seen films like this and it's not that original, but it does an excellent job of what it's trying to accomplish.Jonah Hill is fantastic in this film. Definitely one of his best performances. He really just commands the screen. I really think Jonah is deserving of another Oscar nod for this. Of course he won't get one, but one could hope. Miles Teller is very good as well, and the both of them have great chemistry. The film had a decent amount of laughs, but isn't as much the comedy it's made out to be in trailers. It still works when the tone gets serious, as it blends drama and comedy very well.I really found the story to be very fascinating and from what I hear, critics say Todd Phillips did it no justice. I haven't read about the true story, but I think he did a damn fine job. Maybe it's a bit on the nose, if I have an issue with it. The ending is very similar to other films like this, like The Wolf of Wall Street and Pain &amp; Gain. While definitely not as incredible as The Wolf of Wall Street is, I seriously loved this movie. It may be my favorite of the year. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Dogs has some shiny weapons and story: it needed more ammunition to fire off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funding the military is expensive. We have bases all over the world, each with facilities and housing for those solders. Each solider (over a million of them) is carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment and weaponry. I bring this up because war may be a travesty, but it's a business opportunity itself. Several companies are out and about to generate the best material for the armed forces to use, and to do so in an inexpensive way. While I doubt I could ever get into that business (personal morals would prevent me), I can see why gunrunning would seem attractive to those that want the high life. The subjects within War Dogs are gunrunners, but they're also very young. Their college aged, which would make their maturity a big question. The good news is that if your smart enough, then age doesn't matter. What matter's is how well your know your clientele and the best manner to negotiate with. The early 2000's was a period of two wars; the War on Terror in the Middle East and the Invasion of Iraq. Both would obviously require some ammunition. Let's see how the real life subjects handled these ends in War Dogs. Starting off in 2005 in Miami, David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) is a guy with little direction. He dropped out of college, has failed in a business selling sheets to retirement homes, and makes a small living as a massage therapist. While attending a funeral for a friend, he spots his middle school buddy Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill). The two meet up where we find out that the two did bad things in their youth and Efraim's parents sent him away to work with his uncle's arms business. Efraim has now returned and tells David about his new business venture?the war.Despite not agreeing with the war, David comes on board when his girlfriend Iz becomes pregnant. Efraim shows him how they acquire these contracts: the Pentagon has a website a lot like a job search site where they have thousands of listings for businesses to put a bid into. They manage to acquire contracts from Bagdad to Albania where they stay true to their word and become millionaires overnight. As Efriam's company gets bigger, his greed grows (along with a drug addiction) and tensions rise when David is forced to live in Albania to secure a 30 million deal with a terrorist watch list candidate Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).The idea of irresponsible people getting into a shady business and rising in that world is nothing new. Scarface did this (and is referenced several times. The Wolf of Wall Street, The Lord of War and Pain &amp; Gain did this. What does War Dogs have to offer that's new? The movie brings these two guys who are played well by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. The movie shows that these guys would be smart enough to pull off these government deals by day while going to Miami nightclubs at night. War Dogs is a nice looking movie. Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy) has a way of shooting his comedies like thrillers. A lot of that has to do with how he uses lighting. His colorful shooting of Miami becomes brighter once we arrive in the bleaker and grayer Albania. For his first mature story, Todd Phillips found a good blend of political problems, comedy, and some surprising thrills. What's lacking is a closer study at the relationship between these two. With what could have been a dramatic look into these two young men is more of a party. At least what they say can be interesting at times.I'll give this six machine guns out of ten. I can't say that War Dogs is an intelligent insight into how the government acquires its weaponry, but its still an entertaining look at some smart individuals. This needed a Martin Scorsese like director to really help this take off. I can still have fun with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed War Dogs. The film has Todd Phillip's visual style throughout that has been displayed in his previous films, which is a professional glossy feel. The acting went from just being OK to good as the film went on. The first act suffered the most, not only story wise but acting wise. As the film got going both aspects started to kick into gear.The film reminded me a little of Lord of War for obvious story reasons but in tone reasons as well. I like learning about these type of situations and stories that seem to slip through the cracks of our observed society and to learn how these issues actually drastically affect our world society. War Dogs accomplishes this for me. The tone comes with a comedic and light heart-ed "fun" of the subject but it still brings a darker serious side as well, and when I left the theater it kept me thinking of how the world is and operators.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An energetic and fun gun-running trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With one of those true life stories that you'd never believe had it not actually happened at its disposal, Old School and The Hangover director Todd Phillips and his capable duo of Miles Teller (in need of a hit) and the scenery chewing Jonah Hill (going all method on us) make War Dogs an entertaining and quick-fire experience that shines a light on an interesting aspect of White House law and how strange our modern warfare has become. A dark comedy filled to the brim with deplorable and colourful characters, language and drug addled life lessons, War Dogs is one of those somewhat uneasy hybrids that flirts the line between becoming and out and out drama or an outright comedy and while Phillips at times finds his directional abilities tested in a tale that has a number of different aspects going on at any one time the story of best friends turned gun running business partners David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli is brought to life by Teller and Hill thanks to their considerable talents and the two actors know doubt elevate the material at their disposal to another level.The talents of these two performers has been evident in such tales as Whiplash, The Spectacular Now, The Wolf of Wall Street and Moneyball and while War Dogs won't be going down on their all-time greatest list and Hill has a tendency to take things a little too far (his Efraim is a nigh on irremediably arrogant creature and his laugh is a little much) the two work up a good cooperation on screen and when they're both doing their thing from a near suicidal gun run through the Iraq wastelands or conducting a government meeting while far from clear headed, War Dogs is a film owned by the actors.Who would've thought that two mid 20 year old's with a tendency for drugs, alcohol and massages could've become arms dealers for the United States Government but War Dogs makes good use of its bizarre yet true story and while the film isn't as smart as it perhaps thinks it is, this is a fun and breezy experience that would make for a great double bill with the underrated Nichols Cage starrer Lord of War. 3 ? golden grenades out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before I start this review, I would like to thank the person who messaged me and said that they enjoy my reviews. I would reply to you personally, but for some reason my account will not verify. If you are reading this, I thank you because your message really meant a lot to me!"War Dogs" stars Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, and is an absolute blast and no doubt the best movie of the summer. First off, Jonah Hill's performance is so energetic, hilarious, and fun to watch. I don't want to spoil anything about his character, but let's just say he's very unpredictable, and very funny. He has some lines in this movie that will make you bust a gut laughing, and he's also surprisingly cool. He has a great scene involving drug dealers that I won't spoil, but it's one of the most entertaining scenes of the film. Miles Teller plays more of the serious man in this role, and he is just as good. He gives a compelling, sympathetic, and believable performance, and the relationship between him and his girlfriend, Ana de Armas, (who is probably the most beautiful person on the planet) is sweet to watch, and I enjoyed the romance and drama between them.The chemistry between Miles and Jonah felt real; they felt like childhood friends, and you could tell they had fun playing off of each other. Jonah felt like the person everyone wanted to be, while Miles felt like the person everyone became. In other words, Jonah was the fantasy and Miles was the reality, if that makes any sense. However you want to word it, the dichotomy between them worked well and they were both supremely entertaining.Also, Bradley Cooper has a small role in this movie, and he delivers what is probably the coolest line of the entire movie. He was so good, and I wish he played a more prominent role in the film, but what we got of him was great.While this movie is marketed as a comedy, it is more of a very fun and interesting drama with some really funny moments. "War Dogs" is pretty much non-stop fun from start to finish, and is, in my opinion, the best film that Todd Phillips has made so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull movie with no new ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a movie about international gun runners? Sign me up! Is what I was saying going into the film. Coming out was a different story. As is the story with many movies so far this year, 'War Dogs' is a boring mess of a movie. If you saw 'The infiltrator' or read my review you know I hated that film. And for the same reasons I hate that film, I hate this one. Except this one has the nerve to be nearly identical to the far superior 'Wolf Of Wall Street'. This movie hits all the same beats and story lines that Scorseses near masterpiece does. The difference between the two is that this one is neither funny nor entertaining to watch. It is quite possibly one of the most dull, lifeless, boring films I have seen this year. Every time something funny or stressful could have happened it just cuts to another scene. Or, even more upsetting, ques up a voice over track from Teller. It blatantly skips over possible character building scenes in favor of out of place, lazy voice overs.I don't think I would be lying when I say that there is more voice overs here than in 'Knight of Cups'. Which literally had not script. Why the choice was made to do this really comes down to laziness. There is no other reason to explain why it couldn't just let scenes play out. Not only was there countless voice overs that robbed scenes of tension, but it also did chapter kind of things.Every twenty minutes or so a black screen with a sentence appeared on screen, describing what we were about to see. Just like the voice work, it didn't seem to have a point to it. It just felt like it didn't know how to transfer to the next scene so it threw in these random titles. They came from no where and served literally no purpose other than to tell you what was going to happen before it did.But what was I expecting? Right from the first few scenes this film has jarring tones that clash with each other from scene to scene. The first shot of the movie is a tense scene involving a kidnapping and it cuts immediately to a stylized, scene with a pop song playing over top. It is a completely jarring tonal shift that is off and on through out the film. And, much like 'Suicide Squad' it has no idea how to place a song in a scene.The songs it chooses are good on their own but, the scenes they are used in makes me hate them. All but maybe once were they used appropriately. It's sad that films have decided to just throw in pop songs to try and get a bigger audience instead of making a score that works in the film. It never helps the story move forward, they are all just kind of there.That being said, nothing could have saved this story. As I said, it's exactly like 'Wolf of Wall Street'. But it's not near as fun nor does it have the interesting character study that 'Wall Street' has. It has Jonah Hill and Miles Teller furiously trying to make the dialogue they have sound organic. Yet, it's so poorly written that these Oscar worthy actors come across with little chemistry and sound like morons while doing it.There isn't much that redeems this film. It's mostly well shot and these two performances aren't to bad. Other than that everything fails. It's poorly written, horribly boring, offers no interesting characters, and fails to deliver any comedic moments. It's one of those movies that thinks it's so much better than it is. It wants to be great and desperately tries to be but falls flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This years we wish we were Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I'm not sure why they have tried to label this movie a comedy. It really isn't funny nor does it seem like a comedy in any way shape or form. Like much of Hill's earlier work, it's just not funny. It's another Hill movie where he is type caste into the roll where he is some sort of sleazy bad guy doing anything for money. Not sure why he keeps getting those rolls as frankly, he's not every good in them. There are drugs, they drop the F bomb a whole ton because you know those things are "cool" and are what make a movie, and there of course there is the back drop of a story about guns. If you can't tell i'm being sarcastic there. The whole movie is shot in the same style and manner as GoodFella's was, much like wolf of wall st tried to copy (but came up short) and they are obviously trying to capture into that style of movie. To be honest the movie idea is interesting in the sense that it goes into the story of these two guys running guns based off a true story. But it really falls short in that you can see right through the movie as being another type caste movie of that type. There is nothing ground breaking in this movie and frankly the casting simply isn't that good. Hill frankly just isn't capable of really pulling off these characters (I'm kind of shocked people are still putting him in movies), and his co-star is really a sub par actor not capable of really playing the other side of the role. There are a lot of reasons why this movie seems to sink. The bad acting is one of them, but the main reason really seems to be on the script. We have seen this story before.....many times before. It's old and worn. They added nothing really new to it, and frankly didn't do it nearly as good as the ones that really stand out that were done before it. There really is a lot missing here in order to really make this a must see movie. I don't know if the story itself is just not that interesting to actually be put on film or that they couldn't do anything creative with it. What I do know is that none of the characters stood out and make me think that will be an epicly remembered character or story line. It's something to watch if you are bored but if you are looking for a good movie, this simply isn't it. In a summer full of really disappointing and bad movies this is another one to throw into the trash can.</fullReview>

You know the train wreck is going to happen, you just cannot help watch the wreck out of a morbid curiosity. War Dogs has stereotypes, ugly characters, and even nastier real life experiences. War Dogs is a buddy story of, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. When someone has a friend who a bad influence you know there is going to be trouble. No matter what the good intentions are you know the bad influence can not help but be himself. Everyone looks bad in War Dogs, governments, people and arms dealers. I felt the slime just ooze out! The moral message of easy money with fast people comes with a price hits hard! A good moral in of family/wife over money. War Dogs is directed at a fast pace, which transitions from sub story to sub story well. The Packouz/Diveroli characters create a synergy which drives a character driven story about decidence and greed. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Gun Runs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After three Hangover films, two progressively worse than the first, and after another shift in the popularity of comedy films, you'd think that we had seen the last of Todd Phillips. But here he returns with War Dogs, a film that doesn't include Tigers in bathrooms, Mike Tyson karaoke, or men over the age of 40 waking up the next morning wondering what the hell they did the night before. This time, it's guns, ammo, drugs, the Iraq War, The Bush administration, fraud, corruption, greed and a group of violent Albanian mobsters. This is no laughing matter. This is Phillips' first attempt at making a truly serious film, while supplying his familiar style of dark comedy. But when you factor in the freeze-frame shots, the narrations, the soundtrack of classic rock tunes, the violence and the drugs, this film is nothing short of a love letter to Martin Scorsese. I kid you not, that's what this film is. Roll your eyes all you want, but it's a style of filmmaking that always works, especially when you're making something based on a true story. Paul Thomas Anderson did it with Boogie Nights, David O. Russell did it with American Hustle, Adam McKay did it with The Big Short.. and so on, and so on. I'll never dislike a movie that attempts to emulate Scorsese, no matter how blatant it could be. War Dogs succeeds with this formula, up to a certain point. When it comes to the political angle that the film takes, it wants you to believe that it's smarter than it actually is. It takes it's aim at the military industrial complex under Bush, but with the rise of a non- interventionalist foreign policy embraced by both parties, thanks to Trump and Sanders, this kind of subject is hardly daring. You're preaching to the converted, Todd. We all know that the Iraq War sucked. The edge is simply not there, but the performances and the writing make up for it. Teller and Hill have tremendous chemistry. They make believable brothers. Jonah Hill in particular is mesmerizing, creepy and totally hilarious. If this was a much better picture, you'd probably be hearing a lot of award buzz surrounding his performance. I really enjoyed Bradley Cooper's interesting bad-guy character. In short, it's a fairly entertaining, fairly long, and not too bad time at the movies, but it doesn't break any new ground, and it's nothing to rave about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to this movie I had little expectations, I was expecting some average or sub par movie with a plot holes, silly laughs and the odd nudity. It was certainly marketed to be like this to some extent. But what I got was a very well executed and entertaining film, its safe to say it far exceeded expectations.War dogs is a great story about two friends who partner up and become international arms dealers landing a huge Afghan contract to supply arms to American allies. The film contains the right amount of drama as well as some good doses of humor thrown in such as Jonah Hill's eccentric laugh throughout the film. The humor works very well but at the same time it is an entertaining drama with some very good scenes such as the one where the two protagonists escape gunfire in Iraq when they were delivering weapons. The film has elements of a Greek tragedy similar to what we have seen with Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street that depicts the rise, glory and eventual downfall of the characters with the FBI eventually showing up at your door. The soundtrack was also very good and the performances were great. Teller and Hill may not deserve an Oscar but they deserve a nomination. Their characters were developed nicely and you could feel the tension throughout the movie. I would say this movie would definitely satisfy the viewer and leave you pleasantly surprised.

		<shortDescription>Dark Comedic Take on Iraq Gun Runners - What Could Have Been?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. The screenplay was extremely promising. A true story of two 20 something stoners turned gun runners during the Iraq War, and it was directed by Todd Phillips? Will this go the way of Spotlight, or even The Wolf of Wall Street?It does not reach the acclaim of either of those two films, but I will say that it makes for an entertaining watch. War Dogs borders on the seriousness of Spotlight, but also includes the debauchery of Wolf. And that's not a bad thing, but it cheaply cashes out instead of digging deeper.Phillips took many creative liberties with the story. Take a look at the original Rolling Stone piece, or any other article and you'll see exactly what I am talking about.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller portray the two real life runners, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, despite looking nothing like them. They are here for the laughs. Both offer plenty, but Teller's character provides a seriousness to counter Hill's Scarface persona. They create a dynamic buddy pairing that neither is bad, nor great.Phillips picked a screenplay that is so interesting, it would be very difficult to screw up. He avoids doing so by instead taking the safe route. For more substance, check out the movie's inspiration, the book "Arms and the Dudes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'WAR DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'men behaving badly' comedy flick from writer/director/producer Todd Phillips (the man who also brought us 'OLD SCHOOL', 'ROAD TRIP', 'DUE DATE' and all three 'HANGOVER' movies). The film is based on a Rolling Stone article, by Guy Lawson, about two twenty-something arms dealers, that land a U.S. contract to supply weapons to Afghanistan military forces. Phillips directed, co- produced and co-wrote the movie; with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic. It stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak and Bradley Cooper (who also co-produced the flick). The movie's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's done mildly well at the Box Office. I liked it, but it's definitely no 'HANGOVER' (it is far better than it's two sequels though).David Packouz (Teller) was working (unhappily) as a massage therapist, in Miami Beach during the Iraq War. His girlfriend Iz (Armas) unexpectedly became pregnant, and David decided he desperately needed a new source of income. So when he runs into his old childhood friend, Efraim Diveroli (Hill), at another old friend's funeral, he learns he can make a lot of money selling guns to the U.S. military (like Efraim already is). The two form a partnership, and get rich (really fast), but they also run into some serious problems.The movie is only loosely based on true events; a lot of it is entirely made up (which makes for a more entertaining film, of course). It's nice to see Phillips branching out as a filmmaker (and I really wasn't impressed with the two 'HANGOVER' sequels), and it's also cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain. Teller is perfectly cast as the relatable lead, but he's capable of much more than this though ('WHIPLASH' is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion). This film is fun (at times), and kind of interesting. It's a little too dark, to be a lot of fun though, and a little too light, to be really interesting (in a very serious way, anyway). The performances are good though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trigger Warning(s): IslamophobiaCharacters Worth Noting David (Miles Teller) | Efraim (Jonah Hill) | Iz (Ana de Armas)Main Storyline22-year-old David is living with a cute girlfriend, who he recently got pregnant, is a college dropout, failed entrepreneur, and his sole steady paycheck is rubbing the bodies of older men. Men who like to tease him a little bit. As you can imagine, he is frustrated with how his life has turned out. That is, until Efraim, his friend from when he was a kid, pops up at a mutual acquaintance's funeral and they hang out. Efraim shows off this grandeur lifestyle and of course, David wants in. He has a kid on the way, wants to do right by his girlfriend Iz, and doesn't want to struggle. No, he'd rather trade in his morals in order to obtain the mighty dollar. Hell, even to benefit Iz and his child, he'd lie to her if he had to, and he does.Thing is, when you have two young men with a huge amount of ambition, willing to fib or outright lie to get ahead, it has to catch up with them eventually right?HighlightsHill has mastered crafting someone you love to hate. Efraim, no matter what aspect of his personality or business side, is someone you can't inherently stand. He is a professional con artist with a polarizing laugh which will either crack you up or annoy the hell out of you. On top of that, he is a pro at being selfish. He will adapt to the minimum required to get what he wants out of you, and then play you for a fool. Reminding you that despite some really odd and questionable films in Hill's filmography, he has been in the game for over a decade and certainly has learned a thing or two.Low PointsPerhaps the main problem of this film is that on top of the trailer giving away most of the best parts of the movie, the trailer sells you an action comedy. Making it so when Teller is left to present, mostly on his own, the film's dramatic elements, he almost seems like a liability. For with Hill, being his usual comical self, like a borderline caricature of what supposedly is a real person, it makes David's issues that Teller is trying to portray feel unwelcomed.David is trying to make money for his family and Efraim is trying to get his full hour with a prostitute. David is trying to be a good father and boyfriend, and Efraim is flipping out because someone corrects him in a meeting about IBM just being a random set of letters. I mean, the straight man and the fool works in a lot of movies, but it doesn't here. For on top of Teller trying to bring you the drama, and not doing so well at that, you are left wondering why this story, in particular, was important to tell? What makes two kids, barely old enough to drink, worth making a movie about? That question is never really answered.Going back to the topic of Teller in this film, as I wrote this review, I was questioning that with how much Hill gets to eclipse Teller in this film, could it be Teller has lost his luster? Maybe that charm and possible IT factor wasn't all him? Could it be that with his co-star in Whiplash being a supporting role challenging him or his past love interest focused complimenting his character, could that have been it? Could it be that when someone isn't cast to support or compliment his character, but rather just make their character the one remembered after the credits roll, is Teller no longer the type of lead I, admittedly, took him for?Either way, be it the movie selling one thing and you buying another, Hill and Teller's having unbalanced chemistry, or simply Teller bearing all the weight of bringing a dramatic element to this film, even if this film is "Based on a True Story," you never get why this one, in particular, was an important one to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I dropped out of high school before they covered international diplomacy."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Packouz (Miles Teller) has an unfulfilling career as a massage therapist in Miami - and just spent his life's savings on a bad investment of luxury bedsheets. When he discovers his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) is pregnant, David knows he needs a more profitable vocation. Partnering with old friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) in his fledgling arms dealing company (amusingly dubbed AEY, without actually being an acronym) seems risky, but after the money starts pouring in, David is hooked. As the contracts to procure weapons for the U.S. government steadily get larger and more dangerous, David finds himself creating increasingly extravagant lies to keep Iz from the truth. When the company lands a three-hundred-million-dollar deal to supply munitions to soldiers in Afghanistan, the rapidly accelerating deception, mistrust, and peril surrounding his job begin to tear David's world apart."War Dogs" corresponds to so many other films that it practically fits as a companion piece to be watched in conjunction with other features. Like "The Big Short" for the 2008 involvement in the arming of Afghanistan forces, and as a supplementation to "Charlie Wilson's War," the film also works as additional commentary on white collar crime, a la "The Wolf of Wall Street." It's the flashy, modern, hip, comic representation of armed conflict, utilizing lines like "eBay for war" and "Comic-Con with grenades" to spruce up the dark subject matter of gun-running, fraudulent shell companies, and the Pentagon's intentional blind-eye policies toward Middle Eastern ally armament. After all, it's directed by the man who brought audiences "Old School" and "The Hangover," so comedy is expected to be kneaded into the plot - even when it doesn't fit."I dropped out of high school before they covered international diplomacy." There's something curiously incongruous with the amount of levity witnessed in these particularly morbid affairs, though this occasionally gives the film its wit and uniqueness. In other moments, its enough that Jonah Hill dons an obnoxious laugh. The problem with sustained humor is that nothing can be taken as seriously as it ought to be, which discounts the moments that are supposed to be thrilling. Despite the movie opening to the narrator being pulled out of a trunk, beaten, and facially prodded by a handgun, a violent payoff is replaced by general timidity. Sequences that shouldn't need or require laughs are forcibly given morsels of merriment - to an uneasy effect. This carries over to the familial melodrama of a newborn and a wife, who conveniently shuts up when money begins rolling in, only to reappear later when that cash grows to uncomfortable excesses (even though it's never specified to what degree - and at what speed - they become rich) to voice her disapproval. The character of Iz is surely an invention for the plot, solely included to humanize Packouz, even though she's the most unbelievable element of the whole "true" story.But the screenplay is entirely sufficient to maintain the two-hour runtime, shifting between snappy one-liners and the humor inherent in such grotesque governmental shortcomings as the ones examined here (many of AEY's actions were in compliance with laws), and youthful opportunists taking advantage of horribly failed political predicaments. Even though the introduction of David's demeaning masseuse job and desperate bedclothes scheme are orchestrated for contrast, the film has an odd way of making the paradisaical Miami Beach seem just as dangerous as bullet-riddled Fallujah. Indeed, the perils in both locations seem equivalent, considering scenes of theft and assault endured in Florida. The narration doesn't help (it really should be Efraim's story, not David's); the self-proclaimed bottom-feeders aren't given many opportunities to redeem themselves, even down to the final sequence, which casts further doubts on the more remorseful of the two; and the very mixed message about crime not paying (because it truly does) isn't supported by the lenient punishments. But there's nevertheless something intriguing about average guys with desk jobs spontaneously transforming into literal gun runners through war-torn Iraq, especially with Teller and Hill imparting their expected, quirky routines into this unbelievable yet reality-based yarn.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well made war comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Philips has done a fine job in creating a nice War Comedy. There haven't been many decent war comedies in the recent times.War dogs is about two young kids who exploit the not-so-good government initiative in becoming arms dealers, in the process getting greedy and in trouble. Based on a real life story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan, the director has done a great job in converting a dry story into an entertaining movie.Jonah Hill keeps up the comedy of the film through out. Miles Teller, an under rated actor proves yet again that he can be a great actor in this one. Bradley Cooper's character is well crafted and is entertaining till the end. The supporting characters have done a decent job.This wouldn't be on top movies but sure is a fun watch in summer. my rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good story told beautifully well !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a chance to see this movie in an early screening. I am not a big fan of Jonah Hills body of work (nor do I hate his work); nevertheless, he has managed to surprise me in big productions like WoWS, Moneyball and Django. He stole the show in this one. He embodied the character so well that I actually forgot that he is the same guy from 21 Jump Street and Superbad. The swag he carried was unbelievable. His laugh is unforgettable! The story is portrayed from the POV of Miles Teller's character David Packouz who is a deadbeat albeit honest bed sheet salesman and a "certified" massage therapist who is drawn into a shady world of arms dealing by Efraim (JH). He learns the ins and outs of the trade and helps their partnership grow and make tons of money. What happens during and after is for you to find out. Its an insanely fun ride. Cameo by Bradley Cooper, which btw not insignificant at all, as a sly but deadly operator is also memorable. All in all I enjoyed the movie a lot. Much better than all the superhero mania that's been going around this year. A mark of a good movie is that it keeps you engaged and keeps you wondering what happens next, and it avoids scenes where you go, "oh, come on!" (like you did when Superman went, "Martha!"), and it did all that. Not comparing to any of the blockbusters to be fair, but this movie stands on its own. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily my favorite film so far this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually at least 8 films on my 10 best list are released from October 1st on, but this one will sure make the list this year.If you are like me and thought that The Big Short should have won Best Picture last year and that in 2014 The Wolf of Wall Street should have won, and that " Lord of War" is one of the most underrated films of all time, you will love War DogsMaybe not as good as those two Oscar films but awfully darned close. and better than The Lord of War.Funny , Suspenseful, extremely insightful, and though set during 2005- 2008 it has a soundtrack from the 60-80s that is pitch perfect.Loved Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Teller is the best actor of his generation. Though this is probably not going to be his best performance this year. I have a feeling his performance in that Boxing film is Oscar bait. Jonah Hill plays the sort of character that he is best known for, but who cares he does it so well. I was not familiar with the female lead Ana De Armas, but she is mesmerizing.Bradley Cooper was terrific in a relatively small role as well.I can see hundreds of twenty somethings wanting to become War Dogs after seeing this film, but I a pretty certain that window of opportunity is closed. This has been a pretty disappointing year so far in film. My guilty pleasure was Tarzan, and I really liked Sing Street and 10 Cloverfield Lane but this is my first ten of the year. Maybe I should only have given it a 9, but I it certainly is the best film released in the last eight months, and you gotta give a 10 once in awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Story That Might Anger Some Viewers With Shock &amp; Awe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ripped from the news, this movie is the story of 2 twenty-something guys who went into the arms peddling business in 2005 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It tells the story in the first person with Miles Teller (David Packouz) narrating it throughout. The film packs a lot of surprising things into it and is one of the better told true story tales spun on film this year.The writers who did the screen play were also writers on The Hangover and they know how to tell a story and make it into comedy. What is strange is how the truth can be funny and is most of the way through until the conclusion where things do get serious. It is spun here as a quite incredible story.The anger of some viewers might be in how inept the Military and W Bush administration are presented. W Bush does not come off looking great here by any stretch. Efraim (Jonah Hill) and David (Teller) do not appear to be very intelligent, and yet they manage to make a lot of money because of the system set up to provide weapons in the Middle East conflicts. When it is put together overall, Government waste in these wars is massive, and it appears that it was quite easy to make money on the US Government.Is there comedy? Yes, some of the situations are quite funny, and the narration is spot on in telling the story. There are no weak spots in the story, as this is story telling the way it should be done. It is easy to follow and does not get lost. There is one scene at the beginning which David is getting a gun to his head. Then the story goes back to the start and goes through everything logically. It does get back to the gun, though I think the first opening of the film is not needed but does attract the viewers attention.This is an important film which is very much worth going too. It is not a waste of time by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Jonah Hill's laugh is highly contagious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the viewer sees the story through the eyes of hard working father-to-be David Packouz (played by Miles Teller), it really is the quality performance of Jonah Hill's portrait of slick arms dealer Efraim Diveroli the audience will remember long after the credits roll. I could not think of any more suitable actor to play the role of greedy, talkative and merciless yet funny and charismatic businessman than Jonah Hill. Think of The Wolf of Wall Street, but this time Jonah claims Leo's part as leader of the pack. This doesn't mean Miles' part is meaningless, it is the contrast between these two characters that works really well. Miles Teller is the right guy to play the role of the shy and gullible young father struggling with his conscience when his former tenth grade buddy comes along shaking his world upside down. Altogether the casting for this film was good, except for Bradley Cooper, which I found not very convincing as a bad guy with a forced foreign accent.The movie is based on a true story and although the plot may be exaggerated and exalted, this is not the kind of biography that is all about an accurate display of events. It's an action comedy intending to make you laugh. And oh, it definitely will! Especially when Jonah came up with his high-pitched laughs, I could not witness anyone in the audience able to resist this contagious laugh. All in all this is a great movie if you just want to have a great night out with your friends and you're not looking for a movie with dark complex story lines yet you're also not into the Adam-Sandler-ish cheesy kind of comedy. There is still enough substance and drama to enjoy besides the jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious comedy, that also has some superb dramatic moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War Dogs tells the true story of two men in their 20s named, Efraim Diveroli(Jonah Hill) &amp; David Packouz(Miles Teller). Efraim &amp; David realize that they can make easy money, by selling guns &amp; other war equipment to the American military. Soon the two childhood friends make a name for themselves &amp; land a major million dollar contract to sell different kinds of guns &amp; ammunition to the military. However, things don't quite go according to plan. War Dogs is a fantastic film. This movie has many extremely funny scenes. The one-liners will crack you up. However, what really makes this film stand out from all the other adult comedies is that, it has a beautiful emotional core. This makes you care about all the main characters in the film. The dramatic moments in the movie, are as powerful as the comedic moments. The only flaw in this movie is that, it's not as funny as it could have been. The performances are the highlight of the film. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Efraim Diveroli. Hill continues to masterfully balance comedy &amp; drama, after his role in The Wolf of Wall Street(2013). Miles Teller is outstanding as David Packouz. Teller brings an irresistible dry humor to his role. The chemistry between Hill &amp; Teller is effortless. It really feels like they are childhood friends. Ana de Armas is awesome as Iz. Bradley Cooper is amazing in his small yet significant role, as Henry Girard. Shaun Toub is great as Marlboro. Director Todd Phillips has successfully made an adult comedy/drama, after two continuous sequels &amp; four full fledged adult comedies. Kudos! War Dogs is a must watch. Go, laugh until your sides hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but Superficial !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An hour into War Dogs last nite, I was wondering what is tone of the movie director Todd Philips and the writers (incl him) trying to maintain. At one moment I thought, the movie is trying to be another 'The Wolf of Wall Street' while another moment, I could see 'The Social Network'. And throughout the film, you could see references to many other Hollywood films. But where the director misses the cut is that The Wolf of Wall Street and Social Network had an emotional core which War Dogs doesn't have. At any moment, one doesn't feel sad or bad for the main leads nor feel their anxiety or happiness. However, the film is one joy ride from start to end if you're ready to overlook the lack of core as I did.Its a fabulous true life story of two 20 year old Jews who become arms suppliers for the US Govt. And in one fabulous sequence, they drive from Jordan to Iraq with truck laden with guns to deliver to the US Army.Another highlight of the film is that the director never takes sides. He doesn't tell us the war is bad or how poorly the US Govt awards defence contracts. The performance by the leads is the icing on the cake. Jonah Hill is hilarious as the shallow and devilish Efraim though I could feel the hangover of his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. And Miles Teller beautifully plays the role of a man who trying hard to balance the arms supplier and loving caring husband/father.Bradley Cooper is effective in a small cameo. However, I felt someone like a Pierce Brosnan would have added more layer to the character than Cooper.My last word. Keep your expectations low and you will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Meets Wolf of Wall street: Teller and Hill Take On Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robbie K here, starting the weekend off with what else?a movie review. Tonight we jump into the political drama movie that is about our beloved country and those who try to cheat the system to make excessive amounts of cash. So lets bump past the formalities and dive right into my thoughts on War Dogs starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller! LIKES: ? Good chemistry between actors ? Interesting story ? Comedy is wittyWhen I saw the trailers for this movie, I shuddered to think of the mess this movie could potentially be. After all, both of the actors (while talented) had not been in any roles that I absolutely loved. Therefore I was nervous to see these cast together and the potential stupidity/annoyance that could have been. To my surprise, these two were great together, having a dynamic relationship that sold the characters to me. Hill's brash, aggressive nature led the charge of the movie, but was able to be toned down by Teller's calm, intelligent, and more mature role. Each one was able to balance the others extremes and certainly felt like two coworkers/friends cheating the system. Once more I say that alone these guys were good, but together they were excellent. While the relationship is certainly the driving force of the movie, the story helps keep the pace and suspense going. The story is exactly as sold in the trailers of two young men giving up their mundane jobs to begin selling weapons across the country. Unlike other gun running movies, this film abandons the frontlines for the bank, and feels much like another rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street. Todd Phillips and his team integrated the lives of our characters well into the story while still adding an edge of threat to keep you wondering what would interfere. The many moving pieces keep one engaged in the movie, and while there were components I felt under developed, had enough detail in each to bring things together. Finally the comedy, I was expecting the comedy to be nothing more than a bunch of one-liners and facial expressions to make the next wave of memes. Truth is?there are plenty of these moments, but surprisingly there is some rather witty dialogue that had me laughing. In particular the banter between the two held plenty of clever insults and jabs at American stereotypes. Hill's character in particular had more lines I found funny, mainly by his delivery, but Teller's responses to those lines also assisted with that factor. All-in-all, the comedy has all of the insult and stupidity you expect, but is delivered so well. DISLIKES: ? Wanted more Ana De Armas moments ? The F word and comedic antics getting old ? Underdeveloped parts and the endingMy first dislike is the limitation of Ana De Armas' character. I won't lie, she is a beautiful woman and was very nice to have on screen (hey I am human after all). But I also really liked her character and how she drove the morals of the story despite all the corruption in this film. That goodness could have really refreshed the movie at some of the slower parts and they could have injected some more suspense in the film by having her in the film. Perhaps she isn't the most key character in this war/crime drama, but hey it couldn't have hurt?I think. To sound like a broken record, the F word does not equal great dialogue or great writing. Yet Hollywood still can't get that idea through their skulls. War Dogs has moments where it is just one bomb dropped after another, which may not bother you much. Still this reviewer would love the strategic use of the word to maximize its comedy potential, instead of replaying the ploy much like a Hallmark Channel Christmas movie. The same can be said for the comedic ploys in this film, some of which are again beaten to death without much remorse. Jonah Hill's laugh (which sounded like a mixture between the joker and a donkey) in particular grew stale to me and was more annoying by the tenth time it escaped its lips. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these stale antics plaguing the riding. My final limitation was the underdeveloped components of the film. I've already stated the Ana De Armas parts, but there were other components I felt were in need of some fine tuning. The Bradley Cooper character I expected to have a bigger role for the price tag he carries and the way they snuck under the government's nose was a bit far-fetched as well. In addition, the fact that this is all based on a Rolling Stone article left me wondering how much was true and how much of this was Hollywood magic and fantasy. And as for the ending, it is a little lackluster and I would have thought more ploy, drama, and actual footage would have been in the film. Not to mention the final scene was ambiguous and unnecessary. The VERDICTWar Dogs was much better than I expected and really portrays the actions some may take to make a quick buck. While certainly not the most original or entertaining movie, the engaging characters will keep you entertained and the dialogue will have you laughing. However, these qualities are not enough to recommend a trip to the theater for most of the audience members. Only those with great capitalistic pride and who don't mind American political jabs should venture into this movie, otherwise wait for the Redbox rent. My scores:Comedy/Drama/War: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of War Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rise and fall of the American dream gets the veritable Todd Phillips treatment. And after 15 years of directing explicit comedies, he decides to venture elsewhere with the meta-drama, War Dogs (my latest review). Good for him. "Dogs" closely resembles the 2006 vehicle Lord of War except that it's far from dull. With a certain amount of flamboyance, a more entertaining flow, and Bradley Cooper in a steely-eyed, supporting role, War Dogs is the kind of movie Lord of War wish it could have been. Bravo Todd the bod. You went out of your comfort zone to channel a little Martin Scorsese (the use of freeze frames, voice-over narration, and freewheeling camera movement) and the result is one of 2016's best. "War, huh good God, y'all". Indeed. Anyway, "Dogs" is based on a true story and takes place anywhere between Miami Beach, Florida to Albania to Jordan to the largest city in Iraq (that would be um, Baghdad). There are decent performances from the two leads (Jonah Hill and Miles Teller), a favorable use of dialogue- inserted title cards, and biting soundtrack tunes spanning at least four decades. Yeah I was a little unfulfilled with the way "Dogs" ended or if it even had an actual ending. No matter. This Warner Bros. release is sumptuous in every frame. Whether it's giving us long shots of high-rise condos in South Florida, rapid editing by way of business computers (and bookkeeping), plenty of characters smoking dubage, and even a poolside scene straight out of Scarface (the flick War Dogs references frequently), "Dogs" is a step above most cinema endeavors that have hit theaters in the dog days of August. Just call director Todd Phillips the surprising lovechild of 90's Scorsese and Andrew Niccol. The only difference is that he is not quite as self-serious.With a running time of just under 2 hours (114 minutes to be exact) and featuring the stunning Ana de Armas (Knock Knock, Exposed) as its love interest, War Dogs chronicles two twentysomethings named Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller). David lives with his pregnant girlfriend and is just getting by financially with his massage and (nursing home) bed sheet businesses. Efraim is his best friend and just happens to be an arms dealer operating out of Los Angeles. Hill's character saddled with plenty of cockiness and will, takes David out of his life of doldrums all the while showing him how to make some real money. They team up to form a company and land a $300 million dollar arms deal that gets them in over their heads. There are random bits of humor here, suggestive language, a slight of hand towards the Bush administration, some mild violence, and plenty of guns (duh). Ultimately, this is Todd's best and most full-grown work. He should do films like this more often and stop resorting to his frat boy tendencies. Rating: 3 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dynamite! Jonah Hill Is Da Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, 'War Dogs' is a BLAST! Director &amp; Co-Writer Todd Phillips regains supremacy in this racy, darkly funny &amp; entirely amusing criminal comedy-drama, that is bolstered by a compelling performance by Jonah Hill. I had a ball. 'War Dogs' Synopsis: Based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan.'War Dogs' is about achieving "The Great American Dream", at any cost. You watch 2 young fellas sweating it out, running around &amp; even literally going nuts in the middle of warfare in Jordan, (The entire chapter in Jordan, is a standout). The two leading-men aren't particularly likable, but its one hell of a ride, to watch them hustle, lie, cheat &amp; steal from all ends. 'War Dogs' is a true-story, that has turned into a terrific film, that keeps you on your seat &amp; swings itself with hilarity &amp; sheer menace.The Screenplay by Stephen Chin, Jason Smilovic &amp; Phillips, is explosive. The narrative arrests you &amp; doesn't let you go. Its so much fun watching the two young bloods doing so much wrong, to get it right. Phillips's Direction is super. Its good to see him back in form, after a hiatus. 'War Dogs' is definitely among his best films to date! Lawrence Sher's Cinematography captures the greed &amp; madness, with fineness. Jeff Groth's Editing is razor-crisp, 114-minutes swing by smoothly. Art &amp; Costume Design are excellent. The brief action-bits are well-done. Cliff Martinez's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: While its Miles Teller who gets the main role (and also does a voice-over throughout the film), 'War Dogs' still belongs to Jonah Hill. Jonah, an actor who never fails to surprise, is simply fabulous. Jonah sinks his teeth into the part &amp; performs with enviable bravado. He's every bit of the greedy a-hole he plays &amp; gets the best lines as well, who he delivers with his uniqueness. Also, his laugh, is another highlight. Having said that, Miles is quite-good as well, but this is Jonah's show &amp; he owns it. Ana de Armas looks gorgeous &amp; plays the mandatory female influence, with honesty. Kevin Pollak is first-rate. Bradley Cooper shines in an extended cameo.On the whole, 'War Dogs' is a Dynamite! Don't miss it. And how about a 3rd Oscar-Nomination for Jonah?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so hoping that War Dogs, would be a breakthrough film for writer/director Todd Phillips, much in the way that last year's The Big Short, was not only the most mature film of writer/director Adam McKay's career, but it was also what I would consider to be his best film and it even won him an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, amongst other nominations and honours that the film received. I say this because up till this point, both Phillips and McKay had been known mostly for lowbrow comedies that were obnoxious, crude and featured very juvenile humour and antics which would probably appeal to teenagers and maybe guys in their early 20's, but after that the appeal would greatly diminish within older and more mature viewers. I admit and I have my reviews on this site to prove that I have liked past works by both these directors, but again they were just amusing comedies that I would see once and then probably not bother with again and while humorous and entertaining at the time, they would have no lasting impact, or affect on me other than having a few chuckles amongst the other filmgoers at the theatre. McKay broke through this barrier last year with The Big Short, and now he has plans to do other more serious and yet entertaining films like one he has lined up with Jennifer Lawrence, and while I am sure he will still do his immature comedies, he has proved that he can and has the ability to do more serious and ultimately much better work. Having now seen War Dogs, I can safely say that not only has Phillips shown his truest talent as a writer, director and ultimately as a filmmaker, but I also think like McKay he has made the best film of his career. War Dogs much like The Big Short, focuses on real people and events that unfold before our eyes and the film is very satirical at times and also gives a good commentary on things such as how these two young men could have conned the American government the way they did and basically how easy it was for them to get filthy rich and do so under everyone's noses, or without them being aware. The film looks at war and weapons and how the American government goes about it's daily business with these types of foreign affairs and activities and the filmmakers here give a very critical and sometimes scathing look at such things showing that as voters, citizens and everyday people, we really sometimes have no clue as to what our government officials are up to, or what goes on behind the scenes and it also leaves one thinking that these people must not always be completely competent, or on top of things the way they should have been because otherwise we wouldn't have a film like War Dogs, or a true story and events such as this film depicts because anyone who knew what was going on would have put an end to it a long time ago, or so I hope. The film is just as good as any political spoof, or skewering by offering up many things for us as viewers to both be amazed and horrified at in equal measures. All the while though, Phillips proves he can tell a good story and both make an impact with it and completely engulf us into the world of arms dealings and the seedy goings on that these characters were involved in. The film can be quite humorous at times both in crude ways which Phillips still knows how to do, but yet he improves upon here and yet the film is so riveting that while not a thriller we are still so fascinated by what is going on in front of us that it would be a major mistake to leave the theatre even for a couple minutes and dare miss a second of this riveting story unfolding before us. The film's script is sharp with both it's quite perceptive and sometimes painfully accurate criticisms of what these two men did as well as the failure at the time of the American government, but it also raises good questions about what anyone would resort to and what depths, or lows we might go to in order to make a name for ourselves and be filthy rich even if it means facing major consequences. The acting here from the whole cast is also excellent and some of the finest work of both Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. Phillips has proved he can make one great film and I hope like McKay they continue to make serious and thought provoking films of a higher quality like this and not just go for the easy, or stupid laughs like in the past because in both cases that would be more or less selling themselves out and isn't that basically what they were both against with these two movies? I hope they will continue to work seriously, but as it stands, War Dogs is one of this year's finest achievements and overall best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got to watch this movie on the pre-screening. It is so good, that I wonder if I somehow can pay for the tickets? Everything is good about this movie: story, acting, camera, humor. I was glad to see the director getting over the Hangovers and doing something different for a change. To me it is definitely a step up for Phillips. Two hours went by so fast that ending seemed to be a bit rushed, but I have to trust that that how the original story went. It is not an instant classic of the Revenant proportions, but if the subject is appealing to you at all - it is worth watching. The voting is not yet enabled, but when it will be I give this title 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe but as a comedy it may be successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'War dogs' is one of the most anticipated movies of this summer. When I saw the trailer it felt to me that there is so much fun and it will be a good entertainer movie. Casting is also good. Jonah Hill is a good actor but is a very good comedian and Miles teller is a promising actor. It is a "based on true story" film so My expectation was huge and as a comedy movie it is good and the story pick up is fair. The title of the film tells you nothing but maybe this is a metaphor.I am not telling this is only a comedy and fun film. The story is very serious and there are good crude and real incident humor are in this movie. So if anyone is searching the seriousness of that issue it will be good. This is the story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. They won a contract of 300 million from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan. It is a very funny story and the script makes this more interesting. There are lots of real incidents with good political humor and good double meaning dialogues. These double meaning dialogues will make you laugh and the political drama will make you thinking the real reason of the arms dealing. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller has done a very good job and the background score is a perfect matching. The story is good and fresh with good humor. the direction could have been better but not bad. The only negative point is movie's pace. Very slow pace movie and sometimes I felt the continuity is not built well. The story-telling style is also another negative point. It could have been better. Otherwise, it is a good movie. The story writer could have made this more believable but after all I will say it is a good choice for fun lover.</fullReview>
