		<shortDescription>Missed the point of Pan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan is one of those films where it's hard to pinpoint what is wrong because the answer is basically everything. I'm confused as to how they managed to turn such a simple story into such a convoluted mess.At his core, Peter Pan is just a boy who escapes to a magical fantasy land because he doesn't want to grow up. In Neverland he leads a crew of similarly disenfranchised kids, plays games with Indians, swims with mermaids, and fights pirates.Simple right? Well not according to Joe Wright and the producers of this film. For some reason they felt the need to cram in every single cliché possible in order to 'modernize' the story despite the fact that the themes in Barrie's stories were already timeless.Levi Miller stumbles here and there but he was well cast as Peter. However the script doesn't support the role. At certain points he becomes secondary in his own story. His desires don't move the plot forward and after the first 20 minutes he has very little to do except "learn how to fly". We never seem him turn into the character we know as Peter Pan except for the fact that *spoilers* he flies at the end. And don't even get me started on 'The Chosen One' thing.Tiger Lily, played by Rooney Mara, is bland, and I'm not talking about the color of her skin. She's your typical warrior princess and for some reason they try to set up a possible romance between her and Hook. She's basically around to be walking talking exposition.Jackman also does a good job, but his character, Blackbeard, isn't interesting. His motivations are paper thin. He wants to mine some fairy dust in order to live forever which doesn't even make sense because Neverland supposed to be a place where people don't age. Blackbeard is just shoehorned in there so they could have a villain other than Hook.This brings me to one of the most pointless things in the film: Hook being Peter's ally. It doesn't amount to anything. You never get a sense of conflict between the two. You keep waiting for a point when Hook is going to betray Peter but it never happens. You want to see that scene where Peter cuts off his hand and feeds it to the crock, but it never happens. Hook's only motivation in this film is to escape and go home. He doesn't seem like he could turn into the devious Captain we know. At the end of the film, Hook and Pan are still friends and they just hint at a possible conflict in the sequel with a throw away line. Also, if you're a kid and this is your introduction to the character of Hook the 'twist' will go right over your head.And why is Hook American? Who made this decision? Another problem with Pan is the over-use and reliance of CGI. It looks fake, especially Peter's flying. Peter Pan was better animated in 1953, not in terms of graphical fidelity, but in motion. He had weight, he had grace, and he was agile. In Pan he just kind of floats like he's being dragged by a mouse cursor.When you stretch the rules of reality too far it becomes unbelievable even in a world like Neverland. You have to have rules. In Pan there are flying pirate ships. Why? How do they fly? It's never explained. The ships can fly both in the real world and Neverland. There is no consistency.I'm giving this film a 1 out of 10 because they squandered so much potential. The source material is so rich and this is the best they could come up with? I think a live action Peter Pan film could be successful but if they ignore the themes that make the story interesting in the first place it just won't resonate with the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't care what the critics say, I enjoyed it from start to finish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing the trailer I was hesitant that it might be good but I decided to give it a shot and watched it during its premiere. And boy, was I surprised! I absolutely loved the simple things that foreshadow the events of the actual story: James Hook using a hook in the mining scene, the ticktock of the bomb that he placed to set Peter free, Tiger Lily scaring Hook with the crocodile and many more. I have to give credit to the writer with his different take on the Peter Pan story.Also, the friendship between Hook and Peter was great, they got each other's backs, with Hook saving Peter and vice-versa, kinda sad that they'll eventually end up as enemies since this movie established that relationship. Everyone was right for the role, Hugh Jackman was amazing as the villain, how he looked here made me forget that he is Wolverine. Rooney Mara was dashing in her Tiger Lily role and performed well even though she was Caucasian in contrast to the natives. Garrett Hedlund played this cocky, playboy-type, off-character Hook who always provides the laughable comebacks. Levi Miller was great as Peter, that dude's going places. Although, I have to note the lack of battle between Peter and Blackbeard, since the prophecy stated that the former will defeat the latter. They should have put at least a short duel between the two because that'd be amazing. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I don't care what the Rotten Tomatoes rating or critics say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How dumb do you have to be to misunderstand a movie like Pan? Because this movie has generated some of the dumbest review comments I've ever seen. "There's no Wendy." Because this is a PREquel. Look up "pre" in a dictionary. "It's dark." All fairy tales are, and their modern imitations like Peter Pan or Pinocchio have to be, too, to remain true to the genre. Fairy tales originated in a time when meeting wolves and bears in the woods was all too likely, and they weren't cute and anthropomorphic, either. And the original Grimm stories, unlike their sanitized modern retellings, carried the clear message that Awful Things happen to Naughty Children Who Don't Obey The Rules. The prize comment was someone complaining that a flying pirate ship over WWII London was unrealistic. So name some historical periods when it WAS realistic.Overall it's a satisfying action story, and wholly undeserving of the scorn some reviewers have dumped on it. The weakest links are Garrett Hedlund as Hook (still a good guy at this point) and Rooney Mara as Tiger Lily. Hedlund tries to be Harrison Ford, complete with Indiana Jones' hat and Han Solo's flying off to save his own skin but coming back to save the day, but he just doesn't have charisma. Neither does Tiger Lily, who's pretty but bland, and goes through life with a deer in the headlights expression. They're both stiff and lifeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ton Of Fun To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I knew it wouldn't do well at the box office. Unfortunately, that is true, due to the negativity surrounding it. It did indeed bomb at the box office... By default, does that mean it's a bad film? Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I found it a ton of fun to watch!The biggest problem the movie has is there are quite a few scenes that seem to rush themselves. Aside from that, the characters are a sheer delight to watch; all the cast members were clearly having a ton of fun in their respective roles and one can't help but feel that when watching. The music is absolutely enchanting and the visual effects are gorgeous; one scene in particular, though barely a minute long, has a beautiful combination of music, cinematography, and character intensity.Fans of the source material may not like the changes they made, but try to watch this movie with the unbridled ambition of a child's imagination and judge the movie as a movie on its own merits first... and who knows? You may enjoy it too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruising through gorgeous visual and beautiful shanties, but unfortunately also on shallow narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan bears a lot of similarities to other adventure films, family animation and even role-playing games. It packs myriad of visual antics across the journey of self-discovery. However, it's also painfully one dimensional and predictable, using the "chosen one" plot to a fault. While it's admittedly aesthetically pleasing, this is not the innovative origin story it's advertised to be.In a world tormented by pirates, one child must discover his destiny. You've seen this before. Some angles have been changed, but this is typical Peter's adventure to Neverland. It's so overused, one might find half the script in Final Fantasy games. Not to mention it's riddled with fantasy genre cliché and uninspiring romance subplot.To their credit, the actors do a fine job. Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard is a good antagonist, he looks the part by carrying the character with ominous charisma, either it's by his flamboyant dialogues or even timely singing. He can appear funny yet still threatening. Well, as threatening as a villain in family flick can be.While Blackbeard looks fit for Hook's replacement, Hook himself is played by Garrett Hedlund, who ironically tries too hard to be young Hugh Jackman. His delivery is forced to create a suave persona, but most of the times he just looks out of place. Levi Miller as Peter handles himself pretty well. The story focuses heavily on this boy's fate, and although he can seem rough at some scenes, he brings a commendable performance as the lead.Graphical prowess plays important role, almost too much, and on its better parts Pan definitely has the stylish charm of fantasy vista. Setting is filled with colorful designs and details, although CGI takes the helm on most cases. Its soundtracks are splendid, it simply doesn't let go. From subtle chimes, loud symphony and even shanty version of popular songs, the audio is brilliant.Pan would've been great if it didn't copy so many elements from other movies. In nearly every scene, there's a hint of Pirates of Caribbean, Mad Max and multitude of classic Disney flicks. The straightforward plot doesn't help either, it's tedious to see the predictable developments ahead. Ancient prophecies, letter from the past and hidden power manifestation are tired gimmicks. Please, you know he's gonna fly at some point.For a movie that looks so appealing, Pan never really takes flight. One might find happy thoughts on the visual and songs, but the CGI charm and adventure gimmicks will not last through its boring plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A world of fantasy from a timeless story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film! I loved the creative twists and turns, the unexpected friendships and the ability to lose myself in a story from my childhood. Rejuvenated to allow my imagination to explore a timeless plot running down a new path. The acting was good enough for me to believe in the characters and want to see what will happen next. (I'm hoping for a sequel!) For me it's not about the special effect or the perfect screenplay. it's about wanting to immerse myself in the story and keep watching! I liked that it resembled other story lines (Hook was another of my favorites!) That made it comforting and familiar, yet new and exciting! I'm just a person....a grandmother that likes to share an experience with my grandchildren....a mother that still wants to phone my kids and say wow you have to watch this!.....A professional who likes to write in our company newsletter a "not to be missed" review....For whatever reason technical or otherwise that you didn't like this film. I don't pretend to understand why? But if like me you just want to sit with a bucket of popcorn and get lost in the fantasy...Then go watch this.....and just lose yourself for a little while!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll Always Believe in You, Peter Pan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, Peter Pan is one of those stories that just draws the child in me to it. Who doesn't want to learn to fly, be friends with pixies, or never grow up and have all the anxieties of life? And whenever a new Peter Pan story is made into a film, I generally wind up seeing it. At last count I've seen Disney's animated Peter Pan and Return to Neverland, Mary Martin's Peter Pan, Cathy Rigby as Peter Pan, Hook, Peter Pan (2003), Peter Pan Live!, and now Pan and read Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, Peter Pan and Wendy, Peter Pan in Scarlet, and Capt. Hook. So you might say I am an old hand at this...Pan is a lively, different take on the tradition of Peter Pan...not quite as bizarre or hilarious as Hook and not as accurate to the original story as Peter Pan from '03. But what I know from having read about Mr. Barrie's life was that he edited Peter Pan numerous times when it was on stage and was always looking for a way to liven things up...so this Pan keeps with that tradition! It is a fun, rollicking adventure about a boy with a destiny, a savvy yet heartfelt pirate tag-a-long, and a warrior-princess...all battling the despotic Captain Blackbeard.SPOILERS AFTER THIS: There is something absolutely charming about this version of Hook who is given the full emotional treatment of a person with an actual past, not just a guy missing a hand who wants revenge. Mr. Hedlund was the ideal casting choice because he can be gruff and still very likable.And for all the complaints about Tiger Lily NOT being cast as Native America, might I suggest an alternative view for this? There is no way to give viewers a 100% authentic, First-Nations approved version of Tiger Lily. Why? Because the way Barrie wrote them was racist and you cannot escape from it...ever. But if you decide to make them Native-Neverlanders instead you remove what could be insulting by making them a new group of people that has no connections on earth. Instead, the Native-Neverlanders were a beautiful, eclectic tribe of people living in the trees like wood-elves (!) in bright tents and clothing, with skilled warriors and artisans. There was never a moment of disrespect to other cultures that I found and it this movie set apart from the others. Rooney Mara was a solid choice for Tiger Lily, enjoyable, spunky and given some really cool fighting scenes.Blackbeard is a great villain with a purpose and Hugh Jackman was remarkable in the role, per the usual. His clothing and hair was flamboyant but not out of place in a world that is rather flamboyant and imaginative...and yes, he can be cruel and vicious. This is not a film for little wee-uns, as Blackbeard does kill children (implied, no impact seen).And Peter Pan himself is a pretty brilliant marvel. Zachary is a newcomer but a fine young actor, quite likable and holds an impressive array of emotions. Peter is his usual self, albeit in a slightly different story, marked by determination and ability to lead. Unfortunately, this story did kill a little of the child-like wonder and glee Peter usually has but then...so did the film Hook.I am giving it 8 out of 10 stars because the casting is very solid, character development is good, setting is spectacular, and plot is mostly sound. The only things I didn't like were the sorta Oliver Twist beginning (with mean nuns, which has been done to death, folks) and the plot hole of what happens to all those men and boys in the mine? Did Peter just leave them there or did he return them home? You decide.But I recommend it wholeheartedly, just beware that it can be a bit scary and some smaller children may not do so well. On the scale of favorite Peter Pan films, it ranks just behind Cathy Rigby as Peter Pan and Hook, which isn't bad at all! It keeps Barrie's fun story alive for a new generation...until the next one is made! See you at the movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, wrong audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my nephew and niece to see this movie this past week, and one thing was clearly noticeable. The movie is a bit to overwhelming for small kids. However, if you don't go to this movie to see a funny and uplifting 'Hook' remake, but instead go to see a more deep and thrilling retelling of a childhood tale, you will be most pleasantly surprised. The movie, from this point of view, is fantastic. I feel bad that it has received such harsh reviews from parents that apparently took their small kids to a movie without first at least watching the trailer. Its a bit darker then its predecessors, but is clearly shown that way through the trailer.Let me put it this way, if the trailer looks like a movie you want to see, you will not be disappointed here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Peter Pan lover or child you will love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the movie enjoyable and new. Sure there were the same foundations as any Peter Pan movie, but it was a new turn. If you like Maleficent you'll like this too. I am a die hard fan of anything Peter or Neverland related. I have read review on other sites and found the dislikes appalling. The reason Tigerlily (Rooney Mara) is white is in the original plot of Peter Pan she was a blonde native princess. She is meant to be Neverland's native not anything to do with the real world. The director made the tribe multicultural and I found it lovely. And some found that Blackbeard (aka Hugh Jackman)was over acting. Have they not seen any pirate movies? Have they missed the Disney Peter Pan movies? Hook in Disney's animated version is a very dramatized character so why wouldn't Blackbeard and Hook be a bit over the top in this movie. This movie left the child inside me (19yo) delighted and my sister (5yo) and brother (10yo) both loved it. Was worth buying and watching again. I hope and look forward to the possibly of a second one. And I hope there are more people voicing my opinion also so the idea can get to whoever sees to production and release of the next one will actually film another one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pan has all the foundation to make a fantastic prequel for the Peter Pan story, sadly the foundation doesn't have much on it and what's there is shaky.The main issue I had with this film is that it seemed like it couldn't make up it's mind on whether it wanted to cater to children with goofy and antic like behavior from the characters, or offer up serious and gritty story telling for the adults. It flip flops from one to the other from scene to scene and it's very noticeable. The incredibly cringe-worthy use of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in the Neverland introduction scene represents my point the best.I wondered all throughout the movie why they had given James Hook an American Accent, I have seen other reviews say that it seemed like the Director/Writer wanted Garret Hedlund to channel some Indiana Jones for this role. They are right, but I am baffled as to why the Production wanted him too. It makes no sense for what we know he will eventually become.This movie isn't ALL bad, however. Levi Miller as Pan is a lot better than I ever expected him to be, the kid has some talent and it's going to be interesting to see how he develops as an actor if he sticks with it. Rooney Mara puts in a great effort as Tiger Lily too. Hugh Jackman tries REALLY hard to lift this movie. He is easily the top performance with his Blackbeard and it was easy to see that he enjoyed the freedom of the character. In fact, they should get Jackman to play Hook in the next movie. He'd be brilliant.Shout out to Adeel Akhtar as Mr. Smee. Outside of Jackman he gets the most laughs in the film and was a great casting choice.If you have kids then take them to see it, they will like it but be prepared because you probably won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fab adventure from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We (1 adult + 3 x 12 year olds) absolutely loved this. Let me start by saying I am a fan of The Pan, and so was worried before seeing this that it would not come up to scratch. So we were lucky enough to win tickets of the preview, and I have to say I loved it. It was a film full of adventure and goes along at a cracking pace. There is not much back story or character development but the Pan universe is not supposed to be "Tolkien Deep". There is enough reference to JM Barrie's classic play and the iconic lines that we all know and love. The casting was good, the portrayal of the iconic characters was excellent. Ignore the negative reviews, leave the grumpy adult at the door and enjoy.NB: we saw this in 3D , and it was exceptionally good use of 3D visuals, I've seen a lot of 3D films (have 3D TV setup at home too) and rate this very highly for effects, I actually jumped/ducked on quite a few occasions!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Pan" (2015) is a marvelous adventure for the whole family. It is dazzling looking, fun, highly enjoyable escapism, especial for the youngest ones. There are tons of fun action, colorful characters, familiar faces and it's just a joy to watch this flick. Knowing that this movie bombed at the box office and was critically bashed, i watched this movie with only one expectation, to see why it tanked. After seeing it i think that probably wrong marketing or lack of it was the reason - just relax, sit comfortably and enjoy the ride, it is one colorful fun.Overall, "Pan" is a surprise for me. I thought it is going to be bad, but actually it was very cool fun. It's target audience is youngest ones, but older can also enjoy it. Special effects very solid and there were tons of them, sets are cool as well. This is highly enjoyable fun.</fullReview>

When Peter didn't listen to other words but all he did is just believe in himself that he can meet his mom one day. Peter's a smart boy and optimistic person. He's not afraid to be different, he's not afraid to stand up. He's such a brave boy. However, his action really inspire me and I think I should be like him in my life. After i watched this movie i feel so confident. In my life i shouldn't give up easily i should stand up and face all the conflicts in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had low expectations for this movie seeing the low review scores but I just saw Pan and really enjoyed it. It was above all a visual stunning movie. We saw it in 3d and Neverland really came alive. The story is thin but OK enough to keep the movie going. It reminded me in a way of Mad max. Also visual stunning, lost of action, with duels, fighting, etc but with a razor thin story line. Above all my kids of 6 and 7 enjoyed it very much. It was kind of the first time that they saw such an action movie. It can be a little bit frightening sometimes for kids but not too much.I would recommend seeing the movie with your family.

		<shortDescription>Fly, float, and fall along pirates and Peter ? fantastical drama with small bits of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Peter! Such an unfortunate child! But he is to be redeemed, and his adventure begins...Flying, floating,and falling, faaalling,faaaaalling!! There was so much of that in PAN. Maybe too much. Lots of fighting and persecution: pirates vs. children, pirates vs.natives, pirates vs. fairies. At first the movie felt slow. We meet Peter in an orphanage, surrounded by a world war II setting,and horrid nuns. I love Joe Wright's movies, (Pride and Prejudice, Anna Karenina, Atonement) they are filled with drama and wonder. Perhaps precisely this was Joe Wright's intention with PAN: to show Peter PAN's dark nightmarish origins instead of all the sunny and colorful happy-happy portrayed in other versions of Peter Pan. I'm giving it a 7 because this movie will satisfy the fantasy/drama genre fans, but as an all-audiences movie, it didn't meet its full potential. It is entertaining for adults, for the most part. It might be scary for children. One of the problems in this movie is that it feels like a stage, as if watching a theater play. This is especially noticeable in the second part of the film - with the tribal territory.Although a very energetic film, I was taken aback by the brutality, children slavery, killing of children (being kicked into an endless pit), the prevalent role of a merciless pirate (of course brilliantly performed by Hugh Jackman), and the subject of destructive mining (which exhausted the fairy dust gems). Was all that really necessary? I guess the writers wanted to emphasize the ugliness that Peter had to live through before he could discover happiness. Nonetheless, I just kept wanting greater enchantment and heart. For instance, why were the fairies, which are quintessential of fantasy and magic, reduced to just sparkles? It's so different from our classic view of the fairies in Disney's animated Peter Pan. More things I wondered about...What was Black Beard's motivation? Eventually midpoint in the movie, in a subtle scene, we figure it out. Jackman's performance is good, but his character seems too wicked for a children's movie. Not funny, just fantastic! Hook is the only one that shows bits of humor.Clearly the film was not conceived to elicit laughter. It was conceived to elicit empathy for the misfortune of the children and Peter. But it could have had been more fun. It did however keep me on the edge-of-my-seat: with all the perils and troubles chasing Peter. I just kept searching for that emotional connection between the characters. There is however, one emotional thread that keeps the movie together: the child's eagerness to find his mother. "You will find me in this world, or another?" was a written message from his mother. That's Peter's motivation. Eventually Peter gets assigned the title of "chosen" one, the savior of the fairies. Will he find his mother at the end? I won't reveal it here. But the ending scenes were my favorite: these had heart and charm and magic...The fantasy element is undeniable astonishing ? those flying ships and the different worlds they go to are a feast to watch. But sometimes it felt too repetitive. For sure,there is lots of action. Every second of the movie is filled with adventure, haphazard adventure I would say. Peter is always being chased by something or someone. Giant birds, crocs, pirates, etc., are there to put Peter's life in constant danger. There's a mermaid rescuing scene that is quite magical.About the music, that Nirvana "teen spirits" chant was creepy! Maybe that was the intention exactly... What can you expect from enslaved children working in a mine for a wicked pirate?Overall, the actors did their best with the script they had. They put their heart in their performances. Black Beard is Peter's nemesis. Peter is the determined boy who, with the help of a mining runaway, Hook and the natives' princess (Mara), sets on a quest to survive and find his mother. This native princess confused me-?I thought she was Peter's mother! She looked like a foreigner among the natives. But that was an intentional casting choice, they wanted to portray a multicultural native tribe. In the end, I walked out of the theater thinking "that was okay." But I had no feeling of excitement or wonder or joy. It was an average dark fantasy movie experience. Worth watching once. Although I will caution parents-- I think some scenes might not be appropriate for very young children...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn you Warner Bros for greenlighting this garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this was first announced they sold it as being different and man the tone of the early trailers just really made me feel like they were going to go deep and abstract. The trailer song made me shiver. My dumb ass thought it might even be something like "The adventures of Baron Munchausen" full of metaphors and abstractions like "What dreams may come". Like it was going tell a more emotional story about the relationship of the main actors. Nope boring run of the mill peter pan adaptation with a couple characters swapped to claim uniqueness. Damn I just rewatched the first trailer and it totally sold me on a different story. What makes matters worse is the world is very well designed and there's several hints at what could have been a really trippy adventure, but for some reason they went incredibly cheap on the CGI which in several spots is just unbearably bad. The story doesn't really make any sense. "chosen one"? For what? and what exactly does he provide? He can control fairies? but the fairies were perfectly capable of throwing a couple pirates around. The relationship between Blackbeard and his mother was really dumb and illogical, there's so much more they could have done with that. In general it just felt crap and plodded along and then just rolled over at the end. Man I'm just so angry. I would have killed to have Terry Gilliam to do this, or David fincher, Darren Aronofsky. It sucks because Hugh Jackman was wasted. Thats the one thing they got right. The design and portrayal of Blackbeard was cool, but his story was so Blasé. I liked the inclusion of modern music but instead of making it a theme with a story nope you get one cool song and then generic music for the rest of the film.(I know there was another one but it sucked) Damn you Warner Bros for greenlighting this garbage.Im giving this a 1/10 because of how insultingly wasteful they were with such a great idea. I've seen better execution of concepts like this out of 50k indie movies. When we talk about twist of fairy tale concepts I have to give the nod to Maleficent. Again the trailer was chilling and though the movie had innumerable flaws it was the mature emotional experience we were looking for. Guess now were just going to have to wait for the Fables trilogy they'll inevitably screw up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lotta Hard Work, Which Pays Off Something Amazing on This Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers: I mention the 1960 Peter Pan, Barney's Christmas, the Chronicles of Narnia, the Oz Books, Alice in Wonderland, and Harry Potter.This movie tells me movies are getting better and better, and I like movies of this dynamic.What drew me in was Tiger Lily and probably Blackbeard. Peter was such a good actor and such a sweet boy. He actually began to look like Peter Pan, which reminds me of the 1960 version with the lady playing Peter. I remember Wendy was good in that one, too. I used to watch it at my aunt's and have seen it at school a few times for music. I also used to watch Barney's Christmas, which reminds me of that version of Peter Pan; I actually loved Barney until kids in school said it wasn't cool again and I finally seemed older.My favorite was after I came back from the bathroom (had to go twice tho it was so short) and saw Blackbeard together with Sam Smiegel. The dynamic of their acting was so good. I 1st connected with the character of Sam Smiegel. Then, I grew to find Blackbeard acted well, except of course that he killed Peter Pan's mother. If he didn't murder, I'd like him. I liked him as an actor. I figure they dumped his character as a murderer and made him a warrior. His mother was an innocent maiden or something. It's sad to say I liked Blackbeard and Sam Smiegel over all the others.Tiger Lily made this movie.. a movie. She is so beautiful and sound. She is an excellent actress. She was flawless and the best. She is a beautiful young girl. She's a wonderful budding actress. As a person, I think she is very kind, good, and cool, very deserving. I'd like to see her now next to other stars, like Chloe Grace Moretz, Bella Thorne, and the girls from Pitch Perfect 2. I don't know what would happen if she acted for Tim Burton, but he sounds like a tough director, maybe wants actors to be more independent to let their creativity out and make creative choices.I rate this a 10/10. It contributed so much intelligence to the world with the cool acting. I really truly like it and hope others found themselves in it, too, and look forward to more movies as good as this in certain ways.I read a review that said it didn't really cover much fantasy, and I'm beginning to think a lot of people agreed. Fantasies like the Chronicles of Narnia, the Oz Books, Alice in Wonderland, and Harry Potter provide more magical ideas. It's hard to say I'd watch this again on my own, Pan, tho I loved it so much. I go to the movies about every week, tho. I'm sure you could really get into this. You'd have to do a lotta work if no one else is as into it, like posting on the board. A lotta people were fans of things like Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars...I used to do this for Sweeney Todd, watch it a lot. It's a lotta work to make a movie, a good movie. I was hoping for more things like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, like from Tim Burton since he does so much and you should always be moving up, knocking all the pins down, eventually, and getting there. I don't know who'd argue this popular belief that supposedly everyone loves. So, Pan is a good new classic work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Peter Pan Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really liked it. It was so refreshing and well produced. Tiger Lily shouldn't be Rooney Mara, I agree, but somehow she made me forget that the princess is a Native girl. I think Rooney did an amazing job and I understand her emotionless face as the way Tiger Lily found to look tough. Garrett was also brilliant and I think the script brought a happier Hook and yeah it was off character, but I think it made the movie lighter. I really like the fact that Hook and Pan were friends. It's a cool new view of their relationship. Hugh Jackman was just fantastic in his role. I didn't even recognize him and it was a surprise read his name in the credits. He made such a good villain, the kind you love-hate because he's mean as hell, but also funny and smart. It was one of the best part of the movie, no doubts. Levi Miller is a really good actor and who doesn't agree, didn't watch a lot of movies with kids as the star. It's hard to find kids that don't look too forced or too young to be acting. He's in a spotlight along with Dakota Fanning, Abigail Breslin and Freddie Highmore. Miller's Pan was so likable that I just want to pinch his cheeks forever. I loved how the character was growing alongside with the movie and in the end, the cheeky Pan was so amazing to see and hear. I really loved Levi acting and I think he's gonna be huge! Smee was so so good that I don't have words. It's like he jumped out of the book right into the movie. Really loved Adeel Akhtar. The effects were amazing just as the rest of the movie. The photography was perfect. The colors, the scenarios, everything.The soundtrack was really good to listen and I think it worked really well in the movie. The script was really well developed and I really wish there was a book about this version of the story.People who didn't like the movie must be one of those people who can't stand movies that isn't about deep thoughts and philosophy. I think Pan is a movie really cute and well done. Good acting, good script, good timing. I really want to watch more movies like this in the next years.Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prequel reboot of J.M Barrie's classic tale of Peter Pan was definitely fresh on the table. Admittedly, it felt more comical and theatrical than the original. Nevertheless, it was a welcome surprise to see the bizarre arrangement of the story, humor and cast.Altogether, I think it was meant for a different audience since the humor felt more close to adult than the youth which makes it very unique. I would like to also comment on how amazing Hugh Jackman's acting in this movie had been because for the first few minutes of his appearance on screen. I had no idea it was him until I double checked on the movie poster and description. if there would be a negative comment on this which I highly wouldn't think it to be negative. Hook with the cowboy thematic approach, I'm not so sure if that blended well with the whole romance build with tiger lily and all. anyhow, cheers and thanks for the amazing show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actor/writer young Jason Fuchs (using JM Barrie's characters) and director Joe Wright (Atonement, Pride &amp; Prejudice, Hanna, Anna Karenina) have put together a prequel for Barrie's PETER PAN, cast a fine group of actors, included enough animation to bring the fairytale aspects to life, and the result is not only a fine film, but a very reasonable explanation for how Peter became Peter Pan.The line from the script that may answer the naysayers as to whether this story is plausible is, 'If you don't believe, Peter, then neither will they.' Opening in England during WW II and the London blitz 12-year-old Peter (Levi Miller, an excellent actor!) is an orphan having been left as a baby on the doorsteps of a Catholic orphanage by his mother (Amanda Seyfried). Peter is a mischievous 12-year-old boy with an irrepressible rebellious streak who with his best friend attempt an unsuccessful escape but discover that every night certain boys are missing from their beds. One incredible night, Peter is likewise whisked away from the orphanage and spirited off to a fantastical world of pirates, warriors and fairies called Neverland where he is befriended by Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), a new friend in James Cook (Barrett Hedlund), and encounters the pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Amidst the fun and danger, Peter ultimately discovers his destiny -- to become the hero who will be forever known as Peter Pan.This is a film of fantasy and requires releasing disbelief in order to become involved with the premise of a prequel to Peter Pan. The acting, musical score, direction and special effects add to the spectacle ? which in the end s simple a lovely little fairytale rethought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get why some people didn't like this film; I thought it was pretty good. It's a creative story about how Peter came to Neverland and became known as Peter Pan. Peter and other orphans are kidnapped by pirates on their flying ship and taken to Neverland where the evil Captain Blackbeard (not Hook) is using the orphans as slaves. As a matter of fact, Peter meets Hook and he is one of the slaves digging for Pixie dust. Peter is forced to fly and Blackbeard believes he is the boy in the prophesy whom will overthrow him.Peter and Hook escape, meet up the natives whom think he is the Pan. The 2 escape with Tiger Lily go on some adventures and eventually there is the battle at the end with Blackbeard in the fairy kingdom.I think the special effects were very good, I liked the story, and I thought Hugh Jackman was great. The crocodile was cool and all the colorful natives-it was just visual stunning.FINAL VERDICT: I liked the story, don't believe all the reviews, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awkward and misguided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was a more awkward movie than Pan released in the last few years I'd certainly like to know about it as Joe Wright's big budgeted wannabe franchise starter is a lavishly coloured and extravagant picture that lacks knowledge of what it actually wants to be or who in fact it's aimed at and judging by the films flopping at the box office the world over, it seems as though audiences too struggled to figure out who should be watching this revamping of J.M Barrie's classic material or why they should be watching it.Tonally all over the place and with a story that seems to meander about the motions until a highly lacking finale and lack of answers regarding certain story questions (a glaring one being how Hook and Pan in fact become enemies as they are adventures together here), for the first time in his quietly impressive directing career Wright seems completely lost within his narrative and fails to liven up proceedings despite throwing every known colour onto the screen, plopping in Nirvana songs and letting many of his actors ham it up to level 11 to try and cover up the fact Pan's story is actually rather dull in a world that should be anything but.Our Pan here is played by newcomer Levi Miller and the poor young performer labours in his first major turn injecting Peter with neither the charm, smarts nor emotion that was needed for the role. When you consider however how his cast alongside a horribly miscast double act of Garrett Hedlund (who continues to frustrate as a lead actor) and the beyond bad Rooney Mara, the child performer didn't really stand much of a chance. The films only saving grace acting wise is Hugh Jackman who has a blast playing Blackbeard the fearsome pirate who will stop at nothing to collect that sought after pixie dust but while he has fun it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense having Blackbeard in this beloved tale.Whilst normally it would not be something called out for by the masses it would've actually been nice for Pan to stick more closely to the original Peter Pan story that has enchanted readers and viewers for decades upon decades and while its commendable for a big budget film to take such a risk on a new take on a well-trod property, Pan is a stinging reminder of what can go wrong when money is thrown all over the place and scripts seem doctored to tick off as many set piece wish lists as possible and for the first time in his career Joe Wright has crafted an almost irredeemably bad piece of cinematic entertainment.All those seeking a Peter Pan fix are much better off seeking out a copy of Disney's beloved animated take or even the similarly styled Steven Spielberg event Hook.1 ? awkwardly used Nirvana song out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's WWII London. Peter (Levi Miller) was left by his mother on the doorstep of the Home for Boys and he's still waiting for her to return. Kids have been disappearing. One night, pirates come to take Peter and his friends away. Pirate leader Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) has enslaved the boys to mine Pixum, fairy dust, and looking to wipe out all fairies. Peter is made to walk the plank and discovers that he is able to fly. He escapes from Blackbeard with the help of James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) and Smiegel. They are captured by Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Recognizing the pan necklace from his mother, she reveals that Peter's mother is Blackbeard's possession Mary. She had fallen in love with the fairy prince and he is the child of their love.I really like the start of this movie. Peter Pan is brash, mischievous and heroic. I even like transferring the story to WWII which allows for a fun dogfight in the skies of London. Then the movie goes to Neverland and the problems start to pile up. I also like the wild colorful action extravaganza. It does get repetitive during the climatic action scene but the exuberance fits Neverland.For some reason, the story forces Peter to turn into a self-doubting taciturn. The flying story really hurts Peter's character development. He turns into non-Peter Pan and not even the same character from the first act. Blackbeard is a black-feathered peacock. He's not scary enough. Garrett Hedlund is not flamboyant enough to be Hook. Rooney Mara is perfectly fine as an action heroine but her pale white skin is really distracting. They may as well paint her face as some kind of warpaint like the Maori war paint. Her pale skin is too old Hollywood. I can see a wild Peter Pan movie being made here but the little problems overwhelm it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This wasn't Pan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'ve never hyped myself up for a movie more than Pan. I saw the trailer the day it came out and watched every trailer since then. Well now I've had my chance to watch it... And well...The best part of the movie was the credits. The music is catchy... That's about it. The animation and graphical affects were alright I guess. And some parts of the story weren't too bad. However the amount of plot holes made me want to cry, the relationship between Hook and Tiger lily, and Hook and Pan, and Pan and Tiger Lily, and all of them with Blackbeard was poor. The best character in it was Smeeh, but that was only in the first half of the movie, so anything past that first half for him was garbage. When I sat down and started watching it, I was disappointed by the beginning, but I sat through it anyway, in hopes that the second half would be phenomenal... And I can confirm it really wasn't. Nothing in the film made any sense. Nothing was ever explored or explained. Nothing was ever adopted on to get the main characters into their positions before we get to the Peter Pan that everyone knows where it is Pan vs Hook. There was none of that.Hooks accent... Hooks freaking accent... Oh my god. It sounded so fake it was painful. I hate writing this review, but I can honestly say I don't think I've been more disappointed in the film... Whoever made the trailers deserves the biggest pay rise ever, because the trailers did look amazing, the trailer soundtrack was amazing. The movie did not look amazing, the soundtrack was also not amazing...That's another thing, WHY WAS THE FILM A MUSICAL?! I didn't sit down to watch this so I could watch Blackbeard sing songs that hadn't been invented yet. Because I think three songs were in this film and every time I heard one, I was more tempted to turn it off.Like I said, the graphics were good, the story telling wasn't that bad and costume design was also pretty good and sets and stuff. But the film as a whole makes me final thoughts 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about Hook?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan is a great ride for the family, but allow me to elaborate more on artistic choices that turned this film into a poor execution. The movie makes the viewer feel that the initial conflict between Capt. Hook and Pan will be analyzed, or at least spawned out of the plot. As many movies and television series (Once Upon A Time, Christopher Nolan's Batman, Maleficent, etc.) fill in the gap for viewers these days, I was under the impression that Pan would satisfy my craving for a back-story. The movie was a real Expectation vs. Reality lesson, as Hook carried less depth than I would have expected. Instead of a dignatious, future arch enemy, the character was reduced to a cowardly comedic-relief role, portrayed by a poor actor. I walked away from this film frustrated. The action, visual art, musical application, and Hugh Jackman-- all marginal to what truly makes a great film (emotions, plot, character relationships) -- are the only thing that carry this film out of the depths of the 1 and 2 star category. Here's the spoiler, readers: The movie could have functioned the same without a Capt. Hook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with quite low expectations, but came out pleasantly surprised. The concept is actually identical to what Wicked is for The Wizard of Oz, and the movie offers a lot of insight/ties up ends and answers some of the questions which were left unanswered in the original Disney feature (although most of them are still not totally answered by the end of the movie). Actually, they should have started with Pan as a musical and made a movie afterwards, I'm quite sure it could have had quite some success....The visuals qre quite good with spectacular effects/costumes and cinematographic visuals all around.... but they're alternated with moments where production was sloppy to say the best. Quite uneven work on the CGI/FX department.Jackman and Miller do a decent enough job, Mara Rooney is the highlight of the movie. As far as I'm concerned, Hedlund (who looks like a Chris Pratt stand-in) and Akhtar were totally miscast. My feeling is that the box office fiasco might well be found in Hedlund's character, which should have meant so much more to this movie and could have supported the story....All in all a good and entertaining movie. Some prior Peter Pan knowledge or affinity is advised though....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter is left, as a baby, at an orphanage by his mother: he never sees the letter she leaves for him as it is hidden by the horrible nun who runs the place. World War II coincides with pirates from Neverland kidnapping the boys in the orphanage in order for them to be put to work in Blackbeard's fairy-dust mines. It turns out that Peter may be the prophesied Chosen One (yes, another Chosen One story) to put an end to Blackbeard's reign of terror, aided by likable older prisoner Hook.So what we have here is a Peter Pan prequel which sets out to answer many of the questions we never asked and, in so doing, raises as many questions as it answers, not to mentioning not answering some of the questions we did ask! At the risk of spoilering, the unanswered questions include why the World War II setting, how did Hook lose his hand, and how did he and Peter become enemies ? both of these are left open for the sequel, no doubt, although they'll have to get a move on because, while Peter may be the boy who never grew up, I doubt whether newcomer Levi Miller can pull off the same trick.There is a lot to enjoy here. The action never lets up for a second, the film is visually stunning with fabulous effects, Hugh Jackman and Kathy Burke are both enjoyably effective pantomime villains, and the rest of the cast are fine (it's good to have a Peter with an English accent for a change, even if the exact location does wander about a bit). There are plenty of nods to the established Peter Pan mythos, with some nice additions. And it is an excellent family film ? maybe a bit intense here and there for the little ones, but otherwise solid.But, for me, it was just a little bit wide of the mark: it didn't quite connect in the way I had hoped it would.The 3D is fairly successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan, a prequel for the movies Peter Pan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sometimes, friends begin as enemies. And sometimes, enemies begin as friends. Sometimes, in order to truly know how things end, we must first know how they begin." As the quote implied, the movie Pan is ultimately a prequel to any Peter Pan movie.Peter, who is played by Levi Miller, lives out his life in an oppressive London orphanage. This twelve year old finds himself and the rest of the orphanage in a strange and beautiful world of Neverland. It's here, in mine run by child laborers, which he is swept into an ancient prophesy. Chased by the pirate captain Blackbeard, played by Hugh Jackman, Peter finds new friends Hook, played by Garrett Hedlund, and Tiger Lily, played by Rooney Mara and answers about his family.As the movie ends several different questions are left up in the air. I'm still a little unsure which friend was now an enemy. I can figure from previous movies that Pan and Hook become enemies but it isn't directly stated. In fact it's quite the opposite. So I'm thinking there is at least one movie in the works as a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an adventure story there is quite a lot of action and battles in grand and magical looking landscapes. There is a journey from orphanage to fairy land. The movie is entertaining enough and doesn't deserve to flop even though there are some faults. The story has too much repetitive fighting against Blackbeard and not enough use of the prequel to establish the main characters of Peter Pan like how Captain Hook got the way he did, Wendy, Tinkerbell etc. Compared to another prequel "Maleficent", this suffers in comparison because the characters and plot seem tangential. Even with a lot of ships flying around and stuff the first half is a bit boring. Things pick up when Rooney Mara comes in and she is a lovely Tiger Lily. Amanda Seyfried could have been shown more in realistic imagery and not so blurry. The boy who plays Peter, Levi Miller is endearing. Hugh Jackman is good Blackbeard.Worth one watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love the magic of Harry Potter with the humor of Pirates of the Caribbean, Pan is right up your alley. I actually wish the movie was longer to really give us more mermaids and character depth (though understand the premise was to tell the first layer of how Peter originally arrived at NL). I missed it in theaters but watched it thrice before returning it to the RedBox. I will add this movie to my collection. Pan gives you everything you'd want from a fantasy action nautical film. It's nice to see a film when a child LOVES his parents and not trying to run away or hate them (even having never met them). Casting did a great job filling the roles but it is a bit white-washed. I hope they do another and really let us explore more of Neverland and how Hook becomes Hook and how Peter becomes ruler of the lost boys, (BANG-A-RANG!!) With this solid foundation I feel they could really build a great second movie. But as I said before, only flaw was the length of the film, it felt like a first chapter instead of a first novel in a series.</fullReview>

Pan ended with you (me) wanting more, needing to find out what happened between Pan and Hook. It has everything you want in a family movie. The only down side in my opinion (not the strange songs that didn't seem to fit because I did sing along in the cinema), but the natives? who actually looked like a bunch of kidnapped Londoners who escaped and put on colorful native clothing.... They didn't look native at all.I need it to do better, because ... I need Pan 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Warner Brothers live-action feature, Pan, is an amazing film that is a great prequel to Peter Pan. This story starts when infant Peter (Levi Miller) is dropped off at a boys' orphanage by his mother. He grows up with his friend Nibs (Lewis MacDougal) and is raised by evil nuns. One night, 12-year-old Peter and Nibs get taken away to Neverland by pirates in flying boats. Nibs escapes from the boat by jumping onto a roof. Peter and the other kids from the orphanage have to mine fairy dust for the evil Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) in order to survive. He meets Hook (Garrett Hedlund) in a mine chamber while they are going to sleep. The next day he finds fairy dust but a man steals it from him and Blackbeard makes him walk the plank. When he gets kicked off the board, he flies before he hits the ground, surprising himself and everyone else. Peter's adventures in Neverland are full of many more surprises, epic battles and answers to many of the questions he's always wondered about. The incredibly talented Hugh Jackman is completely unrecognizable as Blackbeard. He's ruthless but has an oddly compassionate side. He sends Peter to his death and, when he survives, he lets him live. He tells Peter, "We have an ancient prophecy that tells of a boy, a boy who would disappeared from his world until he was old enough to return and lead an uprising against me. A boy who could fly...To find the right actor to play Peter, the filmmakers looked at thousands of kids in the UK, the United States, Canada and Australia before finding Levi Miller. I think he does a good job playing this mischievous boy who wants to know where he comes from and where he's headed.Pan is a beautiful film full of fun and adventure - giant crocodiles jumping high into the air, beautiful mermaids gliding through the water and pirate ships sailing through the sky. It all looks so real and the colors are so rich. I enjoyed every bit of it and think you will too! Pan is suitable for ages 8 to 18 because there is some violence but it's not gory. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Nathaniel B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 9</fullReview>

If you are going to watch this movie you must know it's not a remake of Peter Pan, this is a story about who Peter Pan actually is, how he became "the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up" and how Hook became Captain Hook and who princess Tiger Lily is.It's amazingly beautiful and the soundtrack is phenomenal! My husband and I absolutely loved it.All I want by this point is part 2! I want Joe's version of how Wendy Darling enters the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome, i honnestly don't understand why is getting so criticized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHAT A MOVIE! I ONLY DIDN'T GIVE IT A 10, BECAUSE THE "BAD" IN THE MOVIE, ARE GOOD THINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!Is hard not to compare with the first chronicles of Marnia movie and i really don't know why, but there are several similarities.Hugh Jackman is obviously sensational, Rooney Mara too, and she will shut the people who signed that ridiculous petition to change actress, Garrett Hedlund is good too, many people have denied that, but the character, in the way he is in the movie, it did get well played by Garrett, And the boy they have chosen to play Pan, Levi Miller, THEY COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN ANY BETTER! He just rocked, is amazing how good he can act being that young. He was my first concern about the movie because the main acting is the most crucial, and it would be a kid, and is hard to find a kid acting good, so this was a crucial point that would be hard to make work, and they did, Levi Miller was just amazing, i think he can be the next DiCaprio, after all, looks like a young version of him, A LOT, jUS HOPE HE DOESN'T GET TO BE THE NEXT DICAPRIO BECAUSE....Oscar. Do i need to say any more? He also (last time i talk about his acting, u must be like "yeah we get it, the kid is good") rocks in the scenes which he's tied up and black beard is killing all the fairies, he cries and yells, ILL DO ANYTHING JUST STOP!! ANYTHIIING!! AMAZING! and when he meets his mom, cries, and show a perfect mixed expression of sadness, happiness, and satisfaction! this boy just...wow! Now i don't understand the reason of so much hate, there are critics that complain about the lack of magic and wonder in Neverland. What?! mermaids crocodiles, giant floating water balls, a "space" before Neverland, skeletal birds, the fairy kingdom, how is it without magic? And they also complain about the nirvana scene that doesn't make sense but....THE MOVIE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE! U CAN SAY THE SCENE WAS BAD, BUT COMPLAIN BECAUSE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE THEN, WHAT THE HECK MAKES SENSE IN THIS MOVIE? I feel deeply sorry for the people who worked in this movie that i loved, and i have seen how hard they tried (i have came along with the news of this movie's production since December of 2013 when it was announced)and see how hard they worked, to get these reviews of the movie that i personally loved, made me feel kinda sad 4 them, also for Levi Miller, to know that his first major movie, that made him cry when knew he was gonna be a part of it, being so criticized, at least almost ALL the reviews are loving him as an actor, and trust me, this boy is gonna steal every1's heart!Lets see how he's gonna handle it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Family Movie That Even Adults Can Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Mom and I decided to go to the movies last night I thought we might to go "The Walk". Instead we saw "Pan". To get me ready we watched "Hook", and few other earlier "Peter Pan" movies. I didn't understand why they needed to make a new one but this story was different. The other "Peter Pan" movies deal with The Darling family. This one featured Peter.The movie started out with Peter as a baby then moved into his transition of becoming an enchanted boy who could fly. Usually the bad guy in these movies was "Captain Hook" but in this movie Garrett Hedlund played Hook and trust me he was not bad at all. Rooney Mara was great as "Tiger Lilly." Hugh Jackman played "Blackbeard". I am not used to seeing him looking that ugly but he was good. Levi Miller did a great job as "Peter Pan". When you see these movies you don't realized that the actors are not reacting to anything initially. All of the creatures are put in later.THe special effects were beautiful. I loved all of the fairies. I also loved how the movie moved from an cold, sad London of WW2 to Neverland. It was great.This movie is rated PG and has a good story so if you want to take your family out for a cinematic treat this weekend. I think "Pan" would be a good choice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best 3D I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night in a 3D theater. I was not expecting to like it, I was going more for the kids because they wanted to see it. I LOVED it. I have been very disappointed in 3D movies lately and this movie brought back my hope in quality 3D. I am beside myself on the reviews...... I really enjoyed it and would actually like to go see it again. I just wonder if it's going to be as good without the 3D effects. The story is really good. I love seeing Pan and Hook as friends and the story behind the story. Great acting from all actors. I fell in love with Tiger Lily. I hope to see a story of how they become enemies. I highly suggest giving it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I like Peter Pan. It's always been one of my favorite stories. I've got a super cute picture of me at Halloween of my kindergarten year in my award-winning "most original" Peter Pan costume. So while I realize that there's a lot of things that are problematic about the book, I still think there's incredible value in a story that suggest to children that viewing their own inevitable deaths as "an awfully big adventure."If you are not a person who appreciates Peter Pan, don't go see the film. It's not like Hook, Robin Williams isn't there to charm you despite yourself. Pan is a damn fine reimagining of the story you already love. It's visually stunning and occasionally bizarre, surreal like the best dreams. The soundtrack was great, and I liked the 3D effects, although I noticed my friend occasionally having some trouble with them.I was pretty pleased with the acting. Levi Miller was engaging and believable. Rooney Mara was one bad-ass young lady. Hugh Jackman was his own insane pirate - not anyone else's. And Garrett Hedlund seemed aware that he was not Dustin Hoffman or Cyril Ritchard and took his character in a very different.I was also pretty pleased with the way the movie handled the whole issue of "Indians!" Basically, they weren't presented as Indians at all, just a really interesting tribe of people. There were certainly cultural elements, but the visual was way more "raver" than anything else.I feel like I should probably come up with some strong conclusion here, like the value of friendship, or whatever, but honestly, if you are a fan of the whole thing, you should go. If you aren't, you're a cynical jerk and I probably didn't like you anyway.TLDR: Up yours, hater critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pan is the best movie I have seen in a while. Although it is based on the story of Peter Pan, the story is original. It tells the story of how Peter Pan came to be, a sort of back story. It is the tale of Peter in search of his mother whom he has never met. His search takes him from the ordinary world to the stunningly beautiful Neverland. The cast is great and do a great job. Hugh Jackman is not even recognizable as Blackbeard the pirate. Wow is Rooney Mara beautiful as Tiger Lily. The story flows very well and is worth seeing in 3D on the big screen. It is a very fun movie to watch and worth seeing a second time. Once again the critics are wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie for the family. They truly did an outstanding job creating a fresh way to present Peter Pan. This movie is a prequel that I feel definitely did an outstanding job filling in the questions we have about the loved character Peter Pan. The visual effects and design were amazing, in my opinion the movie looked as good as Avatar. The Movie was fun for everyone. It was adult enough in ways to keep parents from passing out and drooling on themselves; and light hearted enough to keep from being to violent to take your children to watch. They had an excellent idea for the fight scenes that I feel most of everyone will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great And Successful Movie With A Giant Budget Of 150 Million $$$$.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter (Levi Miller) is a young boy who is left as a baby on the steps of an orphanage in London by his mother Mary (Amanda Seyfried), an establishment under the care of Mother Barnabas (Kathy Burke). Several years later, during World War II, upon learning that she is hoarding food for herself, Peter and his best friend Nibs steal it to distribute amongst themselves and the other orphans. In the process, Peter finds a letter written by his mother, declaring her love and assuring Peter they will meet again "in this world or the other".In retaliation for the boys' mischief, Mother Barnabas summons pirates who kidnap Nibs and several others. Peter manages to rescue Nibs, but is captured himself and taken to Neverland, a magical realm beyond space and time, where he is forced to become a slave laborer and mine for fairy dust on behalf of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) and where Peter befriends another miner, James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). After insulting Blackbeard's men, Peter is forced to walk the plank, but survives by flying above the water. Blackbeard then confides with him about an old prophecy that a boy who could fly would one day kill him, but Peter refuses to believe he is the said boy.Peter joins Hook and his accomplice, Smee (Adeel Akhtar), in stealing one of Blackbeard's flying boats and escaping into the forest, where they are found and nearly executed by the natives led by Chief Great Little Panther (Jack Charles), before his daughter, Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), notices Peter's pan flute pendant, left to him by Mary, and said to belong to their people's greatest hero, the legendary Pan. Tiger Lily reveals that Peter's father was the Fairy Prince, and that Mary incurred Blackbeard's wrath by rejecting his advances. She was forced to abandon Peter and seek shelter in the Fairy Kingdom. As part of his heritage, Peter has the ability to fly, but unable to do so because of his lack of faith.Fearful of Blackbeard's punishment, Smee betrays the natives' location to him, and in the ensuing battle, Chief Great Little Panther is murdered by Blackbeard, who also reveals he killed Peter's mother. Peter, Hook, and Tiger Lily escape in a raft and head to the Fairy Kingdom to enlist their help in defeating the pirates. Along the way, Peter falls into the river and is nearly eaten by a crocodile before being rescued by the mermaids, after which he has a vision of Blackbeard accidentally killing Mary as she defended the Fairy Kingdom from his offensive. Despondent over their chances, Hook leaves, while Peter and Tiger Lily arrive at the Fairy Kingdom only to be ambushed by Blackbeard, who uses the pan flute pendant to open their gates and launches an attack.Peter escapes and befriends one of the fairies, Tinker Bell. Together, they rally the faries to battle the pirates, and are joined by a returning Hook, who fights Blackbeard's right-hand man Bishop (Nonso Anozie) aboard the stolen ship, which tips over, sending both falling to their deaths. Peter conquers his fears and flies to save Hook, while Blackbeard and his men are overpowered by the faries. Forced into an abyss, they subsequently fall to their deaths; Smee is the sole survivor having fled during the battle. Peter then has a vision of Mary, who reaffirms him to Neverland's great hero, Peter Pan. Shortly afterwards, Peter and Hook, now the captain of the Jolly Roger, return to London to rescue Nibbs and the other orphans, who become part of Peter's crew, the Lost Boys. Peter and Hook then reaffirm their friendship, certain that nothing will ever go wrong between them.This movie is indeed precious and glorious with a giant 150 million $ budget. Recommended for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely fantastic movie, DO NOT READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, COMPLETE LIES!!!!! I'm so glad I didn't read them before watching this movie, what a sin critics are unfairly slamming this masterpiece, they'll eat crow once audiences have a chance to see it for themselves. After watching it, I was so moved that I wanted to read all the rave reviews online, only to be irked by the negativity surrounding this beautiful epic. I am so annoyed that you are reading my first review ever posted on here. This story is so cool, I've always wondered about how Peter Pan came to be, and the storyline is truly magical. Bravo to the writers who completely nailed it! And the kid who plays Peter was absolutely PHENOMENAL, where did they find him? What a talent. Rooney Mara was the perfect Tiger Lily. I will say the only "meh" thing was a CERTAIN actor's campy accent (you'll know exactly who I'm talking about once he appears, I don't want to ruin it) but it's not THAT big a deal and it kind of grows on you as the movie progresses. Other than that, this movie is completely EPIC!! Hands down one of the best children's movies made in decades..my kids were blown away. Shame on the people bashing it - my guess is there must some hidden Hollywood agenda going on here because this movie rocks! Go see it with your kids, you will all be in tears!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Pan exploided by big company WB :) enjoy my review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never give negative reviews... Only those who literally lie to me at the beginning of the movie to give them freedom to f*** up a beloved fairytale/adventure.The problem with this story, is that it puts itself in as a prequel to the original Peter Pan story. The narrator in the beginning refer to the original, and claims to expand on the Peter Pan lore I got excited by that. I love Peter Pan and to be honest even though there were some mistakes, I couldn't wait to see how the Pan story would grow with a prequel... However... This movie never ever touched on the setup the narrator set up for us.Narrator~"because sometimes friends begin as enemies, and enemies begin as friends. Sometimes to truly understand how things end, we must first know how they begin."Really? REALLY?! The only reason they did that, was so they could rewrite the entire Peter Pan story. So they had the name to exploid with nothing to limit their writers. Next time write something original... Well Hook is a good guy, and they (SPOILERALERT) end up better friends than ever at the end of the movie... But wait, didn't they say that this would explain the world of Peter Pan? That was what the narrator said "because sometimes friends begin as enemies, and enemies begin as friends" but they never become enemies, the story in this movie just made a HUGE question-mark where there were non before. I loved the actors and I actually did enjoy the story a little bit, but with small changes it would be fantastic as a original script. Final words: A name doesn't make a good movie, pretty colors doesn't make a good movie, big actors like Hugh Jackman Wolverine doesn't make a good movie and people looking for a cheap cash-in NEVER MAKES A GOOD MOVIE!!!!! WB just don't.</fullReview>

What an opportunity to create the origin story for Peter Pan and Captain Hook, unfortunately they kind of missed it with this movie. There were just so many stupid moments, the type you just cringe at how bad it is, the acting was pretty bad, and the writing was uninspired. I could predict what would happen in my sleep. The final fight was terrible as well. I don't understand why Peter was needed at all. I'm happy that i've seen this movie, so that I know not to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pan is an origins movie (Peter and Hook start out as friends) brightly and colourfully directed by Joe Wright but at the same time derivative of a lot of other films giving it a rather tired familiar look to it.The film starts of during the London of the second world war. Peter (Levi Miller) is left by his mother on the doorstep of an orphanage and wishes for her to return to claim him. The orphanage is a cruel place in the best tradition of Charles Dickens and here the kids keep disappearing.One night pirates come take Peter and his friends away. The Pirate leader Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) has taken slaves from all countries and time zones to mine Pixum, a fairy dust that will wipe out all fairies. Peter who gets in a dispute when he finds some Pixum is made to walk the plank and finds out that he can fly, with the help of James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) and Smee (Adeel Akhtar) they escape from Blackbeard but are captured by Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) and seeing the necklace that Peter has she tells him his mother had fallen in love with a fairy prince and he is their child and Blackbeard also wanted her as he loved her as well.The film starts off as interesting fantasy adventure, dogfights with a sail ship in the skies of London also reminded me of dogfights with dalek ships in an episode of Doctor Who. When Blackbeard makes a grand entrance with a Nirvana song kind of reminds you of A Knight's Tale. Then their are elements of Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean films. Despite the bright colourful storytelling and use of CGI the movie just feels rather unoriginal.Levi Miller plays Peter Pan initially as a courageous and spunky hero who is then filled with self doubts as he tries to learn how to fly. Hugh Jackman suitably hams it up as Blackbeard and he even gets to sing a note or two, it just that his character reminds me too much of the menacing Captain Hook from Peter Pan.This leaves Garrett Hedlund with the 'Brendan Fraser' heroic role. His young James Hook is meant to be romantic, brash but a reluctant hero, he and Peter are friends but Hedlund brings little charisma and is just bland.The film is not bad, kids will enjoy it and it runs along nicely with a blend of action, adventure and special effects but the story is really nothing special.</fullReview>

And though I wish there was more to it - it is still a very entertaining movie. it's a lot of fun, and the acting was excellent. The story line is much more original than other adaptations. Keep in mind, this is a prequel to Peter Pan - This is how he arrived in Neverland and what he had to go through to save his people. Imagination is vivid in this movie - but they really should have not rushed everything so much - It is one of those movies that make you want more - so that is a great attribute in itself. Definitely a family movie - and very kid friendly. We need more movies like this. Friends begin as enemies and enemies begin as friends. Go check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never written a review. I have been a member for many years. No one single movie angered or effected me more than reading critic and general reviews of more than Pan. This movie was brilliant. It was a true Pan, reminding us to never grow up. It catered to us as adults! Hearing them sing Nirvana and The Ramones as well as seeing Hugh in a role I would have NEVER recognized him in was a creative shocker for me. I believe that was the problem here, too many of you grew up and couldn't use your imaginations to see this film for what it was. Pure excellence. I would have given it a high 8 but went to a 10 to make up for the lack of imagination and child-like purity many have looked at this movie with. Go in with an open mind and pure heart and you too will see what I saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different tale of Pan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was interesting, but it could have been better. A lot of time was spent developing the back story to Peter Pan's character before he was taken to Neverland. At first it does not seem needed, but as the story goes on, it adds to the depth of it.Neverland was magnificent. There was a lot of detail in the landscape of Neverland and its surroundings. The floating spheres of water with different sea creatures in them were pretty cool to see. But the Fairy Kingdom was not as glamorous as one would think it would be. It was dull colored, and a super bright shining light is what each fairy looked like. They were way too bright to look at.Blackbeard, played by Hugh Jackman, was an interesting character. Jackman did a much better job playing an evil pirate than what was anticipated.This movie really did not show much of Peter Pan as the hero he is supposed to be up until towards the end. He did not do much, but the movie was left to lead viewers onto a new chapter to the story of Peter Pan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Pan's origin story, we were entertained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At home on DVD. The picture and sound are quite spectacular. It has enough deep bass to give a subwoofer a nice workout. Which always pleases me.This is the origin story for Peter Pan. It starts when his mother leaves him as a baby in an orphanage where he grows to the age of 12 or so. Then he and the other boys are taken by Blackbeard to become his crew, but Captain Hook comes along to help free them. Plus Tiger Lily comes along.Of course most of it is silly, over-the-top acting, especially by Blackbeard and Hook. Peter and Tiger Lily are more dramatic with little comedy.My only complaint is what I call "sensory overload" during the last half-hour or so of the movie, lots of chases by flying pirate ships, ascent into the Stratosphere, cannon shots, lots of things going on ... a bit too much at times. Still, it was a good flick for a weekend.Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard, young Australian Levi Miller as Peter. American Garrett Hedlund as Hook, American Rooney Mara with a decent English accent as Tiger Lily, and we don't see much of her but American Amanda Seyfried as Peter's mother, Mary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting way of introducing Peter Pan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly don't listen to any of the bad reviews. I am sure a lot of people have their own ideas of how Peter Pan became well Peter Pan and how he came to live and stay on Neverland, I believe that director Joe Wright had a very good vision on the story and he directed this version very well. The only 2 things that I don't agree with are that Tiger Lily shouldn't be a grown up as in the original she was a young girl and the second thing is that Hook and Tiger Lily shouldn't have fancied each other. I thought everything else was really well done the 3 main actors/actresses acted really well in it especially the young boy who acted as Peter Pan. I really enjoyed the bit in the fairy land and how they introduced Tinker Bell and they should have added her helping Peter out more. The movie was full of adventure and fantasy and any child would enjoy this movie. Lastly what michaeltong-29180 said about Hook and Peter being allies is pointless, it isn't as most enemies are friends from the start. Also what he said about the pirate ships being able to fly in the real world and in Neverland shouldn't happen and didn't happen in the original film isn't true as Peter Pan took Wendy back to London in a flying pirate ship. And lastly about the Peter flying being dragged around by a mouse cursor I don't agree with as I thought that bit was very well done. I would watch this movie over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not another Disney Princess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly the story's development is not that bad considering that the original Peter Pan story took place way before the 1940's, Joe Wright's interpretation was new and creative. In honesty many of the overlying themes in the film responded with me more as an adult than the child within. Blackbeard's entire struggle with Death and complete lack of acceptance that life is limited. Hook and his obviously messed up childhood, along with underlying emotions that he can't express with tiger lily (Mommy Issues). Even Peter himself has had to deal with situations way beyond any child. Joe Wright gave an off the wall interpretation and I for one was glad to see something more than another adaptation of if the shoe fits the princess. Tiger Lily was completely awesome. She served not only a fantastic role model to young girls, but was often the warrior behind most of the battles, she could totally take Hook in a fight. While some of the acting was over the top I argue that that too is a theme of Peter Pan, a story of a boy who never grows up and can fly. Gee I wonder why people would find it unrealistic? I'm guessing most of the critics against this film were men or 1950's house wives who still believe that the Grimm fairy tales come first in creating a well lived society. Personally, the film is a must see and takes a classic tale in a new direction that frankly among all the boring remakes and sequels was refreshing to watch. Don't think of it as Peter Pan, go in with fresh eyes and you'll see that each and every one of those characters brought together a fantastical and fun-loving story.</fullReview>

I have seen the Disney version of peter pan, and vaguely familiar with the story. So someone did something different, is that bad? I thought the story was neat, and they definitely left enough wonder for sequels, and I can't wait to see them. We have to wonder how Hook becomes a bad guy....and what more adventures Peter and company get into. The ending left me teary eyed and my son ready to watch it again. I was entertained through and through. So I'm not the best reviewer, and maybe this movie is no Forrest Gump or Godfather or Shawshank Redemption, but it kept my interest twice in 2 nights, and I'm sure I'll be begged to play it again for my 7 son plenty of times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Inventive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie it was very inventive, especially the grungy feel that came along with some of the colors and songs they sung in the movie, i think it is a great prequel. The friendship between hook and pan was a little hard to get used to, because I'm so used to the stories. I did how ever loved that fact that tiger lily was in the story, because she is in the original and the Disney animated movie as well. yes there were some story flaws, but in other ways it made up for them. I am actually looking forward to see if they do make sequel to see how exactly hook and pan split their friendship and it better involve a crocodile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lousy with tons of ugly CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The origin story of Peter Pan that nobody asked for and nobody went to see. I would have totally avoided it, too, had it not been directed by Joe Wright, who has been a reliably good director since his debut feature, Pride and Prejudice, ten years ago. This is easily his worst film to date. It's one of the loudest, most CGI-ed movies in the year that gave us Mad Max: Fury Road, which made me realize how much I hate CGI. The visuals are really ugly throughout. Levi Miller is a boring Peter Pan and Garrett Hedlund a terrible Captain Hook (they're best friends in this film - they're enmity apparently comes later). Better are Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard, apparently the major pirate in Neverland before Hook, and Rooney Mara as, um, Tiger Lily. I guess they decided the whole Indian thing in Peter Pan was racist, so their solution to that problem was to cast a white girl. But she's good in the movie, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching Pan, which I sadly missed it in theater last year. Though I enjoyed it immensely, I somewhat understand why it flopped so badly now. The story line and characters were very well thought out and very well acted (loved every actor choice!), but overall the feel of the film was like someone shoved a few too many ideas into it. The most notable of which were a few questionable and lingering camera angles, music choices and a sound quality that seemed lacking. At the end those few things left me going, huh? Despite that, if they made a sequel and perhaps had a more ruthless editor to reign in some of the creativity, I'd go see it. The writer and actors captured the original characters and brought them to life in a way that JM Barrie would be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I'll try to write something without spoilers. If you like your films to be perfectly executed or a film critic, then this film is probably not be for you. However, if you are childish at heart and enjoyed Hook then you will probably enjoy this. I found it to be pleasantly clean fun albeit with some less believable moments. But if you are happy to suspend reality for while then just sit back and enjoy. Having, said that there are moments in this film which are quite likely scarier for younger children so the PG rating is quite valid (I'll leave that deliberately vague as what children find scary differs so much between individuals). Essentially if you have worries about suitability for your child watch it first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, apparently the 30th was a big movie-watching day for me. I even watched this strange little movie, Pan. So what does IMDb say it's about?"12-year-old orphan Peter is spirited away to the magical world of Neverland, where he finds both fun and danger, and ultimately discovers his destiny -- to become the hero who will be forever known as Peter Pan."All in all the movie isn't really that bad. It is well made, and tells a reasonable fun story. Absolutely a movie for the family, although there are some weird violent moments that might make it for the older kids. You also have a dynamite performance from Hugh Jackman, proving that he commits 100% to every role he takes one, and no one in the movie does a particularly bad job. That said, Garrett Hedlund's performance choices as Hook do border on the baffling.With that said, Pan has some problems. It's absolutely a cute movie, and might even be enjoyable if you're not someone who watches movies and subconsciously picks them apart. The computer generated effects, for example, when Peter flies around are really distracted, as the movie becomes The Polar Express in those scenes. I would almost argue that the flight in Hook was more believable.Another strange dropped thread in the movie are the musical moments. Upon Peter's arrival in Neverland, the crowd of kidnapped orphan slaves singing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" to Blackbeard. This happens one other time, with the same orphan slaves singing "Blitzkreig Bop" later on, but that's it. It never happens again. It's almost like two different writers worked on different parts of the movie and didn't share notes.It's a fine movie if you're a kid or a parent, and want something fun and well made to kill some time to, but it's not a GREAT movie by any stretch. Cute, but not without problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved Peter Pan. I loved every single story told about him and watched every movie involving him including Once Upon A Time with Hook and Pan but when I saw this movie I was like "What the hell IS this? Where is the ACTUAL plot? There is just too many questions left unanswered. I am so disappointed because of this. If they are going to make a sequel, AT LEAST leave answers this time and just follow the original plot.Pan is a 2015 American 3D fantasy action-adventure family film directed by Joe Wright. The film is a prequel to Scottish author J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan story, first staged in 1904. It serves as an alternative origin story for Peter Pan and Captain Hook.The story is basically about Peter, abandoned as an orphan, who gets kidnapped by Blackbeard to mine for Pixie Dust so that Blackbeard can live eternal youth. Blackbeard is also at war with the Red Indians and a rebellion is taking place. It also shows the friendship Pan and Hook had before they lead to what they are destined to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Peter Pan adaptation EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I can see the enjoyment of this film as family entertainment, its probably great for kids around the age of 3-4, as it has scenes with nice flashy lights and lots of colors. However as a movie, and from an entertainment perspective is utter crap. Excuse my French.I do not know what is worse; the horrid choice of music, the terrible dialog, almost plastic looking CGI or perhaps the terrible choice of actors, and their performances. The only almost descent acting that managed to get at least some life into its character was performed by Hugh Jackman, for his character Blackbeard... but even then they had to ruin it, by making half of his armor a dress, (He has a BOW on his ASS for Gods sake!!) and then introducing him with song. I can get it if Disney does it, but at least they do the stuff with style. In this situation they just ruined a perfectly good Nirvana song. And how about the fact that Peter is actually non-essential to the entire plot of the movie? He does literally nothing to stop Blackbeard, the fairies (or the little balls of light) do all the heavy lifting while he does "fancy" arm movements to show them what general direction to go. If he has any purpose to the storyline it is perhaps only acting as a delivery boy, giving Blackbeard the pan (key) so that he can access the fairies secret kingdom. I had such high expectations of this movie, the trailer looked sooo exciting! But it only showed the moments in the movie that looked cool, cut the dialog so that it actually sounded reasonable and had no shitty singing scenes. I was warned not to watch this movie by a friend, still I did it. Now I warn you; DO NOT WATCH THIS. If you have ever seen either Hook or Disney's version of the story, stay as far away from this garbage as you possibly can! I might recommend for you to check out Finding Neverland instead, its leaps and bounds better than this; with better acting and a more interesting story. Even the mini TV-series Neverland is better than this, if you guys want the pre-Disney story. But do not watch this. It's bad, and should be ashamed of itself.</fullReview>

But overall I enjoyed it. The singing kind of through me off in the early part of the movie. I watched it with my 8yr old Daughter and after a while she fell asleep but she did have a busy day prior to watching the film. I gave the movie a 7 for the background of how the fabled cast of the story became involved, but for a child, I wonder if it became too deep at sometimes. Nice large epic scenes that made the movie move at a nice pace. For us adults that have loved the mindset of never growing up we will enjoy it. I don't recommend it for a child under 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vastly Violated Movie by the Critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid adventure movie watcher (die-hard fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, Hook, Peter Pan, Master &amp; Commander, Robin Hood, etc.), I found Pan a fun, engaging, and rewarding experience. I believe the early reviews by craggy Hollywood critics may have killed this film. Sure it had its faults, as does nearly every movie. Perhaps more stars would have fueled the popularity (e.g., Ewan McGregor as James Hook). The faults, however, do not override the plot, effects, chemistry, etc. Overall I score this movie highly because of the simple fact that I enjoyed it so much. It made me thrilled. It made me intrigued. It made me smile. It made me happy. What more can you ask for from an adventure movie? Pan... panned wrongfully. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marketing for this movie was WAY OFF.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this a solid 7 out of 10 stars. It actually was well directed and well acted. The SFX was superb and the story line wasn't bad either. I waited till I had nothing else better to do and decided to watch it. Now to my point of the title of this review. YES, the marketing team totally marketed this film wrong! If they had marketed it differently, catered more towards the older adults perhaps it would have made more money in it's grand opening. A 150 mil flick which took in 15 mil. on it's opening weekend is a total bomb. I'm a 40 year old man so when it came out and I saw the previews I could've sworn I thought this was a musical family movie. Jackman having a singing background, yes he was a very accomplished singer before his rise to stardom, I thought we are going to see another character where Jackman wears black tights and croons out pirate melodies. Boy was I way off. I don't recall him singing anything in this movie. In fact, he played the evil villain brilliantly. I totally despised him at the end. The story was interesting as well, it did start out like a family movie but little by little Joe Wright decided to ease us in to a more PG-13 rating towards the middle and end of the movie. The sfx was excellent. Wish I could've been there to see it in its full glory, the big screen and 3-D. It probably would've been amazing to watch. That crocodile that jumped out of the water was very well executed and so believable looking. This movie did not try so hard to be a family movie. It pretty much hit all the right notes for me and at the end I felt very satisfied that I saw a well-crafted movie. I would recommend it to anyone. Too bad the marketing team slipped with this one, it could've been a blockbuster! Perhaps made a few sequels but atlas it fell short. And that's a shame. Maybe word of mouth will save this film and make it into a cult classic, who knows. Until then do yourself a favor and watch this great flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been better if it WASN'T a Peter Pan Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the end of the film I was absolutely convinced that what was produced was NOT the original story or screenplay. Most likely the writer had a fun adventure planned out for a poor orphaned boy from WWII England. It was suggested that he was dyslexic, which I thought had some potential - being myself married to a brilliant dyslexic. In any case, I imagine that the writer took his screenplay to various producers who said something along the lines of "That's a nice story, but no one has ever heard of it. We can't SELL it. Can't you turn it into, oh, say Peter Pan? We can sell Peter Pan."So the poor writer hacks and slashes his work to conform it to Mr. Barrie's tale and it becomes an abomination of both his original story and that of Peter Pan. Visually impressive. A good performance by its young lead, but he is wasted on such a mishmash of a story. Hook? Grating on the senses. Tiger Lily? Perhaps in a different universe she would work, with an entirely different name. Blackbeard? Mr. Jackson should read the script before signing on to do his next film, although he does make a good villain. Nirvana??? Utterly inexplicable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Family Movie - Don't understand the bad ratings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Peter Pan lore, I was disheartened to see all of the bad reviews of this movie by both movie goers and critics. In fact, as much as I wanted to see it with my family, I was pressed for time and decided that it was probably going to be a horrible take on a story I loved, and so I passed while in the theater. Having now watched it (tv rental), I hate that I didn't go to the theater, as it deserved to make more money than it did, which I assume is largely due to those same reviews.The movie was fantastic. The settings were perfect. The sense of imagination and wonder that a place like "Neverland" should hold were all present. Blackbeard and Hook were both as gregarious as they SHOULD be, especially considering what we all know Hook will become. Hook's portrayal has excellent, as you could imagine this person someday morphing into the Hook that everyone knows. Peter's journey to discover who he was played out very nicely.The only slightly off-putting things might be that the accent at the very beginning was so thick, it took a moment to adjust, resulting in missing a bit of the beginning dialog; and, the only other issue being a couple of instances where visuals of Peter flying from a distance were poorly done computer graphics. But, the flying thing did not interfere with the feel of the movie more than minimally, and the rest of the settings were so well done, that I assumed it was an issue of staying within budget, so where do sacrifices have to be made.If you like a fun adventure, especially one telling a very good "origin story" of a great Disney character, then I would think you would enjoy this very much. Or, at least don't forgo the experience due to some of the reviews you are seeing here or elsewhere. Judge for yourself. But, more importantly, have some fun seeing an excellent movie. I, my wife, and my 8 year old son all enjoyed it tremendously. Additionally, we watched it in 3D, and that was very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film - very underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hesitated to view the film due to bad reviews overall, but found it to be surprisingly good. For one thing, the special effects are stupendous. The (SPOILER) scene in the crystal caves toward the end made them look as realistic as the real-life crystal caves of Mexico's Yucatan as shown in a National Geographic site video. The movie deviates wildly from the well-known versions, (i.e. as far as SPOILER SPOILER the evil "captain" not being the person named Hook etc.) but if anything this was helpful as it made the story unpredictable. Although the goings-on were ludicrous (as they would have to be given its fantasy nature), everyone had sufficient "gravitas" to pull it off, including the child playing Peter (Levi Miller), the Princess (Rooney Mara) and Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). There was a very inspired use of, of all things, Nirvana tunes that did not seem "anachronistic." There were a couple of negatives - a lot of it was derivative of other films, i.e. as if "Mad Max meets Avatar meets Indiana Jones." Also, despite other A+ special effects, the flying birds looked like Disney cartoon characters, which didn't fit the overall look of the film. However, I found it to be very engaging, and splendid to look at, and didn't feel I'd wasted my 2 hours (as I often do after having watched a film.:))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure, definitely not for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning this movie clearly defines itself as a child's film. However it is most certainly not suitable for children and I am saying this as someone who oft ridicules people for believing movies would be "disturbing" to children. It is a lot like Mad Mad Fury Road after a painting factory explosion. Yes, there are no on screen brutalities a la Spartacus, but the movie still manages to instill the same emotion of carnage and slaughter. That, coupled with the Dickensian themes, slave labour, tribal barbarity and numerous, albeit stylised, deaths makes Pan simply not suitable for children.On a more positive note, the acting is great. Hugh Jackman, Rooney Mara, Garrett Hedlund. Even the child actors are quite convincing, although the main protagonist seems too forced to channel adventure and Indiana Jones and ends up being a lot more like Christopher from The Sopranos.The dialogue and script are more or less a collection of clichés to fill the time until the next rainbow massacre. Still, the movie is solid, well paced and there are quite a few witty parts and scenes the one could easily love.All in all Pan is a movie that a person will initially dislike, because it is a child's film that is not a child's film. But then one realises that despite all the bad parts it is actually kind of awesome.</fullReview>

Especially Garrett Hedlund character 'James Hook' really annoy's me. His lines are cheesy and painful to watch. Levi Miller plays his part as 'Peter' very well he did a good job. I didn't like the pirates either they all looked so fake.The graphics in the film are not that good.

So far so good.But unfortunately this movie has its flaws. The plot especially is way too simple. I mean you can't change the plot of the "classic" Peter Pan, but I expected a little bit more. The twists are weak and at times the movie continues slowly.Anyway, I think is a great family-movie, perfect especially for those who have grown up with the animated film.</fullReview>

Both Falak (who is 7) and Isaac (who will be 4 in Jan) enjoyed it. Basically what Warner Brothers did was get a pot threw in the movies Oliver, Mad Max, Hook (Spielberg's version), Peter Pan and Avator together with the end result being 'Pan'. Its no masterpiece but since the children enjoyed it, I will give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Levi Miller as Peter was over the top and some times goosebumps worthy. He's precious and talented way beyond his years. I see grand things for him in the future. The ever stunning Rooney Mara was once again stunning. Poorly casted as native Tiger Lily but she carried the role with grace and beauty. Hugh Jackman, aka the Jack of all characters, Blackbeard was once again top of is craft. You actually forget it's him because he sinks into a role like a magical being. Best of all was the comedic relief of Smiegal. His humor and goofiness rounded out the film and really made it enjoyable. What a wild beautifully done ride.</fullReview>

The acting was really brilliant Hugh Jackman was ace and very crazy looking as Blackbeard (even if he did remind me of Johnny Depp Lil), Garrett hedlund was funny, hot and gave a different side to Hook. The kid playing Peter was OK for a up and coming actor. Just needs to work on his line delivery a bit as some of his line reads seemed a bit flat. Rooney Mara was excellent as Tiger Lily! The upgrade to ww2 era London was interesting and different. Only gripe I had with it was the *spoiler alert* cliché chosen one plot but apart from that, pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time in a movie land far,far away there was a movie called Hook. Peter was a grown man in this film and as far as I know that movie did not do so well. Not even with an all star cast,a big budget and a great director.According to me this movie does everything right and fits perfectly as a prequel to the Peter Pan story. From the first scene on I was intrigued to know more about this world and the characters it inhabits. The story,the performances and the visuals all felt top notch and I thought Hugh Jackman was close to brilliant in this. His role was written in such a way that you sympathize with 'm but at the same time you also fear him.You could argue that some characters are underused but that is actually good for the pacing of the movie. This was just solid entertainment and although for some it might be a little "off" ,I'm one of those people who actually likes "off".I hope that with the passing of time more people will appreciate this movie because for me it was a welcome idea as a spin off to the well known classic fairytale.Put some pixum in your life and give it a try.Let the Pan franchise begin.Happy thoughts!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the heck were they thinking?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's some things that never cease to amaze me in the film world. Huge films with great potential loved by tons of people and then bomb, and then outright flops that flop. The first is surprising because there's no way anyone can see the flop coming (like Steve Jobs), the latter is surprising because everyone can see the flop coming yet the studio and everyone involved thinks it will be a huge success, like Pan.It there's something that really makes my jaw drop, and my tension to rise, is how the heck can a studio, that has tons of people that breathe films can greenlight a high budget flop of this size when there's flop written all over it. And then, how can someone write and direct this and think its a good thing they are doing. How, how i ask? Is everyone blind? I mean is way easier to have something great on the path to success and thinking it is bound to flop than to have something bad bound to succeed. But hey, they keep doing it. And once here and there i keep falling. This film is just so poorly written it can be quite surprising, there's no point in the story, it goes on and on going nowhere, and without a sense of reason, is just things happening with no substance. Its like well i think this should happen, but then there's nothing to support that. Is like putting a romance out of nowhere in the film and then never talk about it, it just happened and now we have to deal with it.The dialogue is quite bad, the performances are not good (aside from one, but i will get there in a moment), Hugh Jackman gives a weird performance, and so does Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara, poor thing, she does the best she can with what she has (which is barely something), but thats it, the performances are like this mainly because they don't have nothing to work with. Though Levi Miller gives an outstanding performance as Pan, something that should be awarded just for being able to be so great in something bad. The action is one the few things that is satisfying, even though it is far from being something great. The production design has its moments but there's some very weird things, like the fairy world. the special effects are terrible but are far from being good, and when this happens in a film that is 99% CGI, well there's something wrong going on. The score is really the best thing is this film alongside Levi Miller. It is quite energetic and gives a special flavor that the film never produces. In the end, i really don't know what was the point in making this origin story, that barely has a story, where a 6 year old kid could write a far better film. You just can't see this film and shake the feeling of what was the point? This is just a very weird film, it is not terrible, you are entertained, but really, what were they thinking?!</fullReview>

(In that version, Pan stole souls, was evil, and too old!) The worst "Pans" to date remain both "Hook" and the NBC special, killed by Chris Walken and technical glitches. I hope this one does well-enough worldwide to continue on, as it bombed in the USA. Hugh Jackman puts in a superior performance, as does the (newcomer) little boy. Curiously filmed in beautiful Australia, just like the 2003 live-action version, which I strongly recommend to almost all ages. Why can't someone make the version I want, which is a motion-capture version with the "Mary Martin" book and musical score? All of a sudden "Pan" is the new "Scrooge" with several new versions both good and bad. (Parents pulled children out of the "Disney-released" Scrooge as it scared little children, as well.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is OK but the pirate is terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Is my kid's review. He's 6,5 years old. :)I would give it a 10 but the pirate is just too terrifying. Also I don't like the part when they kidnapped children from the orphanage. Pan's ability to fly is every child's dream come true!The special effects were amazing especially the flying ships and the ship battle when a ship was blown to pieces!Also pan in space was very funny.The mine reminded me of minecraft.I didn't like the part when Pan's mother left him in the orphanage, it was just too sad.All together, never mind the sad/terrifying parts, it is an awesome movie for kids.Maybe even for their parents too. I would probably give it a higher score but the pirate was too scary!We have nothing more to say... So much from us! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Film with a Few Major Plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't too sure about this movie when I first started seeing previews for it but I actually ended up enjoying it for the most part. It's a very strange movie. Honestly, it's probably better to come into the film with no preconceived expectations but it's a little hard to do that since it's a prequel to Peter Pan. The problem is that this film really doesn't fit together too well with its eventual sequel story and the film itself has quite a few plot holes, and we're not talking about nit-picky plot holes but the humongous kind that leave you scratching your head during the film. Despite these plot holes, the film is still enjoyable and it's directed beautifully by Joe Wright. Let's talk about the story first.Peter (Levi Miller) is a young orphan that's trying to get by in a dingy orphanage during the London bombing raids of World War II. Peter believes that his mother is coming back to find him and he's determined to wait for her. He and a friend of his notice that more and more children are starting to disappear each night and become a bit suspicious. Unfortunately, Peter finds out exactly what's going on when pirates in a flying pirate ship (don't think about it too hard) capture the children to use as slave labor in a place called Neverland. It turns out the orphans are being used by the pirate leader Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) to cultivate a material made from fairies. Peter eventually escapes Blackbeard with the help of a man named Hook (Garrett Hedlund) and decides to look for a group of natives opposed to the pirates and ends up finding out that his destiny is inextricably linked to that of Neverland's.The characters in this film are pretty likable and come off as cartoony yet still different from the Peter Pan that we know and love. Levi Miller is a very decent actor for his age and is completely believable considering all of the stuff this poor kid has to go through. He's much more unsure of himself than the Peter Pan from the animated movie but it makes sense since he's younger and inexperienced. Hugh Jackman has mastered the art of chewing the scenery in many of his films and this one is no exception. Despite that, I can't help but love this guy in everything he does. He brings so much enthusiasm to each and every role and he makes those characters fun to watch. Hedlund does an interesting Hook. He's not a villain in this film but is portrayed as more of an antihero, though I'm not sure what's up with his accent. I won't even try to describe it but it's goofy and fits perfectly with the mood of the film. Rooney Mara also plays in this movie as Tiger Lily. Her character is also very likable but she doesn't exactly scream 'Native American' to me. She's actually the whitest person in the whole of the tribal lands. Overall, the characters are likable and I can't complain about their performances.Neverland itself is very diverse and we get to see quite a few locales during the film. Everything from desolate mountains, jungles, and swamps are all represented in Neverland. The world building is actually very enjoyable and the change of scenery helps to keep the movie interesting. The pirate ships are a little over the top but it works out fine since the whole movie requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. However, there are a few flaws that keep the film from being fantastic.I'm going to be getting into spoiler territory here so be warned. The plot holes in this movie are very difficult to ignore. First, why are fairies useless unless Peter is controlling/commanding them? They seem incredibly incompetent at first and then are incredibly powerful and take on the pirates easily. Is Peter Pan a superhero with some kind of fairy power? He certainly comes off as a superhero at times in this film. Also, Neverland is hinted at being a place where orphans go when they die. If this is true, does that mean Peter Pan murders people when he brings them to Neverland? That makes Peter a much darker character. Third, why isn't Hook a pirate? He comes off as very heroic throughout the film and we don't see any sign of his eventual transformation into the villainous pirate captain. Why does every movie have to be set up to be a franchise? I actually enjoyed a lot of the film but there are some truly bizarre plot holes that left me scratching my head. I'm usually pretty good at ignoring tiny plot holes that don't really need to be answered to make a movie enjoyable but these are a bit different. They try to explain what Neverland actually is in this film but that makes Peter's future actions much more sadistic than they actually are, especially considering Peter and his friends can travel between the worlds at will. So Neverland isn't what Blackbeard said it was but in that case why would Blackbeard compare the place to death? What benefit could he possibly achieve from that? All in all, the movie is still really fun but the ending is a little hard to swallow and the plot holes start to pile up after a while. I would still recommend giving it a watch but don't expect master storytelling or anything like that. Just enjoy the visuals and the craziness and you'll be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan was another enjoyable version of the Peter Pan story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, who had seen this before and enjoyed it. I did too. This was quite an enjoyable early story of Peter Pan and his then-friendship with James Hook as well as Tiger Lilly. And then there's the villain of Blackbeard who's perfectly portrayed by Hugh Jackman. I especially liked it when he did his version of the Nirvana song. We saw this in 3-D which was pretty impressive though it would have been just as enjoyable in the regular format. Good humor and plenty of awesome action sequences abounded. Part of me did wonder how Hook and Pan would eventually be enemies but since this isn't cannon with the other Pan movies, I wasn't too concerned. Really, I'll just now say I highly recommend Pan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music a bit lacking, but powerful performance of Levi Miller(Pan)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan was very good. The music score I felt although at the beginning very good, however thou throughout the film, the music decreased. In my opinion, I think you should actually read up on the story of the Boy who never grew up. hahaah. I found the storyline a bit confusing in particular below relating to the fairies and the mother of PanThe film, tells a story of a boy who is orphaned into an orphanage in a setting of World War 2. He is mistreated by the Matron or the Mother Superior. One particular night he is abducted by apparently pirates. Captain Blackbeard(Jackman) heads the pirates. He welcomes the boys "Welcome to NEVERLAND". It is then made apparent that Pan(Miller) is actually "special", ie to "fulfill the prophecy". So he befriends James Hook(Garrett Hedlund) who "lies as he's a Grownup", ahahah. Great laugh that was. Then Hook and Pan actually escape into a fairyland. Now this bit I was COMPLETELY lost. All I know they's the Goodies. hahaha. The Pirates then catch up. A war ensues. The now infamous Tinkerbell, says I to meself: "Oh she's on her own now, ie she has her own movies"."Home is not where you're from, but Home is what you make"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely boyish adventure without being too childish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I watch these movies in 3D, with Pan I made differently and watched it in 2D. Movie is colourful and looks beautiful so I was little disappoint that I didn't spent few more Euros for 3D version. As a movie Pan is like a prequel to Peter Pan's story and it tells, how legend was born. It is quite nasty to notify that captain Hook was originally Peters friend. It would be interesting to see how these two friends became to enemies in the future, but that might never happen because of movies success this far an that is a pity. Movie plot is nicely boyish and script is smooth. Levi Miller is a good choice to play Peter and Hugh Jackson is brilliant as a captain Blackbeard. Adventure aspirates you in the story and keeps you tightly to follow it. Beginning of the movie is sharp, middle part of the movie is smooth and the ending is nicely timed. Script is fluent and there are no vain stops at the story. I could easily to give this movie full five stars, but there are few things to irritating. Movie has few nice musical scenes. Nirvana's Smells like Teen Spirit is quite ingenious when Pan arrives to Neverland and that makes you to wait more. Few more musical scenes like this and movie would be perfect. Unfortunately there are not more these enjoyable scenes. After all Pan is well worth of a movie ticket. As soon I can get it in BlueRay 3D I will watch it again. Beautiful, compelling and nicely boyish adventure without being too childish. A great fairy tale nice prequel to Peter Pan story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Disney fairy tale re-imagining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pan" is the latest Disney live-action remake/reboot/prequel of a classic story and is directed by Joe Wright.'Sometimes, friends begin as enemies and enemies begin as friends', the narration says at the beginning. This is a good indicator that what you're getting into isn't your typical Neverland story.Peter Pan is left as a baby at the doorstep of an orphanage in England. When he grows up, World War II is in full swing, with the blitz arriving at his doorstep. Meanwhile, orphans keep disappearing and Peter begins to learn the true identity of his mother.What follows is an adventure to the famous Neverland, re-imagined for modern audiences with CGI creatures, pirates singing covers of Nirvana and the Ramones. There are tribesmen and mermaids too, among other fantastical things.Hugh Jackman is the highlight of the film as the villainous Blackbeard, especially in a scene early on where he confronts Peter about his flying powers, and the legend that a boy will come to rise up against him "Have you come to kill me, Peter?" he says in a somber tone. He has a charm and menace about him that suits the role well, and makes his unique looking character all the more memorable.Levi Miller as Peter Pan performs well, as does the rest of the cast, but I found Hook's portrayal by Garrett Hedlund to be grating and distracting to watch. Maybe it's the accent they gave him, the actor's performance, or the overt sincerity of the character - a character which acts completely different in the original story. I just couldn't see him becoming Captain Hook. The love story between him and Princess Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) also seemed forced and underdeveloped; put in as an afterthought to break up all the action set pieces.Speaking of action set pieces, there are a lot of them. For the most part, they're pretty good, like early on when Peter and Hook escape Blackbeard's mines. But near the end of the film, they seemed a bit extraneous and unnecessary, some scenes could have been shortened or cut out and it wouldn't have hurt the picture.The final showdown between Peter and Blackbeard seemed a bit rushed, though, with Peter suddenly gaining magical powers, just for the convenience of the plot - it seemed to come out of nowhere.Joe Wright knows how to make a beautiful looking movie, each scene comes alive with his distinct touch. The score composed by John Powell is equally enchanting as well."Pan" is a pretty watchable movie, let down by some flaws in writing and casting. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Visuals will have you say "Holy Pudding". The story will have you say, "Ehh"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robbie K here bringing you another review on the latest movies to hit the theater. This weekend we start off with another iteration about the famous boy who flies, fights off pirates, and flirts with mermaids. That's right I'm talking about Peter Pan. Over the decades we've experienced numerous spins on the tale, and yet I can't recall too many films portraying Peter's origins. Well hold on to your hats folks, because director Joe Wright has brought his tale to the silver screen entitled Pan. Let's start with the story. We know all the classic elements of Peter Pan, but perhaps you have questioned the origins of our title character. Pan's tale dives into the impoverished England, once more strolling down the Oliver Twist orphan path as the opening of Peter's tale. The origin lacks much in terms of originality, but bypasses gross details to get to the meat of the story. Once Peter is abducted to the ageless Neverland, the tale begins to liven up. Pan forgoes a lot of the character development and emotional buildup for superficial thrills. Peter's relationship with a lot of characters evolves rapidly, from simple hellos to becoming their wards. Fans will certainly not suffer a drawn out plot, but may not like the rapid and abrupt scene transitions. I give Wright his props for adding some darker moments while maintaining the kid friendly environment, but I felt he was a little to ADD in organizing the story. Peter's journey reaches many impasses, however they blow over without much struggle with our good guys able to overpower their oppressors with ease. The characters that are part of this plot were also lacking. Acting wise I give them a round of applause, each member certainly doing their best to breathe life into their characters. Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard has the gruff and ruthlessness of a pirate Captain, but soon becomes annoying with his constant screaming and pompous braggart. I did enjoy the use of metal songs as his anthem, a nice touch of modern metal. Garrett Hedlund as Hook captures the classic voice, but his look and presence comes off more Midwestern desperado than future pirate. Levi Miller plays the adolescent Peter quite well, nailing the devious, adventurous, and vulnerable sides of Pan while keeping everything balanced. However it is Rooney Mara who takes first place, bringing a nice balance of wonder, courage, and emotion as the warrior princess Tiger Lily, minus a few flat moments. Simplistic story and characters aside, Pan's action is surprisingly higher intensity than I expected. The opening chase between pirate ship and plane is quite exhilarating with all the stunts, explosions, and elements of a World War II movie. From there the action remains dynamic as our characters navigate the various hazards of the world, interjecting combat and comedy to keep it entertaining. Again these conflicts sometimes end without much of a struggle, and a bit anticlimactic at times. Still I appreciate Wright slightly breaking the PG mold and adding some quality edge to the mix. I warn parents there are a few moments that might seem a tad too mature (i.e. executions), so evaluate your children's psyche before attending this film. Finally the best quality of Pan for me was the setting. Wright's team designed a world that is majestic enough to have you say "Holy Pudding". The jungle is ominous, filled with deep foliage that offers shelter from the pirates, while also concealing ominous predators. Pirate ships are decorated to mirror their "helmsmen", such as Blackbeard's ship being cold and lifeless to personify the merciless man he is. And mermaid lagoon, while not as passive as it was in the cartoon, still held the serenity, especially once the gorgeous glowing, (CGI enhanced) mermaids who glow showed up. Even the costumes help pull you into the moment, the pirates having styles that span from traditional buccaneers to more formal, butler ware?okay not everything makes sense. Fortunately the tribal people bring about the hunter atmosphere, blending multiple cultures into their attire and dwellings. While certainly not the most impressive, Pan's world has the color, whimsy, and magic that captured all our hearts years ago. Overall Pan is not the best movie to "soar" into theaters. However, it offers a good, kid friendly movie to entertain until the holiday season arrives. It's a fun thrilling ride for all ages that lays foundation for other movies, (either existing or new), while recapturing the moments you grew up with. Unfortunately the story just wasn't as put together as I hoped it would be, or as thrilling as the trailers made it out to be. Worth a trip to theater? Only for the special effects and setting can I say it is worth a theater trip, but your money is best saved for other films. My scores are: Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

Visually, so much fun to watch! Just have to see to believe me.Visually the film is incredible. I hope it wins best cinematography. Incredible, beautiful shots, and the make-up &amp; costumes are out of this world. It's just pure eye-candy! There is one scene, that is the most incredible thing I've ever seen on screen. No spoilers; You'll know it when you see the tree :)The kid does a great job as Pan, Jackman of course is incredible. Felt like he channeled some old energy back in the Fountain.The only reason I gave it a 9 - I wish the film pushed to 3 hrs...It seemed like the pre-story to the tale of PeterPan was scrunched into only 2 hrs...Every important scene explaining the history just felt too brief. I wanted MORE!! Overall - Such a fun, beautiful film to experience, especially in 3d. It makes me angry seeing such dreadful reviews! If you're a Peter Pan fan. Go back to NeverLand....And to Director Joe Wright. You da man! Darn !!Super interesting take on the origins of Peter Pan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sassy British descendant of Time Lord Cosette and Thumbelina's Prince Cornelius is orphaned with his flute necklace and surrounded by ninja-kicking nuns who sell children on the black market. After being abducted by Jean Valjean the Nirvana-loving dictator, he befriends Indiana Jones, who falls in love with Emily Blunt's Native American alter ego. He is then saved from flying crocodiles by the Cara Delevingne mermaid quadruplets (with glowing Rapunzel hair) who live in a sea of memories. He proceeds to discover he has the force, pixie-edition, and saves Atlantis the lost fairy-kingdom empire, adopting the title of "The Chosen One". And after all of this, we still don't find out what caused the proverbial bad blood between Peter Flute and Captain Indiana Hook. So there's that. Despite all of this (or maybe because of it), I actually did enjoy the movie quite a bit. Even if the singing of Smells Like Teen Spirit left me confused and thinking of Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie but, it is mainly meant for children.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan tells the story of a 12 year old boy named, Peter(Levi Miller). Peter is an orphan who lives in an orphanage for boys. One night, he is kidnapped &amp; taken to a magical place, called Neverland. Here, he meets an evil pirate named, Blackbeard(Hugh Jackman). Blackbeard tells Peter of an ancient prophecy that says, he will be defeated by a boy who can fly. Blackbeard believes Peter is the boy mentioned in the prophecy. With the help of an ally named Hook(Garrett Hedlund), Peter escapes from the evil pirate's clutches. Now, it is up to Peter to embrace his destiny &amp; become the hero everyone now calls, Peter Pan. Pan is a good film. The highlight of the movie are the special effects. The fantasy world of Neverland looks beautiful and extremely realistic. The 3D has been put to great use throughout the film. There are several action set pieces in the movie that are eye-popping in 3D. Apart from the visual effects there is nothing much to write home about. The story of the film is very generic &amp; resembles the plot of pretty much every fantasy film out there. I'm not complaining though. You can make out that director Joe Wright made this movie, mainly with the kids in mind. The riot of colors &amp; the various magical aspects of Neverland will keep any child glued to the screen, right till the end. Hugh Jackman is great as Blackbeard. Though Jackman is completely capable of portraying a much more intimidating villain as seen in Chappie(2015), you can make out that Jackman purposely portrayed Blackbeard as an over the top antagonist, to entertain the kids. They are the target audience for the film, after all. Newcomer Levi Miller is brilliant as Peter. Miller has a bright future ahead of him, in Hollywood. Garrett Hedlund is awesome as Hook. It's nice to see Hedlund portray a completely new take on a famous character. Rooney Mara is impressive as Tiger Lily. Adeel Akhtar is hilarious as Sam Smiegel. Nonso Anozie is effective as Bishop. Amanda Seyfried is good in her small but important role, as Mary. Kathy Burke is menacing as Mother Barnabas. Lewis MacDougall is adorable as Nibs. Cara Delevingne is impressive as the Mermaids. Pan is not a must watch. However, it's worth a watch in 3D on the big screen, with your entire family. Kids will love it. Adults will find it anywhere from average to good, depending on their mindset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A discombobulated mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I sat down to watch this one Sunday evening and it was so bad I almost turned it off. But inertia is a powerful force and passively sitting through the movie in its entirety seemed easier than trying to figure out who was sitting on the remote.I wanted to like Pan. I really did. It was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid and a live action origin story sounded fun and exciting. However, the movie completely missed the mark.The first act of the movie takes place in an orphanage taken straight from Oliver Twist. Corrupt nuns hoard rations and abuse children, ultimately selling them off to fantastical pirates. The head nun resembles more of a deranged terrier with her growling and barking than an actual person. One dimensional characters aside, Levi Miller shines as Peter, a brave, clever, and mischievous child.It's when the pirates enter as cirque du soleil style abductors that the movie starts to fall apart. For some reason they have been abducting children from the orphanage in pairs until the fateful night that Peter is abducted that they seem to be gunning for the entire population of the orphanage. Not sure how the nuns were going to explain that away. Whoever designed the pirate costumes couldn't decide whether they were trying to channel Mad Max or Burning Man. There was no common thematic approach, which just made the lot look disorganized and in-cohesive.Anyway, the kids are taken aboard a flying pirate ship that proceeds to engage in a gun battle with London fighter pilots before hitting turbo boost and traveling to Neverland. This is where I almost turned off the movie. The kids are thrown into a mining pit with thousands of other slaves and then enters Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) to the forced chorus of Smells Like Team Spirit by Nirvana. Yeah, did I mention that this was supposed to be taking place during WWII? The inclusion of the song only served as a distraction, did nothing to further the story line or set the scene. Jackman's version of Blackbeard can't figure out if he is supposed to be evil and menacing or more slapstick. Either way the character comes across as obnoxious and annoying.It's about this time that Peter is introduced to James Hook played by Garret Hedlund who proceeds to channel a weird Jack Nicholson-esque rendition of Hook. I kept expecting him to bust out the phrase, "Here's Johnny!" Some things happen. Peter learns that he may be the "chosen one" from a prophesy and Hook helps him escape the mines.They eventually come upon the natives, the leader, Tiger Lily, is white washed by a subdued and uninteresting Rooney Mara. For some reason the writers feel the need to insert a love interest between Tiger Lily and Hook, which doesn't work, it makes no sense, and it just leads to a lot of stupid simpering and lingering hand holding between the two characters.The superficial side stories detract from the main story, which is supposed to be a hero's quest for Peter. At times Peter seems like a supporting character in his own journey as the story line meanders and doesn't do much in the way of story development. And all the while there is some over the top CGI that looks horrible and reminds you that you are watching a very bad movie.The movie culminates with Peter leading the kingdom of fairies in a battle against the pirates in which the fairies easily win. As the credits were rolling I turned to my husband and asked, "So why couldn't the fairies have just done that without Peter?"This movie could have been so good! The story could have been super simple and still magical. But the writers and director seemed like kids in the candy store. Too much star power, which they didn't know how to harness into great performances, too much CGI, which just comes across as fake and distracting, and too many superficial story lines that never amounted to anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan is a sweet movie about a boy who goes to a magical land full of fairies/pixies and pirates.Just as a backstory, I watched the first 1953 Peter Pan before this.When I think of a prequel I think of a movie/book that answers questions about the characters backstory as well as sets the scene. I had these questions in mind while watching the 1953 version.1: What is Peter's backstory? 2: What is Hook's backstory? 3: Why does Hook hate Peter? (I'll explain later) 4: How did Peter meet Tinkerbell? 5: How did Peter and the Indians become friends? 6: How did the crocodile get the clock?Pan answered 1,4 &amp; 5What it did not do was tell us how Hook became enemies with Peter nor what his backstory was (Why he became a pirate) or how the darned crocodile got the clock. All this movie did was set up an actual prequel.Everything is seriously CGI. Now for the plot holes. *Spoiler Alert*Why/how could the orphanage mother summon pirates? Why can they fly? If they can fly in the real world, why does Neverland not exist there? If Neverland is beyond time, why does Blackbeard need the pixum dust as he shouldn't age anyway? Is this Blackbeard, the real world one as he does not look the same? Why does Blackbeard use an old pirate ship during the 40's? If Peter can fly, why cant everyone? I mean the ships can and they aren't sentient. irregardless of the fairly heritage. How can a fairy impregnate a human? Different species right? Size difference? Why does having a pan-flute pendant protect him? It is just a symbol and not a one-off one at that? Why did Tiger-Lilly lie? I mean revenge is a pretty good motivator? How can Tiger-Lilly fight Blackbeard? She was taken hostage with no resistance by Hook in the original movie?These lead me to give a 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as people say that Avatar (the James Cameron one, in case you are an Anime fan of Last Airbender) was influenced and "stole" many things from different sources (Pocahontas to name but one), it also influenced a lot of movies after it came out. Like this one and you'd be hard pressed not to see similarities visually speaking.But while many may have the Disney Pan or the other one in mind (with Robin Williams in it), this tries to go Batman Begins with it all. A good move overall if you come to think of it and is not wrong in many regards either. You could say that we have been treated to many similar movies. Also that Hugh Jackman, as much fun as he's having, is not a perfect villain in this. The not Pan male lead is far too bland and the love story feels squeezed in very uncomfortably. So while it does have a lot going for it (visually especially), it also has a lot going against it. If you can enjoy the one without the other, you're in luck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very forgettable adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another movie where the trailer made it seem more exciting than it really is. There is a lot of CGI, some good and some pretty awful looking. It's basically a retelling of the Peter Pan story with some scenarios switched around. While trying to touch base with the Peter Pan origin story that was written just for this movie. And the origin part of it is just so darn boring to sit through. The boy actor that played Peter Pan in this did a alright job but everyone else just seemed exaggerated or just out of place. For instance Hugh Jackman played his role as Blackbeard like he would do in a Broadway play but in a movie form it just wasn't convincing at all. I also feel sort of bad for saying this, but Hugh Jackman is actually a good guy and a gentleman so for him to play a villain...It just didn't work here. Garrett Hedlund seemed like he was trying very hard to copy the comedic pirate henchmen in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies. I think Rooney Mara is a really good actress but she was just a really poor choice to play Tiger Lily. The part that was somewhat fun to watch was the sky pirate ship battle but that is about it. Overall this is a forgettable movie, I was constantly just wanting the movie to get on with it.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those untold origin stories that should have been left untold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get one thing straight, there is no pleasure taken panning this film. Being someone who has liked some of Joe Wright's previous work (especially 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Atonement' and 'Hanna'), who likes Hugh Jackman and adores the source material that 'Pan takes inspiration from.Although it is not a film without redeeming merits, 'Pan' was hugely disappointing. It starts promisingly but then stumbles downhill once we get to Neverland and apart from the odd bright spot doesn't properly get back up again. As an origin story inspired by J.M. Barrie's magnificent story with its complex themes and rich characters, to say that it disrespects the source material is being kind to the word disrespect. But it is very underwhelming on its own merits too, while 'Anna Karenina' didn't do much for me 'Pan' is the one time where Joe Wright has come close to hitting rock bottom.'Pan' starts off really promisingly, with a real sense of threat and false security. A lot of effort went into the production values, and there are frequent points where it does show, especially in the visually dazzling scene where the children are stolen, the whole film is exquisitely photographed, the set design is very colourful and eye-poppingly vivid with a wondrous-looking Neverland and lavish costumes apart from the ridiculously gaudy ones for the Indians. The incidental score has the right amount of whimsy and rousing energy. There is one good performance, that of Hugh Jackman who is clearly enjoying himself with glee as campy, energetic but sinister Blackbeard.Not all the visuals work. There are so many special effects that it does start feeling too much and making the spectacle take over the story. Apart from the ships, the scene where the children are stolen and to a lesser extent the translucent mermaids, the effects are less than special, very amateurish-looking digital doubles, skeleton birds that look worse than a low budget video game from 15-20 years ago and very over-sized crocodiles that make them seem more goofy than threatening. Equally, there is a lot of spectacle, but they are very mixed when it comes to execution. Sometimes the spectacle dazzles, but at other times they're little more than nauseating kitsch. It does seem that all Wright's efforts went into the visuals and spectacle but he completely forgets telling a story and making the characters interesting, for Wright this is pretty inept.Apart from Jackman, the rest of the cast struggle. Well actually Nonso Anoozie is pretty good, just that his screen time isn't enough to shine. Amanda Seyfried is suitably compassionate, but again very little to do. Levi Miller does do his best as Peter, he's suitably perky, has charisma and is cute as a button, but his character doesn't ever really go anywhere and he doesn't give as much charm and emotion as he should have done, Peter's trademark mischievous side is more cocky and desperate. Garrett Hedlund overacts dreadfully as a wannabe Indianna Jones/Han Solo and Brendan Fraser-esque-hero sort of Hook, constantly speaking in a way that seems to impersonate James Stewart and John Huston and very poorly, that he becomes very annoying with no foreshadowing whatsoever of the dark and complex character Hook as we know him would become. In a controversial piece of casting, Rooney Mara looks completely bored and miserable. Cara Delevigne is a pretty pallid presence though is disadvantaged by throwaway writing, and Adeel Akhtar gives a performance so stereotypical it might cause offence. None of the characters are interesting or colourful enough, although Jackman gives it everything even he can't disguise that Blackbeard's motivations and such are paper thin.On top of the spectacle, 'Pan' also includes musical numbers. These musical numbers manage to be even more memorable than the incidental score, and that is not a good thing. Although spiritedly performed, they are not only jarringly anachronistic in style, but they are also out of place, too randomly thrown in and almost like Wright was trying to be a wannabe Baz Luhrmann, which doesn't suit Wright at all (was taken right out of the film once the characters started singing Nirvana). The script is also prone to anachronisms and often sounds completely stupid and too heavy in the cheese and schmaltz factor. There isn't really much of a story, and what there is of it is executed poorly with very little new to say, most of it not even trying to make sense to the point of being incomprehensible. There are some good ideas here but they are badly rushed through, the whole children as slaves idea was the one strand that was properly elaborated upon and had some emotional impact of some kind. Consequently, the whole point of the story is completely lost in translation, and not only was the whole Peter and Hook as friends poorly developed, plus they didn't seem believable as friends (Peter seemed as annoyed with Hook as much as those watching the film were), but there is next to no foreshadowing of them as enemies either which would have made Hook much more interesting. Most of the story is basically an excuse to include as many set pieces and musical numbers as possible, regardless of whether they were important and of good-quality or not.Overall, a big disappointment. A few good things here and there, but this "untold" story should have stayed untold. 3/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film...oh man this film.So Cinema Snob aka Brad Jones and his posse did a Midnight Screening of this, and their overall thoughts coincide with my own in that the film is...not BAD-BAD but just...what.I think I read somewhere in an article in Time magazine that all the actors thought they were in a different film and boy does it show. Hugh Jackman must have thought he was in a campy pirate musical, Garrett Hedlund in some film like that of an Indiana Jones version of "Journey to the Center of the Earth", Levi Miller in a knockoff "James and the Giant Peach", and Rooney Mara in...I have no idea.I am not a film buff by any means but even a casual viewer like me could tell that the beginning of the film was rushed, very rushed. It was all here's Peter. Hey kids are missing, nuns are meanies, oh no I'm kidnapped! Just scene, scene, scene, scene, no real character development of Peter other than what you probably assume Peter Pan to be from previous media-- that he's a bit of a curious "brave" kid, plucky, and obviously "special". When we get to the mines and are introduced to Blackbeard, it's bizarre yet strangely entertaining. Yes, they do sing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and oddly enough, the rendition kind of works. It was riveting in a way to see a whole canyon of people sing this grunge song like some kind of battle cry/war chant in a Capella, but when they did Blitzkrieg Bop I had to go "what the...?" in a half-smiling bemused way.Blackbeard as played by Hugh Jackman is the most enigmatic and entertaining part of this film by a country mile. It isn't like he's the most fleshed-out character or overly compelling, but he is like...like a giant Victorian crow with feathers, a bustle (?), a black wig, and devilish facial hair to match. Despite hearing from Brad that Jackman played Blackbeard, I had to check the movie's IMDb page to confirm with my own eyes that yes this is Wolverine Jean Val Helsing we're seeing.Honestly, I greatly enjoy it when a villain fakes tenderness and moments of intimacy with the heroes to lull them into a false sense of security, or else truly drive home how mercurial they are; you see this in a few scenes between Blackbeard and Peter when the two are alone after it is revealed who Peter is. Given Blackbeard's backstory with Peter's mother, it's undoubtedly a cauldron of mixed feelings that Blackbeard has for Peter.Unfortunately (!) that possibility is given almost no attention because right away after Peter's first talk with Blackbeard he makes a Prison Break with Garrett Hedlund/James Hook, who had a way with his voice that I have no idea what it was about. It was like the first and last consonants of each word were capitalized - emphasized, and the weird swaggering demeanor reminded me of Indiana Jones and Flynn Ryder from Tangled. His attempts at one-liners fell flat with me every single time: His character was just not funny or suave or charming at all, he was a bit annoying. There were maybe a handful of times that the character didn't make me roll my eyes but they were far and few between.Again, I want to emphasize how quick this film seems to go with too much stuff happening, because it just seemed to be a mishmash of the Blitz, Close Encounters of the Scurvy Kind, Avatar for a split second, and then when the tribal people come in, it's like National Heritage Month and Holi wrapped into one. The director circumvented the possibility of pissing people off with portraying natives as stereotypes by including ALL tribal peoples from around the world. All races are featured in traditional costume and it doesn't all match. My guess is, is that these people also come from all over the world like the Blackbeard's miner kids. How did the natives get to Neverland you ask? I dunno.I immediately knew Rooney Mara was Tigerlily as soon as I saw her, and it disappointed me. Yes, because she was white. Yes there are Saami people and white natives but...but more representation of interracial relationships in films is what I like to see.When Blackbeard descends on the village I thought to myself "Man, this feels like a climax to something that had no build up. How much is there left of the film?" I checked and it was 3/4ths done. And that made me realize another large part of the film. Not only does it rush, there is no great build up. It's just action and things happening but there really isn't any time or effort to get me emotionally invested in any of the characters. Honestly I just wanted to see Blackbeard be weird and eccentric like the walking music video he is. Also, did I mention the cringe worthy effects of this film? You can clearly tell that the majority of it was green-screened, and those skeleton birds were atrocious.This film is not going to age well technologically speaking, not at all. Brad Jones said that he could see this film turning into a cult hit, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe if the film had been better constructed and actually had decent visuals like Waterworld or The Labyrinth, but with it being all over the place and the majority of the characters being bland and uninspiring, I think this will continue to be seen as a "What the...Hollywood, you okay?" kind of film. No, but seriously, I must stress how much fun I got out of seeing Hugh Jackman be a Visual Kei Raven on screen. It was kind of magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't believe, Peter, then neither will they.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was at the point when everyone in Neverland started singing Nirvana's "Smell Like Teen Spirit" that I knew this film was a misguided effort in style with zero substance. Wright's Pan is so bland that its desperate effort to be artistic is sad and frankly, a little pathetic. Peter is an orphan who desperately seeks out who his mother is. One night at the orphanage, he is kidnapped by some pirates and is brought to Neverland. He is instantly put to work in the mines under the rule of the evil pirate Blackbeard. While there he meets a young James Hook and together they escape. With Blackbeard in hot pursuit, Peter has to learn to fly, save the fairies and fulfill his destiny in becoming the boy who never ages. I don't really know where the film went wrong, but one would have to say the script. Peter needing to fulfill the chosen one plot line is tired and clichéd. The idea of making him and Hook friends in the beginning isn't anything new either, in fact the exact same thing happened in the British mini- series adaptation of the Peter Pan story, Neverland. Wright's Pan takes the misguided step of focusing on spectacle rather then trying to tell a compelling story. The results are this disastrous attempt at something artful or creative. The spectacle in this film tries so hard to dazzle the viewer that it becomes cringeworthy. Flying bubbles of water with various creatures swimming inside? Why? It looks cool I guess. All the ships fly, we have a bio luminescent scene that steals from Avatar and don't get me started on the absolutely terrible CGI in this film. Sometimes it works, mainly the background environments, but literally everything else is horrendous. Peter flying looks very reminiscent of early human CGI rendering, think Blade II if you've seen it. Then we are introduced to some Neverland Birds, something that looks like it belongs on the N64. Shall we move on to the acting? My God does Garrett Hedlund make some awful choices in this film. What is he doing with his voice? I have no idea, but his acting sticks out like a sore thumb. Hugh Jackman goes over the top and chews up a lot of scenery with his Blackbeard. He seems to have some fun with the role and is a redeeming factor here. Levi Miller shows some promise, but in the role of Peter Pan, will be forgotten. Finally Rooney Mara, utterly bored and miscast as the Native princess.Pan was "panned" by critics and I always wonder if those films deserve the savage beatings they get. Pan does, this film is a mess with no direction. A colourful prism of mistakes and bad effects. Pan and Hook being friends adds nothing to the story, they don't have any really conflict between each other. It's simply a "hey, we know they will be enemies later, let's have some funny foreshadowing". Neverland never inspires any awe, which is the real shame here because the film relies so heavily on the visuals. Also...yes, I will mention again, they sing Smells Like Teen Spirit in this film, it was a real Moulin Rouge! moment...only terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried guys i tried so hard but this movie is meh. They took Pan and destroyed him Tiger Lily is not an Indian not that it matters but just saying, Hook talks every time in an awkward way and Hugh Jackman looks like he's sick. This movie took The Wolverine and destroyed him to pieces and made him come out as a comedian everyone in this film looks and sounds like they came out from an actual cartoon. I didn't hate the movie as much as other people did but the obvious green screen hurts my eyes and after finishing this movie it hurt me too. Pan has 2 or 3 good scenes but the poor writing and direction and having a talented actor like Hugh Jackman acting like a Nickelodeon villain it just set me off. Pan gets a 6 out of 10. Aww i almost forgot Jackman sings Nirvana too, please go watch Hook it's a much much better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but this movie did not have anything that remotely reminded me of "Peter Pan" and nor was it interesting or coherent on its own.This movie had nothing to say, the plot was stagnant and really there was too much adult complexity for kids, but no real plot.Sure, the effects, as is common these days were nice to see, but without good characters and a solid plot, not to mention a point, there is really no movie there.I watched this and kept trying to understand who this was trying to appeal to and what the point was. It just seemed to meander from scene to scene showcasing some cool graphics, but it was all jammed together in a pointless confusing way.No ... the Story of Peter Pan is a simply one, and a timeless one pretty much.The kid who played Peter was annoying too, but mostly because they did not give him a story to act in.</fullReview>

I found that I wasn't paying all that much attention, it was very easy for me it get distracted when the kids were watching it. I liked it enough though but the children still seemed to love the story and it occupied them for a time for me to get some things done around the house. I guess you could say I really didn't like this rendition all that much. Boring. I don't think I will be watching and reviewing any other Peter Pan movies in the near future. Going to let this storyline rest for a little while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing spectacle, below par plot and script!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I came into this movie sceptical from the start as this is the 4th Peter Pan movie I have seen and the remakes has managed to disappoint me every time, and its not a prequel I really saw the need for, with movies like the animated Peter Pan, Hook, and Peter Pan of 2003.Peter Pan starts with Peter Pan, the archetypal boy who would never grow up, with a story of him being the chosen one (ala Harry Potter), some offspring of a fairy prince and a native warrior with a magical pan-flute totem which helps him fly. It introduces a new villain Blackbeard (ala Pirates of Caribbean), and spends most of the movie focused on his tragic past, and his motivations to find his mother.Visually the movie goes from one stunning CGI scene to another and was as appealing as Hook and Peter Pan, perhaps even more. I was pleased that there was enough differences in the story to make it feel new, interesting and exciting as it embarks on the journey of Peter Pan &amp; Captain Hook before the story we know so well, and answers many questions the other movies have not, but which most probably didn't need answered.Its a great adventure for kids and visually beautiful to Watch and never boring. That said the script, plot and acting did not really convince me, and having the characters sing Nirvana did not really help the feel of a believable captivating fantasy either.I never understood the reason to remake movies if you are not sure you can add something new to the story which improves it. And Pan doesn't do that to me. I do not think it was better than Peter Pan, and I prefer Hook over both especially in acting, script, and plot, but also music score and editing.All in all its a good movie I think most especially children will enjoy, but it could have been so much more and in the end does not justify the remake in my opinion.</fullReview>

Bullets are made of colourful powder, which appears quite delightful! It is a children's film as you don't see people die, and it's not gory. I'm annoyed by the slow pacing though.

		<fullReview>The prequel to Peter's story and how he becomes the legend we know. Conflict between Black Beard and the Fairies of Neverland. The storyline is really fun to watch and a great movie overall but it was really uncalled for to have a movie so blatantly cast with white actors. A missed opportunity for progress in Hollywood. I liked the effects, the camera angles and the music though. It was a very visual movie, with fun and colorful sets, costumes and makeup. My favorite part was the coming of age aspect of Peter's story. Finding yourself is a great ( and overused ) theme in movies. It would be nice to see more originality from Hollywood in future films. Pushing outside the limits is what keeps art and entertainment going. Audiences are looking for more. Variety is the spice of life and this movie is more like a plain pasta dish. Pasta is great, but it's nothing new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pan is one of those movie where you can nitpick the heck out of it, but it does not deserve it because compared to some of the awful kids movies that have come out recently like Norm of the North and Road Chip. This one at least has effort and heart put into it.The Story and Characters: The prelude to Peter's adventure in Neverland begins in a orphanage ruled by nuns who went to the Mrs. Trunchable school of taking care of kids during WW2. It's a good set up to his adventure that ends with a well done action scene involving WW2 fighter planes and a flying pirate ship....Then once Neverland comes to the story for a brief moment it turns into Moulin Rouge for no reason(They sing a song from the movie). Hugh Jackman plays Blackbeard, is clearly hamming it up and having the time of his life. Garret Hedlund as Hook...is like if William Shatner as Kirk meets Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, Which does not mix well. Rooney Mara as Tiger Lily is fine but miscast(Though the Disney movie is way less sensitive to native Americans). Levi Miller does a great job a portraying Peter. The adventure itself revolves around cliché moments that occur(Prophecy, Lost Parents, and Captures) between all 3 acts. But the climactic battle does deliver. But not the last 5 minutes which wrongly sets itself up for a sequel(Fan4stic). Music: John Powell does it again creating a amazing score after replacing regular Joe Wright composer Dario Marianelli.Cinematography: Its well shot with 2 acclaimed cinematographers Final Verdict: Its not perfect and not that great...but compared to most kids movies this one is way better than most of the live action ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually everyone loved growing up watching the various film adaptations of original work by JM Barrie's a century old creation, 'Peter Pan'. There are plenty of unofficial prequels and sequels were also made and met success. Yet this prequel with high budget and modern technology, but not a Disney film, generated some expectations with stars like Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara in it.The box office was not as expected, and the movie was also just above average, but I liked the performances and visuals. The story is about an orphan Peter who becomes a Pan, a leader to 'the lost boys'. The opening line goes like this: 'Sometimes friends begin as enemies and enemies as friends' and that's what the rest of the movie evolves.I don't think I liked this story. In all the prequels, I loved the Nick Willing's 'Neverland' who is a master of prequels to all the greatest fairy tales. I disappointed with this only because of lack of the depth in narration, short storyline and quick scenes, other than that it was not a bad flick to me. The main relief was, it was not like the recent 'Alice in Wonderland' style movie with the weird costumes, makeups and the character physiques.Despite all the negative feedback for this flick, I feel it won't hurt for a one time watch. My eye is now on its sequel, because before the Wendy's introduction there's another story is to be told and that is between Peter and Hook. But now it's on doubt over the result of this movie. Anyway, I'm on for it and hope it only gets better than the original.6/10</fullReview>

Just like the Alice In Wonderland and Charlie And The Chocolate Factory remake. Don't even get me started on remakes. Make sure your kids don't watch this.

		<shortDescription>Another movie that should only be seen in a decent cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the recent "The Force Awakens," this is a movie that should really only be seen in 3D on a 100-foot screen and all-around loudspeakers. Why? Because where it excels is in its visual and audio presentation, which is simply superlative. As a viewer, you need to be captivated by this aspect of the cinematography because, in all other respects, it's a so-so film.To be fair, it's decently acted, although perhaps not outstandingly so. None of the acting performances stank, but the actors weren't given a lot to work with so far as character depth was concerned. Some of the parts were played for laughs which, of course, is fair enough in a film of this genre. The part of Hook was ambiguous -- we all know that Hook turns out to be a villain, so it isn't clear why he's a good guy (and a rather insipid one) here. Still, perhaps the film-makers are already planning a sequel that will do for Hook with "Revenge of the Sith" did for Darth Vader? In the end, what lets Pan down is the storytelling. If this were a children's book, rather than a blockbuster movie, by about page ten you'd be wondering what the heck was going on. So much of the plot makes no sense. Why is it such a big deal that Peter can fly? What does it prove if he can? The fantasy world is full of ships that fly about with no visible means of support, so clearly magical flight is unremarkable. Why do the characters keep bursting into song? It's not a musical, right? The characters in the original book have a certain amount of depth, and as a reader you can't help wondering what their back-stories are (which, of course, is a hallmark of great character writing). Pan ought to answer that question, but it doesn't -- we don't really learn anything about why Peter, Tiger Lily, Smee, et al., are who they are.You can have the original Peter Pan performed on a packing-crate stage by high school kids, and it can still be magical. But if you take all the high-tech whizzbangery away from Pan, I wonder what is left? Not a great deal, I suspect.For all that, worth watching in the right environment.</fullReview>

Levi Miller who plays Peter did a great job with an amazing performance throughout the film. The manager did a good job. Another positive aspect of the film is the soundtrack, composed by John Powell, is very nice.The spaces where the film was developed are incredible, both boats like Neverland, which makes the film more entertaining to watch.In short, a good film suitable for all ages.</fullReview>

A story revised for Millennials with Attention Deficit Disorder that just need a quick classic storybook CGI fix. But sadly this story is mush, that acting subpar and downright embarrassing. The screen is vividly Avatar colorful with CGI vistas that seem to pixelate forever in this Neverland that my disbelief &amp; boredom draws me back toward the ground &amp; a jaunt toward the fridge .This Island in the sky is forgettable, unwatchable incomprehensible that I just want to find a warm cuddly place from my childhood,so far away We'll be young, that's how we'll stay .

		<fullReview>Review: I'm really not surprised that this movie lost money, because it goes against all of the usual Peter Pan morals and the flying ships, flying crocodiles and crew singing Nirvana, went a bit too far. You can see were all the money went because it visually looks great but the annoying young Pan and strange talking captain Hook were not in the same league as Robin Williams Hook. Tinkle Bell only gets one small scene towards the end, which didn't seem right and the fact that Pan is best pals with Hook also went against the original story. I missed all of the fun about Pan and the little kids dancing together, while he's trying to learn how to fly. I can tell that the director was trying to show how Pan was before Hook became his enemy because of the ending, so it's obvious that they had a sequel in mind but this movie really didn't go down well with critics so they might have to forget about that idea. Although the movie does look great, I personally think that the director went a bit too far with the green screen and I wasn't impressed with there choice of Pan (Levi Miller). He seemed like a little know-it-all who had a cocky attitude, which is not actually Levi's fault. I just found his face expressions and voice quite irritating after a while. Hugh Jackman wasn't bad as Blackboard but I didn't understand why they made Captain Hook like Indiana Jones. Anyway, the whole concept of this film, didn't really work for me and the average performances and over exaggerated visual effects, made it and average watch from my point of view.&nbsp;Round-Up: Hugh Jackman, 47, is definitely one of the most versatile actors! From singing in Les Miserables, kicking butt as Wolverine, fighting against a machine in Chappie, training a robot in Real Steel and being romantic in Australia, he really does give his all when he takes on a project. After the awful singing and dancing scenes at the Oscars in 2013, it earned him quite a bad name in Hollywood but he bounced back with the deep Prisoners, alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, X-Men: Days Of Future Past and the brilliant Chappie, so he could put the Oscars firmly behind him. He's due to star in the upcoming Eddie The Eagle movie and it's rumoured that he will be starring in a sequel to the Wolverine movie in 2017, so he has some big projects to look forward to. This movie was directed by, English born Joe Wright, who brought you Pride &amp; Prejudice with Kiera Knightley, Atonement, The Soloist with Robert Downey Jr., Hanna and Anna Karenina. His movies have covered many genres which proves that he's not scared to take on projects out of his comfort zone. Personally, I don't think that he done a good job with this movie. If he would have taken the whole Peter Pan element out of the film and directed it as a fresh new project, it might have got a better reception from audiences, especially those Peter Pan fanatics around the world.Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $128.3milliomI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/family/fantasy movies starring Hugh Jackman, Levi Miller, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara, Amanda Seyfried and Kathy Burke. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see this film to treat my little brother. From an adult's perspective, this movie was on some parts so bad, that I would have left if I weren't there with my brother and I just sat through it. The film nosedived to concrete on many occasions. What was up with the fact that Pan showed no feelings when his peer was on the plank and after Blackbeard jumped on, the little boy fell to his certain death. Pan was always a little mischievous but not a psycho MEANING he should have shown empathy. I almost threw up when a scene welcoming the new orphans used that Nirvana song. It's not that it's the world's most horrible song, it's not entirely awful in all but in that scene it felt so out of place, I questioned myself whether this film was a production of a mega production company or something made for a school project. Also how the actual ... did Blackbeard find the village in Neverland's forest so quickly when it had proved to be an impossible task beforehand. I could write more about why this movie was always going to flop but that wouldn't be fair to someone who hasn't seen it(but is going to). If your expectations of what this movie was roughly going to be about in terms of story, characters and quality were based on the book "Peter and Wendy" then I suggest you shouldn't go see this one.When watching a children's movie with your sibling and it's bad just ignore it and it'll be easier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun, Colourful Family Adventure,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan is a decent movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast. It's an enjoyable family film that I believe critics are being too harsh on, it's an original take on the beloved Peter Pan that tells the story of how he became the "boy who never grew up", with a charming performance from Levi Miller, a young and promising actor, as well as a great supporting cast from the likes of Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund and Rooney Mara. I think the biggest mistake this movie makes is that it tries to be different from the original story, it makes a lot of confusing and unnecessary decisions, such as Peter being an orphan during the Second World War, which bothered me for the fact that the author of the Peter Pan novels, J.M. Barrie, died before the War even began, and making Hook a friend of Pan, it tries too hard to be different from the original stories, but I don't think there's any point in fixing what's not broken. The film is also surprisingly dark, Blackbeard is a terrifying villain, for a children's film I think it's a bit too much, both his personality and what he does, there are also parts where his men are singing songs (such as "Smells like Teen Spirit") which genuinely sent a shiver down my spine, and an overuse of CGI is also evident, but this stuff would probably only bother the older audience. It certainly has Imperfections that I feel they could improve for a potential sequel, but Pan is still enjoyable with charming performances and whimsical special effects that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film. A young orphan named Peter is transported to the magical world of Neverland, where he learns the truth about his mother and his own destiny on a journey to defeat Blackbeard.

Can you imagine the hue and cry the PC lynch mob would raise if the next Panem Archer Phenom turned out to be Katner Everdeen (that is, a guy)?! So how is it that a chick can steal Peter's thunder for decades running, but it causes such a ruckus to "deviate" the tiniest bit in casting a minor role (Ms. Rooney's "Tiger Lily")?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Spirit of the The Lost Boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Writer J.M. Barre first introduced the world to Peter Pan just after the turn of the twentieth century. Children and adults alike were enamored with "the boy who wouldn't grow up". The stories were filled with the mischief created by Peter and his Lost Boys buddies from their Neverland home, and although there existed elements of danger (Captain Hook), Barre's story was mostly about holding on to the joy and carefree world of childhood.Sadly, these days we don't encourage kids to be kids. Instead, we push them to take on responsibility and act 'grown up' ? heck, most kids today never really experience free play time with their friends. Everything is organized and scheduled (just check the calendar on the fridge). Writer Jason Fuchs and director Joe Wright (Atonement, Hanna) have created a Peter Pan "origin" story that lacks any touch of whimsy or enchantment from the original books or the numerous film adaptations: the 1953 Disney animated classic, the 1991 Steven Spielberg/Robin Williams/Dustin Hoffman vehicle, the underrated 2003 live action version from director P.J. Hogan, or even last year's Live TV broadcast featuring Allison Williams as Peter.This one begins with a talented Parkour-enabled Mother (Amanda Seyfried) dropping off her infant son on the steps of an orphanage. She leaves only a note and a pan flute medallion. Flash forward twelve years and Peter (Levi Miller) is questioning the mysterious disappearance of kids from an environment straight out of a Dickens novel, as well as the hoarding talents of the evil Mother Superior (Kathy Burke). Soon enough Peter finds himself, along with scores of other youngsters, slaving in the fairy dust mines belonging to Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Are you depressed yet? Things only get bleaker as Peter escapes with his new friend James Hook (the name is no coincidence). They soon encounter the tribe that protects the Fairy Kingdom and the fairy dust that Blackbeard so values. Part of the tribe is Tiger Lilly (Rooney Mara) who believes that Peter is "the chosen one" who has come to lead and protect them. Lots of fighting ensues, plus some soaring giant crocodiles, flying pirate ships, and a trio of mermaids (all played by supermodel Cara Delevingne).Re-imagining the classics is about the closest thing we get to creativity in Hollywood these days, so it's not the idea of the project that so bothers, but rather the approach. Where is the fun? Where is the sense of wonderment? In fact, young Peter's destiny seems to be an urgency to assume more responsibility as a leader ? not live the carefree days of fun and games that Mr. Barre had set out.Newcomer Levi, who plays Peter, ranks right there with director Joe Wright's previous discovery of Saoirse Ronan, as child actors with big time screen presence. Young Mr. Miller has a grasp of the script and character and is the best part of the film. Hugh Jackman plays Blackbeard, but can never really reach the necessary level of intimidation or theatricality. For some reason Garrett Hedlund plays Hook as if he is imitating Christian Slater who is imitating Jack Nicholson playing Indiana Jones. It's so over-the-top that we must assume Hedlund was directed to bring some comic relief to the bleak environment. Much has already been written about the casting of ultra-Caucasian Rooney Mara in the role of Tiger Lilly, though she performs the role quite well (avoiding the screeching of her lines in the manner of Jackman and Hedlund). Rounding out the cast is Adeel Axhtar as Smiegel/Smee.Some of Wright's action sequences and CGI are quite impressive, though it's difficult to overlook the obvious influences of Terry Gilliam, Baz Luhrman, and even George Lucas and James Cameron. Particularly painful and out of place are the Luhrman-influenced musical interludes of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and The Ramone's "Blitkrieg Bop". Even the pixie dust effect reminds of Dorian Gray, though Jackman only gets one brief scene in which to capitalize.Devotees of the J.M. Barre source material will be no doubt disappointed and confused, but the theatre was filled with youngsters who couldn't seem to care less that Joe Wright had taken a classic story in the opposite direction. They enjoyed the visual effects as evidenced by the numerous "oohs" and "ahhs". So let's allow that reaction to speak for itself, rather than saying this version just didn't pan out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning with wooden action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually quite like this movie. I like the premise. I like the CGI which there is a tremendous amount of. I like the music. I like the scenery and costumes which are predominantly steampunk. I like the orphan boys and the other extras who are very interesting and full of character. Peter is very likable (though it would be nice if he could choose an East or West London accent and stick with it), Smee and Blackbeard are likable... But.. Tiger Lily's expressionless face and wooden acting, and Hook's unnecessarily loud, booming voice succeed in detracting attention away from everything else that was good about this movie. The brutal fighting action with no blood was confusing, and although a lot of the content was noticeably unrealistic you need to bear in mind that Neverland is a children's fantasy so of course it is not going to be true to life. So overall I like it, except for those two characters who, I am sorry to say, completely ruined it for everyone else. Your are left with the impression that the casting director for the extras did a much better job than the casting director for the main characters. For example - Tigerlily who I doubt could look less like an Indian than anyone you could ever imagine and who displays no fighting skills, agility, footwork, facial expressions, emotions, intent, strength or flexibility whatsoever, yet still somehow manages to slay pirates left right and centre throughout the film - mainly, it seems, because the pirates wait on the spot for her to chuck a tomahawk their way or slash them with a knife without ever making a move or reacting defence of their own lives as you might otherwise expect them to. If you can overlook the bad acting of those two (which unfortunately you can't because oddly enough they seem to get more screen time than anyone else) you may well think it is a terrific film. Which is why I give it six stars out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but not as magical as it could be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I don't believe in bedtime stories' - Peter Popcorn, M&amp;Ms and a large drink... roll the film... The story of Peter Pan has been the source for a multitude of films. To know more about his past is an interesting proposition, but the trailers seem confusing. Is James T. Hook an ally or even a friend of Peter Pan? Kid's Korner rating: 2.75 stars* Parent's Rating: 3 starsDo you know the story of Peter Pan, the legendary tale from J.M. Barrie about Wendy, Tinkerbell, Captain Hook, Neverland and the boy who could fly? His story must have a beginning and is begging answers to the questions of where did he come from and how did he get introduced to all of these iconic characters on this magical island? Pan is the origins viewpoint of director Joe Wright (Atonement) of the boy who is perpetually 12-years-old and the defender of fairies and orphans. Peter (Levi Miller) is an orphan during World War II, who lives with the hope that his mother will come back to retrieve him. While living in the confines of the nightmarish orphanage, Peter and a multitude of other boys are inexplicably kidnapped by pirates and taken to the island that is controlled by the dreaded Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Peter must come to terms with a prophecy that has him at the heart of the deliverance of Neverland from this tyrannical pirate. He must partner with the local inhabitants and a strange ally named James T. Hook (Garrett Hedlund) to determine if Peter is really the saviour of this magical land.Pan is a lesson in trying to do too much in a short period of time. The story is placed against a visually stunning backdrop of childhood dreams. Wright provides the magical land that would be expected of the J.M. Barrie story, but like Peter and James Hook in the film, the director seems to get lost along the way. There are so many elements and characters to take in and retrofit into the familiar children's fairy tale it becomes muddled in the delivery. The actors convey confusion of what type of film they are participating in and their performances do not capitalise on the talent that they represent. Also, with all that Wright is attempting to do with the film, the pacing of the film struggles under the weight of expectation and causes it to drag for the first half. Then he seems to attempt to make up for lost time in the second half and the journey comes in a rapid fire delivery that leads to confusion. Even though the visual cinematic experience is pleasurable, the overall experience is inevitably perplexing, which will lead to a multitude of questions from little ones during or after the film. Children and parents can enjoy the film together, but an explanatory discussion will be in order in the car ride home afterwards.As an origins story, The writers were not original in where they pulled their source material for Pan, which is not a bad thing. There is no masking of who Peter Pan represents in Neverland. See if any of this storyline sounds familiar, a prophecy says that the son of Mary will one day come and be the messiah for the people of this land. Once Peter is fully aware of his role, he will have three days to rise to the challenge and save Neverland. Even though the overall story is a bit confusing at times, this film production paves the way for many discussions on who Peter is meant to represent and who the true Saviour of the world is for all of us.Dad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did we think of the film?' What was up with the Nirvana song in the introduction of Blackbeard. Weird! It was fun, but a bit confusing at times. Overall we liked it, but it was not as magical as it could have been. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about orphans? (Isaiah 1:17, John 14:18) 2. Why is family important? (Matthew 22:36-40, Romans 15:2) 3. Who is the real Messiah?

I may have enjoyed it more if I wasn't so bothered by Garrett Hedlund's portrayal of James Hook. It was a strange mix of Buzz from Back to the Future and Brenden Frasier in...anything! Not a big fan of the announcer-voice line after line. Hugh Jackman was a great Blackbeard, so hopefully he can come back in some fairy way. And the boy playing Pan was likable and fit the role well.I wish there would have been more story between Peter and Hook, or between Hook and Tiger Lily (who was alright actually), or between Blackbeard and Mary. Really, tell us more about any of that! Oh well, maybe we'll get some explanation with a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing that childhood nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The century old story of Peter Pan has, in recent years, been the focus of many Hollywood directors. Joe Wright tries to follow in the footsteps of other Pan stories, along the lines of "Hook" and "Return to Never Land." The director and writers took a 'prequel' approach to this classic tale, and despite their best efforts and big budget, it's missing all the nostalgia of the classic story. They tried to update it as much as possible, but in the process they made it something a bit gaudy to look at, and like most modernizations, it loses the history that connects us to tales like this. Still, I enjoyed the visual aspects of the film. It certainly has a fantastical feel to the scenery and characters and they all blend together quite beautifully.They also focused on a WW2 era story, which was about 40 years after the tale was written, so it was a little off the mark with the original. That being said, they still told an interesting enough story. Actor Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job as the dread pirate Blackbeard, who really dominated most of the scenes and was a real pleasure to watch! However, there were some truly bizarre moments in the storyline as well, including a few sing-song moments using Nirvana's "Smell's Like Teen Spirit" and the Ramone's "Blitzkrieg Bop". It made it feel like they were trying to make a "Moulin Rouge" moment in this film, which is a strange thing, considering it's a children's film and felt totally out of place with the rest of the story. In addition, near the end of the film, you're left wondering what happened to a few of the well known characters (Mr. Smee for example), with no real explanation and the viewer is left wondering as the director tries to wrap things up quickly in the final act.All in all, it's something that adults and kids can enjoy together, but it missed that childhood feeling, that previous films have brought to the screen.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable characters but weak storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead, indeed!This film suffers from formulaic, uninspired writing, and mediocre direction. Don't misunderstand: Joe Wright has directed 4 or 5 very beautiful, very watchable, very enjoyable pictures (for example: 2004's "Pride and Prejudice"). What he hasn't done is attempt an epic fantasy adventure. It felt like he was going for a vision and chose only to show the 'highlights' or tiny bits of cultural information, (Blackbeard's Victorian costume, the miners singing Nirvana, Tiger Lily's fuzzy yarn hat), leaving us with virtually nothing to stand on when it came to figuring out the world we were watching. This is very different than his previous direction, so I can only conclude it's because he hasn't tried this genre before.The writing is the same story with the same lines you see in any kind of film like this. Usually, that's okay, because this kind of story kind of requires plot devices like what we see. But the lines are rote and at times you can see the actors more just saying them than really acting them. Everyone suffers from this, from newcomer Levi Miller to Academy Award nominee Hugh Jackman. This does place a little more blame on the director because the director should be able to see the actor struggling and say the famous: "Again, only better please!" The biggest conflict in the FILM - Peter's ability to fly - is solved instantly at the 11th hour and we don't even see it happen. I thought they were going to set it up with Peter thinking of Blackbeard always saying: "think a happy thought" and then put the whole thing together. No such luck. Also, Smee randomly looks at a drawing. Pow! It's the map to the fairy kingdom! Peter says to Tiger Lily: "Take me to the fairy kingdom." Boom! We're there! Not a moment of struggle or confusion.This film also can't decide if it's for children or adults. All the times I saw it, the only people I heard laughing in the theater were adults. You have Blackbeard inhaling fairy dust like a drug, and then you have the natives exploding into colorful mist clouds when killed so as not to show blood. The film could be interpreted as coming purely from the imagination of a child, which means things don't always have to make sense...except if you're trying to watch the movie and understand where it's coming from, you kinda do need things to make sense.ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) is rerecording of an actor saying lines after a scene has been filmed. The rerecording is then dubbed onto the scene to improve audio quality. There are a million ways this can go wrong and consequently it's one of the hardest things to get right. Unfortunately, when it goes wrong, it's OBVIOUS. And every one of the main actors has at least one scene where this happens. Their physical delivery does not match up with the emotional delivery of the lines, confusing both the viewer's eyes and ears.Now, the answer to the question I had initially. I didn't like this film but I had to go back and see it again. Why? Simple: The characters.The writers were clearly going for the anti-hero role with James Hook. There are elements of Jayne Cobb, Captain Jack Sparrow, Indiana Jones, and - most obvious - Han Solo. Garrett Hedlund gives a performance that is so over the top, it either comes across as funny or knocks you out of the movie. It was funny to me and, I daresay, others, because the only time I heard laughter in the theaters (at all three showings) was when he delivered a line or did a bout of physical comedy).Hugh Jackman is pretty much flawless, save for the complaints above. It's always nice to hear him sing, and I have to say the sequence with him and Peter in which he reveals the prophecy is truly moving. He is playing a man looking at his doom, and the emotion in that scene is just incredible.Rooney Mara needed more to do, in my opinion. She was a cookie-cutter warrior woman who falls for the rebel. Not to say Rooney is cookie-cutter - she's a fantastic actress. But she really just had very little to do in the film range-wise.Levi Miller is the up and coming child actor who takes on the role of Pan. He has potential - and a lot of it. He was limited by the mediocre writing and direction. It is obvious he is able to call up great amounts of emotion and convey it through body language. With some schooling I really think he's going to be big.The score was nothing special in my mind. I expected more from the man who gave us 'How to Train Your Dragon'. He basically took a single theme (a church hymn, the title I recall is 'Lord of All Hopefulness') and played it on repeat with a couple variations thrown in.The film was very visually beautiful at times (the mermaids and the fairy kingdom.). However, at least two 'key' moments of the film were kind of ruined by confusing visuals (the memory tree and Blackbeard's fight with Peter's mother).The film also was a lot of fun in its action moments. The initial escape from the orphanage (in which a pirate ship gets in a dogfight with American and German planes), the escape from the mines (In which Hook flies a pirate ship upside down a la HM Murdock from 2010's "The A-Team"), the test of the Pan (in which I was compelled to scream: "RU-FI-OOOOOOOO" as the lead warrior of the natives turned Hook into a pinball), and the climactic sword fight between Tiger Lily and Blackbeard.I want to see it again, if for no other reason than to laugh at Hook and wonder what this film COULD have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Have you come to kill me, Peter? I don't believe in bedtime stories."Occasionally I don't mind watching a film adaptation of a fairy tale. I liked the movie "Hook" with Robin Williams in the role of an adult Peter Pan who forgot what it was like in his childhood, a lot. An original alternative to the classic tale of Peter Pan, the boy who never wants to grow up and has exciting adventures on the island of Neverland. "Pan" approaches the story of Peter in a different perspective. It's more about the pre-Peter Pan era where we see him at first as a newborn little baby, abandoned at an orphanage, guided by a gang of nuns who clearly skipped the chapters about charity and compassion in the Bible. The orphanage looks more like a concentration camp where all those little fellows have to live by strict rules and are treated like slaves. The comparison with "Oliver Twist" is inevitable. And to be honest this was the most magical part of the whole movie for me. What follows is a rather bombastic and chaotic story.As soon as Peter (Levi Miller) is lifted out of his bed, by some pirates hanging on elastics, and he's being hoisted aboard a pirate ship sailing through the air, the film turns into a higher gear. Admittedly, the scene with that ship floating through the air and being chased by fighter planes, looked absolutely stunning. And the unrecognizable Hugh Jackman as Captain Blackbeard is magnificent. A magisterial role and probably the most eccentric character that Jackman has ever played. But unfortunately, the special effects and computer-animated images are so dominant during the film.The magic of the original story gradually disappears and is being replaced by what the current magicians in the special effects department can make up nowadays.At one point, I looked totally flabbergasted at the screen. Not because of the stunning images and swirling action scenes, but because a crowd of pirates and kidnapped children loudly sang "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from Nirvana. I didn't recognize it immediately. But then I couldn't believe my ears. I never thought that this masterpiece would be used in a fairy tale. And why the hell this song? Was it because"Nevermind" sounds like "Neverland"? Or because Cobain is seen as someone who never wanted to grow up either? I thought and still think it's a bizarre choice of music and I'm sure Cobain will turn over in his grave after hearing the news that one of his songs was used in a fairytale movie. In my view inappropriate and irrelevant.And you can expect a hodgepodge of mixed rarities. An Indiana Jones kind of inmate called Hook (Garrett Hedlund), who of course in a later stage will be the archenemy of Peter, and some beautiful mermaids. And lets not forget the fearsome crocodile. And a native village with residents turning into colorful clouds as soon as they are killed. Also impressive images of ports floating in the air and pirate boats sailing in the air through water bubbles (made me think of a Dali artwork). There's even a moment with Peter Pan orbiting Saturn. So fairly abstract and bizarre at times. But it wasn't real magic. Peter showing of his flying skills is rather limited. Tinkerbell has only a small part in the complete movie. The only thing remaining is a lot of stunt work full of chases and skirmishes.It's a bit exaggerated. What remains are the excellent performances of Miller and especially Jackman. Not to mention the rather funny contribution by Sam Smiegel (Adeel Akhtar). But despite the superb acting and the successful decors, the end result is still weak. I'm sure there are already plans for a sequel. Something I'm not enthusiastically waiting for. Hello, hello, hello, how low. Oh well, whatever, never mind.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

Prequel stories like this are very popular these days, and although the telling of the story was solid, I can't help but to prefer that they just did another remake of Peter Pan.Hugh Jackman lends is charm to the movie has the villainous Blackbeard the pirate, but he was not as charming as the dude from Tron Legacy, who plays Captain James Hook in the film. Hugh makes you buy the tickets, but this guy was steeling the movie as a more dashing Hon- Solo type, soon to be Captain Hook, and Peter's friend in the movie. My biggest issue with the film is the CGI, however. At some points the computer generated images help move the story along and were beautiful to look at, but overall they were very distracting to the point that it was all I could see. It was like they could not decide whether to make this a live-action film or an animated one.All together, the movie is very enjoyable and entertaining, but it feels like it was just on the verge of being epic, but did not quite make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Origin Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Pan", starring Hugh Jackman-Les Miserables_2012, Wolverine in the X-Men movies; Garrett Hedlund-Unbroken, Eragon; Rooney Mara-The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo_2011, A Nightmare on Elm Street_2010; Amanda Seyfried-Ted 2, Les Miserables_2012 and introducing Levi Miller to American audiences as Peter Pan, although he did do an Australian movie called A Heartbeat Away.This is an interesting origin story of the infamous boy who never grew up, Peter Pan. He was originally created by J.M. Barrie. The story starts with a mysterious woman, Amanda, leaving Levi, as a baby, at an orphanage in London. 12 years later, just as WW2 is in full swing, with German bombers attacking, Levi and the other children at the orphanage are kidnapped by Hugh/Blackbeard and taken in a flying pirate ship to Neverland. Hugh uses the children as slaves in his plans to conquer the other inhabitants of Neverland, the Fairies. Garrett is a fellow slave that Levi meets and befriends. Oh yeah, Garrett's name is Hook. Rooney plays Tiger Lily, a Princess of the Fairies that also befriends Levi-she believes he is prophesied to be their savior that will lead a resistance against Hugh. Just in case you were wondering, Tinker Bell and a giant crocodile do make an appearance. I know this sounds like it's a kiddie movie, and it could be for older kids, but I don't think the little ones, say under 6, will like it as much because of some of the relationships of the characters may be too confusing; for instance, Levi/Peter is friends with Garrett/Hook. FYI: There are two songs that are sung in the movie that are probably more familiar to the adults watching. Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana and Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones are both sung by the cast in the movie, including Hugh. It's rated "PG" for the action, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 51 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie Pan, yesterday. It was a pretty good movie, I liked the style and the acting was also wonderfully done.The problem I had with it, was it the plot was pretty boring and wasn't that exciting. I think the fighting scenes were much too fast and the movie in general ended far too quickly. The fight scene at the end was also terribly done. It was over too quickly also and I didn't get into it. The music was wonderful and fitted greatly with everything also.It left a lot of unexplained things and basically unanswered questions I had. Overall I have to give it a 5, acting, music and the design were all amazing and done greatly as said above. But the plot and quickness of everything just failed it for me and took off some points. The plot is one of the most important things in any movie/book and it was just done bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won tickets to the movie premiere in London. The movie is good. But I am glad I had free tickets, because I would not have wanted to pay so much to see it (movie tickets in London are generally quite expensive, around ?14 per ticket)! But if you're in America and can get a ticket for $5, then I would probably do that, otherwise I'd wait to rent it on a rainy day.Hugh Jackman was amazing as Captain Blackbeard, he's a great actor. Even the kid who plays Pan, Levi Miller, did a very good job (he was a better actor in Pan than Daniel Radcliffe was in the early Harry Potter movies, if that comparison helps). Garrett Hedlund's acting seemed a bit over-the-top, but I am not sure if that's what he was aiming for because he thought that it fit with the character's personality? Or if that's just his acting style? His acting reminded me of Brendan Fraser's acting in The Mummy. Rooney Mara was believable as Tiger Lilly.Plot was good, cinematography and movie sets were great. But the action sequences at times felt a bit too long and drawn out. Didn't find many of the jokes funny at all, but perhaps kids would enjoy them. All in all, a nice family movie that's good to rent on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a general interest in seeing this, it was a film that I could have waited to watch at home but I got a free ticket from work and I had no intention of letting it go to waste.Throughout this film, I always found my attention drawn to anyone and anything but Peter (Levi Miller) and I didn't think much of Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard either. Garrett Hedlund and Rooney Mara were definitely the standouts of the film and every scene that had one and/or the other always had my attention.The special effects are awesome including some epic underwater scenes, the costumes were amazing, the sets too and the whole movie is insanely bright and colourful.The film can be corny at some points and in some others they try too hard to point out who these characters will be in the future. There's also a scene with Blackbeard, his crew and his slaves singing 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' by Nirvana, which was a little off-putting.At the end of the film, you don't really leave with a sense of anything new. I would have preferred a movie focused on Peter's parents or even a film that takes place after the events of this that show some of the friendship between Peter and Hook as well as the downfall.I've seen this once; I don't think I'll ever see the need to watch it again. I'll just stick with the animated Disney film and even the 2003 live action film that are both a lot more entertaining than this is.CHAPPY THINKS you should travel to the second star on the right and straight past this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't smell like Neverland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you don't believe, Peter, then neither will they."It seems that every decade there is a new attempt at bringing Peter Pan back to life whether it be a re-imagining of the classic tale or a prequel. This time it was Joe Wright's turn to give us an origin story of Peter Pan and how he arrived at Neverland. The concept seemed pretty interesting considering Pan is such a fascinating character, and Joe Wright who delivered solid films like Pride and Prejudice and Atonement seemed to be the perfect man for the job. That is why Pan was among my most anticipated films of the year, although that anticipation began to wear down once the first reviews starting coming in. The visuals are quite mesmerizing, but the problem with Pan has more to do with the narrative structure of the film. Pan is such a lovable character, but here he seems to lack that charm that made kids fall in love with his childish and wacky behavior. This Pan seems more mature and not very mischievous. He is in search of his mother and is trying to find meaning to his existence. But that approach sort of takes the fun out of his character. However, the choice of including Hook as an ally was pretty engaging. I liked that element of the story, but that was about it. Hook and Pan have a solid relationship in the film, but it never takes center stage and the action scenes kind of eclipse any attempt of establishing these characters. Hugh Jackman rarely works for me as a villain since he seems to go over the top with these characters at times. Blackbeard was not the exception for Jackman. Rooney Mara seemed like the perfect choice for Tiger Lily, but her character is never given much opportunity in the film and I thought it was a waste of talent. Pan seemed to have all the right ingredients to become a success but from the moment Peter arrives at Neverland to the sound of miners chanting Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, all the magic disappeared. I wouldn't blame the film's lack of heart on its cast because I thought there were some strong performances. Levi Miller did a good job playing the title character, but the problem is that this Peter simply wasn't childish and lively as the ones we are used to seeing him in. Adeel Akhtar was given the task of playing Sam Smiegel and in my opinion his character was the closest to the cartoon. Of course here Hook is playing Peter's friend so he is nothing like we are used to seeing. Garret Hedlund gives the best performance of the film and I think that his character would've been a more fascinating character study. We could have used more of his origin story and then explore reasons as to why he ultimately became the Hook we all know. The cast and the visuals were all very satisfactory, but the narrative elements are what ultimately hurt this film and didn't allow it to take off the way I would've wanted it to. Pan was definitely a disappointment for me, and it just goes to prove how difficult it is to bring Neverland to life. I'm in the minority here, but I think that Spielberg's Hook is the best adaptation of the story. Watch that instead. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that great of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan (2015) is not the film in which everyone had hoped it to be, though it isn't as bad as what critics are saying it to be either. Reviewing this film realistically depends on how you are looking at it. From my interest in films like this it wasn't really that good of a film but it was entertaining, though if you're at the age that you are starting to put the shapes in the right places then this film is great.The cast selected for Pan (2015) I don't believe fit the part, now don't get me wrong the actors and actresses are great and do their part for what it was; I just don't think the cast was picked right. The story is short in many parts and very shortcoming when it comes to each actor's script. The graphics were fairly well done and this film did have some good potential if it were to be done with the right cast, writers, producers, and directors; then I'm certain it would've come out a bit better. Pan (2015) is a fairly entertaining film but it fails in holding the attention of any who are old enough to purchase a ticket on their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good kids film, but a not so great family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Pan' is the story of a young orphan who finds himself on a magical adventure in Neverland and eventually grows into the legend known as Peter Pan. I personally thought the trailer for this film looked pretty cool, after seeing it 20 times it looked like this was going to be a huge, spectacular, fun adventure film that was going to have a light-hearted but slightly dark tone. And after seeing it, i have to say that it really wasn't that great and was quite disappointing actually. The biggest thing to point out is that this isn't as much of a family film as i thought it was going to be, it definitely is more of a kids film that those aged 10 to 15 would enjoy the most. The performances were OK, save for Hugh Jackman who was understandably the stand-out role. Some characters were a little too comical and over exaggerated, and i believe it was more the fault of the writers rather than the actors. The plot was structured pretty well and i thought it was easy enough to follow and moved at a relatively steady pace, good for the audience it was aiming for. Firstly, the CGI in this film i thought was mostly pretty impressive, and it needed to be because at least 90% of this film is just CGI. There were some really cool shots of the various locations in Neverland and i gotta say i really liked that aspect of the film. Although you know it is all completely fake, it still does suck you into the world. There were a few moments though where the CGI was a little too much and did take me out of the scene. Most of this was during the action sequences where you had a lot of stuff going on and the screen got very busy. There was one moment especially, in the Tribal area, that was so obviously fake it just looked very wrong and took me out of the film completely for the next 5 minutes or so. So the CG effects were definitely one of the highlights of the film for me. Performance wise the film was just average overall. I didn't mind Levi Miller's performance as Peter Pan, he did a fine job leading the film and had some pretty good individual moments where his potential talents came through. Hey, the kid's a good cryer. Garret Hedlund as the infamous pirate Captain Hook was one of the low-points of the film for me. I really don't think it was Hedlund who chose to act that way, i think it was written in the character and he took me out of the film a few times. His rendition of Hook was comical and was just very exaggerated in his line deliveries and actions, and that was one of the aspects i thought just didn't fit in with the rest of the film. There is another character who shows up occasionally and is there purely to serve the purpose of comic relief, but it was all humour for young kids and just didn't interest me or make me laugh. Hugh Jackman as i mentioned was really good as Blackbeard in this film, he is such a versatile actor who can play a wide range of characters and definitely had the standout performance. Overall he felt like the most grounded character but even then he did have some moments that were slightly out of character and also a little comical. One final problem i had with the film was with some of the dialogue that was very very unnatural and felt forced at times where i just wasn't buying into their conversations. Like, there were some lines in the trailer that worked well in the trailer, but in the film, as i mentioned, they felt thrown in there just to be used later on in the trailer. So yeh the dialogue wasn't great. Bust despite what i didn't like i have to say the film did have some somewhat entertaining moments. I was never completely engaged in what was going on but i thought the film was consistently average from start to finish. There were no sequences i HATED and no sequences i really LOVED, it was all just average the whole way through so i guess it did well at focusing in on that younger audience who would love the film more than others. - 4.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? I had very little interest in seeing this movie, but being a Rooney Mara fan, I thought, 'What the hell?' Boy was this a waste of my time.The plot of this is supposed to be some kind of re-imagining of the origin story of Peter Pan. But it almost seems as if the writers didn't know where to begin. Pan is in an orphanage and kidnapped by pirates. But not Hook. Black Beard is the Villain in this story. Throw in some half baked love story between a fairy and a human girl and you get an even more convoluted and corrupt story than you thought would be possible.I sat through two hours of uninspired story and borderline bored actors blandly reciting their lines and by the end I felt as if nothing had really happened. The movie fails to rev you up or get you to really root for anything. Not Peter's belief in himself. Not Hook's wrestling with his morals. Not the pathetic semi flirting between Tiger Lilly and Hook. Hell, the whole time you're looking for the thing that'll set Hook on edge and turn him into the Pirate we all know and love. But nothing. Nothing happens. I don't know why all these actors, Hugh Jackman, Rooney Mara, even the always misplaced Amanda Seyfried would agree to do it.It seems like such a waste of vast potential. Neverland is full of myriad wonders that have always jogged the imagination and love of readers. But this just fell flat. Joe Wright's Pan is a huge miss, but the five-year-olds will like it. 4/10 stars. And I'm being very generous.</fullReview>

The characters are funny and -the most of the time- interesting, and the cast is great. Especially Huge Jackman as the villain and Levi Miller, who did a decent job playing the leading role. The visual effects and the 3-D are incredible, but somehow the magic that previous Peter Pan movies had (like "Hook") is gone. Maybe the effects are too much, maybe the plotis boring, but the truth is that this Peter Plan can't... fly, and it is sad because that kind of movies must be dreamy and magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would be wrong to pan "Pan"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pan" has been panned by many critics but really it's entertaining enough if narratively weak. My wife and I took our granddaughter (almost five) to see it in 3D (which works quite well) and the little one enjoyed it, although she found some bits scary. Later my wife took two of her other young relatives - a girl of almost 10 and boy of seven - and they really liked it. So it's not a failure by any means but, whether it recoups its massive $150 million budget and whether we actually see the sequel hinted at in the final dialogue, must be highly problematic.The film offers a vision of 12 year old Peter and his companion Hook before the first learned to fly and the second lost his hand. Young Levi Miller is surprisingly accomplished as Peter, while Garrett Hedlund plays Hook like a combination of Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Hugh Jackman has fun as Blackbeard and Rooney Mara is sweet as Tiger Lilly. Visually the movie is a treat - flying galleons attacked by wartime Spitfires, for example - and the whole tone seems to be an attempt to emulate the "Pirates Of The Caribbean" franchise, but the storyline is weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a bit of a fan of JM Barrie's works so unless the movie essentially butchers it I find it an enjoyable watch. As others have already said, cute, lots of special effects, and there's hardly an actor that doesn't do an admirable job of bringing their character to life. It's very clear how much everyone put into this production and I don't want to discourage others from giving us fresh slants on this old classic. But this particular movie does seem to be like too many Hollywood offerings these days, a celebration of fashion (glitz, special effects) over function. It's a good story-line that makes use of many of the foundational elements of Barrie's original work, but really falls short of any meaningful back-development of those elements. Still though, very watchable. Enjoyable. Family-friendly except for a few scenes some might find frightening. Those who seek to enjoy this movie will have to be good managers of their expectations and simply let the movie be what it is and not get all bitter that it's not what they wanted/needed it to be.But if you are a fan of Barrie's works and crave a prequel with more thoughtful meat to it and more respectful development of the essential characters consider this title http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1720619/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 It's a Syfy channel mini-series with fewer big Hollywood names (though notably Bob Hoskins farewell performance as Smee). Still it manages to do magnitudes more in deepening the characters Barrie created; and with just a fraction of the budget. Excellent story-telling, acting and respect for Barrie's work more than make up for the occasionally hokey special effect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Pan' prequel falters mid-flight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie studios are profit famished entities, consuming current film trends for monetary sustenance. The current fad of reboots and prequels has producers salivating ? eagerly pouring through source materials for any possibilities of spawning a franchise, like pirates pillaging unsuspecting vessels for treasure. 'Pan', the latest retelling of author J.M. Barrie's beloved Neverland fable, does little to unearth box-office gold.The film, directed by talented Joe Wright (so capable with 'Atonement', but lacking with his latest efforts of 'Hanna' and 'Anna Karenina'), is at times creative eye candy that sweetens the senses, but also putrid fluff that wrinkles the nostrils.'Pan' begins with Peter as a baby, abandoned on the doorsteps of an orphanage by his mother Mary (Amanda Seyfried), who harbors secret ties to Neverland. She drapes a necklace adorned with a pan flute around the babies neck, and vows an eventual reunion with her son, murmuring "I'll see you again, in this world, or another."Peter (Levi Miller) grows up as a rambunctious orphan; he eagerly disobeys oppressive nuns, and seeks out mischief as World War 2 desolates London.During an airborne bomb raid, the orphans are plucked from their beds by bungee jumping pirates, descending from the roof and snatching them up onto their levitating pirate ship. The captives are taken to Neverland, where they labor within mines presided over by Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman, clearly having fun with a role with limited depth). The pirate has a fondness for Nirvana and the Ramones, hosting sing-a-longs with his slaves and belting tunes like a displaced character from 'Moulin Rouge'.Blackbeard desperately seeks 'Fairy Dust', a fossilized crystal that possess the keys to immortality.After Peter is falsely accused of pocketing 'Fairy Dust', he is sentenced to walk the plank. When he tumbles to his death, he flies for an instance, and captures the attention of fellow miner James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). Blackbeard takes Peter to his personal chambers and tells him a prophesy of a half- human and half-fairy boy who is destined to defeat him. To prevent this from happening, he imprisons Peter. While in captivity, Peter agrees to use his flying abilities to help James Hook escape, if he returns the favor by aiding his search for his mother. Accompanied by Smee (Adeel Akhtar), Peter and Hook flee. Shortly after, they are intercepted by the Natives, where they meet Tiger Lily, who pledges herself to assisting their plight.Their adventure is an interesting and flawed addition to the Peter Pan myths, but lacks originality or relevance to distinguish it from past movies from a clunky script.Prior Peter Pan movies ranged from the good ? 'Peter Pan (1953)', 'Hook (1991)', 'Finding Neverland (2004)' ? to the awful ? 'Return to Neverland (2002)', 'Peter Pan (2003)'. The latest telling ranks somewhere in the middle ? a decent adaptation that lingers between the realism of early 1940s London and the fantasy of Neverland, but never quite showcases the enthralling magic exhibited by it's finer predecessors. Its unusual that Wright's 'Pan' was created, when superior material existed for a better adaptation. Within the last decade, authors Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson wrote a fine young adult trilogy entitled Peter and the Starcatchers ? prequels that garnered both praise from critics and audiences alike. Anticipate a redux in the future, especially when the taste of a possible blockbuster series is a financial delicacy for those profit hungry studios.</fullReview>

Also the scenes in the real world look very much in contrast that they are clear see-through for children. They are very suiting as a children's movie as it encourages imagination. Yet that's all I see good in this movie. The story is essentially crippled. I don't think the producers knew how to handle the story of Peter Pan's origins. They seemed to ignore the more older generations who were told these stories when they were going to sleep as kids. The fairies look odd since only Peter can understand them while in the original story Tinkerbell look more than just a light. TRhe acting overall is just as a standard children's movie. I personally think there's isn't any significant problem with the acting, rather with the story and the dialog themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this new retelling of the Peter Pan lore isn't terribly original with its mind in the Star Wars galaxy, its climax in Superman's home and, heck, even its theft of the other Pan reboot, 1991's Hook, it's not as bad as the rap it received.Granted, this 111 minute movie took me nearly 3? hours to finish ? didn't always grab my attention, I still wanted to finish it. Looks like they wanted to really build a franchise out of it, but with its buck ninety eight box-office returns (exaggerating, of course, though it didn't even make its money back world-wide,) it's doubtful the boy who could fly won't be flying again any time soon.That is, until Disney takes over and does their Cinderella/Maleficent treatment, of course.I digress. It's not perfect. It's predictable, even if you don't know the old fairy tale, it's slow at times, leaves a bunch of holes big enough to fly a flying pirate ship through and yet?still enjoyable for the family to watch. Um, well, if the few deliberate deaths of children doesn't bother you. Eek, I forgot about that. At very least, Pan wasn't played by a female. Always found that rather disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie because of the story and the cast (Hugh Jackman is one of my favorites!) but I made the mistake of having expectations. So if you don't think the storyline too much and just enjoy the brilliant CGI and beautiful world of Neverland, "Pan" is definitely watchable. But - stop to think just once and you're screwed.Story: A good idea telling the story of Peter's origins, how he became Peter Pan and how he met Hook and Tiger Lily and why he was special and different from other lost boys. As many of the viewers already have pointed out however, the story is full of holes. So full, that you can easily see through it.Acting: As Hugh Jackman does what he does best, I have no complaints whatsoever about his work. Levi Miller does good enough job playing Peter, but maybe it was the awkward script that made him seem stiff at some points.Complaints: THE SONGS. Oh Gods why, why?! why instead of good ol' pirate chants they're singing Nirvana?! Why?????Other: I just really hoped they would've spend more time writing the story and thinking it through. The story of this movie seems just lazy and you can easily think that because it's so easy nowadays produce beautiful CGI worlds there's no need for a decent story. Back in the 80's they HAD to focus on the story because making the effects &amp; props was so much more time consuming and challenging.Pan was still fun to watch, but... just don't expect anything epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PanThe worst thing about being young forever is all of your lovers eventually become sex-offenders.Fortunately, the immortal in this fantasy is technically still a mortal. Spirited away to Neverland on a pirate ship belonging to Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman), reluctant orphan Peter (Levi Miller) hopes to find his mother (Amanda Seyfried) in the mystical realm.Instead, he becomes a slave in Blackbeard's fairy-dust mine where he befriends a young Captain Hook (Garrett Hedlund), who helps him escape.Fearful of a prophecy foretelling a flying boy who will overthrow him, Blackbeard vows to vanquish Peter before he learns his true ancestry.The overblown origin story of author J. M. Barrie's beloved Lost Boy, this gaudy green-screened 3-D extravaganza exploits modern fantasy movies for its expected exposition, while its characterization of a benevolent Hook lacks plausibility.Mind you, telling orphans they can fly might free up some beds at the old orphanage.

		<shortDescription>Pan Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living a desolate life at a London orphanage, 12-year-old Peter (Levi Miller) finds himself taken to the fantastical world of Neverland. Adventure awaits him as he meets a new friend James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) and the tribal warrior Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). This group must now band together to save Neverland from the evil pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Along the way, the orphan must uncover his own true destiny, becoming the legendary hero forever known as Peter Pan.The film starts off with a voice saying that you may have heard this story plenty of times (which I believe most of you have) but not this one. I am very skeptical of that. I assume everyone has heard of the characters. You got your Peter Pan and your Hook, not quite a captain just yet. There are other characters that I haven't (but probably others) quite heard of like Tiger Lily and Blackbeard (in the context of Peter Pan). I found this direction to be interesting but I found they didn't add much to the story other than being a cliché source of encouragement (Tiger Lily) and being a transvestite (Blackbeard). I found there to be many WTF moments while watching this film but the worst WTF moment has to be Hugh Jackman's performance as Blackbeard. I had a hard time ever taking him seriously as a character when the way his character was designed (makeup, clothes, facial hair, etc) makes him look like a transvestite. Not only does he have the misfortune of looking like a transvestite, his performance (or over-performance), to me, was the worst of the film. What made it so bad was not only the way he looked like a transvestite, his dialogue was just cringe-worthy. He is not the only one to get my scorn, however. Garrett Hedlund's performance as Hook seemed very out-of-place to me. His dialogue was bad but not as bad as Jackman's Blackbeard and the baffling decision to give him a southern accent (I don't know whether or not he ever was supposed to have one) just felt a little off when juxtaposed to the world the filmmakers were trying to create. I thought Levi Miller was okay as Peter Pan. I thought I was going to find him super annoying going in and I was pleasantly surprised when he wasn't annoying as I thought he was going to be. He still was but not as much. I thought the underlying story here was kind of cheesy here with silly WTF moments throughout such as the appearance of Nirvana and The Ramones for some reason. I thought the beginning of the film was the worst culprit and I found it just torture. Despite the quality of the story you get to see, it sometimes gets drowned out by the special effects which appear a little too often. Overall, if there was a little more substance to go with the style, then this could have ended up a better film.Score: 5/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise Lost...... Badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a movie that could have, would have, should have but didn't.Pan had all the raw elements to be a great reinterpretation of a modern classic (Peter Pan for those who don't know), but unfortunately failed to tie those elements together with any coherence.Good animation, decent premise for a fantasy world, some good acting (especially Levi Miller and Hugh Jackman) couldn't save this movie from below average script writing and overall story.The script was loose and downright cheesy on occasions (Tiger Lilly and Hook romance anyone). Scenes from the movie seemed to be added in just to fill time and added nothing to the overall story. To top it off the movie steered us slowly and drearily towards an ending which grew ever and ever more predictable. My advice to any adult considering watching this movie would be.... don't. There are plenty of better uses for your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'PAN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A new origin story, to the classic fantasy character 'Peter Pan' (created by J.M. Barrie, in 1902). The film tells of how Peter Pan and Captain Hook first met (as allies); and how Peter became the hero of Neverland, and the leader of the 'Lost Boys'. It was directed by Joe Wright (the acclaimed director of such Oscar nominated films as 'ATONEMENT' and 'PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE') and it was written by Jason Fuchs (who previously wrote the 2012 animated sequel 'ICE AGE: CONTINENTAL DRIFT'). The film stars Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara and newcomer Levi Miller (as Peter Pan). It's a huge critical and financial failure (at the Box Office). I think it's a very mediocre film, at best. The story begins with Peter (Miller) being left at a London orphanage, as a baby, by his mother (Amanda Seyfried). He's kidnapped there, during World War II, by flying pirates; and taken to Neverland. There he meets Blackbeard (Jackman) and James Hook (Hedlund). After witnessing Peter miraculously fly, Blackbeard believes he's a boy from an old prophecy; sent to kill him. Peter befriends Hook and escapes the pirates. The two make their way to the forest, where Peter meets Tiger Lily (Mara) and learns of his fabled destiny.The film is surprisingly weird and quirky; it's filled with bizarre visuals and odd (modern) music placement (by Nirvana and the Ramones). This isn't what bothered me about the movie though, like it did the critics; I just was not at all interested in the story, or the characters (for that matter). While it is pretty strange, in places, it still seems like a tired old story; that we've seen dozens of times before. I don't think it's strange, and quirky, enough. It's also poorly cast; including the controversial casting of Mara (in a Native American role). Kids might like it, but most others will be bored (like I was).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Neverland you will not want to revisit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&#x2b50;&#xfe0f;&#x2b50;&#xfe0f;When it was announced another Peter Pan movie was on the way the assumption was it would be under the careful hands of Disney but alas Warner Brothers saw potential in a blockbuster hit and possibly sequels. Sadly that is where it ends as 'Pan' is such a mess of a film it is laughable. With the talented Hugh Jackman going all out with a over the top but entertaining performance as Blackbeard and easily the best part of the entire movie. Levi Miller plays the lead role, Peter and it is hard to tell if it is bad acting or a young actor trying to make the best of a weak script. The story starts with Peter being left at the steps of a orphanage as a young baby. Many years later in the middle of the night, Peter and man others are snatched from their beds by pirates of a flying ship and taken to Neverland and enslaved by the fearsome Blackbeard. It is hard not to be impressed to a certain level of the visual effects of Neverland but they soon become overwhelming and more like a video game. In conclusion 'Pan' might not be the blockbuster for all the family and better off as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic, butchered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a horrendous prequel to the much loved Peter Pan story, and all to try and turn a profit.The film serves no point in the franchise, as it hardly contributes anything to the story, and if anything has points of conflict with the original story of Peter Pan.The acting is mediocre at best, and horrible at its worst. The script is boring and ridden with clichés. The entire plot seemingly has no real direction, and virtually no twists, or mystery, making it incredibly predictable from within the first half hour. And perhaps most annoyingly, despite being a prequel, it doesn't lead in and set up for the main story in any meaningful way.It's only redeeming feature would be some excellent visual effects, although as with a lot of films these days with empty plots, the visual effects are overused, in order to try and mask the other awful attributes.A huge disappointment as I'm a big fan of the Peter Pan story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hook as Indiana Jones/Han Solo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it with my boys, ages 10 and 14. They thought it was "ok, not great," and gave it 5 stars. Overall, I found it enjoyable, albeit with some curious creative decisions, which presumably is why it being panned by most critics.As you probably know by now, it's a prequel, which affords the film makers the opportunity to change aspects of the story with which we are familiar, and to invent new plot lines. That said, they left enough of the familiar elements intact that the changes didn't overly distress me.A significant change, however, was the choice to make Captain Hook into a (mostly) sympathetic character. I found this curious but not particularly troubling; after all, a villainous character can be made more interesting with a sympathetic back story. What bothered me more was the decision to turn him into a swashbuckling Indiana Jones (or Han Solo, if you prefer), because the actor does not pull this off; he looks and sounds like he's trying WAY too hard to be Harrison Ford.Another problematic aspect is the whole "natives" thing. If you're doing a Peter Pan story, you have to confront the racism of J. M. Barrie's original (also in Disney's film), in which "Indians" are basically a "cowboys and injuns" 1950's American stereotype, bearing no similarity to actual aboriginals anywhere in this world.One option would be to simply eliminate that aspect of the story, much as Disney eliminated black Africans, portrayed as racist stereotypes in Edgar Rice Burroughs' story, from their film version of Tarzan. My guess is the film kept the "natives" in the story for at least two reasons: 1. It provides the hint of a budding romantic interest between Tiger Lilly and Hook; and 2. The "natives" provide a link to the magical world of fairies, which in turn lead to the introduction of the Tinker Bell character.Alas, both of these reasons are weak, however. Not only does the story not need a budding romance between Hook and Tiger Lilly, these characters don't have any credible on-screen chemistry between them. Using "natives" as a link to the magical is yet another racist stereotype, similar to what Spike Lee calls the "magical negro," only in this case it would be the "magical Indian." If you are unfamiliar with the problems surrounding the "magical negro" stock character, you can read about it on line, including in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Negro).And so, they decided to keep the "natives" in the story, but on this island they are mostly not aboriginals in any sense that would be recognizable. The chief, played by Australian aboriginal actor Jack Charles, is a notable exception, but beyond him the natives are largely represented by a variety of ethnicities, including an Asian ninja fighter, various south Asians, and the princess herself (Rooney Mara), who is clearly white Caucasian. This seems inexcusable in 2015, or at least very strange.The film is derivative on many levels, from the "Hook as Harrison Ford wannabe" issue, to Hook borrowing a line from Raiders 4 ("I'm not your friend, kid!"), to Peter Pan's dyslexia which magically transforms into an ability to read fairy language, as in Percy Jackson (the scene in which this happens is almost identical to when Percy Jackson, a dyslexic, learns he can read ancient Greek).The Good: Hugh Jackman is great as a caricature of an evil pirate (Blackbeard). It is often a visually stunning film. Peter's life in the orphanage is very Dickensian, and thus another derivative aspect, but it is very well done. Levi Miller as Peter is excellent, as in fact are all of the boy actors. The 3-D effects are subtle but pervasive, and overall better than in almost any other 3-D film I have seen. The movie is entertaining. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon with your kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A title wave of too much pixie dust (magic) ambushing most of anything resembling a plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you happen to be one who only cares about visual in a move and nothing about plot, this year's Pan is absolutely for you in my opinion. Such as the great visual of the beautiful ship. It comes complete with spectacular spellbinding wizardly special effects such as magical creatures whom appear in the movie! Neverland has never been depicted in such a grand scale as massive lands and sets in this movie! While it all looked amazing to me in 2D, I could easily imagine the visuals being out of this world in 3D! However; at lass, there is the plot problem of the movie. Since the trailers and ads for 'Pan' have consistently engaged in letting you know this film was made by the same studio that made the 'Harry Potter' movies, I think it's best to begin with that reference. The tale spinners of the studio who brought you, 'Harry Potter' presents a story about a baby left at a doorstep by his mother whom it appears she has been left with no choice due to some unexplained dilemma in her life. Peter (Levi Miller) will grow older in an orphanage with mean nuns who not only distorts the truth of his parents to him, but is constantly told he is a nobody. A little while later after being kidnapped by pirates from Neverland in the middle of the night, Peter won't only begin to inherit magic, but will be informed that he is more than nothing: he is prophesied to be the chosen one who will be a great leader to Neverland. (Does this piece of yarn sound similar to another magical boy from a different story? Anyone? "Bueller. Bueller." Shortly after being brought to Netherland, Peter will meet Blackbeard, (Hugh Jackman) whom is the evil dictator of Neverland whom enslaves thousands and thousands of adolescences and children to do his hard labor of searching for pixie dust in rocks. It is here that Peter meets a minor, James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). While it never is quite explained as far as I can recall how Hook came to be in these circumstances, the one big thing he shares with Peter is the wish to leave the trap they are in. The boy and man join forces to take on Blackbeard and or to escape. The main problem is that there is very little dept of character or even chemistry among the characters. Ironically, the one actor that showed great range in the film was Jackman as the chief antagonist and he's not the one you are supposed to be impressed with. Jackman plays a very creepy and demented merciless pirate. I'd say he's the best part in the acting field. Everyone else appears like cardboard characters. James Hook comes off looking and having a similar demeanor to Indiana Jones. As a matter of a fact; it becomes very obvious halfway into the film when he is still acting very much as the protagonist that there may have to be added sequels in the future. It's starting to look like an Anakin Skywalker storyline about how a man goes from being good to evil. (The one plus side, though: while Hedlund's performance may be bland, his performance still is far better than Hayden Christensen's awful acting in the final two prequel 'Star Wars' movies).While there is nothing particularly bad about Rooney Mara's role of Tiger Lily and newcomer, Levi Miller's role of Peter pan, they nevertheless lack much of anything resembling character dept or chemistry. They are simply present as action figures to do the physical actions that it takes to fight a battle against the Blackbeard. I don't really fault any of the actors or actresses for how their role turned out on film. I got the impression that the movie had many talented performers; whom could only do so much on Joe Wright's poor craftsmanship of a director, Joe Wright. The most disappointing thing for me was that I did not feel like it answered any prequel questions I've always wondered about the boy in green. I admit; that sometimes, not always, but sometimes when I see a movie, I'm sort of like Agent Mulder in 'X Files'. Even though I know a movie is going to be fiction, in Mulder fashion, "I want to believe". I want to temporarily be pulled into a simulated reality and believe it is real for a while. However; in the fantasy world I found the story in 'Pan' not to be plausible. Because I've heard bits of pieces of Pan's backstory through other Pan Literature and films, the explanations never comes off as being true to the original author of Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie. I won't engage in any spoilers for the film telling you the roots explanation in the film, but knowing what I know of the original Peter Pan stories, the film's answer is pretty far-fetched. I think that the movie did have potential, but I think that it could have reached that potential if it had been directed by someone else. Considering the emotional themes such as dealing with growing up and confused feelings that has transpired in literature and films about Peter, I think a more appropriate choice would have been for the producers to hire directors that could deal with emotional elements such as, Tim Burton, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Peter Jackson, or even Chris Columbus whom told both an exciting and emotional story in his direction of the first two Harry Potter films. Whatsoever, I have faith that this won't be the last Peter Pan prequel and someone will come up with something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you like Hook? Then don't see this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving it 1/10 because worse than an OK movie is one that takes elements for greatness and makes you cringe as it burns them.From no where, Hook (1991) made characters like Hook, Smee, and Wendy, deep, intriguing, and larger than life - hats off to the actors (Hoffman, Hoskins, Smith), hats off to a stage set with delicate pace, mystery, and music, and, of course, take a knee for Robin Williams who was born to play the part. (loved the child actor's, too)The potential greatness for Pan (2015): - Hugh Jackman - The Peter Pan mythology; delicious characters we want more of. - 21st century cinematography (24 years after Hook (1991)) - A novel plot line with real potential - Hugh Jackman (not a typo)Context is everything. You should expect an excellent movie. You will be disappointed.Fails: - Hook, cheesy acting much? (Garrett Hedlund) 2nd half of movie, every time he's on screen, his acting makes you cringe. - Zero character chemistry. The romance, the fateful suspense, it's lame. It's like watching a high-school drama, there's no chemistry. - Blackbeard. Hugh was OK, but unlike Dustin Hoffman, who set us on the edge of our seat with his repertoire with Bob Hoskins (Smee), Robin Williams (Pan, duh), Julia Roberts (Tinkerbell), and the child actors (sorry, this review is already too much effort to look up!), Hugh gets no one, it's lame.There's more, but this vengeful review is already adding to the minutes of my life wasted by this movie!I love the mythology, I treasure an 80 year old book of Peter Pan!Just don't do it. Life's too short to be disappointed - go watch Cinderella 2015, or Maleficent if you want better reboots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous, Half-Baked Hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether on the big-screen or the small screen, the media has venerated Scottish writer J.M. Barrie's classic 1904 play and 1911 novel about a rambunctious boy who refused to grow up. Paramount Pictures produced the first and only silent movie about Peter Pan in 1924 with Barrie's approval and cast Betty Bronson as the adolescent hellion. About 29 years later, Walt Disney appropriated the property and produced an animated epic with a 15-year old boy voicing Peter Pan. In the 1954 telecast of "Producers' Showcase: Peter Pan," actress Mary Martin impersonated Peter. This broadcast was aired again in 1963, then again in both 1966 and 1973. NBC broadcast the Hallmark Hall of Fame television adaptation in 1976 with Mia Farrow as the eternal youth. In 1987, Soviet television aired its own unauthorized adaptation, while in 1988 the Australians rendered their own unauthorized direct-to-video version. Steven Spielberg cast Robin Williams as a grown-up Peter Pan in "Hook" (1991) with Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell. Captain Hook kidnaps Peter's two children to lure a reluctant Peter back to Neverland. About ten years later, Disney released an animated sequel "Return to Never Land" (2002) to its 1953 original." "Return to Never Land" occurs during World War II, and dastardly Captain Hook battles British fighter aircraft over London when he invades air space with his pirate-ship that he flies by means of pixie-dust. In 2003, P.J. Hogan helmed a traditional version of Barrie's "Peter Pan" with a boy playing the protagonist, unlike a girl in two earlier versions. In 2003's Neverland, indie film director Damion Dietz reimagined Barrie's play with "Neverland" (2003) with Peter as an older teen confused about his sexual identity, while Captain Hook was homosexual, and Tiger Lily was a cross-dresser. More recently, the SyFy Channel's "Neverland" (2011) produced its own origins story about Peter and the Lost Boys as they picked pockets in England adding a Charles Dickins twist to the shenanigans."Atonement" director Joe Wright and "Ice Age: Continental Drift" scenarist Jason Fuchs have borrowed more from Charles Dickens than James Barrie for their 'origins' epic "Pan" (** OUT OF ****) that looks like it was designed to fuel a franchise. Basically, Wright and Fuchs introduce us to Peter before the boy could fly. The action unfolds in the late 1920s as Peter's mother Mary (Amanda Seyfried of "Gone") abandons her infant child mysteriously on the doorstep of an oppressive Catholic orphanage. Presided over by the corrupt, gluttonous Mother Barnabas (Kathy Burke), the Sisters of Eternal Prudence rule the Lambeth School for Boys as harshly as a penitentiary. Inexorably, time elapses, and the year is now 1939. World War II has erupted, and the Nazis have embarked on a massive aerial bombing campaign against the British. The Sisters horde food and conceal more treasure than you could find at the end of a rainbow. Ironically, Mother Barnabas keeps a statue of Mary in her room. All she has to do is twist Mary's delicate snout, and a partition in the floor opens to reveal everything that the sisters have hidden. Furthermore, the good Mother has been selling orphans to pirates passing in the night. Twelve- year old Peter (newcomer Levi Miller) has become such a thorn in the Mother's side that she sells him to those pirates. Specifically, the pirate passing in the night is the infamous Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman of "Wolverine") and he cruises in on an 18th century sailing ship that charts its path through the stars. In other words, he flies his ship across the same skies that Hitler's Luftwaffe uses to bomb London. Blackbeard's men descend through the orphanage skylights in the dead of night and snatch the boys Mother Barnabas has sold him. Imagine bungee-cording into a building and bouncing back aboard a ship in the sky, and you've got an idea how Blackbeard stages these abductions.Blackbeard escapes the British fighter pilots prowling the night skies, ascends above the clouds, and wings his way back to Neverland. He employs these poor youngsters as slaves to mine for pixum. Essentially, Pixum is 'fairy dust,' and the villainous Blackbeard uses it keep his ships airborne. The first time we are shown Blackbeard's kingdom and the massive quarries where the mining is done, everything resembles the citadel in the fourth Mad Max movie "Mad Max: Fury Road." When he isn't conscripting lads for labor, Blackbeard has to contend with the quarrelsome natives who look nothing like Barrie's "redskins" but more like Pacific Island natives. When Peter accuses an older miner of stealing the pixum that our hero has chiseled out of the quarry, he finds himself poised on a plank sticking out of Blackbeard's ship high above the quarry. Miraculously, Peter doesn't plunge to his death, and this impossibility bothers Blackbeard because he fears the youth may be 'the chosen one' sent to topple him. While Peter toils in the mines, he meets James Hook (Garrett Hedlund of "TRON: Legacy"), and this time around Hook is a good guy. Hook and Peter manage to escape from Blackbeard and lead an uprising that eventually deposes Blackbeard.Anybody familiar with Barrie's "Peter Pan" will wince at the liberties that "Pan" takes. Wright and Fuchs have omitted ninety percent of Barrie's book. Hook's only close encounter with a crocodile occurs when one leaps over the raft that Peter and he share with Tiger Lily. Furthermore, Hook isn't even a pirate. If you're wondering about Blackbeard's presence, Barrie mentioned him only once in the novel. Meantime, Wright and Fuchs have expanded his minor role considerably. Hugh Jackson is horribly miscast as the notorious pirate. He looks like he belongs to the 1970s' disco group The Village People. Rooney Mara of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" looks just as ridiculous as Tiger Lily. The people who produced "Pan" have spared no expense with their lavish $150 million budget. Nevertheless, the less you know about the literary "Peter Pan," the more you may enjoy this outrageous half-baked hokum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd, Contrived, and Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I had a ball laughing with my family at how bad this movie was. And I can't recall a movie where my older sister was ranting literally all the way from her theater seat to the car.Pan is basically about a boy named Peter, who has been dropped off at an orphanage of one dimensional Ms. Trunchbull impersonating nuns. He later gets kidnapped with a whole bunch of boys to Neverland to be enslaved by the "fearsome" Blackbeard, but with James Hook (Peter's new friend), they escape and with Tiger Lily's help try to prove that Peter is the Pan (or Chosen One). If you've read the original book (and I have) or even saw the animated Disney movie, you could already start listing everything wrong with it, like the fact that Peter ran away from his parents as a baby (don't ask how) to Neverland and was rescued by Tinkerbell, but let's just look at the movie as is: For starters, the movie intro states that it is about how friends become enemies and enemies become friends. The plot does not ever focus on that. Instead it is all about Peter being the "chosen one" and all the following clichés it brings like self denial, everyone being fooled, pretending he is the chosen one, allies who later betray, allies who say they won't help but later do, and ultimately our hero finding the courage to believe in himself and be the chosen one. It is frustrating to see how predictable these plots have become.What is even more frustrating is how very poorly Blackbeard is portrayed. I don't know what the original stories say about him, but this movie and Stranger Tides make Blackbeard either boring or in this movie's case stupid. He's suppose to be feared, but he barely does anything worth being afraid of outside of enslaving kids, making them walk the plank, and killing off Indians. He knows Peter is suppose to kill him, but what does he do about it? He lets Peter get away not one, not two, but THREE TIMES! He doesn't even try to kill off Peter and end the prophecy! There's a scene where he's got Tiger Lily and Pan both tied up, and what does he do? He cuts their bonds so they can bow before him or die. If that's not stupid, call me a mongoose. Also that costume's silly looking. I don't blame Hugh Jackman for trying, but come on Dustin Hoffman's version of Hook is scarier than this guy. Speaking of Hook, how is it we've got an Indiana Jones rip off flying a ship rather than Captain Hook himself? Yeah, just compare the two and there's practically no difference between the two, all that's missing is the theme music. I have more rants about the film, but I won't have enough room for everything.However, there were a few good things in the movie. The actors tried and were pretty good for what they got (I still blame the writers or director for the flop), and the child actor for Peter was great. Also the effects are pretty good, messy most of the time and all over the place, but a few stood out. My favorite effects have got to be the crocodiles and the mermaids. The crocodiles are so big that Hook would be too small for them. Not to mention the mermaids are the coolest things in the entire movie, not just because they're mermaids but because the tail part of them is electric eel and they glow in the dark.The movie is a bomb, but I had fun knowing why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pirates of Neverland sing "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which should tell you what kind of story Pan is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Pan is the boys fairy tale; though it was written by the great J.M. Barrie in the nineteenth century, it fits right along Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. What separates it though from those stories is that our leader Peter guides it's audience on an adventure to Neverland; the place where the innocence of childhood comes to life. Though I can understand girl's enjoying the story nonetheless, most boys have taken Peter Pan as the kind of story they could admit is fun without looking like a sissy. The tale comes with pirates, Indians, crocodiles, mermaids, flying, and the general idea that the fun of childhood never has to end.Given it's popularity, it seems like it's bound for a reinterpretation. We've gotten different viewpoints of the story from other published novels, but what I had not seen was a full origin story. Normally I would have groaned at the concept as I felt it was used too often in plenty of other Hollywood productions, but this is something that I'm simply too curious to find myself annoyed. My favorite adaptations still remain Disney's Peter Pan and the Steven Spielberg directed Hook, but will Pan do the character justice?Rather then opening in the Victorian era, we find ourselves in WWII London where a baby Peter has been raised in a cruel orphanage. Now at twelve, Peter (played by Levi Miller) is interested in what happened with his mother. While discovering extra food thats being kept away from the rest of the boys, he finds a letter stating that his mother will find him "In this world or another". The head nun catches them and punishes them by raising a pirate flag for a call. Overnight, a band of pirates capture some children, including Peter as it flies away beyond space in time to reach the magical realm of Neverland.Peter finds himself in an open mine where other pirates and miners start chanting "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (I'm not kidding) to introduce Blackbeard the pirate (played by Hugh Jackman) as he sings along. Peter makes friends with another miner, James Hook (played by Garrett Hedlund) and manages to escape into the jungle where they encounter the Indians. Just as they are about to be killed, Tiger Lilly (played by Rooney Mara) and her father discover the pan flute necklace Peter wears and declares him the Pan, the one who will lead an uprising against the pirates.Pan's the kind of rare movie that was a studio product, but allowed director Joe Wright to add some of his strange ideas. The "Smells Like Teen Spirit" moment and floating water traps are only the beginning on how much creative freedom the producers took with Pan. It screams "spectacle" with it's large looking world and had a neat design, but it still needs a proper story to go with it. I'm?okay with the prophet scenario, but rather then dwelling into the deeper personality of the boy who won't grow up, we seem him and his friends engage in fights in the colorful world.The finished picture feels like a Cirque Du Soleil production and not in a good way. The movie is so focused on looking spectacular that the general plot feels very rushed in order to get to the next pretty scene. Levi Miller does exceptionally well, carrying the picture even if Peter is underdeveloped. The rest do fine, though Hugh Jackman's Blackbeard is so hammy that I put him in the same category as Tim Curry in Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's so bizarre and strange, that I can't help but laugh at the choices he makes. He clearly had fun and I had fun observing him.I'll give this five pan flutes out of ten. I think most kids will like Pan, though it was too fast paced and immature for my taste. I'll remember the show more then I did the story. It's an eye candy movie and that should help decide whether this Peter Pan is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan picks pictorial over plentiful approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's longtime fascination with the story of Peter Pan has been a perplexing one, being that, outside of Walt Disney's adaptation, no other retelling or reimagining of the classic fairytale has every managed to assert itself, especially in financial terms. The last reboot of the story was in 2003 to miserable earnings, making me stunned to see that Warner Bros. would even want to risk yet another adaptation that, from the looks of it, will now gross even less than the aforementioned film.Despite being a visual wonder and an imaginative film all around, "Pan" is a disappointingly flat film that fails to give us any reason to sympathize with or care about the characters on-screen, let alone justify why we should show up to watch them. Director Joe Wright, famous for both "Atonement" and "Hanna," two sleeper hits, seems to have had his project monopolized by controlling studio heads that wanted a marketable product rather than a film including limitless visuals and narrative structure, so the result is a film robbed of any kind of identity whatsoever.The Peter Pan story is one that has been told, retold, and rewritten enough to warrant its own documentary about its history, so extensive plot detail is unnecessary. The story concerns Peter (Levi Miller), a young orphan who lives at an orphanage run by miserable, controlling nuns, who hopes that one day he'll be able to reunite with his mother. Out of nowhere, however, upon being told by a nun that he is a boy who isn't special nor is his mother ever going to return, Peter and his fellow orphan friends are kidnapped and boarded on a flying pirate ship helmed by Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman), the feared and respected ruler of Neverland. Upon being ostracized because of his unintentionally rabble-rousing nature, Peter teams up with James Hook (Garrett Hedlund), a lifelong passenger on Blackbeard's ship, and the colorful Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) to take down Blackbeard after he has been told that he is the sacred, special child (or "Pan") the land has been looking for."Pan" is incredibly similar to "Jupiter Ascending" in terms of its release, its circumstances, and its probable fate. For one, both films were due to come out right in the middle of the summer blockbuster season ("Pan" in July 2015, "Jupiter" in July 2014), but were subsequently delayed because both films reportedly had a multitude of special effects work that needed to be completed. In addition, both films were predicted to be large bombs for their respective studio, Warner Bros., and now it's looking like both films' huge budgets will be the bane of their inability to recoup the finances necessary to break even."Pan," however, isn't as murky in terms of its story as "Jupiter Ascending," though it is surprisingly bland. Wright and writer Jason Fuchs feel like they've concocted a checklist of events from the beloved story of "Peter Pan," so instead of spending time on each, they rush through them in order to make a film that isn't too long, but also isn't too developed either. As a result, Fuchs rushes through the perfunctory elements of the "Peter Pan" story in order to get to the film's main attraction, the wide variety of special effects, fairy dust, and chase sequences, all while forgetting that these characters' human traits are what attracted us to them in the first place.The significance of the Peter Pan story has attributed to several things, but largely because of its underdog idea of a young orphan, stuck in an ostensibly hopeless situation, actually being more special than the boys and girls his age that have parents. Similar to "Cinderella" and other classic stories, Peter proving the mean nuns wrong and teaming up with other societal misfits in order to do something extraordinary is the fundamental idea of his story and why he has remained so relevant and memorable to this day. While "Pan" is never boring for long stretches of time, it fails to give us a reason to really recognize the story's significance or real imaginative qualities on a narrative scale when our eyes are so bombarded by pretty colors.Wright and Fuchs don't seem to realize that, or have been steered in the opposite direction by studio-heads, and as a result, aside from some really miraculous sequences involving a flying pirate ship and some very attractive costume-work, "Pan" is a cruelly unmemorable endeavor that is destined for the pits of despair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PAN is a gorgeous mess. Visually beautiful with a superb music score, this mish mash of the writer and director's favorite movie scenes, all shoved together and pelted at the audience, ends up being infuriating and tedious. Peter Pan was written by JM Barrie in about 1904. Not 1940, as this film thinks it starts. The London Blitz sets the Little Orphan Peter scenes with cartoon Catholic Nuns and suddenly switches to galleons which whisk kids through The Batlle Of Britain to Mad Max Thunderdome or is it Fury Road. Utter preposterous ridiculous rubbish, even by fantasy standards. This is THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MAUNCHHAUSEN colliding with MADAM BUTTERFLY in operatic OLIVER cacophony with Hugh Jackman in the most stupid pirate lacquer since Burt Lancaster in THE CRIMSON PIRATE. Hook is introduced and played by a ridiculous Garret Hedlind who clearly has been told to sound like Jack Nicholson imitating Clint Eastwood imitating John Huston dressed as Indiana Jones doing Michael Douglas in ROMANCING THE STONE. Some jungle scenes crash in which collide Aztec SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON with RAPA NUI. A risible crystal amphetamine smoking scene should have been deleted from the picture as is all hunting the addictive crystal should have been. The endless fighting, screaming and yelling will drive any audience to tears... and then it all ends. This is a terrible beautiful mess of a film, and I groaned audibly often. Levi Miller is magnificent as Peter... but what is this Pan Flute crap? JM Barrie did not write PETER PAN FLUTE. This is just stupid, endlessly. What a waste of all the craftsmanship on show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I sat down to watch this when our son was away one night. The movie started out with nice music and very well done CGI special effects. After the first three minutes of this relaxed preparation for the movie it quickly became a total bust. One scene after another of senseless cruelty and violence. For kids under 13 I would say don't even consider exposing their precious hearts to any of this. In spite this movie carrying no underlying story they managed one pointless scene after that another actually has some good CGI special effects. What little story and anticipation one could garner from watching did nothing to pull together a totally discombobulated film. I would not show this movie to my son, and he's 18. There is no good reason to expose youth to the pointless hatred and fighting. There is no real saving grace. I probably had my eyes closed falling asleep for about a third of the movie wile only listening to pointless dialogue. Characters were dry, poorly motivated and poorly directed. My wife and I sort of looked at each other and wondered why we sat through the whole thing. I was there for her, and I think she was waiting for some saving grace which never came. I honestly cannot think of anyone or any reason that anyone would want to see this movie. It's not even a good way to kill time since it's rather short and has you constantly on the edge of your seat wanting to escape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed wins out over creativity, mediocre retelling with subpar performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan, the grand retelling of the beloved story about the boy who refuses to grow up, may have a stellar cast and millions of dollars invested in post-production effects but that is not enough to save this dismal film.Just as the film's tagline suggests, "Every legend has a beginning," Pan tells of Peter's origin story. Left at a dreadful orphanage as an infant, he travels to Neverland on a pirate ship where he encounters mermaids, Indians, pirates, fairies and eventually becomes the leader of the Lost Boys as we know him.Unfortunately for those executives behind approving this film for a $150 million budget, there is very little in Pan worthy of the label 'good'. The acting is atrociously one-dimensional, the narrative is dry and nearing on plagiarism, the CGI is distractingly over-used, and worst of all there is no heart or soul in the story. It has come to our conclusion that perhaps making a live adaptation of a Disney animated film is no easy feat and hope future studios take note.Let's start with the good since it will take the least amount of time. The fantastical production and set designers truly created a vividly imaginative world that is perfectly aligned with the atmosphere and heart of the Neverland created by J.M. Barrie. That alone helps to transport the audience, namely the children in the audience, to that marvelous place second star to the right and straight on til morning. The costumes also create a level of wonder one hopes to get from a film of this caliber. The use of color and texture on the characters Blackbeard and Tiger Lily are inspiring while the mute natural tones of Peter and James Hook are appropriately subdued.There is one awesome moment in the film that deserves special recognition and must be included in the review. About half way through the film, Tiger Lily begins to tell Peter the story of his mother and the fairy prince. Her voice slowly fades into this wondrous animated story made of clay and mud that transforms before your very eyes showing you the story Tiger Lily recites. It reminds us of that moment in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows when we learn of the deathly hallows in an animated sequence by Ben Hibon. At least someone involved in the making of Pan captured the charm that captivated our hearts as children and, if nothing else, at least the mind behind the animation in Pan was able to create something original and awesome.Now onto the bad, and hold onto your britches because you might be here for awhile. First the performances, for who to blame remains a mystery to us. Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard relies on screaming from the diaphragm as his hair and makeup completely overwhelm the character. Garrett Hedlund does his best impression of an adventurer a la Indiana Jones the entire time, but his gargly and guttural vibrato is forced and unemotional. Rooney Mara is aloof and stone faced which doesn't bode well with the character dynamic created in the film. The only good performance is by Levi Miller as Peter Pan, he encapsulates the willfulness of a child but the steadfast honesty of Peter.In the end, Pan feels like a poor rip-off of Oliver or Harry Potter or a copy of the recent Oz the Great and Powerful trying to capitalize on market demand. Nothing proves this further than the inclusion of moderns songs like Nirvana in the film. In trying to market to children and adults alike, the story comes across as overly muddled and simultaneously simplistic with a childish tone rather than magical innocence.What it comes down to it is the director Joe Wright was not able to inspire those involved in the film to create a charmingly endearing narrative because he was unable to connect to the soul of the material. Pan fails at leaving its indelible mark the way Hook remains agelessly in our hearts.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter "Post-Modern" Pan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really and truly over these "reimaginings" of beloved children's classics where the filmmakers feel they have to darken the material to the point of turning the proceedings into horror. Call it the video- game effect. Or the Lord of the Rings effect. Just don't call it enjoyable. Here we have Peter Pan given a back-story; but not just any back-story. A "destined savior" back-story with all the hokum and false religiosity that comes with: celestial choirs, resurrected parental holograms, magic keys and all. And that would be fine if the tale was told with a light touch, a little magic and some charm. Instead, we are treated in "Pan" to corrupt nuns who sell boys into lifelong slavery where if they do not comply with their captors they are thrown off of ships to plunge to their deaths. We see this happen to a boy not much older than Peter; in the service of a joke no less. We get to see Peter wake up in Hugh Jackman's bed and then be treated with chocolate as Hugh waxes rhapsodic about the joy of death between his snortings of pixie dust (his drug of choice). There's a sick sub-text running through this entire enterprise that seems more obsessed with corrupting Peter's innocence than celebrating it. And that might be okay too if you were setting out to do a dark, deliberately adult take on Peter Pan. But this Pan purports to be a "family" film. I'm sorry. The second you kill a child on-screen in a movie that's supposedly about the wonder of childhood, why would you expect me to enjoy the remaining 90 minutes? Even if they were any good? But they are not. A barrage of mind- numbing computer visuals and frenetic action scenes that bombard you rather than delight you. If I had to sum this up in one word it would be: execrable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is not recommended. In brief: In need of fairy dustGRADE: CMost critics panned Pan and I would readily agree that the film is loud, dull, and uninspired. This new reboot is just plain dumb and tries to align itself with the beloved characters created by J. M. Barrie as its safety net. Others have used this sacred cow to better effect in the past , and will, undoubtedly, continue to take advantage of the Peter Pan love-fest in the future.&#xfffc;In this film, the main problem is the half-baked screenplay by Jason Fuchs. The woeful script is bereft of imagination, never succeeding in re-imagining its Neverland inhabitants from its far superior book source. Characters are poorly written and defy logic, if not gravity. But, at least, Pan is visually striking and is a feast for the eyes, if not the mind. &#xfffc;This prequel introduces Peter, Hook, Tiger Lily, and newly added to the lore, Blackbeard the Pirate, into the plot. This Pan starts in WWII London with plump evil nuns running a Miss Hannigan-like orphanage and little Peter (winningly played by Levi Miller) acting all Oliver Twist for a while, until he is finally whisked off to Neverland to do battle with, not Captain Hook, but Blackbeard (a miscast Hugh Jackman) who is high on fairy-dust, an age suppressing drug. That's a lot to say in one sentence, but Pan has a lot of plot to cover while it plays with the story as we know it. In fact, Hook (an overacting Garrett Hedlund, acting like a goofy frat-boy type) is not a villain at all. Instead, he's a bit of a rogue hero in this version, channeling Han Solo bravado into his character. Are you still with me?&#xfffc;Along the way, we meet Tiger Lily (a fine Rooney Mara) and her politically correct tribe, Smee, dubbed here as Sam Smiegel (a god awful Adeel Akhtar, playing his part like a demented Ricky Gervais), a very large CGI crocodile, glowing mermaids, and Tinkerbell herself. Oh, I forgot to mention a mining town reminiscent of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and lost boys anachronistically singing Nirvana's Feels Like Teen Spirit too. Yes, really!It is a big mess of a movie, handsomely choreographed by Joe Wright, who should have never green-lit this project. But the director still has a good eye for gorgeous design elements and surreal moments. He wisely assembled a group of talented artisans who deliver strong production values. Costumes by Jacqueline Durran are sumptuous and highly-detailed, Dominic Capon's massive set designs are stunningly over-saturated with wonderful fuchsias and deep blue tones, and John Mathieson and Seamus McGarvey team up to create fluid aerial photography that has magical images that include ships that sail through the clouds and a boy that can effortlessly fly. Too bad all of their hard work in a film like this sinks from an excess of action overkill and little narrative sense.&#xfffc;Pan fails on most counts. It is a noble failure that gets lost looking for that second star to the left, thanks mainly to an inept screenplay that lets everyone down. Wright ends up looking like a lost boy in need of a better map. With all its excess and glitz, the film just never lands.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan is an unending barrage of visual effects when it could have sufficed as a magical origins story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie magic and a movie about magic are entirely different, but as we've seen before in the similarly themed Jumanji, a film with these motifs can be an overwhelming singularity when done just right. As the seventh film adaptation and loosely based on the original play by J. M. Barrie, Pan is a relentless offering in visual effects to such an extent that eyes will bleed and heads will spin.Movie magic? As profuse as the fury of an erupting volcano! With the obvious nod to high-end production values, Pan works as an epic fantasy-adventure as along as the CGI onslaught is your cup of tea. And seen in 3D, that's double the pan-demonium (if you'll excuse the pun) on the senses and akin to a kid on a sugar overload. Even so, the proverbial bull in a china shop is not the overuse of special effects but fundamental problems with Jason Fuchs' screen adaptation of Barrie's story books. On a positive note, I'll say that Fuchs' reimagining adds a fresh new spin to the Peter Pan story with a low-key opening segment set in WWII era London. Peter (Australian newcomer Levi Miller) is an orphan with an Oliver Twist (twist) who doesn't lay down to tyranny in the orphanage. Instead, his reputation as a mischief monger fits snug, and like Matilda in Matilda, gives head nun (ala the Trunchbull) a run for her life. Then one night Peter is snatched by pirates in an 'airship' and flown off to the fabled Neverland. Run by the despicable Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman), Neverland turns out to be a quarry for pixie dust where children from all over the world are enslaved as miners. Adding another twist is fellow miner James Hook (Garrett Hedlund), Peter's reluctant friend who has his own agenda in escaping Neverland. Together, they proceed to outsmart Blackbeard and his henchmen, and thus begins director Joe Wright's inexhaustible barrage of CGI bombardment. Up until this point, Fuchs' screenplay is a welcome change given previous film adaptations has Hook placed as Peter's archenemies. But once Peter learns of his latent ability to fly, the film takes a sharp detour into familiar territory. Here on, it's swashbuckling and platform jumping and repeat, with each skirmish filmed in as many camera angles as possible. Also joining this flying farce is not Tinkerbell, but Tiger Lilly (Rooney Mara), a Native American princess who helps Peter in and out of his adventures. Somehow, Fuchs' bizarre concoction of character placement works to a certain degree, if only they didn't end up doing what they do every fifteen minutes or so. With repetitive action scenes taking center stage, the main story takes a back seat, and in the process undermines what could have been an original prequel to the Peter Pan saga. Worst of all, and for a nonstop action film, there isn't a tense moment throughout its 111 minutes runtime. Neither is there any sense of wonder or charm or the spirit in which Barrie conjured magic with words alone. With the story overpowered by eye-popping effects, the only saving grace is Jackman's whimsical delivery as a villain with a hidden motive. Combined with Hook's Indiana Jones getup and short-lived supporting characters including triplet mermaids and the inescapable crocodile, humor is unmistakable and refreshingly so. It's just too bad that the film isn't as special as the titular hero. Take it with a pinch of salt?or pan-cakes with a gallon of syrup. Oops, I did it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not do the original Peter Pan story justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only reason i didn't give it a 1 out of 10 is mainly because the actors in the movie did pretty well. Levi Miller and Hugh Jackman mainly. First off, the story had no coherence or unity. It was very disconnected at parts. From what i could tell this story was supposed to be the prequel to all other Peter Pan's that have been made. Sort of showing you how Peter got to Neverland and his relationship with Captain Hook and Tinkerbell. *spoiler* There was also way too many 'almost' deaths for the main characters. To where they should have died, but something would happen at the last moment. And usually it would be a stalled moment. Where there would be no viable reason for them not to die. In the original story Pan runs away to Neverland because he doesn't wanna grow up. In this movie he is kidnapped. And once in Neverland he somehow puts together on his own that his mother must be in that world. A very random assumption. Because there is really no reason to say that she should be there. Personally i think Garret Hedlund's character Hook was not portrayed very well. He seemed very corny. And the way he would talk seemed too unnatural. Any ways if you want to watch this movie and have never seen any of the other Pan movies, you would enjoy it more. Though im pretty sure you would still be confused by its disconnectedness. And if you have a child who has never watched any of the other Pan movies, PLEASE do not let this movie be the first one they watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie which is remotely based of a classic novel, shows great shame to the book, the context is all wrong for a starting point of what was up wit this movie. The first problem with the context is the fact that we meet James hook and many other adults in Neverland however from previous knowledge it is known that people do not grow up in Neverland which then brings us in to black beard who lets just face it, should be really dead as shown by the progressiveness of his ageing speed yet as stated before this ageing rate doesn't occur in Neverland. Furthermore, the whole thing with hook as it is well known that hook got his hand bitten off by a crocodile which is the basic point of hook's vengeful nature towards peter however this was never brought up. This movie should not even be classed as a starting point of peter story as it doesn't show the things that set peter pans story in to motion and complete disappointment especially with the CGI effect which was completely noticeable. Finally, the only thing I could actually say was a good pointer in this movie is some of the actor that was picked to portray peter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie fails to impress there is almost no decent story line , it starts out with an original idea but soon the plot becomes predictable and trivial. Although i have always admired Joe Wright's work this one greatly disappointed me. This movie had so many good elements, i thought Huge Jackman was great and i loved Levi Miller in the role of peter he was so expressive and brilliant despite his young age. The make up artist does a fine job and the movie is full of color. It has decent effects and image but that along cannot make a movie interesting. The plot fails to thrill. The turning points of the story are all predictable, you end up seeing a story you have seen and read about a thousand times with not an ounce of originality. I think next to the script the sound greatly fails this movie, the sound mixing has a serious problem many of the fight scenes would have been 10 times better if the appropriate sounds could have backed it up. This film had a brilliant director a good cast and other decent elements but it fails to reach the hearts of the audience . The story of Peter Pan is such a powerful story , packed with emotion and action it has always found a way to touch me till the day i saw this film. I was amazed they took this story and yet failed to reach me. In my humble opinion if a movie can't reach the hearts of the audience it has no purpose of existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't begin to describe how bad this movie is. I found myself face- palming and rolling my eyes constantly throughout the screening. Nothing can redeem this disappointing revision of the story about the boy who never grew up. The plot is hectic and full of holes, the acting is overdone and the visuals offer nothing we haven't seen before. Pan (2015) is Peter Pan meets the Mummy 2 meets Tim Burton's Charlie and The Chocolate Factory meets The Three Musketeers (2011). A male narrator describes every movement on the screen for the entire duration of the movie, starting with the logos of Warner Bros. and RatPac Entertainment (that's right!), his work only briefly hijacked by a female narrator who promises us a story she isn't going to deliver. WWII, slavery, Nordicism (seriously, all the good guys are light eyed blonds!), drug abuse, Nirvana and flying zombie terror birds are only some of the questionable elements this movie felt the classic story was lacking. Neverland never looked worse!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan - Movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit in a Peter Pan movie? What the f**k!.The story is about a young orphan boy finds himself taken to the magical world known as Neverland. Trouble and adventure await the boy - a boy who will one day become the one and only Peter Pan.So I've just seen Pan a few days ago and I was quite shocked of how bad this film was. This might be the most disappointing movie of the year for me, because Pan was my most anticipated movie of 2015... and it fails to live up to my exceptions.Levi Miller did a decent job playing Peter Pan in the movie, I mean he's really trying here and I can see that from him. This is he's first big motion picture film and it really dose show. He didn't do a terrible performance like most kid actors, he did alright for what he had to work with. Now Rooney Mara is a great actress and she has shown us that she has talent, but here I felt like she was really miscast. I never brought her as this character and I found it kinda strange that she cast as this character in the first place.Garrett Hedlund as Captain Hook dose what I call a "teeth talking performance", and what I mean is that he shows his teeth a lot to deliver dialogue. Oh and he also sounds like Jack Nicholson mix with Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, it get's freaking annoying after awhile.Hugh Jackman as the villain was really over the top and really cartoonist. Jackman is so much better than this.The movie lacks on character development, the story isn't interesting, the movie felt rushed at times and the cgi in this movie looks unfinished. Seriously, the effect's in the movie look so fake and very noticeable that it's Fant4stic level bad when it comes to visual effect's.Overall Pan was a giant mess of a film. Hook (1991 film) was way better than this movie. I wanted to like this movie but I couldn't bring myself to say that this is a "good movie", because it's not. As a person who grew up on Peter Pan I couldn't stand this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this movie without any prior viewing experience with any Peter Pan story or film, so consider my opinion with a grain of salt. With that being said, this movie is a bit of a letdown. The trailers were really good. It seemed to be a great adventure led by what looked to be a great performance from Hugh Jackman. Pan never grabbed me. Jackman was great and the score was fun but once again, it was nothing special.The film introduces Levi Miller to the film industry, and for a first timer, he was actually quite good. I don't know much about Peter Pan, but Miller seemed to nail all the right emotions needed for the role. As I said before, Jackman is also great, although a bit too 'twirl the mustache villain' at times. So with a good villain and a decent protagonist where did the film go wrong? Well the special effects were horrible to say the least. Take some of the forest scenes for example, they don't even look remotely real, neither do these random monster-birds that appear occasionally. Honestly, it looked like something a TV show would try to put together. Then you have the completely out of place rock songs that the citizens of Neverland are singing while mining. Wait isn't this supposed to take place during World War II? Yep, so that makes sense. But if the film would have been more fun, I think you can forgive these things. Finally, you have the god awful performance of Garrett Hedlund. I think most of it can be contributed to his dialogue and the script, but he's clearly overdoing it. Then we have the forced romance between him and Rooney Mara. Some serious cringe worthy moments there.Look, the film isn't really targeted someone my age, so I think kids can probably have some fun with this film. Hugh Jackman was entertaining to watch and Levi Miller seems to have a future in the business, but there's plenty to dislike about this outing for the chosen one.+Jackman does what he can+Levi Miller has a future-Bad CG-Forced romance-Hedlund4.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan tries to be a lot of film premises at once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginnings of Peter Pan and Captain Hook is not a bad idea, but only if the writing was clever, which it was not. Tries to be a mix of Oliver Twist, Star Wars, The Matrix, with some Pirates of The Caribbean, and Harry Potter mixed in. Although the effects are pretty descent, but the CGI becomes a little see through. Not to mention out of nowhere a certain 90's song starts being sung.Levi Miller does give a descent performance as Peter Pan, holds his own with everybody. Rooney Mara is also good has Tiger Lilly, now I'm convinced she would have been a better Sue Storm then her sister Kate. But Hugh Jackman is just a little cartoonie to be taking seriously has Blackbeard, he was a better villain in Chappie. Garrett Hedlund is annoyingly over the top as Hook, his tough guy voice hurt my ears, sounds like Han Solo is he smoked a million Marlboros, and he has no chemistry with nobody here. I know the film Chappie was mixture of a lot of movies about robots, but that knew what it wanted to be. Pan never really seems to really find itself. Watch Hook(1991) instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pan is the prequel of the Peter Pan myth, revealing how the character discovers Neverland and get to be the famous boy who never grows up. And how the film tells this origin story is appealingly whimsical enough, we see some delightfully fun imagery around the surface, but the plot itself is so generic and gets even less interesting when it keeps on going, which loses the essence and magic of the source material. One could admire the technical work and some talents, specifically the leading role, is pretty charming, but the pleasures won't last that long, either.The first thirty or so minutes can be quite fun on how it builds up the flavor of the entire film. We see the sense of playfulness displayed on Peter's smaller adventure in an orphanage and trying to get away from pirates. But once the actual plot kicks in and reveals the true destiny of the protagonist, it loses its steam. Even with all the stunning visuals and energetic action, it just falls short of having any good sense towards this story. And there, it's another prophecy story and people rely on Peter and he doubts that he is the one and so on. It's predictable and it also restrains Peter from having the same adventurous personality he had at the first minutes, making him concern more about his destiny which is needless to have any tension since we already knew how things will turn out. Most of the journey is clearly just exposition on why the Pan is important to their world, but there isn't much time spent proving or having much character development. It's mostly just foreshadowing the original story and doesn't offer any inspired plotting somewhere else.And it's a shame since the director tried making everything seem endlessly whimsical; every action scene is brought a grand scale of absurd yet actually pretty fun thrills within its visuals. It's much like a cartoon. The bad side, however, is the CGI can be too fake whenever Peter flies, but you can only shrug that off if the movie gave us a reason to. And yes, it can't even gloss over the faults of everything else in the plot. Maybe it also has something to do with the characters; again, they're mostly just shadows and if you don't get the punchline then it would be tougher to root for them; unless you find Hook's strange accent fun.The only character who is genuinely effective is, indeed, Peter. Levi Miller is a wonderful talent, and when he was the only one carrying the film, we see a far more intriguing Peter Pan than what it ended up to be in this film. Once the protagonist discovers the prophecy, he suddenly became one of those who are trying to somewhat brood and prove themselves, but the story contrively skips to the climax. It's a stronger character when he is basically just an adventurous young boy, even at a smaller scale where the villain is just some Ms. Trunchbull retread. The rest of the cast tries to be charming, but doesn't quite top its lead. Hugh Jackman hams it up, surprisingly more than Johnny Depp would, as a pirate. Garrett Hedlund is equally cartoony as Jackman, maybe because of the accent. And I don't exactly know if I have to blame Rooney Mara for this, but this is just the most uninteresting Tiger Lily I've seen, so far. And that's kind of saying a lot.Pan is full of wasted opportunities. It establishes a fun kind of world and its logic, which matches a playful nature a Peter Pan tale could have been. Despite having these images that bring a delightful sense of color, the movie fails to bring the same imagination within the plot. And there, it gets boring, the climax gets dragging. No pretty visual can blind us from each misstep it takes, because it kept the protagonist from being what he should be. But don't worry, because the foreshadowing could give an excuse, except it can't. Even without acknowledging the source material, there isn't enough magic to be found in these quirks, either. Although there is some fun to be admired in the first half hour, the rest just shows that this is just another blockbuster meant to be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J.M. Barrie must be rolling in his grave. I expected to see something with a more child-friendly story to it, rather than this over the top mish-mash of gritty action, dark characters, and not really much in the way of anything suitable for a child to watch. Apparently this film cost $150 million to make, and frankly, the money would have been better spent not only going to the Great Ormond Hospital, but to any number of other children's hospitals around the world. Garrett Hedlund, made me think I was watching a very bad impression of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. The story line was disjointed and disappointing.

		<shortDescription>Falling short of 2nd star to the right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard for fans like myself to watch a film fall so short of its potential. J.M. Barry must be rolling over in his grave, or at least rolling his eyes. Screenwriters must be either setting themselves up for a "prequel sequel" or they did zero research into what fans would expect from a prequel to Peter Pan.Beloved characters that had heretofore lacked depth, remain lacking depth. Questions like: "Why the pan flute?", "Who was Peter's fairy father?", "When does James Hook lose his hand and become Peter's sworn enemy?", "When does Tinkerbell pledge herself to Peter's side", and "What's Peter's relationship with the Mermaids?" all remain unanswered. Oh, and let's not forget the puzzling 1990's Nirvana song Black Beard adopts as his work song....Garrett Hedlund's portrayal of James Hook left me confused. While it may be his own personal interpretation of Hook, I found his over-annunciation and clown-like facial expressions to be a huge distraction. I expected to discover the origins behind the villainous, quirky, and legendary pirate Captain James Hook, and instead I got a regurgitated version of Han Solo.Levi Miller is a great young actor and did fantastic in his portrayal of Peter Pan. Too bad Peter didn't become "Peter Pan" until the last 10 minutes of the show and instead spent most of his screen time crying, overcoming mommy issues, and feeling sorry for himself.Overall, the film was disappointing and I feel there was a lot of missed opportunity for sub-plots and character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even "Thinking a happy thought" won't get you through this movie, huge letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a jumbled mess of CGI, dull acting, and awkward story line. This has got to be one of the most frustrating versions of Peter Pan I've ever seen. The best part of this movie (other than when it was over) was Hugh Jackman being the only one to successfully bring his character to life.In the beginning we see Peter's mom leaving him at an orphanage during the WW2 era. The nuns at the orphanage are outrageously and unnecessarily mean, so forced it makes you roll your eyes hoping they'll just get off screen. Peter and his friend are trying to find out why since bids go missing in the night- turns out the evil nuns and pirates are somehow in cahoots, buying orphans to be slaves in Neverland. The scene of the flying ship traveling to Neverland was a HUGE letdown. This had the potential to be such a magical, aw inspiring scene. But it wasn't, instead for the thirty seconds they are in space we're given random floating bubbles with fish inside then BAM, Neverland appears. Enter Blackbeard, praises to Hugh Jackman for working with what vague character he had to portray. Yet the scene where we first meet him, he is singing Nirvana's "Smells like Teen Spirit". Actually all the pirates are singing, REALLY takes you away from the movie with a shudder and wonder of why this is happening. Blackbeard runs a mine in search if crystallized Pixie dust destroying the land - Avatar basically, but with no stunning visuals.Fast forward, Peter gets caught in a lie, forced to jump the plank and flies briefly. Turns out he may be a "chosen one" to free the land if Blackbeard. After befriending Hook and Smee, they escape to meet the Natives of the land hoping they can help them out. The Native tribe was so diverse, yet Tigerlily is pale as snow with very forced performance.From here on out was a struggle to stay in my seat, I wanted to gag. There is so much focus on this stupid prophecy, which makes Peter Pan sound like a fairy Deity, I couldn't feel excited because Peter is so unlikable. He only cares about finding his mom, barley attempts to even fly again. Hook has become such a loyal companion without a trace if darkness, its confusing how exactly he will become a villain. Hook loss his lovable quirky nature, instead given cheap pick up lines and predictable actions. I never really felt like I was in Neverland. Basically looked like a big forest with weird skeleton birds only appearing for a minute at a time. All other wildlife was randomly thrown in just to say "this IS a Peter Pan movie, look thirty seconds of mermaids, ten second clip of crocodiles, Neverland is believable!" Doesn't work, I completely forgot this was doses to take place on an enchanted floating island.Shame on the director for the crap ending! Peter finally flies, then goes from whinny boy to super smug boy reciting emotionless lines. "I AM the chosen one!" "Think happy thoughts!" "I can fly!" After the "climatic battle" we are left with such bad foreshadowing of Hook and Peter's relationship I got up and finally left. The director is begging for a sequel and I hope he doesn't get it. Such potential gone to waste, there was no magic in this film. Bad acting, bland story, and many unanswered questions. The kids might enjoy but I suggest waiting for it to be at Redbox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dishonor on the screenwriter and his cow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comes from someone who grew up loving Barrie in many forms ? page, stage, and screen ? and asserts that film cannot stand without good writing. My beef with this turkey isn't the popular ruffling over Tiger Lily's bleach bath or distaste of the hammy performances. Jason Fuchs, the astoundingly empty-headed screenwriter of this platitude machine, is my denunciative bullseye. The guy pumped out a script that inched its way to the Black List, which means it must have swept many discerning eyes off their feet, right? Fleshed and furnished, this script lays bare not only the black vacuum of Mr. Fuchs' imagination but the nature of its arbiters as shameless philistines.The bloat plot, unfurled in full, proves that Mr. Fuchs was raised like a toadstool: kept in the dark and fed?not manure in this case, but clichés. He hangs Peter, in all his charm and purpose, on the hook of an ancient prophecy. The ancient prophecy is a chestnut that would roll the eyes of middle-schoolers. In unavoidable tandem, cliché number two: the fulfillment of destiny. Peter is no more than a young alien Jesus to the Neverlanders ? the latest incarnation of Dances With Wolves and Jake Sully. Poor Barrie, to be so tidily crammed into the boo box of banality.There abides a thick effluvium of self-awareness evident in the lame jokes and radically wrong timelining. The movie almost sighs in reluctant acknowledgment of these errors like Frankenstein's monster beholding himself in the mirror. I'm all for new choices if they work in the movie's world, but little if anything did here. By the end of the fight sequence I'd grown a small beard; I'd actually spent most of that time attending to my wristwatch, which did a decent crocodile impression. A good story uncompensated for by bowlfuls of battle would've kept me glued to the screen, but? One detail, revealed so suicidally in the teaser, is a popular fallacy this reviewer will set straight right now. It's small but it's big. Mr. Fuchs wins no points for running with perhaps the laziest decision of all: that 'Hook' was actually James' name at birth, long before his famous amputation. Call it canon till you're blue, but James was not called Hook before he found his prosthesis. To proselytize that a pirate named Hook found a hook to match his name is to advertise or self-advertise as a bad writer and a worse imagination. It's tragic that for all his acclaim and revenue, big-time screenwriter Mr. Fuchs can't conjure an even slightly better alternative for this hook ex machina malarkey.This synoptic Velveeta does nothing but patronize. From legions of audiences to Barrie's very sunbeams (in which it couldn't less deserve to dwell), Fuchs' screenplay maligns the intelligence of whatever it touches like some meth-muddled Midas. A screenwriter's responsibility, especially with derivative work, is to provide a holy trinity: novelty, relative plausibility, and effectiveness. Barrie is an easy read with blessedly ample room for creative gap-filling, so anyone who can't do him justice is not meant to write fiction. Why does director Joe Wright not catch any errant arrows of my onslaught? He, like the crew, only worked with what they were given, proffering a vibrant sensory smorgasbord to cover up the tripe from the peabrain supreme.I'm aware that not all movies are made for the intelligent by the intelligent, but this is not an argument for Frasier-caliber material. Audiences ? kids included ? are far smarter than the industry has come to treat them, and they deserve something smart and rewarding, not lazy and rote. To presume to drop Barrie into the formulaic dunk tank is disgraceful ? public domain or not. The Disney version made good choices and remained plain fun without microwaving a frozen template, so there's no excuse. Even better is the best, the incredibly accurate 2003 adaptation. Screenwriters P.J. Hogan and Michael Goldenberg not only pulled us into Barrie's world but respected us enough to brush ?not oversell ? the pulses of lust and nightmarish bitterness that threatened its gossamer innocence. Those guys, twelve years ago, had the genius to deliver a first-class Neverlandic balance of ferocity, tenderness, whimsy, and intellect.For Mr. Fuchs, on the other hand, to think would be an awfully big adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, okay, Hugh Jackman does make a very satisfying baddie, and the three points out of 10 my daughter and I have awarded are for him alone - the movie overall is about as unsatisfying as it gets. It's much too scary for younger children, and too tediously predictable and ridiculous for older ones and adults. Sure, the kids are cute and the special effects are amazing, but special effects alone don't cut it these days, and this movie is almost nothing but. The plot is slender and frankly daft - Oliver! meets Narnia meets Indiana Jones with a teeny bit of Peter Pan thrown in almost reluctantly. The love interests are yawnworthy, as is the sugary sentiment. Barrie would be spinning in his grave, particularly as Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, to which he left the royalties for any version of his immortal story, got precisely zilch for this movie because it is a prequel. All in all, a shocking waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go watch Hook or the original Peter Pan instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I got to see this film today online as I heard a lot of people criticize this film and of course it became a total flop at the box office. Pan is suppose to be a retelling of Peter Pan the boy who wouldn't grow up. The film opens with Peter(played by newcomer Levi Miller) who was abandoned by his mother Mary(played by Amanda Seyfried)who left Peter at an orphange. As Peter grows up he and his fellow friends ends up being whisked away to Neverland where Peter meets the ruthless Blackbeard(played by an unrecongisable Hugh Jackman sporting a British accent again)who thinks that Peter is a prophecy.Peter then later meets up with James Hook(played by Garret Hedlund from Tron Legacy)and Peter and him team up to defeat Blackbeard.But what is Blackbeard hiding and what does he want with Pixie dust.Bottom line I was disappointed in this film and I can see why it bombed. First thing I have to get out of the way is Hugh Jackman. Now I love this man I seen him in a lot of films ranging from Kate &amp; Leopold to X- Men but whatever reason made him star in this film is beyond me. He acts like his trying to be Johnny Depp and when the part came on when he sang Nirvana's Smell's Like Teen Spirit I was like oh my god why Hugh Jackman why. Also he was too campy and over the top and him as a villain it just doesn't work. Was it just me or does Hugh Jackman sound exactly like his character Leopold from Kate &amp; Leopold with the British accent Also the film has nothing got to do with Peter Pan at all,Hook was the same but at least it was 100 times better than this tasteless flick. The film is just a boring butchered mess.My advice go watch Peter Pan the original 1950 Disney version or Hook with Robin Williams.Avoid D- 3/10 Props goes to well I guess the set but the rest is just boring as hell. Also Garrett Hedlund i'm sorry but was he trying to be Indiana Jones and his accent is appalling its like his trying to be Jack Nicholsen or whatever.Also starring in this film is the guy who played Richard Madden's BFF (the captian from Cinderella) is in this film as Blackbeard's fellow campmates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's animated Peter Pan. Spielberg's Hook. Live-action 2003 Peter Pan. NBC's live Christopher Walken musical. The DisneyToon direct-to-video "Tinkerbell" series. Is NeverLand in the public domain or something? Do we really need another trip to the second star to the right and straight on 'til morning? You would think that if anyone could breathe some life into this ubiquitous universe it would be director Wright (Atonement) with his undeniable pension for beautiful visual storytelling. However, despite some intriguing design and costuming, this begging-to-be-Harry-Potter origin tale of the ageless boy mostly comes across as the film equivalent of white noise. This isn't the story you know; here, we follow Peter during his inaugural trip to NeverLand as he learns and earns his place. Many things plague this ill-advised reboot, starting with the cast and characters. Not a single person is authentic even within this fantastical world, especially Hedlund as a young and overly self-referential Hook and Miller as a charisma-less version of the title character. Not that it's completely their fault; when you're directed to run through a land of computed zeros-and-ones and deliver terrible dialogue, finding truth in your performance can be nearly impossible. Most of the problems, however, arise from the atrocious script. What makes the original great is its themes on how stories should be enjoyed but should never replace and endanger your real-life. They would've been much better off doing a strict retelling, keeping Peter as the braggadocios and mysterious side-character, instead of a faux-complex one. Full of misplaced humor, odd anachronisms, and a complete lack of mystery, Wright's noble attempts at bringing something out of the muck unfortunately fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is an unnecessary, unbalanced, and uninspired prequel to the J. M. Barrie story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever watched that movie about the orphan that overcame impossible odds, was treated terribly by their caretakers, and ultimately discovered that they were destined to do great things? Oh, you have? No, I'm not talking about Harry Potter?or Oliver Twist?or Annie. Okay, I'll just tell you ? it's "Pan", or at least it's Joe Wright's origin story of the beloved Peter Pan character.The movie is an unnecessary, unbalanced, and uninspired prequel to the J. M. Barrie story. "Pan" is set in 1940s London with Peter's mother, Mary (Amanda Seyfried) leaving a newborn Peter in a basket at the doorstep of a Catholic orphanage. The film then takes us forward to a twelve-year-old Peter (Levi Miller) where it begins it's adrenalized story of Peter being scooped up from the sky by pirates to begin his new life in Neverland. Where he searches for answers about where he came from.Jason Fuchs' screenplay features many of Barrie's original characters, although the film has altered many of their back-stories. Such as James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) having an actual friendship with Peter, also Hook having a romantic relationship with Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). "Pan" also introduces us to the flashy and wicked character Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Unfortunately, the creativity ends there."Pan" never seems to find its identity. At first it appeared that it wanted to be a musical. We were given two a cappella songs within our first 15 minutes of arriving in Neverland ? "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Blitzkrieg Bop". Then the musical concept was scrapped almost immediately.Joe Wright did not shy away from the CGI, which is unfortunate, because it was not used well. There was not a believable moment in the entire movie. There were several sequences where it was extremely obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen or moments where characters had been digitally animated.We have also seen much better performances from these actors before, with exception of Levi Miller (this is his first feature film). The best performance in the entire movie actually came from Miller. The worst performance definitely came from Hedlund, who seemed to be doing rough impersonations of both Harrison Ford and a poor man's Jack Nicholson. Hugh Jackman gave a passable performance as Blackbeard and Rooney Mara was emotionless as Tiger Lily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan is ultimately an unnecessary movie no one wanted or needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pan is a pointless, useless movie. It's a drawn out storyline wrapped up in confused visual design and underwritten characters. There is not a single moment of film that doesn't feel like it's pulled from ten better movies, books and video games and staple- gunned together. Pan doesn't know what it wants to be or what it wants to say. All it knows is that it really wants a sequel. The film, directed by Joe Wright, was based super-duper loosely on the story of Peter Pan. It stars Levi Miller as Peter, a young orphan living in WWII-era England in THE WORST ORPHANAGE OF ALL TIME. The nuns in this movie are so inhuman and monstrous in personality and depiction, I would honestly not be surprised if they turned into John Carpenter's The Thing around open flame. The nuns are selling(?) children to pirates from Neverland because they somehow got in contact with each other. The pirates grab Peter and whisk him away to Neverland to be a child-slave. And once we get to Neverland, my real problems kick in.Goddamn Wonderland had more consistent rules than Neverland does here. Bubbles of suspended water and giant skeleton-birds are integrated with cable cars and Fury Road- style shantytowns in a miasma of confused visuals. Every scene looks like it was given to a different art director and production designer, all of whom had just finished watching better pieces of media. The cable cars and airships bare an unmistakable Bioshock: Infinite vibe, the forests and creatures feel ripped straight out of Avatar (2009), and Blackbeard's pixie dust mines might as well be watched over by Immortal Joe.Speaking of, Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) hits the perfect balance of being underwritten and over-acted. His motivation is insultingly simple and his only definable character trait is "evil". I have seen better defined villains in old Captain Planet episodes.Back to the plot because I'm still less than twenty minutes in, Peter is confined to the pixie- dust mines, where he meets Captain James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) who is doing the over- americanized voice Henry Cavil did in Man From U.N.C.L.E. only in this film it isn't a joke. Hook is basically a charmless Indiana Jones, from wardrobe to attitude. Also, the film doesn't even try to create a morally questionable character. It's like if you made a Spider-Man prequel where Norman Osborn was just a really cool dude who never did anything wrong and was best buddies with Peter Parker. Eventually, Hook, Peter, and Smee (Adeel Akhtar) who is no-joke the best part of this movie, escape to go find the Piccaninnies. Now, it is almost impossible to not make Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara)'s collective of stereotypes not culturally insensitive, but they damn sure try here. But, despite casting the group as diversely as possible, the wardrobe and portrayal still made me incredibly uncomfortable. Maybe Tiger Lily is one of those things that should be left out of modern day adaptations, like the Little Mermaid's suicide.At this point in the movie, we learn that Peter is chosen one #192311 because god forbid we have a fantasy movie where the hero isn't destined to be so. Then the pirates attack and they fight the Piccaninnies with paint balls or something, I don't know. Peter, Hook, and Tiger Lily escape to go find the fairy kingdom because it's about time for the third act to happen so we can all go home. On the way, they encounter memory water because the lack of established rules means the movie can just make sh*t up as it goes along. They get to the fairy kingdom and the film steals the whole "protagonist is dyslexic because he's hard- wired to read a mystical language" thing from the Percy Jackson series. Blackbeard shows up and there's a big CGI fight scene where Tinkerbell and the fairies finally show up. Tinkerbell is more a plot device than a character in this movie. Blah Blah, the movie ends with Peter beating Blackbeard and he, Hook, and Tiger Lily going off to have adventures.Overall complaints: The attempts to shoehorn in aspects of the Peter Pan mythology at the expense of the film's pacing is annoying. We get a full scene with a large crocodile because PETER PAN, AUDIENCE!!!! That scene does nothing to further the plot nor the characters. Tinkerbell might as well be literally any other fairy. Also, the nudge-nudge-wink-wink reference dialogue made me angry. At one point, after one of the pirates mentions they have lost track of "the boy", the other responds "Yes, he is a LOST BOY." I don't know what happened in the next five minutes of the film because I walked out of the theater and had to psyche myself up to go back in and endure the rest of this movie.At the very end of the film, Hook says something along the lines of "Man, Peter, we are gonna be friends forever, aren't we?" (I don't remember the exact wording) and I'm sure if I'd been seeing this movie in 3D, Garrett Hedlund would have stuck his head out into the audience, winked directly at me, and shouted "DO YOU GET IT, AUDIENCE??? BECAUSE IF NOT WE CAN EXPLAIN IT TO YOU MORE EXPLICITLY!!!!!" The other reason this line doesn't work (aside from it being clunky as hell) is because, like I said before, There is zero foreshadowing that Hook is in any way not the greatest person ever. It's an unearned wink. Honestly, this feels like the first act of a better movie elongated to feature-length. It's bloated and cluttered and unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like this movie, then you like it and that's great. But leave it at that. Don't go building it up to be a fantastic new story for all ages, because it ain't and you know it. PAN is a cash cow for kids, a cinematic cousin of the fried Twinkie. It's fine to like fried Twinkies, but don't try to say they're nutritious. Junk is junk, however good it tastes; don't pretend it's something more.Many of this movie's yaysayers seem to bash the opposed (the thankful majority) for wanting depth in a story that isn't meant to be, as one reviewer put, "Tolkien-deep." Sorry for not automatically eating and liking everything Hollywood puts in front of me, but it's not as black-and-white as that. Peter Pan may not be Tolkien-deep, but that doesn't mean we're okay with seeing it redone as the most tired narrative in history. If we want a helping of the Chosen One, there's a universe of top-tier selections - I'm not going to list any because you (yes, you) could name five off the top of your head. List ten if you can. Challenge each other. Make it a game.Come on, folks. The writer for this movie was the guy, daresay the Chosen One, behind ICE AGE 2. 2. Not even the first one, which was pretty good. They may as well have hired Tommy Wiseau, who would've at least given us some genuine laughs ("You're tearing me apart, Wendy," "Leave your stupid kisses in your pocket," "What kind of dust did you take?" "You can drop off the face of Neverland. That's a promise," etc.) You'll notice that this movie is the latest example of an unspoken, trendy recipe: crummy writer + decent director + excellent graphic artist + phenomenal composer. The music and visuals sweep your goosebumps up and down like wheat in the wind, convincing you that you're watching a good movie when you're actually just listening to a good soundtrack set to a sequence of good paintings. I'll download the OST and have 50% of the movie's quality in my phone.Joe Wright made a Joe Wrong here, however much or little was his doing. Well, as long as there are no sequels it'll be quickly forgotten...and judging by the ending, PAN is just the first installment in the next Fast Transformers of the Furious Caribbean. Those responsible, hope you're proud. Every legend indeed has a beginning, but sorry - no matter how much you want it to be, this isn't it.P.S. Anyone who is okay with the movie's decision to call him 'Hook' before he had his hook...no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre is the best way to describe it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning, when the setting is not the Victorian Period but rather WWII, I could tell that this wouldn't be the most faithful telling of Peter Pan. However, there is so much to get to that I can't focus on that. Nor will I get into the fact that the American Indian Tiger Lily is portrayed by the White Rooney Mara, since I'm sure plenty of others will do that. There's one point in the film that a child is pushed off a cliff which is completely glossed over, something that I thought would be more important. But this film has to much more crucial stuff to get to, like pirates chanting "Smells like Teen Spirit". I'm dead serious. The visuals were obnoxiously colorful. The costumes, especially those of Blackbeard, were completely over the top. It was very clear that the actors were simply in front of a green screen for a good chunk of it. There were also these birds which were some of the worst effects I've seen in some time. I gave this movie an extra star since the villains and Captain Hook (who for some reason is Peter's friend) were freaking hilarious. I had to bite my lip to prevent myself from laughing at their hysterical overacting. I believe Hook is trying to be a cowboy, but he acts more like a creepy mascot with an unrecognizable American accent. I'm guessing Hugh Jackman must've been inspired by an insane person for his performance as Blackbeard. I would say I'm shocked that he would stoop this low, but the man was in Movie 43. But the best by far was the nun, who was mugging throughout her performance. They gave some hint of a sequel for this, but judging by the box office numbers that's not happening, which is a miracle for the sanity of the general public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have never written a review but was compelled to write one for this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so sad what has happened to movies these days. This movie is so violent for little ones. I brought my seven year old and I constantly wanted to leave the movie. This is a kid who saw Nine by the time he was five. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and it started off really good. Once they go to Never Never Land it starts to go down hill. It seems like they were so worried about cgi that they let the rest of the movie go. The directing was awful. So contrived and Hollywood, nothing new here. I feel bad for Garret Hedlund. The director had him do this ridiculous voice that seemed so forced I had trouble suspending disbelief. Peter himself was the only character I liked. When the pirates find the Neverland people they just start blowing them away shooting and killing at least ten of them, they blow up in to colored powder but his does not take away from the intensity. Then Black Beard takes the chief and and says if he wont tell him where the fairies are he will kill him, the chief doesn't tell of coarse and Black Beard just shoots him and kills him right there and then. WTF. towards the end of the movie the pirates find the fairy cave and just start burning them. Using flamethrowers to burn the fairies out of the air, are you kidding me. Think of the worst kids movie you have seen in years, watch that five times before considering seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long tedious film with good visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Pan' tells the story of a young boy named 'Peter pan' who is an orphan and is lost without his parents. He then finds himself in a magical world called Netherland looking for his mom. On his way he meets a mysterious man named Black Beard played by Hugh Jackman. Peter doesn't really get to know this man till later in the movie he founds out that it was him that killed his mum. In the end Peter gets revenge by killing Blackbeard, and shortly after he meets a fake version of his mom created out of fairy's.Now I am going to go through different topics of the movie and explain my review for each topic.Topic 1: Storyline The movie is meant to be a kids/family movie but when I was watching it, it was a bit violent and a kid trying to kill a man in a kids film seems a bit harsh to me. I guess they were trying to go along the same line as the movie 'Hook - 1991. The story was very slow and tedious at times. The big events of the movie didn't happen till the end and it wasn't anything special either. I'd rather watch the animated movie to this. No joke. The story was so boring. I know some of you people may have enjoyed it but I really don't like boring movies. Topic 2: Character Development/Acting The main characters in the film are Peter Pan played by Levi Miller, Blackbeard played by Hugh Jackman, Hook played by Garret Hedland, Tiger Lily played by Rooney Mara. Firstly Levi's character was alright. He didn't know how to use his powers and he didn't want to have the responsibility of being Peter Pan after knowing his mother is not alive. The acting wasn't perfect from this character but it passes for a kids film. Hugh Jackmans character was the heinous character of th film. He attempted to kill Peter man times during the film but always seem to get interrupted. His acting was great but it wasn't really the right role for Hugh Jackman as an evil character but it was still alright. Hook's character was very forgettable as the audience was meant to focus on Peter Pan and I never really took the time to think about him. But he seemed to be a bit selfish towards tiger lily at times. Tiger Lily's character was re-memorable because she told Peter that his mom was still alive when she wasn't. This causes Peter to get very upset with her causing Peter to not trusting her. Her character was untrustworthy. Topic 3: Visuals/CGI The main reason I didn't give the film a 1/10 is because of the visuals. I actually enjoyed them and especially at the end with the fairy's everywhere made it pleasant to watch. Kids really like colors all over the screen so it really fits into the movie. There was only one thing I really didn't like and I kept on complaining about was the gravity in the film. I know they used a green screen but when the characters jump or land it always seemed like they were leaning slower for some strange reason. If you guys didn't pick this one up then you might want to look again because I found it very strange. The opening scene of Blackbeard when he jumps on the edges of the balcony in front of the crowd, it seems very weird the way he lands. Almost as if the gravity has gone from 9.81 m/s^2 to almost around 6-7. I don't know why this is because it is in another world or the film hasn't been thought through too fell.Topic 4: Music This is a great example in how to over do the music in a film. I don't think there was a pause in the music at all. The music really tries to brainwash the audience into liking the movie. Which it probably did succeed. The movie would have been so empty and boring without the music even though I still find it boring and empty. I eventually managed to isolate the music to the film so I could enjoy the movie without worrying about the music brainwashing me. In conclusion the film to me was boring and the visuals tried to convince me to enjoy it but it wasn't enough. I would recommend you do something else with your day instead of watching this and save your money for something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Correct Title: Incompetent Peter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was easily the worst Peter Pan movie I have ever seen. Other then the first 10min of minor rebellion against a corrupt orphanage manager, Peter then becomes a whiny, oblivious, idiotic, and utterly incompetent little boy who does nothing worthy of respect the rest of the movie. Literally his only contribution to the story and victory is being BORN. His parents were fighters and courageous, and a 'prophesy' inspires others to fight. His incompetence gets dozens of 'tribal natives' killed and possibly thousands of 'fairies' killed before he stops whimpering and crying and stands up, and then does nothing but literally stand up and let his birth gift 'inspire' others. Requiring no personal character, courage, hard work or skill. Hook and Tiger Lilly did all of the work, all of the fighting, motivational speeches, and sometimes literally dragged Peter out of danger that he was incapable of walking himself out of. Hook and Tiger Lilly literally had to drag Pan through the story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very pointless and bad origin story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a humourless, dour, and badly made film. they have taken all the magic out of the world of peter pan, and instead given us a peter that is whiny and miserable almost all thru the film. a loud, noisy cgi affair has nothing to offer. all murky and with dark undertones, cannot see how they thought that this would appeal to kids. Hook is a wannabee indiana jones, jackman's blackbeard is a mediocre pantomime villain, the soundtrack is dreadful. its amazing how Hollywood can lavish so much money on a script that anyone with any sense would have binned. there are some many books and stories that have yet to be made, yet all the studios keep doing is re hashing old properties and then not coming close to films made before with the same characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie TO MISS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLEASE read thisHonestly, I was going to try to be fair with this review... I had a whole paragraph written, and my wife read it and just said, "c'mon... tell the truth!" There were so many embarrassing "face-palm" moments in this movie... we talked about walking out at multiple points. From the completely random Nirvana singalong, to the barely acceptable CGI (even it were still the 90s), to super lazy plot devices, to the just painful dialogue... what a disappointment.Project yourself one year into the future... this is absolutely one of those movies you won't even remember if you saw it or not. There is nothing interesting, thought-provoking, memorable, or even humorous. There have been so many good kids movies recently. How did they ruin such a wonderful story that was part of so many of our childhoods?By the way... child acting. Ughhh.... if you want to see good child acting, watch Finding Neverland. You will not get it in this one. For me, mediocre child acting just kills a movie. And unfortunately, only Hugh Jackman does anything interesting with a character the whole movie through.This is one for the kids... only the kids... but actually, god, I wouldn't even want to take my kids to this one. I'd prefer they develop a taste for movies that don't rely only on bright colors, dumb costumes, and getting-hit-in-the-balls jokes... yes, we're still trying to get laughs at kids getting hit in the balls apparently. Please see literally any other movie currently playing right now. You will not regret that decision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst film EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect example of Hollywood throwing $150million at a director to come up with a new take on a film franchise that nobody cares about. The film is entirely pointless from start to finish and not evan the wolverine could add any credibility to this flop, every actor does a film that they will regret and this has to be hugh jackman's. With a cast that its got, you would hope that its a different take on the film and it does in a way but only in a small way. I would be willing to place a bet on this being the biggest flop of not just 2015 but the biggest one since battlefield earth (2000) Joe wright (director) has got a good CV but if i was him i would not put this on it and in the future stay away from films like this.</fullReview>
