		<shortDescription>Still Confident and Brilliant, Still Seeking to Hold the Moral High Ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first encounter with Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara was in the late spring of 1966 when, as a young Army Intelligence officer just rotated back from Asia, I was assigned to the General Staff in the Pentagon and directed to brief him. The first of a number of occasions when I either briefed the secretary or, more often, was a resource aide to a senior officer, I was cautioned by a nervous lieutenant colonel to expect questions but never, absolutely never, to ground my response in "intuition." It was the pre-Powerpoint age but all briefers were admonished to either have facts best supported by charts and numbers or to simply confess ignorance.I acquitted myself reasonably well and there followed almost a year and a half of observing the nation's highest defense officials and generals in the superheated pressure cooker atmosphere of what we called the "Puzzle Palace."Gifted documentarian Errol Morris's "Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara" is a vital and presciently timely examination of a past that can repeat itself with incalculable harm to the United States. Interpolating documentary film clips from World War II through Vietnam with excerpts from an extensive interview with McNamara, the camera always focused on the alert, articulate and still (controllingly) brilliant eighty-six year old former secretary, Morris quickly takes viewers through his early life getting quickly to World War II. Then as an officer specializing in systems analysis he became a significant analyst whose studies supported the carpet bombing of Japan. His comments about General Curtis "Bombs Away with Curt LeMay" LeMay reflect his transition from wartime admiration for a superb combat leader to distrust of a four-star Air Force chief of staff champing at the opportunity to use nuclear weapons while we still had a commanding edge in what came to be called Mutual Assured Destruction.Interesting and important as McNamara's early war activities were, the crux of his life and the undying source of charge, defense and recrimination is his stewardship of the Defense Department during the early and mid years of the Vietnam conflict.Where Michael Moore wears his views on his sleeve and on the screen through entertaining ridicule and now predictable pillorying of his subjects, Morris wisely and effectively lets McNamara tell his story, prompted by an off-screen inquisitor whose tone is neither hostile nor friendly. The evidence supports McNamara's claim that he sought disengagement during the Kennedy years and he repeats the unprovable belief that J.F.K. would never have permitted the escalation that followed his death (McNamara's account of being Kennedy's right-hand cabinet man during the Cuban Missile Crisis can only leave viewers dry-mouthed as the implications of the Cold War cat-and-missile game clearly emerge as truly bringing the specter of nuclear conflagration to near reality).McNamara frames his eleven life lessons, none startling new advances in philosophical thought. He joins many scholars and advocates of binding international law, the majority of whom have never heard a shot fired, in arguing for the concept of proportionality in the exercise of force. He never seems to realize that contemporary armed conflict is very different, politically and militarily, from his wars.While stating sorrow for what war has wrought, and recognizing his own role, he never apologizes and credibly advances his message for the future through the technique of universalizing: mankind has a problem with violence. I was doing the best I could.Tapes of conversations with President Johnson, who eventually fired him with such subtlety that the Defense Secretary had to ask a friend whether he had resigned or been canned, are especially fascinating. Fractal shards of a once close and then disintegrating relationship, the brief excerpts illustrate just how little both the President and McNamara actually knew (McNamara made many trips to Vietnam-I remember them well. Each time he came back with a positive spin on what was an unraveling military and political situation).At the Pentagon I was struck by the almost total concurrence McNamara's policies and statements enjoyed among civilian leaders and generals alike. McNamara, I thought then and now, was not a man who needed sycophants. He was simply so sure he was right that it probably never occurred to him to wonder why he rarely encountered disagreement. I particularly remember Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Earle Wheeler as a mindless echoer of the secretary's thoughts.A brilliant documentary and a fair one too. McNamara clearly wants this film to be part of his legacy without it being an apologia.He does admit the United States was wrong in misjudging the nature of Vietnam and its history, wrong about assessing on-the-ground intelligence and wrong in not securing support from nations with traditions and values similar to ours (a curious and somewhat Europhilic anachronism). At the end he clearly and brusquely cuts off questions about personal guilt that, I'm sure, he will never be ready to address. Fair enough.I generally dislike any music by Philip Glass but in this film the minimalist score works very well against the documentary images. It would have been a big mistake for Morris to use the folk and protest music of the past.Morris is probably the finest, from an intellectual standpoint, documentarian working today in the U.S.10/10 (because of its enduring archival and current thought-provoking value)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morris Versus McNamara and the Political Pundits of the Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're like Errol Morris, and you want to make documentaries about unusual personalities, it's one thing to choose obscure subjects, people like Fred Leuchter (aka "Mr. Death") or men that excel in topiary hedge sculpture or the study of the African mole rat (two of the people interviewed in "Fast, Cheap and Out of Control"). Not many critics out there will be waiting to pounce if you don't get things just right about the likes of people like these. But it's quite another matter if you choose Robert S. McNamara, one of the last century's most towering, controversial, and - some would say - evil characters. "Fog of War" distills more than 20 hours of interviews that Morris conducted with McNamara over a span of two years, when McNamara was in his mid-80s, and the subjects - all various McNamara ventures - range from "his" World War II, through his days at Ford Motor Company, the Cuban missile crisis, and - finally and mainly - his views of the Vietnam War.As a result, Morris now finds himself in a no man's land of critical crossfire. On the one hand, film critics - people like Steven Holden, Roger Ebert and J. Hoberman - uniformly praise this work. While political pundits of the left - people like Eric Alterman and Alexander Cockburn of "The Nation" - lacerate Morris, accusing him of being overmatched, manipulated, not doing his homework (i.e., being na?ve and unprepared), and thus allowing his film to be nothing but a conduit for the formidably crafty McNamara's continuing campaign of self aggrandizement and distortions of history. Whew. I think the controversy here is based on a misconstruction of the film's purposes by the pundits. First, it is quite clear that McNamara, in full command of his fierce intellectual and interpersonal powers, is not about to be pushed around by an assertive interviewer. McNamara is gonna say what McNamara wants to say, period. To drive home this point, Morris gives us a brief epilogue in which he asks McNamara a few trenchant questions about his sense of responsibility for the Vietnam War, why he didn't speak out against the war, and so on. And McNamara won't bite. He stonewalls Morris absolutely, with comments like, "I am not going to say any more than I have." Or, "I always get into trouble when I try to answer a question like that."More importantly, it doesn't matter very much if Morris or McNamara does not get all the facts straight. If the political pundits went to the movies more often, at least to Morris's films, they would know that his primary interest is in the character of his subjects - their integrity and beliefs and ways of explaining or rationalizing themselves and their lives: he's into people way more than into facts. "Fog of War" is not an oral history, it is the study of a person. For all that, in my estimation, Morris does get on film as close to an acceptance of responsibility for his actions in two wars as McNamara is likely ever to make, short of some dramatic, delirium-driven deathbed confession. He speaks of the likelihood that he and Curtis LeMay would have been deemed war criminals for the fire bombing of Japanese cities, had our side lost. And he speaks clearly when he says "we were wrong" in not seeing that the Vietnam War was a civil war, not a phase of some larger Cold War strategy by the USSR or China. What do the pundits want?Nor was it Morris's purpose to use Santayana's lesson about repeating history to rail at Bush's preemptive war in Iraq. In fact Morris decided to make this film way back in 1995, after reading several books by McNamara and concluding that he was a quintessential man of the 20th Century, embodying all that was so outstandingly smart and sophisticated and ultimately destructive. The interviews wrapped sometime in 2001, the year before Iraq. As usual in Morris's films, the editing is superb, with seamless use of archival footage and special visuals created for this film. I do think Morris gratuitously flattered McNamara by organizing the film around 11 platitudes of his - many of them banal aphorisms known to most high school graduates, students of martial arts, or your grandmother (e.g., "get the data," "empathize with your enemy," "rationality will not save us," "belief and seeing are both often wrong").Political pundits, mired in interpreting concretisms from the historical record, not only see too few films but also don't take seriously the symbolic visuals and sounds offered here. Philip Glass has created an edgy, anxious score that feels just right, just creepy enough for the macabre subjects at hand. I'm also thinking of the scenes when McNamara is recounting his pioneering (he claims) studies of auto safety. As we listen to him, Morris shows us human skulls wrapped in white linen being dropped several floors through a stairwell to smash upon the floor below, all in slow motion. The effect is chilling and speaks volumes about McNamara's famed passionless capacity to treat human carnage as a matter of statistical calculation. It is through such poetic characterization that Morris keeps the game with McNamara in balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and Compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Educated in the best Ivy League schools, successful leaders in the business world, they were the best and the brightest, the core of John F. Kennedy's administration. They came to office in 1961 with high hopes that the world would become a better place. When they left, these expectations lay shattered amidst the rice paddies and jungles of Vietnam. Considered the architect of what came to be known as "McNamara's War", Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson, was one of the brightest but had the reputation of being aloof and arrogant. This public image, however, may not have been the whole story. In the fascinating Oscar-nominated documentary, The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara, Errol Morris (The Thin Blue Line, Dr. Death) interviews the now 86-year old Defense Secretary in an effort to come to terms with what led to the quagmire of Vietnam and reveals a more complex, even strangely sympathetic man.Interspersed with archival footage, actual news broadcasts, and tape-recorded conversations from the period, the interview documents McNamara's personal account of his involvement with American policy from WW II to the 1960s. Culled from 20 hours of tape, the interview is separated into eleven segments corresponding to lessons learned during his life such as "Empathize with your enemy", and "Rationality will not save us". The Secretary does not apologize for the war, saying he was only trying to serve an elected President but is willing to admit his mistakes. He says that he now realizes the Vietnam conflict was considered by the North Vietnamese to be a civil war and that they were fighting for the independence of their country from colonialism, (something opponents of the war had been trying to tell him for over five years). Morris never undercuts McNamara's dignity or pushes him into a corner yet also does not slide troubling questions under the rug and there are some questions McNamara does not want to discuss.Though his reputation is that of a hawk, previously unheard tape-recorded conversations between McNamara and both Presidents reveal that he urged caution and opposed the continued escalation of the Vietnam War. In 1964, we hear Johnson say. "I always thought it was foolish for you to make any statements about withdrawing, but you and the President thought otherwise, and I just sat silent." McNamara also discusses his role in World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and his accomplishments as President of the Ford Motor Company. In talking about Cuba, he reveals how close the world came to nuclear annihilation, saved only by the offhand suggestion by an underling. McNamara repeats over and over again, demonstrating with his fingers, how close we all came to nuclear war. He talks openly about his involvement in World War II under General Curtis Le and how he helped plan the firebombing of 67 Japanese cities including Tokyo in which 100,000 Japanese civilians were killed. In a startling admission, he says that if the allies had not won the war, both he and Le May could have been tried as war criminals.Mr. McNamara has spoken out a bit late to save the lives of 50,000 Americans and several million Vietnamese but at least he has spoken and we can learn from his reflections. Though the Secretary does not apologize for the war, saying he was only trying to serve an elected President, to his credit he has looked at the corrosiveness of war and what it does to the human soul and we are left with the sense of a man who has come a long way. While his lesson that "In order to do good, one may have to do evil" sounds suspiciously like "the end justifies the means", his sentiments are clear that the U.S. should never invade another country without the support of its friends and allies. He says, "We are the strongest nation in the world today", he says, "and I do not believe we should ever apply that economic, political or military power unilaterally. If we'd followed that rule in Vietnam, we wouldn't have been there. None of our allies supported us. If we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merit of our cause, we'd better re-examine our reasoning." A valuable lesson indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mostly McNamara, but just enough Morris to make it a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who watch Errol Morris' Fog of War will be left with a lot to think about. There are a number of parallels to be drawn between what Americans faced during the Vietnam War era and what Americans face now with middle-east conflicts. Morris has directed several controversial documentaries, but Fog of War is very different. He allows the subject of the documentary, Robert McNamara, to remain the focus of the film from beginning to end. Fog of War is very stylish but the artistic features don't take away from the social and political commentary. Instead, they add to it and make the film more enjoyable. This is an important film and while McNamara deserves most the credit for its success, Morris presented the content of this film in a way that made it both provocative and entertaining.When Morris had an opportunity to interview Robert McNamara, he had no idea what was about to happen. Morris was making a film about Vietnam, not McNamara specifically. However, what was intended to be a 20 minute interview turned into a several hour candid conversation. This interview turned conversation became the backbone of Fog of War. It is obvious that something like guilt has been bugging McNamara and for whatever reason, Morris brought it out. As a former secretary of defense for John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon Johnson, McNamara was one of the most important figures from the Vietnam War, in charge of things like bombing campaigns and overall military strategy. Before that, McNamara was a brain behind figuring out how to kill lots of people in World War II. At one point, McNamara says directly to the camera, '?we were behaving as war criminals. What makes it moral if you win but immoral if you lose?' He's making a point about the way the U.S. and allied forces bombed the hell out of Japan, sending hundreds of thousands to fiery graves, mostly civilians. Morris uses what he calls the 'Interrotron', a device which allows the subject, here it's McNamara, to look directly into the camera and see the interviewer, here that's Morris. To the audience, it seems like McNamara is looking right at us, which makes it seem even more confessional than it already is. At certain times in Fog of War, McNamara seems so happy that he has an opportunity to talk about his experiences, but at other times, he seems like he's so defensive about his reputation. All of that seems to have something to do with the way Errol Morris asks questions. Morris is friendly but asks pointed questions that McNamara has a tough time avoiding.Probably the most important moment of Fog of War is when McNamara talks about mankind and its inability to learn from history. He seems very pessimistic but has moments where he seems to think people can learn from the past. It's easy to think about Donald Rumsfeld and wonder what sort of conversations he might have with McNamara. Another great moment in Fog of War is when McNamara gets to meet a general from the Vietnamese army, one of McNamara's adversaries from 30 years ago. It's then where we see that McNamara still doesn't accept much responsibility for what he did during the Vietnam War. He thinks of himself as just being an employee working for the president. Fog of War makes people think about a lot, but that's because of Robert McNamara more than Errol Morris. This was McNamara's film and Morris just happened to hold the camera in place when he probably felt like cringing or even laughing at times. During his famous acceptance speech for Fog of War, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary, Morris reminded the worldwide audience to be careful, because the United States seems to be making the same mistakes it made during the Vietnam War. That's up to the audience to decide, but Fog of War definitely makes everybody think about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grappling with a Difficult Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you possess an especially smug view of history's finality, this film may not do a great deal to impress you. For the rest of us, however, Errol Morris presents a truly complex picture of a clearly complex man.Many of the reviews I read of the film complain that there doesn't seem to be a main point that emerges from the film or its eleven "lessons," which are admittedly too cute by half in many cases. The point, though, is the complexity itself. The point is that history is bigger than its main players, and inscrutably difficult to judge in a definitive moral sense. I don't think I will ever forget McNamara's probing, clearly emotional questioning of the rules of war or the lack thereof, when he discusses how one evening he and general Curtis LeMay decided to burn to death 100,000 people in the Tokyo firebombing. The portrait of McNamara, as well as the two presidents he served, is one of human beings through and through, with all the fallibility and conflictedness that entails. The central quandary of war emerges for the viewer to see: it is the business of killing people, and that means that mistakes cause people to die needlessly.As I said, this film, taken in the right spirit, is deeply challenging. I would recommend it to anyone who has grappled with the enormity and awfulness of the history of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but still relentlessly interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the age of 87, Robert S. McNamara sits to be interviewed by documentary maker Errol Morris. He relates his experiences over his lifetime and talks about his success and his failures and the lessons he has learnt. Starting out as the youngest professor at Harvard university, McNamara talks about his drafting into a special unit during WW2 where bombing sorties were statistically analysed and looking for improvements. The team's findings and recommendations resulted in a change of bombing strategy that was so efficient that it killed 1.9 civilians in 67 Japanese cities. Following the war he carried these same skills to accident and sales analysis for Ford before becoming JFK's Secretary of Defence. It was in this position that he publicly advocated the Vietnam War which led to the deaths of 47378 US soldiers and over 2 million North Vietnamese.I came to this film with high expectations of it being very barbed and sharp. I didn't know who McNamara was prior to this film but I was very quickly able to get a feel for him through the old footage, even if I doubt I held the clear view of him that many Americans do of him when he was in office. The film is mostly him talking to camera and this appears to have been its main weakness in one regard as well as being its main strength. In terms of strength, this approach gives us the intimacy of a conversation with McNamara and, while he is very guarded and clearly still very careful about how he presents himself, I found some of the statements he made to be quite honest and damning. However at the same time it seems like Morris has simply had a long list of topics and just left the camera running while he lets McNamara chat ? creating two problems.The first problem is the '11 lessons' aspects; these feel like an afterthought ? some way of giving a conversation a structure. However they don't all work as the headings don't always fit what is being said and it causes McNamara to jump around a little bit (time wise). Talking of jumping around ? the long shoots that Morris must have had must have produced very long sentences for he has had to edit them down almost into cuts of a few words and, as McNamara is an animated talker it means that he jump-cuts all over the shop ? very distracting and hard on the eyes at some points! Despite these problems the film still works because it is consistently interesting. McNamara seems happy to talk and he is very easy to listen to even with Morris' frantic editing. While I was aware that he was still the same name who had professionally glossed over a lot of things (and at times refused to get into things in the interview) he did say some things that surprised me with his honesty. For example, admitting that, had the Allies lost WW2, those involved in the firebombing of Japanese cities would likely have been tried for war crimes was a shock and was only one of several similar statements he made. However these are rather offset by how careful he is to not blame himself too much and to rather justify what he did; the film helps him out a bit as well and seems to go rather lightly on him. The only thing that makes this acceptable is that Morris has gotten his hands on recently released White House records and tapes that back up McNamara's claims that he was not totally in support of Vietnam (although how he has the nerve to wear a dove on his lapel is beyond me!) and the recordings of ex-presidents in conversation are worth hearing.This painting of history makes the film very effective as a sobering look back at historical conflict. The most unnerving part of the film for me was McNamara's continued assertions that the men involved were all 'rational men' and not crazy James Bond villains. The fact that these rational men came 'this close' to nuclear war is a very scary thought. Similarly, other memories of his are quite scary but funny at the same time ? in the same way as Dr Strangelove was for example. In fact one memory sounds like it could have come straight from the mouth of General 'Buck' Turgidson himself and that's where McNamara suggests that the US could keep its missile advantage over Russia by imposing a mutual limit on testing ? only to be told that the Russians would cheat by 'testing on the dark side of the moon'! At that moment Turgidson's line about a mine shaft gap did not seem so fanciful!Although his points were not as sharp and relevant towards today's Administration as I had expected it was still pretty interesting as a look back with hindsight and, while he is far from broken about what he has been involved in, he certainly is not too proud to look back and judge the overall actions that occurred (even if he was reluctant to accept any more than a little bit of responsibility for his part). He is a great subject though and, like many men who have lived a life, is worth listening to even if you get the impression that he is not as reflective as he think he is. Morris is pretty much an off screen presence for the whole film, only really being heard once or twice prompting for more information.Overall this is a must see documentary simply because it picks back over the bones of some terrible conflicts and some terrible events and we do it with one of the men who was part of plans and decisions that killed millions. I would have liked him to be pressed more about this (he cries over JFK's death but not over the millions killed in 'his' war) but the film goes a little too easy on him, even supplying us with White House tapes that back up McNamara's claims that he was often a voice of reason ? certainly JFK's immediate successor is very critical of him in a phone conversation. The lack of real structure is a big problem and it may have better to pick another tack than the 11 lesson thing ? it doesn't really work and it causes some of the film to feel rather aimless and disappointing when his words don't actually match the 'lesson'. However, for all it's flaws, the film is consistently interesting and I could honestly have sat there for hours and just listened to McNamara talk away ? he is a mystery and has carved out a terrible place in history but he is also a big reason that this documentary is well worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons Learned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his award-winning documentary, `The Fog of War' ? a study of the moral complexities of war and those who wage it - Errol Morris has found the perfect subject in Robert S. McNamara, the man who served as Secretary of Defense in the early days of the Vietnam War. McNamara is astute, articulate, lively and thoughtful, and as a wizened man of 85, he is able to look back on the events of his life with the kind of analytical clarity and sober-minded judgment that only old age can provide.Wisely, Morris allows McNamara to speak for himself, providing very little in the way of poking and prodding as interviewer and filmmaker. McNamara looks at his long and varied career through the prism of eleven lessons he's learned about life and human nature. Each of these revelations is tied into a specific chapter of that career and life. We see McNamara taking stock of his actions as they relate to World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and most notably, of course, the Vietnam War, in each case ruminating aloud about the moral imperatives and ethical decisions he faced on a daily basis as his crucial role in all of these events played itself out. Some may find his comments to be a bit self-serving, an attempt to whitewash the facts and minimize his own responsibility, particularly as concerns his involvement in the Vietnam War. Yet, in many instances, McNamara accepts the judgments of history and admits his culpability, even if he generally does so in a broader war-is-a-necessary-evil context. There are moments during his reminiscence when McNamara actually wells up with tears, thinking about the immense loss of life and personal tragedy that inevitably result from man's insane obsession with destroying his fellow man ? while all the time acknowledging that at times wars must be fought and casualties endured for a greater cause. All throughout the film, McNamara returns to this refrain, additionally warning us that, in the nuclear age in which we live, the human propensity for warfare could very easily lead us over the precipice to global devastation and annihilation as a species. We have little reason to believe that McNamara is not being sincere in his comments, although some more cynical viewers may wonder if he isn't merely saying what he thinks he should be saying in order to secure a more favorable reputation and image for himself as his life comes to a close. If that is, indeed, the case, Morris seems blissfully unaware of it, since he basically accepts McNamara's statements at face value. As an added ? and perhaps unintended bonus ? much of what McNamara says has a pertinent, timely, almost prescient ring to it, as the U.S. struggles through yet another foreign engagement, this time in Iraq.As a documentary filmmaker, Morris demonstrates his usual skill at combining archival footage with one-on-one interviews as a way of bringing his subject matter to life. The caveat here is that Morris provides no counter voices to challenge any of McNamara's statements or his interpretation of events. Yet, as McNamara relates the story of his life, a fascinating history of 20th Century American foreign policy emerges in the background. We see many of the seminal figures from McNamara's time playing out the roles history and the fates assigned to them, from John Kennedy to Lyndon Johnson to Nikita Khrushchev to a whole host of other key players on the world stage. In addition, Philip Glass and John Kusiak have provided a haunting score to go along with the haunting images.As the title suggests, this is a complex film on a complex subject and McNamara and Morris leave us with no pat or easy answers. That is as it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Comes Santayana.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where are you when we need you? A President from Texas acts upon faulty intelligence and gets the endorsement of Congress to use whatever force is necessary and then invades a country whose destiny is more or less irrelevant to the security of the United States. The war generates opposition at home and abroad. The President's domestic programs are cut in order to fund the war. Fifty thousand American lives are lost, and countless indigents die, despite the application of America's high tech weaponry. Having committed himself, not to mention the troops, the President is unable to back down because he doesn't want to lose. "Cut and run" is the expression he uses. In the end the country is united under an anti-American government and forgotten about.This really should be required viewing for voters who may not remember, or may not choose to remember, Vietnam. Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it, to roughly quote George Santayana. It's easy to get into a war, and much harder to get out.And we should bear in mind that the subject of this interview, Robert Macnamara, didn't stand on the sidelines. He was at the center of the Vietnam conflict, which lasted about ten years. He was Secretary of Defense during eight of those years, until fired by Johnson for his increasingly public dissent. He organized the logistics of the war, gave JFK and Johnson advice. Sometimes the conflict was referred to as "MacNamara's War." So he's nobody's idea of an armchair analyst.The most telling and relevant moment comes at the beginning, during the Cuban missile crisis of October, 1962. President Kennedy has received a letter from Chairman Krushchov, saying, basically, that if the US promises not to invade Cuba, the Soviet missiles will be withdrawn. Then a second letter arrives, taking a much harder line than the first, implying a Soviet attack on America.What to do? Curtis LeMay, the Chief of Staff, thinks that since a war with the USSR is inevitable, let's begin it now while we have a 17 to one missile superiority. Another adviser suggests responding to the first, softer letter, while ignoring the second one. Kennedy demurs. What will that get us? He doesn't want to be seen as backing down. The adviser tells him, "Mister President, you're wrong about that." (MacNamara comments, "That took guts.") Kennedy finally gives in and agrees to follow the diplomatic route and responds to letter number one only. We wind up dismantling some obsolete missile bases in Turkey and in exchange the Soviets withdraw their missiles and war is averted. Who is the sage who would now tell the President, if a similar situation arose, that he was wrong? MacNamara comes across as a sympathetic and compassionate guy. He cusses a bit and his eyes tear up when he remembers picking out JFK's grave site in Arlington National Cemetery. He also describes -- without at all boasting about it -- his valuable contributions to the bombing campaigns of World War II.I don't see any bias in Errol Morris's editing, although who knows what wound up on the cutting room floor? It's MacNamara's show all the way and he's candid, keeps the secrets he feels necessary, and never loses dignity. He wrote a book about his period in office admitting that he'd made many mistakes in the run-up to and execution of the Vietnam War. The general reception by the liberal reviewers was that apologies weren't enough. Nothing was enough. The reviewers showed a lot less in the way of compassion than MacNamara shows here.The music is by Philip Glass, who is neat. It's hard to comment on the photography because so much of the footage is from newsreels or TV. It's a fine documentary and ought to be shown in political science classes. It should keep the students interested because it blends the human element with the political. The statistics that were so important to the President of the Ford Motor Company and the Secretary of Defense don't play much of a part in this documentary. What will keep the class attentive is the reenactment of all those human skulls bouncing down the staircase of a dormitory at Cornell University.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest Account of Important Lessons Learned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie the "Fog of War". It is a candid interview with Robert McNamara. He is an 85 year old veteran of WWII and was Secretary of Defense under John Kennedy and Lydon Johnson. Of course, that made him Secretary during the Viet Nam war.It is an amazing account of the lessons learned from a man who lived in interesting times in a powerful position of influence. I get the sense that it is exceptionally honest - about both the success and failures. It was directed by Earl Morris and has a kind of refreshing balance that is NOT present in the films of Michael Moore. I highly recommend this movie.Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the movie is that the lessons McNamara learned are still not understood by the Bush administration with respect to the Iraq conflict. The parallels to that conflict and the conflict in Iraq are scary. Once of the eleven enumerated lessons are a need to respect and understand the culture of the people with whom you are engaged in conflict. He made the statement that he believes that the reason that the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 ended peacefully was that they reached a point where they really tried to understand the Soviets. The reason that Viet Nam failed is that we never learned to understand the culture of the people of Viet Nam. He also mentioned that none of our allies with largely shared values were opposed to our involvement in Viet Nam. We should have recognized that as a warning sign that perhaps we were doing something wrong.Scary, isn't it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The parallel to the war in Iraq is painful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Errol Morris's `Fog of War' may be the best documentary that fuses a controversial historical figure (in this case, Robert McNamara) with his grandest moment (The Vietnam War). `Grand' is ironic because 58,000 dead soldiers cannot be `grand,' the US exit was hardly so, and McNamara's ambivalence about the event and his responsibility give the film an authenticity and humanity that last year was shared only with `Capturing the Friedmans.'Morris, letting McNamara narrate almost the entire film, cuts between the fit 85 year old Aspen skier recollecting the ?60's and 70's and footage from that time when he served as secretary of defense under Kennedy and Johnson. That he is a Harvard--educated, clean-cut, brainy bureaucrat easily changing from leading Ford Motor Company to the Pentagon is obvious. That he allowed the US to go deeper into the war than he personally believed it should is a possible inference from his carefully-crafted dialogue about `responsibility.' He has no problem admitting his major role in firebombing Tokyo in WWII, killing 100,000 Japanese in one night; his boss, General Curtis LeMay, would have had it no other way. But when he almost wistfully speculates that President Kennedy would not have let the war escalate, it is clear what McNamara also wished. But why he didn't criticize the war after he left the Johnson administration he let's us speculate, hinting only that he had information we don't.Throughout the interview (Morris now and then is heard asking questions, especially about McNamara's responsibility), Morris keeps him in the right side of the frame, off center as a metaphor for the confusing war and this secretary's ambivalent role. Like any top-rate documentary, applications to human nature and current events abound. The cool necessary to operate under murderous circumstances is reflected in this wonk's slick hair, rimless glasses, and self-serving dialogue. He is animated when he most seems to have missed the point and embraces the romance of evil, which one of his `lessons' says may be necessary to have in order to do good. The parallel to the war in Iraq is painful. He warns in his first `lesson' we must learn from our mistakes. The inference for us could be, if Vietnam was a great mistake, why are we forgetting it again.For the former secretary, Ernie Pyle's words could hold special meaning: `War makes strange giant creatures out of us little routine men who inhabit the earth.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My own opinion of former defence sectary Robert McNamara is the same as that from critics who described him as " A conman ... An IBM computer on legs " and a technocrat who swapped technology for statistics . But this documentary entitled THE FOG OF WAR almost had me writing a heart felt apology to the man . I did say almost What you think of this documentary is how you morally view conflict and morality . Is there any morality in waging war ? Probably not aside from pursuing a national interest and I did admire McNamara's honesty in saying if America had lost the second world war then the American government would have been tried for war crimes . We also learn that the United States Army Air Force found out the best way to stop a 20% mechanical failure on American planes bombing Germany was to court martial pilots if they turned back before reaching the target which soon led to a 0% mechanical failure on USAAF planes . Not to blow his own trumpet McNamara also tells his audience that he commissioned market research for Ford motor company , took part in amazing ( And quite amusing ) safety tests and fitted seat belts in American cars which save about 20,000 lives every year But it was the waste of lives in South East Asia in the 1960s that McNamara is infamous for and it's this part of the documentary that I have a serious problem with . Despite what the liberal lobby screech about Nixon widening the war in South East Asia the waste of human life must fall squarely on the shoulders of LBJ and Robert McNamara . McNamara is NOT a stupid ignorant man but according to this documentary he was responsible for msome quite ridiculous errors such as not reading up on Vietnamese history or realising the conflict was a civil war . Of course it could be that because he was such an authoritative figure where statistics was concerned McNamara could be of the mind set that a war of attrition where one side with superior fire power with total command of the air and sea holding a manifold kill ratio over the other side will always win a war . This is totally consistent with McNamara's and American military ( Especially Westmoreland ) thinking but this aspect of American strategy in Vietnam is never brought up . We're also led to believe that The Gulf Of Tonkin incident was hyped up by Johnson but is McNamara blameless ? Yes according to McNamara because a war is a president's responsibility in which case I have to ask what does a defence sectary do all day ? And if someone who killed 100,000 Japanese civilians in an air raid is " A war criminal " then how do you describe someone responsible for fighting a war that eventually led to over 3,000,000 deaths most of them civilians ? There's some massive contradictions here especially when you consider " Empathizing with your enemy " is something he learned during the Cuban missile crisis but totally forgot for some reason during Vietnam Despite the rather biased subject matter it's impossible to neither hate Robert McNamara or THE FOG OF WAR in the way someone can hate either Donald Rumsfeld or FARENHEIT 9/11 . With a Michael Moore documentary you know what to expect - Smug partisan glee that adds nothing to knowledge or understanding of a situation while the same smugness seems to be part of parcel of the Rumsfeld ego trip and you can't accuse Rumsfeld of being any type of intellectual . McNamara is different because he is a learned academic and while you may not agree with the 21st century neo-con admin in Washington you can at least understand where they're coming from . In a not very heavily disguised reference to the present war on terror McNamara says America lost the Vietnam war because " None of our allies Germany , Japan , Britain or France agreed with us " . Untrue . America lost Vietnam because neither LBJ or his defence sectary bothered to understand Vietnamese nationalism . Worse still unlike the present war on terror none of the strategy involving intervention in Vietnam was necessary in any way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I believe McNamara is using the media to absolve himself of responsibility for the highest death toll of any military conflict this county was ever involved in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Vietnam-era Veteran. I watched "Fog of War" this evening and I was pretty much disgusted at how the ex-Secretary of Defense uses the media to portray him as a victim instead of the war monger he really was. Feelings? Regret? Compassion? All of this is being conveyed strictly in retrospect. He had one mission and one mission only; send as many young, innocent, healthy American men, and women, as you think it will take to win that war. A war that wasn't even a damn war; it was a "Military Conflict", from beginning to end. Look at the Vietnam Memorial. That's why it's designed the way it is. War was never declared. The Memorial is below ground because it's the only military conflict we ever lost, and we are ashamed of it. It's black, because it's the only black mark on our military history. It starts with one name, gradually builds higher and higher, below ground, to it's apex, then phases smaller and smaller, until the last name, still below ground; the same way we gradually phased in to the conflict and gradually phased out of the conflict. There was no declaration at the beginning or at the end. For McNamara to come out now with this "I was a pawn in the big picture" bull is a disgrace to all the military and civilian personnel who lost their lives in that "Conflict". He should be ashamed of himself for the part he played. In the bigger picture, he would be much better off, and I'm sure he would feel much better, to cleanse his soul by apologizing to the American public; in particular the families of those that didn't come home.These are my feelings, but I won't get the luxury of having them broadcast by "Encore" cable TV. What I will get the luxury of is going to bed at night with a clean conscience. Can McNamara do that? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Banality of Evil, Part 2'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once read Adolf Eichmann's capacity to engineer The Holocaust described as 'The Banality of Evil' and that pretty much sums up other soulless, high-level bureaucrats like McNamara and Rumsfeld, as well. They effortlessly block out the horrendous nature of what they've been tasked to do by the rationalization of how brilliant and efficient they were, even if that brilliance and efficiency causes the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.The mere fact that McNamara, to this day, loves to continue talking and dwelling on his life's 'accomplishments' as a source of pride is a textbook study on the psychology of how anyone, no matter how supposedly brilliant, can rationalize what are otherwise despicable acts.And just like a high-ranking Nazi war criminal, McNamara is quite clever and does a good job of trying to convince the viewer that he's somewhat repentant of what he's done, but it's readily apparent that his real agenda in making this documentary is to make sure everyone knows what a clever bastard he was throughout his life in whatever he was instructed to do. It's this 'brilliance' that is his ultimate absolution for the consequences of his actions.This is the real reason he stuck it out with Johnson, even though he claims to have disagreed with his policies. Had McNamara even an ounce of conscious, he would have quit immediately when Johnson began the Vietnam escalation but he just couldn't bring himself to believe that anyone else could do as good a job of prosecuting the war. Likely as not, Rumsfeld will make the same claim years from now.It's astonishing how similar McNamara is to Donald Rumsfeld in virtually every aspect. I guess we'll have to wait another thirty odd years or so to watch 'The Banality of Evil, Part 3', when Donald Rumsfeld makes his attempt at getting people to believe he's repentant for what will surely be judged as equally (if not more) catastrophic-as-Vietnam 'Iraq experience'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swimming in a Fluid Context (Cambodia?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone should see this, if only to transcend the myth of absolute morality. This is no Kissinger or Bush, but an intelligent and reflective man who truly wants to understand his context. Both he and the filmmaker are experienced at bending reality around them to make sense.Everyone lives in their own movie. Some strong people can convince others to adopt their movie, which is what much of religion/politics has become today. McNamara is a master at getting others to adopt his movie, but he never was adept at building a complex internal narrative himself.Now, late in life, he's interested in finding out what such composition is all about. He was able to escape this need when entering Ford. All he had to do was absorb the "movie" of the relevant world and master it. In the business world, there already was a well-formed narrative, that one invented by Wall Street financiers that involved certain metrics and calculations. This was absorbed and mastered by Mac with little effort: all went into imposing it on those at Ford who by all accounts had no sense or narrative.The point is that he could sell a "story" derived from the greater story of the context. All his methods (get the facts and so on) pertain to these two tasks. The substance of this documentary is the battle between two narratives to impose a story on events that seemingly had none. Nothing wrong with that; that's how history is invented. But we get to see a struggle here between two strong minds, each rooted in a different context.And I have to reluctantly say I'm on the side of the war criminal. The filmmaker has the consensus of the people on his side: Vietnam was a misguided mess base largely on an imagined threat and involving lies to the populace. It was more costly than any war in US history excepting the Civil war in terms of what it prevented from being addressed. Under Nixon, it formed the basis for large-scale mistrust of government which dominates today.The lies, imagined threat, mistrust and opportunity cost are the "truth" of the day, as solid as any and that's why the lessons of Vietnam are thrown at the current situation in Iraq. The filmmaker also has control over the images and the way the whole thing is presented. By all rights, he should win.Mac has reflection on his side. Yes, he participated in the events: we get all sorts of qualifying background here: Lemay, firebombing, Ford, Kennedy. In that day, he was warrior of the narrative, what would later be known as "spin" and "on message." But he's not that now. Now he is not a seller of the movie but an inventor, rather a reinventor. No historical figure has gone to as much effort to understand the context of their important prior actions. He's met the Russians, the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the Cubans. Instead of explaining away their "movies" he's adapted his own. He's clearly doubting his own rock.Between these two approaches to narrative: the filmmaker's certainty and Mac's certain uncertainty, both struggle for control over the movie we see. Mac wins. All history becomes fluid.There's a much quoted utterance here where he says if the US had lost the war, he would be tried as a criminal. Quoters of that impose their own truth on it and focus on the "war criminal" part. But the other half is by far more interesting and complex: the winners create the narrative, the history, the movie.The real wiz kids both live in their own movie and question it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

It would have been much more interesting to hear more voices balancing McNamara. They were certainly available. At any rate, this documentary seemed overrated. Some useful insights, but far from a major achievement. Some reviews said liberals and conservatives alike would find things to be enraged about, but we didn't find it interesting enough to be even a little angry, much less enraged.

		<shortDescription>Rewriting of History at its Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert McNamara was deceptive and cunning back in the 1960's, and he has not changed one bit. While I think Mr. Morris is a fine filmmaker and this film is worth watching for technique, Mr. Morris allowed McNamara a podium to rewrite history without challenge. In that way, this film is a failure and shows that Mr. Morris is not capable of rigorous, investigative reporting. McNamara at one point in the film says that whenever he went before the press, he never answered the question asked but rather answered the question he wished was asked. He does the same in this film and Mr. Morris allows him to get away with it. McNamara controls the moment and rewrites history to suit his needs. Anyone who lived through the years when he was Secretary of Defense knows that he personally lied constantly to the American people and he was, and is, guilty of war crimes (at least he admits to this point). As such, this documentary is a shameful attempt to seek forgiveness and is just another lie on the part of someone who wants us to believe that he was a peacemaker, when in fact he was a contemptuous war criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered down confession of a war criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hooray for Robert McNamara! As the Grim Reaper gets ever closer to calling his number, former defense secretary and mass murderer Robert McNamara sits down in front of a camera and admits he could be considered a war criminal. Maybe a war criminal? Here's a news flash for you, Mac, you are a war criminal. There is nothing fantastic or enlightening about Robert McNamara confessing to war crimes. Gee, if only Henry Kissinger would feel a little guilty when he undertips a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant. McNamara can do all the documentary pseudo-confessions he wants but the gates of hell are opening up nice and wide just for him. If he really wants to purge his sins, it's going to take more than a half-hearted I might have goofed; perhaps a thousand-mile trek carrying Kissinger's head on a pike before prostrating himself on a Cambodian killing field, or maybe on top of some leftover ordnance in Vietnam, or perhaps he could set himself on fire like a Buddhist monk or that silly Mormon. If McNamara is seeking some form of redemption with this postgame mewling, he fell way short of the mark.Aside from the above complaint, this documentary is also kind of boring. I give it a three out of ten because at least McNamara owned up to something, though not nearly enough, while Henry Kissinger still walks the streets with his goodies intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, disturbing portrayal of American foreign policy's pseudo thoughtfulness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember when I last saw anything as chilling as this great documentary... maybe the original 1988 version of The Vanishing, which equally left one profoundly disturbed at how studied and artful yet gratuitous and without any ultimate meaning or purpose the genesis of certain evil is.The lifetime analytical/"intellectual" opus of McNamara, on behalf of the US government, as portrayed in the records shown on the Fog of War, is eerily reminiscent of those obsessive Nazi written orders and documents that we see in WW2 documentaries. Everything counted and tabulated, percentualised and extrapolated. Such infinite trouble and such enormous pains taken, such an exemplary work ethic shown, such savage analysis and documentation undertaken... and all for what, other than the pursuit of goals actually lying between pure amorality and utter immorality?It's understandable and thereby tolerable that one - nation state or individual - should fall into unforgivable amorality or immorality by default, by sloth, out of disorganisation, cluelessness or personal weakness. But to somehow achieve as output an utter darkness of spirit after such effort, study and personal severity is devastatingly eerie, perverse and perplexing.McNamara does have a momentary tear in his eye as he recounts his decades of power across several utterly brutal wars, and it is for Jack Kennedy and his final Arlington resting place. Ultimately, he can be summed up via the school-captain smirk he wears standing next to Kennedy as he announces his appointment as Secretary of State in 1961. Power for the sake of power, success for the sake of success, any claims made to morality and right as meaningless as they are irrelevant. The man a perfect reflection of his country post war. Macchiavelli would consider himself surpassed.These are conclusions that someone, ethically sensitive but not at all prejudiced here (indeed barely knowing anything about this man), can reach here just by viewing what is effectively a documentary self-portrait. Director Errol Morris' genius consists in having allowed McNamara to reveal himself so eerily and damningly even while being given free use of a stage to lay out a grand sophistry of reflections, rationalizations and truisms to justify or expiate his lifetime's work.Quite an unforgettable experience, and multiply so because so unexpectedly and improbably given the self-portrait format. Phillip Glass' own genius should be acknowledged, as well as Morris' brilliance in exploiting it in The Fog of War, with eerie minimalism the perfect soundtrack here as in The Thin Blue Line 15 years earlier.We may not quite have plumbed the depths of gut-emptying futility and Shakespearean despair with this documentary X-Ray of McNamara, but we are close. I can only think of Henry Kissinger, Richard Perle and a few of the latter's soul mates as subjects that could supply an even more devastating moral experience and take us to rock bottom itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sickening rationalization of irresponsible decisions that irrevocably transformed the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a member of an 8th Air Force B-17 bomber crew who served under Curtis LeMay and bunked in the same Nissen hut as a lead crew navigator with LeMay in the right seat, I saw young men like myself die in bunches of 100 at a time and survived against all odds with the firm conviction that never again would the political leaders of the world's major nations be so stupid as to take their people into war again. God, how naive and wrong could one possibly be? And so I have watched with dismay and anger the mistakes of the heads of state on all sides have made again and again beginning with Korea.I also was a student at Cal Berkeley at the same time both Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk were there and I'm not buying this crap that they were just trying to do the best they could to serve the objectives and desires of their Presidents. By all accounts, both JFK and LBJ were in awe of McNamara's intellectual powers, which, in retrospect turned out to be superficially brittle at best. Rusk, on the other hand, was plainly out of his depth and apparently knew it because he protected himself by keeping his mouth shut and going with the flow.McNamara would have us believe that he just didn't know anything about Vietnam's centuries old struggle with China; Rusk, ever the speechless Buddah, just wasn't talking, although his education and war service in Asia should have given him a clue. So if neither man had any knowledge of Vietnam's history, they were just about the only academics at Berkeley, which then as now, because of its position on the eastern Pacific rim, was focused on the the Orient. And at post-war Berkeley, the phenomenon of Titoism was a matter of daily discussion.Our Presidents get the glory and the blame for our nation's successes and failures, but, really, they are just figure-heads, political animals who are isolated from the real world by the nature of the institution and must depend heavily on the advice of people like McNamara and Rusk. And if McNamara didn't know this before, he surely knew it by the time this fascinating documentary was filmed. The blood of millions of innocent people is on McNamara's hands, and photographer and director of this film have most eloquently captured his awareness of his guilt. He sure had a lot of chutzpah to try and sell his "I just didn't understand" nonsense to the obviously disbelieving but nonetheless polite Vietnamese survivors of his former arrogance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as intelligent, true and straightforward- but inventive- as documentaries come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog of War, one of the best film of 2003, is because of the chances that Errol Morris takes with filming his subject, former defense secretary Robert McNamara, combined with the countless images either in montage or slow-motion or brief archival footage mode. It's an assembly of very insightful, if (of course) not altogether the whole truth and nothing but, interview clips by letting the viewer into the way of thinking of this man who became apart and witness to World War 2, Cuba and Vietnam conflicts. It would be one thing to just have a simple sit-down interview with the man and his total life and career choices and the like. But just right in the way Morris films McNamara you know you're getting something different. He is shown (practically) going on in his sharp, raspy 80-something voiced monologues, and he is always looking at the viewer into the camera. It's something a little better than a trick, as it's a special camera set-up where the viewer is given a more personalized take on the subject looking right on. It's left up to the viewer, then, to decide how much is real reflections and honest accounts, or maybe not.It's amazing to see such a man as McNamara go on- holding a great interest- in the cross-sections of his life, which was never planned but taken in stride for better and for lesser times. McNamara's tips, or 'lessons' as they are sectioned off in the film, range from delivering hard facts and even poignant touches. And there are so many lessons that come through the film, not just in the overall point of each segment but in the little marks of knowledge about the nature of mass warfare, conflicting with the other side (and the possible empathy needed for it), that sometimes one not living around in that time of McNamara in the white house may wonder how he grew to be disliked in the press and public. Of course, even McNamara has to say "there are some things I can't talk about", and once this is understood what information is given is presented in a very nifty way. Sometimes even still images showing McNamara listening or talking to his Presidents speak many words. The symbolism is great, too, as dominoes fall, or reverse.The Fog of War succeeds so well in presenting McNamara's reflections and stories and accounts, it even borders on being emotional, or having at least a sentiment (not sentimentality) about the many errors in human judgment in times of crisis. When he talks of people who were rather flawed like Curtis Le May, it's with a kind of logic though that measures out the wrong with what was at least considered right. The morals of men under pressure are a big component in the film, and as the Vietnam section rolls along- and a lesson learned from the Cuba crisis is left by the wayside- it becomes as close to shocking as the PG-13 film could get. For all of the mistakes or faults in judgment or of the dreaded uncertain times McNamara found himself in with those around him, there was good accomplished as well, if for the future to see. One of the best moments in the film is when the former defense man tells of a meeting he had in 1995 with an old Vietnam leader, who has to set the record straight for him to understand the real core of conflict. Such moments have a haunting resonance that also acts in other sections of the film.That all of the stories are fascinating, and then wrapped in this expertly edited style of old clips (as well as ultra-rare audio tapes from inside the white house) with Phillip Glass's better than usual score, only adds to its appeal. It's straightforward in that it is quite the subjective document and testimony, but it's also a unique film for how it pushes into demanding its audience be smart enough to grasp all that McNamara, and Morris, have in mind. It's the kind of film, too, that I watch almost any time it's on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a sort of grunt's-eye view of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting documentary precisely because it makes so little effort to put McNamara's actions in a larger historical context. We catch glimpses of the world's opinion of McNamara in MTV-fast clips from newspapers, but mainly this is McNamara in his own words. He is thoughtful and quite bright, but even though he was an architect of a war, in a way his is the soldier's view of battle. In a way the soldier only sees a portion of the battle, McNamara gives us a very specific view of history. He is an intriguing character, interested in the complexities and ambiguities of action, admitting at one point that he could be realistically considered a war criminal but often skirting responsibility for his decisions. He comes across not as duplicitous but as simply limited to a view of the world informed by his particular place in it, which is true of most of us. A documentary about McNamara could have shown other viewpoints and given a very different perspective on the man, but it's fascinating to just hear this one intelligent if biased perspective.Morris does a better job than usual of staying out of his own film's way. I have always found him intolerably gimmicky, but here his restless editing actually works, and for once I even like a Philip Glass score, which helps the film sustain its melancholy tone. This is not to say that I didn't get sick of his endless slow motion shots of historical incidents or didn't wish he would display press clippings at a speed where I could actually read them all, but overall the film is very effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call Errol Morris's mind-blowing documentary as expressing one war mastermind's attempt to make peace with his soul, or a revelation of historically shocking facts that's bound to bring the audience to reassess the meaning of wars and the role of nuclear weapons in international politics. It documents Robert McNamara's dialogue, exposing a once successful auto-industrial businessman who then ran the largest U.S. bureaucracy and made defense policies in the nation's capital. Philip Glass' musical scores stirs up the same contemplative and atmospheric moods in this film the way his composition did for "The Hours.' Through a series of seeming ?interrogations', the former U.S. Secretary of Defense presents 11 lessons, from his life, to allow the audience to weigh the possibility of ?side effects' and unexpected consequences that could have resulted from war confrontations. He cautions that deadly catastrophic blunders had almost occurred during America's wars with Japan, Vietnam and Cuba. According to McNamara, conventional wars cost lives - sometimes thousands of lives. But if mistakes were to effect decisions on the use of nuclear forces, they would bring about the destruction of whole societies. Quoting the famous Clausewitzian perspective of `the fog of war', McNamara explains that `war is so complex, the application of military power is so complex, that the human mind is incapable of controlling all the variables.' He also stresses that an honest military commander should recognize his mistakes as he has killed people, but that the learning period for any military commander would fail to exist with nuclear weapons. It's truly eerie for me to hear that the risk of uncertainties obviously does exist.It's hard for me to imagine how close Cuba came to be completely eradicated from the globe, or to picture the mass death toll in both Japan and Vietnam. It is also difficult to for me to think of the burning of Tokyo, or listen to the story of Norman Morrison, a Quaker, who torched himself (but threw his infant child to safety) outside McNamara's office. Whoa, who knows? What I witnessed on screen could well prophesize the current Iraqi War situation. Yep, this uncanny film documents McNamara's personal account of the hidden chapters of America's war involvement from WW II to the 1960s. It's a window to assessing whether we can continue to believe that our elected leaders were/are accurate in their determination of other nations' prerogative affairs? Were/Are they justified in tampering with other nations' aspirations? What is the audience supposed to see as wartime atrocities? Will history repeat itself? This is definitely an important and unforgettable documentary to watch. Whatever opinion is achieved from Director Morris' thought-provoking film, I'd say it does open up its door to some very important discussions about contemporary and future wars. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vietnam was a holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the film McNamara said 3.4 million Vietnamese dead. Now that is a holocaust. I learned in my freshman year of college 1967-68 at a debate between an English professor and the schools Reserve Officer Training Corp commander that Vietnam was to be reunited through national elections in 1956 after the Vietnamese defeated the French who were trying to regain their colonies after WW II. We supported the collaborators in the country in not holding elections because they would have been soundly defeated. Also, I learned that the Vietnamese and the Chinese had fought for centuries and the Vietnamese wanted independence. If I leaned this how come McNamara and the cabinet did not know this? The answer is that of course they knew this. It is disingenuous for McNamara to have acted surprised when in 1995 the Vietnamese told him this. The reason we went to war then and many times before and afterwards are because of arrogance and hubris. And because we could. We have weaponry that can devastate countries.At the end of the film McNamara looked like an old NAZI with his cross of freedom earned serving the interests of power. Indeed he would be considered a war criminal not only for his involvement in Japan in WW II but also for his involvement in Vietnam. When he talks about human nature ? I don't think he needs to be concerned about the human nature of average Americans or others but of the arrogance of leaders that are intoxicated with power. If you have seen the Vietnam War memorial in Washington. And have walked from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol then consider - if McNamara' estimate of 3.4 million Vietnamese dead is correct then and we put their names on a wall - the wall would be nearly 60 times longer then the present wall and would extend from the Lincoln memorial to the capitol building and back again. Now that is a holocaust. Similar to the Germans if we do not admit the holocaust we will repeat it and we are in Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another distinctive masterwork from Morris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Errol Morris has always been fascinated with characters that make excuses for their past offences. In Mr. Death, he pointed his famous, intimacy-capturing Interratron camera at a specialist in capital punishment who was trying to construct the kinder, gentler electric chair before he was unknowingly duped by hubris-exploiting white supremacists into proving-in his mind and theirs-that the Jewish Holocaust never happened. What makes The Fog of War so amazing, and so perfect for our times, is the fact that it sympathetically examines Robert S. McNamara, leader of a World War II raid on Tokyo that killed 100,000 people, the man who claims that he introduced safety features like seat belts to the Ford Motor company (even though it was probably the eventually-crushed Preston Tucker who did this), and was the often hawkish Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations (and therefore both advised on the saving of the world during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the destruction of it during the Vietnam War). Morris unerringly points his camera at a man who, at the end of his life, is making a serious reevaluation of his world-changing actions, and is sincerely worried, moved to think, that he may have made the wrong choices.In this way, it makes a perfect companion piece to many of the films at the New York Film Festival this year. Richard Pena, the festival's programmer, is known to make his politics obvious in his and his jury's choices, and this year, in the midst of this country's and, unfortunately, his world's often dubious moral selections, he is wondering if the paths we are taking are the correct ones. Over and over again, particularly in the movies that I chose to see at the festival, is seems that the theme is `We better think, and think hard, about what we are doing, because it is just that which will determine what we will do in the future' Of course, this isn't all up to Pena-it's obviously a theme the filmmakers are they themselves coming to. We are on the verge of a new era in moviemaking, and the concerns of it are before us in these works at the 41st New York Film Festival. Morris' The Fog of War made me realize this.At the press conference after the film, Morris stated that he began this film before the events of 9/11 visited us. He also admitted, when one journalist asked him if he liked Robert S. McNamara, that, yes, he did indeed like him, amazingly, even though Morris actively demonstrated against his policies during the 1960s. If anything proves the remittable side of truly progressive minds, this does. Here, on film, is forgiveness towards a once apparently inhuman human that, at one point, from the filmmaker's perspective, seemed impossible to achieve. The Fog of War is a document of understanding, of compassion, of repentance, reflection and humanism. Edited with quicksilver style, scored with Philip Glass' unmistakable tonal existential dread, and photographed with peculiar beauty (Morris admitted some of his favorite shots of the film involve padded skulls being dropped from great heights, all in the service of illustrating McNamara's obsession with greater car safety), it's a masterpiece just as are the rest of Morris' career works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't quite understand the high rating for this film. It felt very ordinary to me.McNamara is obviously a bright guy and leaves one hopeful that old age does not always cause a reduction in ones mental faculties. (Or, alternatively, that if you start out with a whole big lot of mental faculties, you're still gonna seem smart at 85, even if you've lost some.) Other than that inadvertent point, however, the documentary doesn't really tell a reasonably well-informed viewer much that one doesn't already know. McNamara is wise enough to recognize that he had an important role in the Vietnam debacle, but canny enough not to volunteer to take on more responsibility than he can comfortably shoulder. His conversations have the feel of having been well-honed in many an academic debate and cocktail-party social hour. Nothing too gruesome, nothing too righteous and always willing to acknowledge (with a genial smile) the possibility that he is wrong.The frustration is that McNamara refuses to engage in any discussion of the moral/personal issues raised by his actions and that the interviewer lets McNamara get away with this refusal. Ultimately, therefore, the film sometimes feels like little more than an "insider-y" history of the war, narrated by a sort of "war celebrity." Ultimately, what's the point? I suppose McNamara has the right to keep his own counsel as to his personal feelings (and as to what was going on with his family -- he hints at all sorts of problems, including a FIRM assertion that all of his family benefited from his move into government...that just cries out that the opposite was the case) but if he's not going to open up, what we're left with feels like something one could have read more quickly in a magazine article.The other problem with the film is that it ends up feeling both over-edited and padded with endless clips of bombs falling and meaningless close-up shots of tiny bits of text ("houses destroyed", "troop strength", "warmonger" etc. etc.) that are clearly there just to add color, with no real value of their own. The interview feels stretched-out and the "11 lessons" feel forced into the film as a pretty arbitrary framing device...they certainly weren't part of McNamara's thinking and they don't really help organize the material.Still, this isn't a complete waste of time. McNamara is an engaging speaker and it is interesting to hear some of the thought processes of one of the "best and brightest" who has run large parts of US policy for a long time. But the film stops well short of being great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no desire to see this movie, as I thought I would be bored to tears listening to Robert McNamara talking AGAIN about Vietnam, and what went wrong, blah, blah, blah. But, the reviews were so incredibly positive, that I thought I'd give it a shot. Regrettably, it was exactly as I figured it would be. Perhaps if we could look at Shu Qi's face in close up for an hour instead of Robert McNamara's, maybe I would have enjoyed it more.I am in no way an expert on Vietnam or the Cuban Missile Crisis, but this added very little to my knowledge of either event. How this film beat "Capturing the Friedmans" for the Oscar for best documentary is completely beyond me. Would work as a long-form piece on CNN, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War, Peace And Robert McNamara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few figures of recent American history will be as controversial as Robert McNamara. Secretary Of Defense under both President Kennedy and President Johnson from 1961-1968, he played key roles both during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and in the lead up to and conduct of the Vietnam War during that period. McNamara, who died in 2009, was the subject of Errol Morris' 2003 documentary The Fog Of War which itself recently had its own tenth anniversary.Partly that's because of its subject matter. Largely because of the controversy around him and his long silence about his role in the Vietnam War, McNamara himself is a fascinating figure. Outside of his 1995 book In Retrospect, this may very well be the most candid McNamara ever was about his life and in particular about his time as Secretary Of Defense. Thanks to Morris' interrotron technique, McNamara often seems to be looking right into the eyes of the viewer and the vice versa is true as well. The result is that this portrait of him is given even more power, especially when he talks about helping pick out the site where JFK is buried where you can see his eyes watering or his eyes light up in the rare moments of humor. McNamara also proves he can own up (as it were) to some of the more questionable events he took part in and even downright mistakes such as the firebombing of Japanese cities in World War II and the fundamental misunderstandings that led to increasing involvement in Vietnam. Yet, for every moment like that though, there are moments where one can't quite read him, especially when he becomes increasingly guarded about Vietnam and why he didn't speak out more against it after he left government. The results are often just as haunting as they are fascinating.McNamara himself though is just part of the documentary. Morris makes extensive use of archival material with some of the most outstanding being rarely heard recording of meetings and phone calls involving McNamara and the two President's he served under, especially in comparing the conflicting attitudes to the war in Vietnam expressed first by Kennedy in late 1963 and then Johnson just months after Kennedy's assassination. There is also a wealth of rarely seen documents as well, especially from McNamara's statistical work during World War II that leads to a haunting piece of animation of his handwritten numbers becoming the bombs dropped on Japanese cities. There is also a limited amount of reenactments as well, especially to illustrate the surreal but true way that skulls were dropped down a Cornell University stairwell in tests that led Ford to install seat-belts in their vehicles. Then there's the score of Phillip Glass which gives the entire proceeding a most haunting quality it might not have had otherwise. As a result, the more artistic elements of the documentary compliment the portrait of McNamara rather nicely.The heart of the film though is in its narrative structure, which is centered around eleven lessons Morris draws from McNamara's life. It is these lessons that make the film as timely as ever in a world that continues to be in a state of continuous conflict. McNamara's life and the events he relates are merely examples from how the Cuban Missile Crisis shows us that rationale people can be lead to the edge of irrational decisions (starting a nuclear war) to how the Gulf Of Tonkin incident is a prime example of how seemingly incontrovertible evidence can be wrong and lead to unimagined consequences. While these examples might be taken from decades and crisis' of the past, are every bit as applicable today as they were both in McNamara's time and when this was first released a decade ago.Despite being about events a half century or so ago, and being a decade ago itself, it remains a film as relevant today as it ever has been. On one hand, it presents a compelling portrait of McNamara and his role in some of the most important and controversial events of the last fifty years. On the other, it blends that portrait skillfully with artistic elements that make the lessons taken from that portrait all the more compelling. The results are haunting, fascinating and well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opportunity missed for McNamara to come clean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary that is disturbing and compelling in a Koyaanisqatsi "life out of balance" sort of way. Indeed, the haunting score was composed by Philip Glass. Filmmaker Morris takes the interrogation approach in his interview with McNamara, the infamous Foreign Secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and consequentially the guy in charge of the Vietnam War during the 1960's. A kind of "where were you on the night of . . . " that ends up being a forum for the former Secretary to discuss his "Eleven lessons" about warfare, wise advice that is almost surreal coming from the mouth of one who seems oblivious to his personal culpability during a very tragic part of American history. Essentially McNamara says that "we were dead wrong and thousands of people died as a result, but I was not personally responsible". He goes even further, suggesting at one point a commonality between the Vietnam protesters and himself! Very adept at reflecting the negative spotlight on other "notorious" figures of the military establishment (Curtis LeMay in particular), the ease with which he dispenses the difficult questions has the effect of sending that light out into space, essentially leaving the question shrouded in fog. McNamara still appears to be very much the same unrepentant, beaten "faith in numbers" man after Johnson fired him from his post. THE FOG OF WAR was an opportunity for McNamara to repent that was missed. On the plus side, McNamara's reflections on the Cuban missile crisis and his subsequent dialog with Castro are enlightening and scary. We are told during this film that the "FOG OF WAR" is where a leader during wartime finds oneself when the variables are too numerous to enumerate. Unfortunately, this documentary only thickens the fog. McNamara's eleven lessons: (1) empathize with your enemy, (2) rationality will not save us, (3) there's something beyond one's self, (4) maximize efficiency, (5) proportionality should be a guideline in war, (6) get the data, (7) belief and seeing are both often wrong, (8)be prepared to re-examine your reasoning, (9) in order to do good you may have to engage in evil, (10) never say never and (11) you can't change human nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the director's lesson, not McNamara's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake about this fine film: it is the director's show, not McNamara's, and Morris is in command of any "lessons" you may see. The one thing that stands out about McNamara is, surprisingly, his absolute indecision about the morality of his actions and the meaning of what he went through. Kennedy's secretary of state, his life trajectory, his decisions and point of view are Morris's object of study, serving two questions:1) Should we see wars as caused by "structural" economic and political conditions, necessary consequences of unpredictable chains of events involving millions of people - or are they essentially the product of the decision of a few men in power, who are therefore able to decide whether they happen or not?2) If the need to pursue victory is inseparable from war, how do we balance this pursuit - assuming one's intention in a war has moral content, and is not only meant for gain - with the morality that tells us to preserve human life (BESIDES the easy answer around "legality")?McNamara is actually of little help, though Morris extract his ideas from the secretary's speech. Bob says he can look back now and understand his historical role, but that is not what we see. Throughout the movie, you can't stop wondering: how can such a brilliant man, a genius in math, science of war, and allegedly also trained in philosophy, be so clueless, so unable to give us a consistent vision on the history he helped make and is so interested on? Because military men only know how to win battles; good civilian leaders are the ones that may better choose a general course of action, but interpreting the war is just not for either group, but for thinkers.Morris's answer to both questions is the "Fog": the decisions a few men take can actually make all the difference, but they simply cannot understand adequately, while terrible events are happening, the repercussions of what they do. They do not have enough information nor the capacity to analyze it. 90% of the consequences of wars (and of not going to war) will therefore be "unintended" by those who made it.As for the moral problem, the answer is just as pessimistic: you will almost never be able to keep a war within predetermined boundaries of humanity, no matter how much you legislate. When "thou shalt not kill" is revoked, you will not be able to maintain other restrictions.Morris intentionally left out the question of whether wars can be fair or justifiable, and when. That is up to your convictions. But what the movie intents to show is that whatever your position is, if want the best for mankind you have to take into consideration the cognitive and moral Fog intrinsic to wars. I would add just a couple of less important comments: first, as I watched the movie I was thinking about how you would compare McNamara to Kissinger, who was in a sense more "qualified" for the job of chief warmonger, being trained in political science. Kissinger was a man that knew very well what Morris is trying to show in this film, and answered them (in practice, of course, not in theory) by 1) teaching the US government to act indirectly, letting others take the unintended consequences and 2) submitting morality to American interest ultimately, but making sure you can withhold (or distort) the least moral part of your actions, by antecipating his society's moral expectations.It is our task, now, to try and see the current wars the U.S. is pursuing in the light of these reflections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting study of a conflicted man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be quite interesting. I would rate it an 8/10 as documentaries go. The file footage added greatly to the commentary. The problem with that is that film makers do not always use footage actually shot with the action being discussed. That can distort the viewer's image of what actually occurred.This is not my favorite style of documentary (I prefer those shot in real time such as "Hoop Dreams" because I know the film maker at least had the opportunity to shoot the scenes as they actually occurred. That doesn't mean the director will use the film honestly, however.), but in this case that was not an option. It was, however, a real documentary as opposed to the current crop of movies that are shot in documentary style and, not only get released as true documentaries, but receive awards as well. Oliver Stone's movie, "JFK", was fiction, but at least he didn't call it a documentary. End of Rant!!!I believe that McNamara was being pretty open. The 11 lessons (Supplied by Morris) issue troubles me, because it makes me wonder what else might have come from the director rather than McNamara. However, since I lived through most of what was shown in the movie, I know that it was pretty faithful to the facts, at least as we know them.McNamara seemed almost to be viewing two parallel wars in the WW2 segment. He said that he agreed with Curtis LeMay that the war had to be won and, in a war that killed tens of millions of people, it had to be ended as quickly as possible and that meant killing a lot of people. And yet, when LeMay faced up to the reality of such a war and killed 100,000 people in Tokyo, McNamara starts talking about proportionality. In a war that kills tens of millions of people all over the world, what can proportionality possibly mean? McNamara seemed quite proud of his role in improving the efficiency of the military but then tries to distance himself from the resulting deaths.Again, referring to Vietnam, McNamara is very conflicted. He criticizes the war, but at the end says Johnson did what he had to do. He seems to distance himself from the brutality even though he was Sec. of Defense for almost two full terms. McNamara is a man who never lived up to his potential and seems to be trying to make up for it by advising current leaders to do what he did not do when it counted. That's pretty chicken. He cannot seem to come to grips with the fact that it's the decisions we make when they count, not the ones we make in retrospect, that we have to live with.Comments inspired by other reviewers:The 11 lessons: I viewed the DVD and in the supplementary scenes McNamara says that the 11 lessons were not his. They were imposed by the director. He then gave his own 10 lessons that fit what he said much better. So, it appeared that the director made some unapproved changes, but tried to make up for it by letting McNamara respond in supplementary. Theater viewers would not have seen that.Would Kennedy have pulled out? He said that Kennedy intended to pull out of Vietnam before Diem was assassinated. That changed everything. Most 'experts' on JFK say that there was no evidence that he would have pulled out.The fact the domino effect was not seen in the late '70s does not mean it would not have in the '60s had we not intervened. Communism was expanding all over the world in the '60s. By the time we left Vietnam it was not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons from our former Lord and Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unlikely there will be another film like this one. Robert McNamara was many things, but luckily for us, he was, in the end, an academic with a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, ethics and truth. Even at 85, he is still questioning and examining his life. And, best of all, he doesn't talk down to the audience like little children. He lays out how war happens, how war is cruelty, how war is confusion, and how little "the people" matter to these men of power. In McNamara's view, no matter how rational human beings may be, human nature has a final frontier to explore: not space, but its own destruction.Morris gets quite a story out of McNamara. McNamara admits he's a war criminal for the Tokyo fire bombings, but not Vietnam. Curtis LeMay wanted to start a nuclear war with Cuba and Russia simply because America was ahead in the nuclear arms race. But the lesson, "empathize with your enemy," saved the US from nuclear war with Russia and Cuba. "Belief and seeing are often wrong," as our leaders try to grapple with the complexity of the fog of war. In a nuclear war, there is no room for error, but the fog of war guarantees error.McNamara is willing to confront his mistakes. He meets Castro in the 1990s and learns that Castro was willing to commit suicide for himself and his nation, just for the chance to take out 90 million Americans. McNamara meets the Vietnamese high command 20 years after the end of the war, and finally understands that no amount of bombing ever would have led to their surrender.Vietnam anti-war protests had no effect on McNamara or his superiors. They have such contempt for popular opinion, they hide the start of the Vietnam War by publishing the news release at night, so it won't make the morning editions of the paper. They never answer reporters questions, they answer imaginary questions they wished they had been asked.You will need to have a strong understanding of post-WWII history just to watch this film. It is an advanced course for students and participants of this period.Unfortunately, Fog of War does not answer every question. Morris adds an epilogue to the film, where McNamara states he will not discuss certain issues. It is Morris's way of saying, I tried my best, but this is all McNamara would give me. What Morris did get is incredible to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Genius, Modern Machiavelli - Morris holds up the mirror and his camera gets the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>McNamara relates his complex reasoning for his actions, within the context of the day. Whether that context is flawed, and whether he is ultimately part of the machinations of war or its creator (which is doubtful) this film does not let him off the hook in giving us a clear picture of the flawed logic that brought us the Vietnam War. Some may wish that Morris guided the discourse during the filming or in the editing process - but that would have produced a flawed film, full of bias, and out of character with Morris' body of work. Exceptional lesson in history that requires further reading or additional films to paint the full picture of the war for audiences under 40 or 35, to avoid the broad stroke efforts of the right to gloss over the failures of the war as has seeped into the History Channel or VH1 version documentaries on the subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant haunting evocative look at McNamara's life and tortures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We helped choose the title of this movie in a Morris questionnaire at an advance screening at Brown U. in 2002. My title was "The Wars of Robert McNamara", since it is about his inner travail and guilt even at the murderous bombing raids of Japan, where we were killing 50-100,000 a pop in the 1000 plane firebomb raids for the last 8 months. I remember seeing the statistics and being stunned- Americans had become scientists of death. The title "Fog of War" is pretty hackneyed. The movie is a brilliant haunting evocative look at McNamara's life and tortures in the powerful positions he held. The most moving stuff is his deep qualms about the murderous raids on Japan, which he planned as Curtis LeMay's deputy. Most stunning was his revelations about the near end of the world in the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Cubans actually had 162 live nuclear warheads on the island, and Castro's recommendation was to USE THEM if we invaded. Everything the US did was based on our belief that they had NONE. I actually heard that a few days earlier from McNamara himself, at a concurrent conference on the Missile Crisis, and questioned him after (http://hammernews.com/mcnamara.ram). It was a stunning revelation, like being punched in the stomach, since I'd done several big articles on the threat of nuclear war.McNamara is still smart, wily, and unwilling to be forced into any unwanted admission. He does show sorrow and pain at the results of his actions in Vietnam, and Morris's expert merging of historical audio show Mac and Kennedy were advocating withdrawal as far back as 1963. A fascinating character study, an important historical document, and a slick merging of media, music, man, and movie.Michael Hammerschlag</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Lessons From Robert McNamara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways a simple "talking head" documentary - a lot of it is Robert McNamara (U.S. Secretary of Defence in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and therefore during a good part of the Vietnam War) simply answering questions. It's also combined with some good archival footage of some of the significant events of his lifetime, however, and it isn't exactly what you might expect it to be.I expected it to be largely a justification of McNamara's policies and actions regarding Vietnam, but it's more than that. Essentially McNamara takes his many life experiences - not only as Defence Secretary, but as an army officer during World War II, a professor at Harvard, President of Ford Motor Company, and Head of the World Bank - and develops from them eleven life lessons that he shares. Vietnam is a part of that mix, of course, but isn't really dealt with at length until the last half hour or so of the documentary, and he neither justifies nor admits to guilt about anything - at least not about Vietnam. At the end of the story (in a portion subtitled "Epilogue") McNamara is essentially given the chance to offer judgment on his Vietnam policies but declines, saying simply that he knows things we don't know, and he'd prefer it to remain that way. Fair enough. My impression is that if he were to respond to the question of whether he felt any guilt, he'd say "no. I did what I thought was right at the time." The eleven life lessons are largely common sense ones, and I don't think it's necessary to list them. The film can be watched to find out about them. One that did strike me, though, was "in order to do good, sometimes you have to engage in evil." This, of course, runs counter to the thought which is probably pre-eminent in society that "two wrongs don't make a right," and instead promotes "the ends justify the means" thinking. A couple of other statements McNamara made that stuck with me were his honest admission that, if Japan had won World War II, he and Curtis LeMay would probably have been tried as war criminals for planning the fire bombing of Japanese cities (actually, he goes so far as to say that they were war criminals) and his belief that had Kennedy not been assassinated, the United States wouldn't have become as deeply involved in Vietnam as it did under Johnson.It's an interesting documentary which offers a personal look at McNamara and his thoughts rather than just an assessment of his role in Vietnam. Well worth watching. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What about this film is important? The lessons referred to in the title. This is not a film about Robert S. McNamara, though he is the film's worthy vehicle, subject, and protagonist. Rather, it is a retrospective piece which opens up and refuses to answer some fundamental and profound questions about human nature, violence, politics, and leadership, among other grand topics.Why isn't McNamara himself important? He is! And he was! And he will likely continue to be. But McNamara is, at this point, just an old, and accomplished man, who happens to have been a national leader, a businessman, a soldier, and a family-man. His name has been a household word for politically engaged families in the USA for more than 40 years, as he served as Minister of Defense during some of the United States' most controversial administrations and was, during that time, often painted as the architect of the Viet Nam War. But this is not the point! McNamara tells a story played out by people in every walk of life, at every level of power and in every place and culture on earth over and over again - exemplifying the 11 (and more) lessons identified in the title. Fortunately for the viewer, McNamara is not only intelligent and lucid, but entirely straightforward and concise in his elucidation of the basic principles treated in this film. McNamara's importance as an historical figure only serves to strengthen the humanism of the film's subjects, as this very significant figure is portrayed as a a human-being, not an icon of political culture. How is this accomplished? The film-maker interviewed McNamara at length on film. This interview was then distilled (not really edited) into a very coherent and terse set of segments, occasionally interrupted by Philip Glass' wonderful soundtrack, stock footage from various wars and newsreels, and a couple of tastefully created reenacted scenes. McNamara's clear and intelligent prose is often juxtaposed to images that cast a different light on his comments than he might have intended, and, at even more often an elaboration or vivid illustration of his central points. Sure, the film is about the man's career, about the American political system, the U.S. military and about war, but its also about people struggling to make sense out of the political and social world around them, and that's where this film had its most profound impact on me. So, it's a propaganda film? Absolutely not. Though it is likely that the film-maker has an opinion, the film is far too subtle to effectively propagandize, and that opinion is not clearly articulated, nor even cleverly hidden in the imagery and sound. I believe the point this film-maker wants to make is best illustrated by his choice of releasing the film when the USA has committed lives and resources to causes that seem, at least in a broad sense, somewhat similar to those of Viet Nam. While I understand that this film remained a back-burner project for him over several years, the release date seems more than a coincidence. No matter what side of the fence you stand on in America's backyard of politics, this is a film you shouldn't miss. It will stimulate your mind, your memory, and your sympathies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Is Own Words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insider documentary of the life of former Defense Secretary of the United States Robert Strange McNamara. Who served under both the JFK &amp; LBJ administrations from 1961 to 1968 as well as being the president of the World Bank for thirteen years from 1968 to 1981. Robert McNamara candidly and honestly talks about his life and actions as a man of power in both the political and industrial world and about his life that began when he was born on June 9, 1916 in San Francisco Calif. Growing up during the Great Depression of the 1930's and early 40's McNamara became the youngest assistant professor in the history of Harvard. With the start of WWII and Americas entry into it in late 1941 he worked in the office of the US Army Statistical Control and was confronted with how to win the war in the Pacific with the use of air power. Getting to know Gen. Curtis LeMay of the USAAF McNamara and his team of statisticians together with Gen LeMay devised a plan for the massive B29 bombers, who were built to fly as high as 30,000 feet over their targets, to fly under 5,000 feet. Since Japans anti-aircraft defenses were destroyed to the point where they were almost non-existent at that time ,late 1944. The low flying tactic's of B-29's were used in order to be more accurate in dropping incendiary or fire bombs on Japan. The results were devastating with the giant and deadly B29's in just under ten months, from November 1944 to early August 1945, burning out as much as to 90% of 67 major Japanese cities and killing well over 600,000, some experts of WWII put the dead to be well over a million, Japanese civilians during that time. That's even before the dropping of the Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th 1945.McNamara says that talking with Gen. LeMay about the bombings of Japan that the general honestly told him that what he and McNamara did was enough to convict them as war criminals in an international court of law! Like the Germans and Japanese government and military officials were in the war crime trials in Nuremberg and Tokyo. The only difference between Gen. LeMay &amp; McNamara and the Germans &amp; Japanese was that they were on the winning side of the war and could not be called to answer for what they did by the defeated Axis powers.McNamara also brings out a shocking revelation about the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis in a talk he had with the Cuban President Fidel Castro in Havana in 1992. Castro told him that he had at that time, October 1962, on the Island of Cuba 162 Soviet Nuclear warheads that Soviet Premier Krushcheve had already placed there. With 94 of them that were already mounted on Soviet rockets ready to be launched and targeted for major US cities. At that time the US president John F. Kennedy thought that the Soviets rockets or missiles only had conventional warheads and that the "Nukes" were on their way to Cuba via the Red Navy which was blocked from entering the Island by the US Atlantic flee. In fact we were much closer to Nuclear Armageddon then we realized back then. The last half of the film is about Robert McNamara's involvement in the war in Vietnam. What really astounded me was how as early as October 2, 1963, less then two months before he was assassinated, Pres. Kennedy told McNamara that the war was not winnable and planed to totally withdraw US troops from South Vietnam, there were 16,000 there at that time, by Feb. 1965 after the 1964 election if he were re-elected. Even in his talks with Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson as early as Feb. 1964 the talk was that the war, like Pres. Kennedy said before, was a lost cause. Still LBJ and McNamara continued pushing it to the point where it ended up costing the US military over 60,000 dead and missing and over 350,000 wounded by the time the war ended for the US in Jan. 1973. With over 3.5 million Vietnamese lives, both from North and South Vietnam, by the time the Communist North Vietnamese captured Saigon on April 30-May 1, 1975. Getting all these personal insights and information from someone who had a lot to do with the conduct of the war in Vietnam as well as the planning for it like Robert McNamara is a real eye-opener. Hopefully we can learn like he did that the road to hell is paved with good intentions not all but, like in Vietnam, most of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One often wonders how can these government officers sleep at night, knowing full well that by their actions, thousands of innocent lives are at stake. How can anyone live with himself after finding out, as in the case of Mr. Robert S. McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense, he was wrong in the Viet Nam conflict?Errol Morris' riveting documentary about Robert S. McNamara is a lesson in American history. We get to know first hand as how this man from humble origins rose to be a figure of prominence in the Kennedy and Johnson's administrations. It speaks volumes that this man who was not into politics is picked by president Kennedy to head the Department of Defense at a time when Cuba almost brought the former USSR and the USA into an atomic holocaust.When comparing the reason for our involvement in Viet Nam with the present Iraq conflict, we can see parallels in both thinking. With Viet Nam it was the theory that if Viet Nam fell into communism, the rest of South East Asia would follow! History proved Lyndon Johnson and his set wrong in that one, but the jury is still out with the present reasoning about the Iraq war.Mr. McNamara is very candid in his assessment of his time in history. He tells us probably what we already know, not venturing with any other surprises that haven't been revealed before. At a point, he chokes and cries directly into the camera, and it is at that moment when we see him vulnerable that our hearts go to the man in front of us for we are seeing part of his soul bared in front of our eyes.Excellent historic documentary with a very interesting score by Phillip Glass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important film, but not a great one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Errol Morris, but I don't think this is one of his top efforts. While this film is full of interesting and thought provoking material, cinematically the film drags at points. Morris's artier interludes, with the use of simultaneous fast-motion and slow-motion photography and the jets of statistics edited together, fail to add anything to the movie, either in terms of content or style.Obviously, the access to McNamara and the archived tape recordings of conversations between the subject and Kennedy and Johnson are the bulk of the movie. However, despite the attempt to organize the movie via the 11 'lessons', the movie lacks a certain structure. I suppose it could be argued that this lack of clarity is equivalent to the lack of clarity that those in power had when dealing with Vietnam. But I expect Morris to clarify and remove the fog, so to speak. If anything, this movie felt like it was part of something that should have been much more comprehensive. Nevertheless, it is still a valuable look from the perspective of a major architect. Perhaps he is self-serving (or rather, it is highly likely that he is), but that is also illuminating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog of War is a great documentary because it has an intelligent subject and a wise filmmaker, who fearlessly tackles subjects that come stockpiled with burning questions. Director Errol Morris knows how to gear a discussion where he wants it to go, and utilizes the "Interrotron," which Wikipedia states is Morris' device where, "the image of each person's face is then projected onto a two-way mirror positioned in front of the lens of the other's camera. Instead of looking at a blank lens, then, both Morris and his subject are looking directly at a human face." In return, we get lively, crystal-clear picture quality and the subject often locks eyes with the audience members, showing a very personal relationship for the material at hand.The subject of the film is Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy administration and such events as the Bay of Pigs, the Tokyo bombing, and the Vietnam War. Basically, you can say McNamara was in charge of Defense during some of America's most trying, nerve-wracking times. Uncertainty plagued all officials, frustration loomed from world leaders, issues like Vietnam and civil rights left American citizens more divided than ever, and America seemed to be steered towards the calamity of nuclear war.McNamara and Kennedy were on the frontlines of political danger. McNamara recalls long, sometimes sleepless nights due to stress and indecisiveness on how to approach the war. He even states how meeting with world leaders was a strange process. At one point, it was said that Fidel Castro accepted the fact that the population of his country may plummet because of this war. It was as if he accepted that Cuba could be destroyed over this war. It is when McNamara discusses the bombing in Tokyo that killed thousands that it would be justifiable to try him and numerous other officials as war criminals.Having McNamara discuss the interworkings of his job and the stress and backlash every decision he made came with offers an emotional core to the film. I have a feeling the emotional relevance of documentaries is an unnoticed addition, but when it comes to down it, what you're hearing is a man who was criticized heavily during his days in office and now finally has the courage to speak for an extensive amount of time, in front of a camera, about his experiences as the Secretary of Defense. McNamara often tears up during the film, and this only adds to the idea he wants us to take away, which is the men behind these serious operations are indeed human.Furthermore, McNamara is an electric screen presence to say the least. In the film, he teaches us "lessons," eleven to be exact. They are short, concise sentences that help us understand the circumstances of war and the thought-process that guided him through the dark days of his time in office. Occasionally swayed on-topic by Morris, or directed by a strong question, McNamara speaks with the voice of a leader, rarely pauses, and always seems to have a response loaded up and ready to go. Late in the film, he states he answers every question he is asked with the answer to the question he wish was asked. Perhaps this justifies his quick-wit and immediate responses to every question.The strongest metaphor in the film involves a large array of dominoes scattered across a flat map. In slow-motion, Morris shows the collapsing dominoes with a beautiful blur-effect and thunderous sound. At the end, we see a slow-motion shot of the dominoes aligning back upwards to only be knocked down again sometime in the near future.The concluding points of The Fog of War are as followed: one is that politicians and political officials are human and aren't even totally sure of the moves they make. The second is that the idea of "the fog of war" is a real thing. It's the figurative mental cloud during a treacherous time that fogs your judgment and makes decision-making a hairy, difficult process. By the end of the film, McNamara clearly wants to finish talking. We can hear Morris ask trying questions such as the value and the gain of the Vietnam War on America's part and his personal opinion. McNamara ends the show by informing that he fears backlash if he were to answer these questions from either standpoint.Starring: Robert McNamara. Directed by: Errol Morris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Documentary, Creepy Intellectual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After spending an hour or so with an old man, a product of a important American university, a corporate player and a major decision maker in government policy, a man probably responsible for thousands of human deaths, one wonders why more of us have not been incinerated by bombs set loose by well-meaning madmen who are able to intellectualize and justify mass carnage with few second thoughts.This is an admirable slice of film-making, and while recognizing it's importance as a document, the ideas emanating from the human centerpiece didn't exactly thrill me; mass annihilation is not a particularly salubrious topic. This is a creepy, unsettling film about a man who learns quickly but whose messianic zeal is frightening. The film questions humanity's ability to learn from past mistakes and is seldom optimistic about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog of War (2003)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Oscar-winning documentary from Errol Morris takes a look at the career of Robert McNamara, which went from WWII to Ford to John F. Kennedy and up to Vietnam. Through an interview with McNamara and countless bits of audio and archival video footage, we go through nearly sixty-years worth of material as McNamara explains the reasonings behind various events. THE FOG OF WAR is an extremely well-made documentary and a lot of credit has to go to Morris for the way he structured the film. The mixture of the interview footage with the archival footage was perfectly done and I think both suit the other extremely well and help make this film so memorable. Just take a look at the emotional scene where McNamara talks about the Kenneddy assassination and how he helped find the plot for him to be buried. Just look at the way we see McNamara's emotion face and words and then how Morris puts a picture up of Kennedy. A very simple move but an emotional one that really works. McNamara was 85-years-old when the interview took place but you certainly wouldn't know it because it looks great and his mind is obviously still sharp and he talks a mile a minute and is so captivating with each and every word. Even if you hate McNamara and everything he stands for you really can't help but be drawn into him and it's easy to see why he could control so much. The way he speaks, the power in his voice, the way his messages are delivered are just so right on the mark that you can't help but take notice of everything he's saying. THE FOG OF WAR is certainly one of the most interesting documentaries out there and it's really an important piece of history especially considering how much McNamara was involved in.</fullReview>

This highly controversial, famously arrogant mover and shaker is surprisingly self-critical and wise in this interview. In so many ways that is what makes it powerful. There is nothing knee-jerk about his thoughts. He has spent a life time effecting the outcome of world events and then solemnly looking closely and objectively at them. The lessons he learned and shares with Erroll Morris are extremely relevant and powerful. A must see for anyone one with even a mild interest in history, politics and diplomacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary done with many elements of interest at hand, there is quite a bit to be taken out of it, even if the content does not sound interesting in itself. The style is very similar to 'Koyaanisqatsi', with the different types of shots used and another excellent score by Philip Glass. Perhaps Morris is aiming for a similar message to what 'Koyaanisqatsi' attempted to convey, but the whole purpose of the film is hard to single out. Is it meant to be about war or about Robert S. McNamara as a person? There is no strong focus on either of these options, with the two meshed together. It is also not as well organised as the film's chapter dividers might cause one to think. The material is rather heavy too, and the style is intriguing but it is all the same throughout, which leads to it becoming a bit monotonous. I personally became quite tired of it by the end. So, there are aspects that one can complain about here, but there are a lot of good points too. Some of the shots are spectacular, it is all edited well together, and the fashion in which the interview is set up with Morris is fascinating. It is sort of like a press conference, but also sort of like a confessional. The jump cutting is interesting, indicating that Morris rather than McNamara is able to pull the strings here. There is no doubt a lot going on in this documentary. There are some parts of it that I did not like, but on the other hand, there is a fair amount that can be appreciated too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of McNamara's Comments Defied Logic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes McNamara made statements in a tone that implied they were self-evident facts, yet some of his "logic" escapes me completely. For instance he recounts the time when an angry bomber pilot who lost his wing man during the firebombing of Tokyo asked Curtis Lemay why the hell planes that were designed to fly at 23,000 feet were ordered to fly at 5,000 feet; the answer he got was that an operational height of 5,000 feet "achieved better bombing accuracy". Helloo? When a huge formation of planes carpet-bombs a vast city like Tokyo, where does accuracy come into it? Suppose the raid had been conducted at 23,000 feet, I assume that a bomb that should have hit Mr Suzuki's house drifted and hit Mr Kitamura's house instead, meanwhile the bomb that was supposed to destroy Mr Kobayashi's house accidentally scored a direct hit on Mr Suzuki's house, etc. etc. If there are any experts on WW2 bombing tactics out there who can explain this to me I would be most grateful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I enjoyed this film very much. The following comments refer to Mr. McNamara and his superiors during the Vietnam conflict, not so much to the makers of this film. During the film, destruction figures for various Japanese cities are displayed, then transposed to a similar American city. I don't know and don't care if this is supposed to be a moral lesson by the director or an illustration of the type of number crunching that McNamara did in WWII. The numbers, however, are staggering and suggest a significant destruction of the Japanese military/industrial complex. But when it came time to decide how to end the war, our military leaders outside of McNamara and LeMay thought Japan had sufficient military power to inflict 200,000 to 1,000,000 casualties on U.S. troops. In Vietnam, McNamara used similar "destruction" numbers to indicate we were "winning" the war. These numbers, a product of the MACV order of battle report, were supported by General Westmoreland, and also were nearly impenetrable to outsiders. These numbers were contested by the CIA, but no individual or agency had enough clout to reverse or correct our path in Vietnam. McNamara suggested to "empathize with your enemy", but he had a colossal and tragic failure in not knowing his enemy. That he did not spell this out, and the makers of the film didn't call him on it, was a weak point in this otherwise good film.</fullReview>

I interpreted this visual rhetoric as a metaphor for Robert McNamara's life. During the course of the film Mr. McNamara gave a description of how he built up his career and became Secretary of Defense under President Kennedy, and the events leading up to his resignation under President Johnson. I interpreted the long line of dominoes falling across the map of countries that Mr. McNamara had involvement with during his career as showing how despite his hard work and commitment in the end he lost the career he had built and the respect of the American public. The intermittent scenes of falling dominoes helped to set the tone of the film because seeing the dominoes fall after Mr. McNamara's description of his successes created a sense of foreboding that his despite his accomplishments his career would come crashing down in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bobby McNamara is still as sharp as they come; a highly driven man with such intelligence, he is incapable of living an ordinary life. Unfortunately, Errol Morris decides to surround his persona with an over-dramatized Philip Glass score and 11 extremely vague lessons to construct his theme in FOG OF WAR. As a result, when watching the picture, we're not sure if McNamara had reached these conclusions himself or if they're just the rambling of a self-important documentary filmmaker. Either way, it hampers an objective view point and makes any connection to the current Bush presidency impossible. Nonetheless, McNamara is a man of wisdom. It was an honor to hear the thoughts of a brilliant man, who catapulted the Ford industry to prominence, while fighting Lyndon Johnson every step of the way in Vietnam. Therefore, I can't help but wish Morris hit record on the camera and listened as opposed to having the audacity to make a film that claims to be smarter than its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie Moriss directed about the thoughts of this man who, like it or not, fundamentally shaped the last half of the 20th century totally absorbing. I lived through the McNamara years while he was Secretary of Defense first with JFK and then LBJ and at the time of the Vietnam troop build-up thought he was the personification of evil but oh how time medicates the scars of the past.Had I known at the time of his gestation in the womb of that American monster-Curtis LeMay and therefore his participation in one of the greatest war crimes of that or any century, I would have despised him even more than I did. I must credit him, however, for realizing that those fire raids against Japan that incinerated millions of people while destroying virtually all Japanese cities would constitute today a war crime of the highest order. LeMay, along with Bomber Harris of the RAF who did the same thing against the German people and the German cities, committed war crimes that are only hidden because their side won the conflict-and McNamzara admits it to the camera!The next phase of McNamara's career was considerably more positive but only because Nikita Khrushchev, he of Reagan's Evil Empire, saved the world from a nuclear holocaust because of America's intransigence over the Cuban Missile Crisis. Fortunately McNamara saw through the cloud of looming war and was able to convince JFK to accept the Soviet deal thus preventing the closest brush with nuclear calamity that the world has yet faced.Morris has directed a brilliant film and I recommend it to any person interested in knowing why the contemporary world is the way it is-at least partially the way it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fog of War" is a great documentary, it's very original in its approach to its subject, Robert S. McNamara. Instead of a simple biography, it focuses on the lessons in life that the 85-year-old McNamara has learned. Interspersed with stunning documentary footage, we get a glimpse of the way McNamara's mind works, a man who was partly responsible (in his own words) for the deaths of 3,400,000 Vietnamese soldiers and civilians (North and South), and 58,000 American troops in Vietnam, and also hundreds of thousands (millions?) of Japanese civilians during firebomb attacks on Japanese cities in 1945. And yet it's hard to connect the man with the atrocities he help perpetrate, he seems like such a nice nerdy fellow, which makes him all the more scary. I'd like to see this film again sometime, it's very truthful and never boring.</fullReview>

In an intensely candid interview along with spliced footage of war and various other things that Morris considers relevant to telling his tale Mcnamara outlines his views on war among other things and talks about his life and the various decisions he made in his term.Mcnamara is a very fascinating person. He agrees that he has made mistakes but he also points out that he could not see what else could have been done. He points out that it was inevitable and he could not see other views to do it.Here is a man who is trying to give an answer to America's turbulent relationship with war and he gives it an extremely poignant way.Morris couldn't have picked a better subject for such a documentary. Morris has a huge talent and he can make the most compelling of documentaries with the most idiosyncratic of subjects. As always he shows how much he loves his subjects and how much he cares for the story he wants to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Candid admissions...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Found this to be an informative look into the history of former US Secretary Of Defence, Robert McNamara. As an Australian who regards the American exercise of power to be no more sophisticated than that of Genghis Khan, the kind of admissions that McNamara makes here confirms my own views on this matter. Historical events discussed in this documentary include World War II, the Cuban missile crisis, his time in charge of the Ford Motor Company, and his role during the Vietnam war.Some of the more interesting admissions that McNamara makes in the interview are: * if the US had lost WWII, he, and many other Americans would have been tried as war criminals. This is in the context of the issue of proportionality...the US lacked this in its conflict with Japan. Over 60 Japanese cities were bombed by the US with around 50% destructive efficacy. This was even before the US used the only weapons of mass destruction worth the name...atomic bombs...killing hundreds of thousands of men, women and children in two Japanese cities. McNamara admits to being a war criminal and he claims that American General LeMay also knew that he was such. Being part of a superpower means never having to say that you are sorry...well, you can say sorry, you just don't have to face justice...ever.* the supposed attacks on the US warships "Maddox" and "Turner Joy" are also discussed. You hear some tape of the principle players discussing the 'attack'...I personally read into them that history was being fabricated at that very moment, in order to achieve a certain outcome (US involvement in Asia, against Vietnam). The supposed attack led to The Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which got America what it what sought...war (by any other name).* President Johnson's oversight of the Vietnam war is also discussed. Listening to tapes of the man he strikes me as a nasty piece of work...an evil little man. He declared 'war' on "tyranny and aggression" with the absolute lack of irony that Americans are renowned for. Yeah...fight tyranny and aggression with tyranny and aggression! I've got a note which is a bit vague to me...something about Johnson crossing the Rubicon as far as bombing civilians goes, I think...I might mean that Johnson sanctioned the bombing of innocent civilians in Vietnam even before the marines formally invaded Vietnam.* History repeats...McNamara's comments about the US being unable to persuade nations with comparable values across the world of the justness of its cause against Vietnam resonated with me. President George W.Bush's own war against 'terror' had the same problem...only a lap dog like Australia would join the US on its adventurism. Aptly, McNamara does not seem to regard Australia as important enough to acknowledge as an ally. Maybe he forgot. Maybe he didn't regard us as like minded or equivalent. If we're doing this to win brownie points with the US, I think we are doomed! Most importantly, McNamara acknowledges that the fact that no nations with comparable values joined the US against Vietnam indicated that the US needed to reevaluate its values! * Just a minor side note: McNamara has a Shirley McLaine moment when he derives cosmic significance from the fact that (he claims) he chose a spot for the assassinated President Kennedy to be buried which the living president Kennedy had commented on positively beforehand.Of course, McNamara's hindsight is 20/20. But I wonder how much any wisdom he may have gained would have changed things had he to be in the same situation again. My view is that he would have done it all over again, the same way...Genghis Khan knew how to make an omelette. American presidents and generals and secretaries of state have the recipe too.</fullReview>

I can remember the summer of 1963. All we were concerned about at the time was if we would beat the Russians to the moon.

		<fullReview>I saw this first in the theatres and meant to review it at the time but never did. I got another chance to see it the other night and was blown away again by the approach the film-maker, Errol Morris, takes in the making of this.They say that a life unexamined is not worth living and the subject of this documentary, Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense under Kennedy and Johnson, examines his life and his decisions under the unrelenting eye of the camera and admits to failures and misinterpreted intelligence and tells us what he could have done better and what we all should do when confronted with similar scenarios in the light of the history of both the Second World War and Vietnam.I had never known the extent of the firebombing of all the wooden cities of Japan - and this was before the nuclear devastation that was to befall them. Horrific. Innocent civilians, uncountable children, swept away in fear and pain.I had also never known how the perception of Vietnam by the U.S. was so very, very wrong. The motivations projected onto Vietnam by the U.S. were completely incorrect.Robert McNamara shines a new light on all of this with the benefit of hindsight and new intelligence and weeps with the rest of us. I could not help thinking of how one could live with the blood of so, so many on one's hands. How does one achieve peace?The eleven lessons, though trite at times, have never been brought to bear on the current conflict. But should be.9 out of 10. It should be shown in every school in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog of War is a valuable record of history and the life of the brilliant and controversial Robert S. MacNamara. The documentary, brilliantly told, recounts the life of MacNamara from his middle-class beginnings to Harvard, his role as an aide to General LeMay in WW2 in the aerial bombings of Japan, his rise in Ford Motors during the 1950's culminating in him replacing Henry Ford for all of one week before resigning to join President Kennedy as Secretary of Defence. The bulk of the documentary deals with the next seven years of the cold war and MacNamara's recounting of the Cuban missile crisis and gradually sinking into the morass that was Vietnam. MacNamara eventually resigned or was asked to and headed a little organization called the World Bank for about a decade. He was well and truly the stuff leaders are made of. He is quite candid and does admit to errors made in assessing Vietnam without fully apologizing or calling it a mistake. He describes the horrifying aerial bombings of 67 Japanese cities and confesses that if they had lost the war, he and LeMay would have been tried as war criminals. MacNamara also elicits some sympathy and almost seems human when he breaks down while describing Kennedy's assassination and his responsibility in choosing an appropriate burial spot. MacNamara was close to the action in some of the defining events of the 20th century. A brilliant mind and eloquent speaker even in his mid-80's, he communicates very effectively and is interesting to watch as he recounts historic events.Errol Morris is the greatest documentary film-maker of our times or possibly ever and knows how to present the vast amount of material he worked with (apparently over 20 hours of interviews with MacNamara over a two year period). There is none of that Michael Moore style personal interference in the narrative. Its all told dispassionately, yet Morris's anti-war message does come through quite clearly. Morris has dug up a lot of historic footage, created some footage to help the narrative along and made a brilliant decision to use Phillip Glass's minimalist score.This documentary left me reeling for a few days and it really expands the mental horizons and gives a vivid perspective on various historic events. Its also very entertaining and fluid viewing. Cinema doesn't get much better (or informative) than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Errol Morris is the guy who made the greatest ads ever seen on TV, the famous Miller High Life commercials. I loved the camera movements and the faces. For this documentary film, Morris has achieved an incredible feat of film making: The camera moves without moving, the action unfolds off screen and still reaches new heights of tension and foreboding, and the special effects, what little they are, do what special effects generally are not meant to do, encourage deeper thought.McNamara himself is both frightening and familiar. He is not a leader, he could never inspire people. Inspiration was left to men like Kennedy, with their eloquence and spirit. McNamara is no idealist, no fanatic, no genius. That was not his job, and he is above all a man who knows what his job was and is. McNamara is an artist of common sense, a man who can apply extreme sense, statistics and logic to solve a problem. In his case, the problem was foreign policy, or the application of incredible force to direct foreign policy.In some ways, McNamara's cold logic is frightening, but he understands why it is frightening, and why others might view him as an extension of the evil that comes out of the force he applied. But, as man with common sense, he knows that. He is more of a philosopher than the German officers who claim they were only following orders, but he admits he was part of a mechanism that made so called evil decisions. Was there a limit to how far McNamara would go? The film kind of leaves that question up to the viewer.McNamara's common sense and communication skills qualify him for a great interview. He does not play to the camera, backtrack his words, cover up, or simplify. He tells everything like it was. I'm not sure if I like him, but I wouldn't mind spending a couple hours firing questions at him. He'd probably get annoyed and storm away though.The film contains unexpectedly good music and great film clips. The special effects, particularly the one showing numbers and statistics falling as bombs on a helpless city, are fascinating. The best scenes are in slow motion, as McNamara walks through a crowd, an old man moving past people who have no idea he was once the most powerful man on the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McNamara -- A brilliant mind and a brilliant failure?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young man in the 1960s, I sometimes saw and heard the US Defense Secretary in cinema news clips and on TV. He came across as arrogant, over-confident, powerful and didactic...Nothing much has changed in the last forty years, despite McNamara's admission that, if the US had lost World War II, he and General Curtis LeMay would have been tried as war criminals. You could probably say the same thing about the man in relation to the Vietnam War also which was, in the final analysis, an utter waste and debacle.In both cases, however, McNamara makes no apologies for helping to orchestrate some of the worst civilian casualties in history while bombing many Japanese cities into ashes and the napalm nightmare plus Agent Orange horror visited upon Vietnam villages.The documentary, in Morris's usual fashion, simply allows McNamara to talk directly to the camera; interleaved with that are many official film records from war and photos etc from his own early years. So, the human face of the man is constructed ? or attempted -- showing his doubts, his misgivings, his struggles with different wars and different presidents. Never once, in my opinion, does he come across as being someone you'd like to know...But, perhaps that's true of most public figures in times of war? No doubt he was a good family man as the footage purports to show; however, many grossly evil people have recourse to such revisionism ? without mentioning any names ? at later times, and even more so now.The sad truth is that, regardless of which side you're on, leaders who are caught up in wars often must do things that are abhorrent for most. That doesn't excuse their behavior or exonerate them from culpability. McNamara ? to give him his due ? at least now admits that he and others made many mistakes, which, for the documentary, he encapsulates into his eleven lessons from life. But, what it does mean is that humankind still has a long way to go before our proclivity to be all too human is finally eclipsed by a commonality of purpose in our shared humanity.Ultimately, that's the failure of McNamara and all people like him.Highly recommended for all mature viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War. It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands. While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them.The experiences he recounts ? most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam ? are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations. Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler. MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions. It's also a very valuable instructive tool ? recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam. It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him. It is therefore filled with omissions and lies ? the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq. Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 &amp; 11. In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in the former, Persia, are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject. (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get).1. Empathize with your enemy.2. Rationality will not save us.3. There's something beyond one's self.4. Maximize efficiency.5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war.6. Get the data.7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong.8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning.9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.10. Never say never.11. You can't change human nature.What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration. That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson. Fog of War is an excellent film. In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters. Pure evil does exist. It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara gives 11 short lessons dealing with international conflict in this brilliant documentary from Errol Morris (best known for "Gates of Heaven" and "The Thin Blue Line"). McNamara goes into great detail on the immense political inside problems of the Cuban Missile Crisis and also the Vietnam War as it becomes clearly apparent that the Cold War was red-hot for those in the highest places of government. He also talks about his statistical analysis to better utilize the destruction of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the tail-end of World War II in 1945. A fascinating and detailed look at the key events throughout the course of the 20th Century from a man who quietly stood in the shadows and at times on the front-lines of some of the most critical international and military affairs this country has seen in its contemporary history. A runaway Oscar winner for Best Documentary Feature in 2003. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Winner of the 2003 Academy Award for best Documentary Feature, Fog of War documents Robert McNamara, U.S. Secretary of State under Kennedy and Johnson, and his recollection of everything from his tenure as President of Ford Motors, to his involvement, as an adviser, in the foreign policy and subsequent standoff of the Cuban Missile Crisis.Fog of War uses archival and interview footage with McNamara to explain the eleven lessons he learned from his time working as Secretary of State. His political savvy is captured on screen as he brings the viewers up to speed on some of the historical decisions he helped foster, the results to which saw him become the President of the World Bank.Fog of War acts as a reminder of the importance of past political decisions in a more comprehensive and constructive way thank Michael Moore is capable of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>McNamara himself concedes that those leading the Allied forces in WWII (including himself) had committed War Crimes that resulted in the deaths of untold number of civilians. Having found his calling, he "dutifully" carried on with the genocidal task, butchering millions more in the Vietnam/Cambodian war - in the name of democracy and freedom, of course. And, this was just the beginning! What he couldn't destroy violently, he decimated financially. As the World Bank president, he has brought perpetual poverty to the third-world countries that had the misfortune of borrowing money from the WB. Under endless debt, the governments of these countries have been forced (by the IMF and WB) to cut public services like health care and education in order to keep paying their continually-increasing debt. The IMF and World Bank are the biggest reasons for poverty, while they claim to be the biggest alleviators.Contained in this documentary are some of the lessons learned from the life of a man who makes Ebola virus look honorable. Watch this movie to see McNamara's pitiful attempt to hide his diabolism in this so-called "Fog."</fullReview>

The phrase that comes to mind the most goes something like "lest we forget our history or we are bound to repeat it"(roughly paraphrasing). With that said, I was enthralled by this work and was captivated by McNamara. I felt like I was watching a man in confessional, a somewhat broken man who acted as best he could given the circumstances. He all but completely broke down in recounting the events of war with complete candor. There was some comedic relief during the point in which McNamara was discussing Cuba and the interviewer angrily shouted "but we invaded Cuba in the Bay of Pigs!".Overall, a powerful document in the life of a significant man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is what a documentary should be:(1) It teaches you something. I think I know quite a bit about American history. I'm 47 years old, so I lived through the Vietnam war -- and I paid attention to current events. I studied U.S. history as a graduate student, too. Yet I still learned a great deal from this film, particularly about the second world war and the Cuban missle crisis. (2) It is well edited. Errol Morris did an excellent job of selecting the portions of his extensive interviews with Robert McNamara that best represented what McNamara had to say. It is clear that his subject was someone who thought carefully even as speaking, since the editing suggests that a lot of pauses were cut out to create a smooth flow of thought on McNamara's part. (3) The choice of archive footage complements the commentary very well, illustrating the point and providing additional information as well. Particularly chilling was the montage of photos and captions that Morris selected to show while McNamara was describing the firebombing of Japan during World War II. (4) While it has a point of view, the film does not hammer you over the head with it, a flaw that I find a bit off-putting about the recent spate of popular documentaries by Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock.This is a truly outstanding documentary. It should be required viewing (along with the special features on the DVD)for anyone interested in U.S. military policy. If only we had paid attention to McNamara's lessons before invading Iraq, perhaps we would not be spending $200 billion and 1,000 soldiers' lives going it alone . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert S. McNamara had a front row seat for some of the most important events of the 20th century. In fact, "front row seat" is really not the right way to look at it, since he actually had a role in many significant events. The firebombing of Tokyo, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, these are all events with which McNamara had an intimate involvement.Now in his mid-eighties (though seeming much younger both mentally and physically), McNamara provides an incredibly fascinating subject for Errol Morris' documentary THE FOG OF WAR. Academy Award winner in 2004 for best full-length documentary, Morris has produced a film that will endure for the ages.I'm a big fan of Morris' fellow documentarian Michael Moore, but FOG OF WAR proves that Morris is in many ways the better film-maker. For one thing, Morris provides a production that manages to be stylish and artistic in ways Moore would never dream, without detracting from the point of the enterprise (frequent Morris collaborator Phillip Glass contributes a magnificent score here). FOG OF WAR also manages to be somehow less topical than Moore's usual fare (moving as it certainly can be). I know that this movie will be just as powerful twenty years from now as it is today.McNamara himself is incredible to watch, both in Morris' interviews and in the archival footage that frequently supports the narrative here. The old footage shows how he achieved a reputation for arrogance, even brilliance. In old age he seems to have achieved some degree of humility, but this does nothing to blunt the brilliance or insight. He doesn't seem to dissemble much at all, and has obviously spent considerable time over the years considering his role in atrocities like the Tokyo firebombing (even to the point where he concedes that he and Curtis LeMay would likely have been charged with war crimes had the Americans not been victorious).Morris also manages to refrain from presenting any strong editorial viewpoint; he lets McNamara tell his own fascinating story. Even so, it's easy to see parallels between the way the Vietnam war started and events of the past couple of years. Such inferences, though, are left completely to the viewer. I loved this movie. Historical, yes, but eminently watchable and compellingly presented. Gets a 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

But I can say it's one of the best war movies I've ever seen (believe me, I've seen more than my share of war movies). I've often heard about how great a filmmaker Errol Morris was, but I'd never watched any of his movies before, now with Fog of War, I know what all the fuss is about. Errol Morris can somehow get Robert McNamara to talk about things you'd never expect a person to reveal to a movie camera(in one scene McNamara can't fight back tears as he describes JFK's grave, this is one of the most touching movie moments I've ever seen). Morris has additionally packed this movie with tons of war clips, video footage, photo stills. Morris is like a college student hellbent to get an A on his term paper, searching far and wide, day and night for the best supplements to his paper.Of course as most people who saw the movie have already said, this is a wake-up call to George W. (President George Walker Bush) on the war with Iraq. With the information Robert McNamara gives, I very well believe that we ARE creating another Vietnam war. So George W. better watch out or he'll end up like LBJ.In that case, George W.'s just fine the way he is Grade:A+</fullReview>

The Vietnamese had been through it all before and chose to get on with their lives. I'm not sure how, but they can forgive. McNamara acts as our conscious, trying to forgive himself...almost. Should be required viewing for the real West Wing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belief and seeing are both often wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe I just saw this film because I admire Errol Morris' films (and even moreso the two episodes of his "First Person" TV show that I have been lucky to see. Please BRAVO re-broadcast them all.) Thus, I did not see this film to revisit (or revile someone revising) Viet Nam. Indeed I probably enjoyed those pivotal moments least of all.At 41 years of age, my memories of Viet Nam are traced furthest back to POW/MIA flags, bracelets and stories. I do not remember the war directly. No cousins or neighbors that I met served either. My strongest memory is of a Viet Nam vet on a BART subway car in the early 1980's, he was belligerent and shook by demons of one sort and/or another. He was ranting something about Jane Fonda, honest. It was frightening and sad.Even in reading/learning more about Viet Nam, it always seems like a holographic morass to me. By that I mean holograms are supposed to retain their image no matter how they are fractured, and thus Viet Nam whether on a personal or national level retains that quality of a morass, and definitely a sad, frightening one. That guy on BART was still swamped by it, and our country still can succumb to it as well.As for this film, I do recommend viewing it, especially for fans of Morris like myself. Over the weekend prior to seeing this, I heard a filmmaker on the radio talking about pure documentary style, no music, no text on screen, no voice-over narration to connect parts, just footage of the subject. His film was called "Sheriff" I have not seen it yet, he cited Frederick Wiseman as a hero, still he admitted that ANY film of course has an inherent subjectivity to what you see (the camera angle, the editing, etc...)I remember thinking, well I simply prefer Errol Morris. Morris' use of other clips in the past often served as a more tangential connection to what is being discussed (funny pre-code cartoons, or archive shots of elephants, etc...) but in this case he does have a lot of on-point footage (and earage, errr audio tape) due to the nature of his interviewee.Still we do get interesting images of skulls plummeting down stairwells, not-so-theoretical dominoes falling across countries on a map, payloads of numbers bombing cities. Even when we see the bombs themselves dropping, Morris did some sort of interesting 3-D set up it seemed.Visually the film is stimulating, as it is sonically. Robert Strange McNamara seems to me to be a man who has maintained doubt. I think this is not so easy to do as one gets older, yet it feels important to me. Towards the end, McNamara quotes T.S. Eliot (another inspiration for me) to underscore that doubt. Along those lines, one of his lessons is "Belief and seeing are both often wrong."At 85, he seems very lucid, although certainly measured and controlled in what he says. The same could be said of the tapes between him and Kennedy from 40 years ago, I was a little stunned at the gaps of silence in their recorded interchanges. Gaps that are surely not Nixonian in nature. Along the lines of belief and seeing, I wonder how much of this interview was re-ordered. I certainly look forward to a DVD version of this to watch as well.Many moments in this film resound with me, the account of Norman Morrison I had not heard of before, as well as the RFK recruitment of McNamara and eventually JFK's pitch to him. It was remarkable to think of someone being tabbed for a top cabinet spot (or two), instead of what I figure today would be someone careering towards the position. And someone being tabbed from the civilian sector to guide the armed forces? It makes my stomach knot up to think about such an offer.Leading up to that moment, it seemed McNamara worshipped, well at least worked from, the temple of statistics. Averaging out the cost of error over so many Ford passengers or Japanese civilians comes across chillingly effective. But McNamara drives home to us the pain behind the Japanese bombing with a well rehearsed litany of comparable US cities and lost lives. He then follows that up with his "war criminal" comments mentioned by others here.Is this atonement? Or is this McNamara accepting the blame that he prefers to accept, just as he later talks about answering the questions he wants to answer. (A classic trick on essay exams, no?) Or is this a man grappling with doubts about his past, and our country/world's future? What to make of him going and meeting with Fidel Castro and one of the north Vietnamese high command years after their battles?I'm not sure, the fog is thick. But this film is surely fascinating. McNamara keeps his demons close to himself ultimately, but you at least sense he is well aware of them. I'm not sure how many people you could say that about, much less politicians/cabinet members.8/10One annoying thing was the print of the film I saw (at CineArts in Palo Alto, CA) I am pretty sure had awkward splices that were NOT Morris' intention. Argh... Although I think there were some of his as well, chopped right as McNamara was finishing a word. As if he had to add even more tension to the topics at hand and his off-center angles of McNamara.Oh well, further reason for me to look forward to watching the DVD, maybe with my folks or others who were more aware at the time of the original events. I also look forward to hearing more about the process of putting this together from Morris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about the uncertainties that come in the execution of war, the reasonings behind waging it, and the consequences of it; as told by Robert McNamara and his experiences in World War 2 and the Vietnam War. The movie does a good job of conveying these uncertainties, but could have been better done. First, the dialogue with McNamara were told real-time, with the camera in his face waiting for him as he ponders thoughts, formulates answers, and asks himself and the audience questions. These interview scenes are interspersed with war footage, and visual cuts of newspaper headlines, memos, graphs, charts, and archival material. Most of these latter cuts were quick flashes that allowed the audience to only catch 2-3 words. I found this quite distracting. I think the movie could have been better done if the dialogue between McNamara and the interviewer was played over the visual footage, or if the interview scenes were put in an inset in one corner while the main scene was the footage. The visual cuts to the different memos and written documents should have been slower so the audience can actually read a sentence or two. Also, as someone who has read a lot of literature, both objective and subjective, dealing with WWII and Vietnam, I found the information content of this movie to be too small. I did not learn anything new by watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr., `First Person with Errol Morris' and the various filmed segments during the 2002 Oscars, I thought I had a handle on Morris' style and level of substance, but the Fog of War pretty much blew those conceptions out of the water. While I considered Mr. Death to be compelling, it was certainly a lot more `fluffy' in terms of style. The Fog of War, on the other hand, employs matters of style, yet focuses on the material rather than aesthetics.In terms of our subject Robert McNamara, I was stunned at how lucid and well-spoken he is, and how well he explained the goings-on behind the scenes with Vietnam and the Cuban Missile Crisis, among other topics. These were all complicated and in-depth material, yet he spoke about the subjects as if he were a good history professor - conveying the past in a detailed manner, yet not assuming that the audience area bunch of morons.I did not see the other film that was pitted against The Fog of War as a top contender for Best Documentary at this year's Oscars (Capturing the Friedmans) but I can definitely say that The Fog of War was worthy of an Oscar win. It did not have the flash of say, Bowling for Columbine, or the press and controversy of Capturing the Friedmans, but its quiet superior production and compelling subject make The Fog of War a must see for any documentary lover or history buff.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect movie. Probably the film of the year in my opinion. Just topping Lost in Translation. McNamara comes off as a very nice, smart, and passionate man. The movie is very interesting and rewarding from beginning to end. The movie isn't flashy. A lot of the movie is just McNamara talking into the camera. But it's very well paced and in my opinion, both the audio and the video were well done from beginning to end. What makes the movie so powerful is the audio from McNamara (of course). I didn't really know what the movie was going to be about, and I'd never heard of Robert S. McNamara before. And I am so glad that I saw the movie and heard what McNamara has to say. One kinda small thing I liked about this movie is how they constantly edited McNamara's "lessons." He maybe rambled on too much but they constantly were cutting out small parts of his speeches to make a smooth more stream lined speech, and I think that helped the movie a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathless documentary filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the more obvious propaganda tools such as Leni Reifenstahl's Triumph Of The Will, the power of the documentary medium has never been so blatantly evident than in Errol Morris' 1988 film The Thin Blue Line. The film was based on the murder of a police office in Dallas, Texas which saw Randall Dale Adams wrongly imprisoned for 12 years, coming within 72 hours of being put to death. Morris' investigation and eventual documentary film got the case re-opened, and saw Adams subsequently released. It is a glowing advert for the genre, and Morris was putting his massive talent at work again 15 years later in this film, The Fog Of War.Morris sat down with former U.S. Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara for 20 hours, having him speak into the camera about his rather eventful career. The film structure is based on McNamara's 11 lessons on the act of war, previously chronicled in McNamara and Brian Van De Mark's book In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam. McNamara talks about his life from when he served in World War II, to his brief time serving as Ford Motor Company's President, to his headhunted appointment as Secretary of Defence, initially under President John F. Kennedy, and eventually Lyndon B. Johnson. It is both a powerful autobiographical account of his life, and a complex analysis of the U.S.'s political structure and policies.Being one of the most despised political figures in the last century, Morris' portrait of Robert McNamara is both fair and even-handed. He simply allows McNamara to pour his words out, speaking through what is known as an 'Interrotron', where the talking head would talk directly into camera. It's an effective trick, as it allows us as the audience to relate to him in a much more personal way. The film doesn't try to be judgemental and put McNamara on a stand, it is however a commentary on war by one of the most fiercely intelligent and complex men of his time. McNamara, love him, sympathise with him, or outright hate him, he makes for an enticing host, and fascinating to listen to.In somebody else's less-experienced and less-skilled hands, this film may have just been a simple talking head picture. But in the hands of Morris, the film becomes utterly enthralling, cutting from McNamara's talking head, to archive footage, special effects, graphs, charts, and whatever he can throw at the audience to make this as fast-paced and breathless as a documentary can possibly be, without ever losing focus of McNamara's story. The Cuban Missile Crisis has never be so vividly discussed and so terrifyingly portrayed.Simply breathless filmmaking, and one of the finest documentaries I've seen from the 'noughties' era.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara", one can get the feeling of comparisons to the present, although they probably filmed it before the Iraq invasion. The idea of eleven life lessons sounds a little silly at first, but Robert McNamara knows what he's talking about. As he has been forced to reconsider many of the decisions that he made as defense secretary, he can now look at them in retrospect (although it seems like there are still things about which he doesn't want to talk).I think that my favorite part was his discussion about the Cuban Missile Crisis. I think that that whole sequence shows not only how close the US and USSR came to full-scale war, but also the danger of letting extremists make decisions in dangerous times. And then, there's the Vietnam War. I derived that even though McNamara regrets many of the choices that he made, he still doesn't totally repent for bringing about the deaths of so many Americans and Vietnamese (but make no mistake, he still thinks more logically than Donald Rumsfeld).So this is definitely a documentary that I recommend. And kudos to Errol Morris for reminding everyone of the similarities to the Iraq War when he accepted his Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with a face made for radio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From reading other viewer's comments here it appears that the answer to the question, "Robert McNamara: Good or Evil?" lies entirely in the mind of the beholder, and very few minds appear capable (or willing) to think outside one of those two extremes. Hopefully that is just a sign of our times, and one day it will end so that people can appreciate this film for what it is: McNamara's "memoirs" edited by another person. It's not necessarily the truth, but not necessarily a revisionist version of history either. It's just McNamara talking about his life experiences in his own way, for his own reasons. And it's fascinating.This film is important in the sense that it records a unique perspective of 20th century history for subsequent generations that cannot comprehend the turmoil of the Cold War era from their own experience. It accomplishes this simply because McNamara was there, and was a major player in those events. We have plenty of liars in high places today who are regarded as honest, respectable leaders. We also have plenty of honest, respectable leaders who are constantly accused of being liars. Should we deny them all any opportunity to speak of their experience simply because someone, somewhere doesn't like them? McNamara was there, and for that reason alone anyone who complains about his "performance" here should just shut the hell up and let McNamara speak (unless of course these individuals also helped determine the course of world world events through the 20th century rather than sitting around drinking beer and watching NFL reruns on DVD).If you lived through the Cold War, and particularly the Vietnam era, you owe it to yourself to watch this film to help place those tumultuous times into perspective. If you reached the age of consciousness after these events, you owe it to yourself to watch this film because the man was there, and he is telling you about it. This is not some arrogant academic interpreting or criticizing the very real and difficult work that was done by others decades earlier. This is not a psychopathic talk show host threatening to turn off McNamara's microphone because he doesn't like what the man has to say. Don't read so much into it, it's just McNamara explaining things from his unique point of view, and you can learn a lot by just listening, without trying to believe him or disbelieve him.Despite this recommendation, I give the film a rating of 6/10 because the editing is simply atrocious. Yes, the editing won awards. Yes, some reviewers here have commented on how wonderful the editing is. Like McNamara himself, people will always disagree no matter the subject.But the fact remains that throughout the entire film the editor performed jump cuts in the middle of McNamara's sentences for no apparent reason at all, except to appear stylish. The result was so distracting that I found myself rewinding almost everything McNamara said so I could look away from the screen and actually listen to what he said without the visual discontinuity. Then I'd watch the excellent stock footage of World War II, JFK, LBJ, Vietnam, etc. until the next time McNamara spoke, when I had to begin rewinding all over again. This is one of the most frustrating interviews I've ever watched. This lousy editing created a work that is fascinating to listen to, but almost impossible to watch. Perfect for radio, or for a compact disk at half the price. But as a film it fails. I give it 6/10 because of the content, not the presentation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting interview which but the former Secretary of Defense is allowed to get away with murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is about Robert Strange McNamara, the Secretary of Defence for Kennedy and Johnson and therefore the Secretary who took the US into the war in Vietnam. The film is essentially an interview with McNamara which is punctuated with archive footage of the war and other events that McNamara is talking about.It is expertly directed by Errol Morris who has made a few similar movies although not that many. McNamara tells his story under eleven headings. These headings form sections into which the film is organised and take the format of 'things that the ex-politician (now in his mid eighties) has learnt".This provides a good and well structured presentation of the Secretaries point of view. However, as McNamara chooses the sections and the lessons he has learnt, and coupled with the fact that there is no, or incredibly little, critical commentary or probing questions. This is the films great weakness as it therefore presents a very partisan view of the war and its causes and gives McNamara an extremely easy ride through the turbulent history of the period. McNamara is allowed to make sweeping statements about the reasons for the war, for instance, and his and Johnson's role in this with no questioning. Furthermore, when the going gets a little tough he simply backs off.Even with these caveats I enjoyed the film. However, I do wish that some of the events McNamara simply glosses over, such as the US's claim that their boats were attacked by boats from Vietnam, had been gone into with a little more depth. Other important issues, for instance the Pentagon Papers and the role of the Rand Corporation, simply were never mentioned. Furthermore, whilst it is intimated that the US did not have to bomb Japan with nuclear bombs to end the war, this is not un-packed or explored. Neither is the fact that the US is the only nation to use atomic weapons in anger.McNamara is an accomplished politician and former head of Ford. As such, the history he provides will inevitable be partial and to a large extent untrue. He is allowed to get away with murder, literally, due to the lack of investigative journalism. I have come to the conclusion that America simply does not have hard hitting investigative journalism. This film is a good example as are the films of Michael Moore. These movies are great entertainment and are very high on shock value. However, they do not take the issues to there logical conclusion and they do not push the question to the people who could answer them: Americans really need to see Newsnight on the BBC or listen to Radio 4 to see how this is done much better. Even so, it is very interesting to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film, significant contribution to US historical record</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog of War - A CommentaryWith limited training and minor experience in film making, I found this film to be an outstanding achievement technically and as a contribution to our national historical record.Mr. McNamara's candid recollections of the thought and decisions affecting foreign policy and war strategies and tactics during his tenure provide insight into our actual national history during that time, and the ranges of emotion, intellect and moral sensibility that affect our national leaders, especially in momentous times.Fred Kaplan, while finding the film "fascinating" and acknowledging its impact in his review ("The Evasions of Robert McNamara, Slate Magazine, Dec. 19, 2003), accuses McNamara of "mendacity" and "self-serving travesty" with respect to errors he well documents in McNamara's account.While the errors are important, and I genuinely appreciate knowing of them, they do not diminish the importance of this documentary for me but enhance it. I cannot consider them mendacious without getting further into McNamara's mind than I can ever expect.I them as fitting dramatically well my impressions of how most individual's memories of their thoughts and behavior vary over time, evolved in over 7 decades of listening to stories told and retold by family, friends, engineering colleagues; people of widely ranging ages and positions of power, and myself.The memories that engender our stories reside in neural structures that physically change with time in ways that may even be necessary to our survival. The directions in which they move seem responsive to internal and external pressures. These are most evident sometimes in those whose time for those changes to occur has been the longest. I'm not speaking of senility, though that may be the extreme extrapolation of such changes. Mr. McNamara demonstrates no senility whatever, as I have witnessed it in other men of 85 years.As I have reflected on this film, I've come to regard the discrepancies in McNamara's accounts as equally valuable evidence of those pressures. For the person knowing those discrepancies, the film can be a richer experience.The pressures I recognized were those related to politics and solidarity, morality, and rationality. McNamara is a supremely intellectual person. By that I mean he rationally applies his mind with uncommon concentration to the logic of matters at hand. C. West Churchman in `The Enemies of the systems Approach' [to solving very complex problems], defines politics (including solidarity), and morality as essentially non-rational: They espouse rationality, but when it conflicts with the goals and solidarity of a politically coherent group, it is rationality that is given up, not the goals or solidarity. Likewise morality utilizes rationality, but abandons rational conclusions if they conflicts with one's ultimate, internal moral conviction. (In this view, no one of these motivations is considered ultimately superior.)The tensions that manifest within us in response to these often divergent motivations to be rational, yet a dependable player in a solid team, yet an ethical person (one whose choices align with one's moral values), can become extreme, for those in crucial positions of national leadership especially.This film documents those motivations in one man, among many men, living and working through multiple crises. As such, they inform us about the phenomenon or public office, and the role of leadership of a representative democracy. And it is capable of informing our personal choices as a people whose culture ultimately embodies the multiple ideals of a highly evolved intellectuality, indeed, Western Rationalism; political unity, patriotism and team spirit; and definitive personal moral reference and associated ethical behavior.This film seems to almost willfully evidence the power of these ideals and the force of the tensions among them, molding our ambitions and effecting our choices as we strive to be unassailably rational, trustworthy and ethical, simultaneously. McNamara sums it up a rule of war: (approximately) `To do good you sometimes have to do evil'.It takes only a glance to see the same forces moving and molding national policy and public lives in our present time of crisis.Colin Powell is a highly regarded public servant. I want there to be a comparable documentary of his recollections, when he is 85.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I said to my friend, as we left the theater, "this should be required viewing by everyone of voting age before they vote," and she agreed.I lived through much of the era when McNamara was active in the USAF and DoD and he brought a deepened, sometime frightening, view behind the scenes. Kind of like when Toto reveals the wizard behind the curtain at Oz, but it gives us a less benign conclusion. I've read Roger Ebert's external review (q.v., left sidebar, main IMDP page) and largely agree.The movie ends shortly after McNamara quotes a few lines from T.S. Eliot's "Four Quartets." I reread the poem and was struck by how many passages in the poem captured RSM's present pondering and thinking. Some is in the vein of 'people who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it." Take, for instance, this from the opening of the first of the quartets: "Time present and time past// Are both perhaps present in time future// And time future contained in time past...."and"A people without history// Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern// Of timeless moments...."Several times, the interviewer goads RSM to either apologize for his actions (or to blame someone else) and each time, RSM declines. My view is that he decided if he did say more, it would implicate others and be self-serving and he declined to do that."The only wisdom we can hope to acquire// Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless...."One cannot help but be struck, over and over, by how pertinent RSM's eleven lessons are to the present world conflicts and the US position in them. I was impressed to discover that it's to RSM (probably as much -- more? -- than to Ralph Nader?) that we owe safer vehicles on the highway. That an obscure (to me) former ambassador to the USSR was probably the key figure in avoiding a world nuclear holocaust in the Cuban missile crisis. (Impressed also by RSM's clarity and intelligence; that he was 85 at the time of the filming only adds to it.) RSM quoting a passage from near the end of "Four Quartets." It neatly summarizes what he's been doing through the film in sharing his thinking:"We shall not cease from exploration// And the end of all our exploring// Will be to arrive where we started// And know the place for the first time."10 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frederick Wiseman. D.A. Pennebaker. Barbara Kopple. Les Blank. Steve James. Erroll Morris. These individuals may not be household names, but their work is as culturally significant as any film made by Spielberg or Scorsese, two filmmakers that I also admire a great deal. In an age where overhyped pictures like a certain Mel Gibson movie get all the media attention, Morris reminds us that the soul of cinematic art lies within deeper, structured statement about the conflicts of our world and the direction we are heading in; and what if anything any of us can do to make the globe seem as harmonious as an Otis Redding record. Very few filmmakers are capable of this kind of impressive, soulful exploration. When examining the Italian ne-realist films of the '40s and '50s, from such figures as Rossellini, Antonioni, de Sica and Fellini, one feels that such passionate expressionism can occur on film. With the help of Philip Glass' wonderful, hypnotic score, "The Fog of War" achieves something that transports one from a cinema to the great art museums of Europe. The film allows us to be mystified and captivated as we are being intellectually stimulated. The film also makes one further realize that the current war in Iraq is taking us on a negative path that will further segregate America from the rest of the world. I have my own personal reasons for being against the war, but I doubt I could ever eloquently convey them as well Morris and his subject, Robert MacNamara do here. With the addition of his past films, including "The Thin Blue Line" and "Gates of Heaven," Morris proves he is a definitive genius of our times and that the genre of documentary film is indeed a serious form of artistic expression worthy of greater social discussion. In short, everyone should see this movie and talk about it at during their water cooler breaks the next day.</fullReview>

McNamara sits in front of the camera speaking to the viewer about his life in the US primarily as Defense Secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The film gives 11 segments on McNamara's wisdom, and it is broken down into many key crises he was involved in. The main ones being the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the second being the legacy of the Vietnam War.If these two events aren't fascinating enough in their history as it is, McNamara gives the viewer a startling and in depth look at to how horrible leaders have to make decisions in the face where many lives are at stake.The opportunity for a film like this is great for it to become a soapbox for McNamara to show off his ego and spout of his legacy. It also could have been a propaganda piece for which Errol Morris could have used against him. In the end it is neither. It cautiously comes off as an important warning for all of humanity, and for new world leaders to pay attention to. Simply put McNamara just asks people to listen to what he has to say about what he has been through, and that maybe perhaps some one will learn from it.McNamara comes off as neither proud nor regretful for anything he has done. His stoic mannerisms even at the old age of 85 are sharp as a tack and amazing to witness. But it is his insights into the brink of how close we came to complete annihilation in the early 60's, and the failure to understand the purpose of the Vietnam war and how leaders dealt with it, gives an all inspiring sense of awe and shock as to what really was going on.Chilling phrases are uttered and when you hear them coming from this person they will stick with you forever. McNamara elaborates that if America lost the war with Japan, he doesn't think for a second that he and people like Curtis May, would have been tried for war crimes against the Japanese people. He holds up 2 fingers barely a centimeter apart and proclaims, this is how close we were to nuclear war. It's an amazing piece of work that Errol Morris has had access to, and we as viewers are able to witness.The film also gets to show some more insights that are quite charming, which takes away some of the dread. McNamara's description of his first press conference with Kennedy as Defense Secretary where he was hauled out and claimed he was scared to death, is shown and the old footage played of him in the 60's shows him absolutely petrified.Needless to say, Errol Morris has pulled off a winner here showing an old veteran of crisis giving a cautionary tale for today's world. It is a fascinating, engrossing, scary, humbling, and more importantly amazing documentary to witness on screen.Rating 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing job of humanizing a controversial, if not hated, figure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the film, I expected it would only confirm my long-standing dislike of Secretary McNamara. I just have never liked the guy, seen him as disgustingly calculated if not cold-blooded, the sort that sees things on paper but never acknowledges the consequences of his actions.I was blown away.Speaking for himself, Robert Strange McNamara is suddenly a living, breathing man, at age 85, with real feelings, real concerns, and some real regrets. If you can get past the disconcerting jump-cuts in the middle of some talking-head bits, which admittedly took me a few minutes, you will likely be stunned by what McNamara has to say about war and the future of mankind.An absolutely amazing film, with the added bonus of the Sixth Avenue Subway rattling the walls every now and then at the Angelika Film Center here in New York, since the auditorium is in the basement, right up against Houston Street, where the subway cuts across en route to Brooklyn. This might be irritating during some films, but it had a way of punctuating the war footage woven in and out of the interview segments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If not a great movie, still a very important one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As per expectation, Errol Morris' "The Fog of War" is a fascinating movie about a fascinating man. Morris is the indisputable master of the talking head movie. Nobody gives interview like he does, and there aren't many contemporary figures who are as choice a subject, nor many who would fit so perfectly into Morris' distinctive body of work, as Robert S. McNamara.Since his first movie, the bizarre and just plain awesome "Gates of Heaven," Morris has concerned himself almost exclusively with the human race's complicated relationship with death. From every angle -- spiritual, criminal, intellectual, political -- he has gotten his subjects to spill what goes on in their heads and their souls when confronted with the troublesome question of mortality. In this light, former Secretary of Defense McNamara is as juicy a subject for Morris as one can imagine, not just for his deep involvement in the business of killing, but for the awesome capacity of his mind and his articulate presentation of what happens in it.Nothing that is said in "The Fog of War" is likely to calm either the conservatives who he tends to rankle by revisiting and rethinking wartime mistakes they'd rather let lie, nor the most fanatically dovish liberals who still think he should hang for what the Vietnam War did to our country and to theirs. McNamara's reflections are, however, uncommonly acute. At eighty-five years old, there appears not to be one cell in his brain firing at less than one hundred percent.He seems to remember every thought he ever had, every action he ever took, and his reasons for doing so. Moreover, his constant reassessment of them is defined by a kind of moral frankness most of us should envy and aspire to.Morris, thankfully, does not make the mistake of simplifying either McNamara the man or his now-famous second thoughts. McNamara has not become a pacifist, and while one can imagine Morris' temptation to wave the regrets of the Vietnam War's main architect like a banner for the left, he knows the more compelling film is the more honest one. McNamara maintains that there will be no wars that will end all wars; and that there are times when one must "do evil to minimize evil." However, he is also very clear on some things which have striking relevance in the immediate. "We are the most powerful nation in the world," he says (and I'm paraphrasing), "and that kind of power should never be applied unilaterally. If we cannot gain agreement with our allies of similar values, then we need to rethink our reasoning."Though maybe not on a par with "Gates of Heaven" for sheer cinematic grace, "The Fog of War" is a film that needs to be seen by important people, and now. It is as urgent today as "The Thin Blue Line," which ultimately freed a wrongly convicted man from death row, was upon its release. The greatest difference between McNamara and our current policymakers is not that they are for war and he is against it, but that to them the moral equations are all very simple, and he knows better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ordinary man, with an extraordinary mind, under grimly extraordinary circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog of War (a title almost too perfect) consists of an interview with the US' aged Cold War-era Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara. As he talks, producer/director Errol Morris organizes the piece into 11 lessons on leadership, from as simple as `Understand your data,' to as profound as `In order to do good, one must sometimes perform evil.' Throughout, Morris displays effective visual and audible graphics to convey his inherent judgment against the vast, terrible suffering wrought upon the world in the mid-20th century. Mr. McNamara comes across as a college boy, a pencil pusher ?a man whose devotion to statistics and percentages helped secure an unconditional surrender from the empire of Japan, but also imposed tragic limitations on America's commitment to victory in Vietnam. One of the best sequences is when he relates his insider's knowledge of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Audiences these days may lack a frame of reference as far as understanding the prevalent threat of nuclear war, but here the speaker drives it home. He explains passionately that a nuclear attack upon the US was indeed going to happen, but we simply `lucked out of it.'Unfortunately, by the end of the film, Mr. McNamara ends up seeming rather indifferent to this whole production. He seems as though he has a lot to get off his chest, and wants to pass on some lessons he has learned, but clams up when the most provocative questions are asked. Morris actually, deserves much of the blame. Not only did he fail to entice Mr. McNamara to answer questions like, `Do you feel any guilt about the Vietnam war,' but he also decided to leave these shortcomings in the film. The resultant effect makes The Fog of War feel like a naive condemnation of Mr. McNamara, his advanced age, and his times, rather than an example of the successes and failures of a man responsible for directing armies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The soundtrack and the visual graphics are stunning. I was quite a proponent of the old "we had no choice but to nuke Japan" lobby until I saw this movie. What we did to Japanese civilians with conventional bombs flown from the Marianas is just unspeakable. This movie brings the terrible magnitude of General Curtis LeMay's war- crimes by comparing the bombed Japanese cities to similarly sized American ones as the bombs are falling. It's a very clever visual stunt and in my estimation, perhaps the best way to demonstrate to a modern audience just how bloodthirsty we were as a nation back in 1944.This movie also demonstrates how slippery the slope to go to war is once a President is committed to take some action. The movie achieves that by really drilling down into the casus belli for Vietnam- the Gulf of Tonkin incident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentary's for me are kind of difficult to ruin. Just as long as the subject matter is interesting.Having said that I own and love this film. Mainly because, without reading too much into McNamara before i saw this, I grew up thinking he was an jerk who bombed Vietnam into oblivion.But this film is really, very insightful, into the US policy in Vietnam under McNamara, his intentions in the war effort, etc. McNamara also gives out some sobering information, in regards to the Cold War Era. Such as, "we developed a 100 megaton bomb, and we detonated it the upper atmosphere!" His 11 lesson are good lessons that everyone can use I believe, such as, have "empathy" and "proportionality should be a guideline in war".This is a must see in my book, It may not deserve a 10 out of 10 stars, but as far as documentary's are concerned this belongs as one of the best in recent years. And anyone wanting to hear US motivations from the Secretary of Defence's mouth himself should enjoy this film and be very thankful for it. I found that I empathized with McNamara, as he laid out his intentions, admitted his mistakes, and described how things could have gone drastically worse than they did if "they" we're not there dealing with these issue/conflicts/wars. Overall it is a very insightful movie whether you like McNamara or not, meaning, this is not a partisan movie like say, Micheal Moore's films are. I only wish they had this for all of our leaders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am hoping that the death of Robert McNamara today will motivate more people to see this film. It changed my view of the man, and of history, and I am more than a little shocked at those who say it had no effect on them whatsoever.The "eleven lessons" of which some are complaining, in my opinion, are a mechanism to provide structure to the film, and to move from topic to topic. They prevent the film from being 90 uninterrupted minutes of "talking head", and (again IMO) are not really the point of the film in and of themselves. There's no quiz at the end; you have missed it, somehow.If you think of McNamara's brilliance as a tool to be used to achieve some end, it boggles the mind how many different and better ways history could have turned out. JFK had the right instinct to hire this brilliant man (and he didn't even seem to care for which post); Johnson made the mistake of not listening to him, and instead turning that brilliance to the task of tilting at a really big windmill. McNamara's willingness to do his regular level best in pursuit of a policy that even he thought was wrong -- well, there's the real tragedy.The "what if" games you can play with this are endless. If McNamara had stayed at Ford, then a lesser man would have done a poorer job at pressing a bad policy (thus ending the war earlier), and we'd probably all have 100mpg (or flying) cars by now.Left, right, or center -- this is a "must see" film. Think what you will of McNamara (and you will), but I don't think one person in a million would give us such an unblinking view of his own life's events; everyone should admire at least that much about the man.</fullReview>

If you have any interest in and a bit of knowledge of recent US history, then this will be a pot of gold to you. It is packaged as a series of lessons (confusingly, ten "life lessons" and eleven "political lessons), which doesn't work so well, partially because they aren't catchy enough for a movie. I particularly found McNamara's personal account of his life before his political career very interesting.You don't have to be a history buff to profit from this movie, but be advised that you need to have at least a working knowledge of the Kennedy and Johnson years.</fullReview>

His intelligence is a wonder of its own: he displays no ego, speaks plainly, and avoids any self-aggrandizement, but his perspective is invaluable. And the lessons here have broader applications, suitable for anyone who would be in politics/government, business, management, foreign affairs, or supervision.

		<shortDescription>'Fessing up is hard to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Strange McNamara is a super-bright academic-cum businessman who was plucked by President Kennedy from the Ford Motor company in late 1960 to be his Secretary of Defense. In his seven years in the post he made a major impact on the running of the American defense establishment but he was not able to stop the United States sliding into the morass of Vietnam. He left in early 1968, after disagreements with President Johnson over Vietnam, for the presidency of the World Bank.The remarkable thing about this cleverly made documentary by Errol Morris is that a still very lucid McNamara (he was 85 when this film was made) is reflective rather that defensive about the controversial aspects of his career. He spent much of World War II helping General Curtis Le May, a true military crazy, devise more efficient ways of destroying by firebombing the largely wooden Japanese cities, even after it was clear the Japanese had lost the war. He recalls Le May saying that it was just as well the allies won the war because if they had lost he and McNamara would have been tried as war criminals. McNamara points out that he and the rest of the Kennedy-Johnson administration fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the war in Vietnam ? a nationalist uprising was seen as part of international communism's dastardly plot to take over the world ? "I was a warrior in the Cold War".Morris frames his interviews with McNamara around eleven "lessons" he has learned. In the case of the Cuban missile crisis it is "get inside your enemy's skin" ? thinking like your enemy. The crucial step in that crisis was to give Khruschev, the Soviet leader, a way of proclaiming victory ("I've stopped the US from invading Cuba") while getting him to withdraw the Soviet missiles there. Many years later McNamara talked with Castro and realized during their discussion that both sides got to the very brink of disaster ? if Curtis Le May's advice had been followed and the US had invaded Cuba, nuclear missiles would have landed on American cities ? Castro would have told the Russian to launch them even though this would have meant the destruction of Cuba.The focus is on McNamara's time as Secretary of Defense though his career at Ford is mentioned briefly (his greatest achievement seems to have been the Ford Falcon though he also claims credit for introducing seat belts). One major lesson is that intellect may help you get your way in government but it doesn't guarantee your policies are moral, or effective. At least McNamara is not such an egoist that he won't admit his mistakes.The archival footage, most of it unfamiliar, is interesting and Philip Glass's music is dramatically appropriate. I didn't see the point, though, of the interviewer (who is heard only infrequently) sounding like he was at the other end of a very large room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons From One Who Was There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few people in American government have ever been as controversial or as derided as Robert S. McNamara, who served as our nation's Secretary of Defense at the height of the Cold War. For while he was one of those who had ably assisted President Kennedy to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis before it got past the point of no return, he was also arguably the lynchpin for the disastrous and tragic escalation of the Vietnam War under Lyndon Johnson as well. He was often criticized as cold, arrogant, condescending, an "IBM machine with legs", a statistician par excellence. But as documentarian Errol Morris shows us in his award-winning 2002 documentary THE FOG OF WAR, a film primarily consisting of McNamara's own personal narration of his life and times, there was much more to this man than the often distasteful myth.Even though Vietnam remains, and perhaps always will remain, a scar on America, and even though McNamara can be blamed for a lot of it, in this documentary film we can see the many other things McNamara did that were very beneficial over the long term. For example, in his time at the Ford Motor Company, seat belts were designed that reduced the number of people killed in car crashes. Also, after leaving his SecDef position under a cloud in 1968, he served as president of the World Bank, helping in many ways to try to alleviate the poverty and suffering that tends to breed despair in the world, and, inevitably, terrorism. But he also admits to things that have had disturbing implications, such as his time in World War II, when, while serving under Curtis LeMay, his suggestion to maximize the efficiency of our bomber craft in bombing Japan led to the incineration of sixty-seven Japanese cities and, finally, to planting two radioactive blossoms on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also contrasts the success of defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis, where we learned to see ourselves through the eyes and mind of our adversary, to the Vietnam conflict, where we had no such experience in that area whatsoever. Above all else, McNamara, albeit too late for 58,000 U.S. troops and 3.4 million Vietnamese civilians, acknowledges that the mistake of Vietnam was that we could only see it as an element of the Cold War, and not what the Vietnamese saw it as--a civil war where they had been fighting against colonial powers, Communists and otherwise, for a thousand years.McNamara is now pushing age 90; and in this film, he still remains as adamant as ever, sometimes being evasive in areas that are quite sensitive, but just as often being unbearably candid about his time in government. THE FOG OF WAR probably didn't change the minds of those who thought of him back in the day as a bastard; but for others, present company included, he was shown to be a complex human being who understood the difficult nature of war and its consequences and, at the same time, had become entrenched by the Cold War mentality that had had a stranglehold on American policy for nearly forty-five years. The eleven life lessons discussed in the film have considerable relevance to our lives and our nation as we confront terrorism, as complex and deadly a threat to America now as Communism was back then. Anyone wanting to understand that the world is not the simple black-and-white, good-versus-evil dichotomy we so often wish to make it out to be needs to see THE FOG OF WAR. There is wisdom to be had from observing what McNamara saw on the frontlines of a time in history no less troubling or turbulent than our present-day struggles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Errol Morris is one of my favorite documentary filmmakers, especially in his style and how he manages to conjure up so much imagery to go with his content, which is mostly talking heads-based. In this film, there is only one talking head: former US Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara.Teaming up with his frequent musical collaborator, Philip Glass, Morris drops a dizzying and almost hypnotic series of images to accompany McNamara's monologue and manages to dig into archival footage and sound that provide excellent segeways between McNamara's reflections.Although I found myself often unable to agree with McNamara himself, I still found the portrait painted of him and his involvement in the second World War and Vietnam surprisingly moving. Also surprising is how relevant the lessons learned from the wars of the past are to the conflicts of the present. Ultimately, despite not agreeing with McNamara, I found his own wish to have no war sympathetic.Throughout the film, you can hear Morris firing questions at McNamara, especially regarding how McNamara felt about his responsibility in the wars and if he has any remorse. McNamara resists these questions but you can tell that there's something going on in him. I'm glad that Morris put himself into his own documentary--it makes the whole thing a little more real, although Morris doesn't do wonders for himself. He sort of seems like he's picking at McNamara where he doesn't want to be picked at.All the same, the overall effect of the film is impressive. It's a solid documentary about the life and times of Robert S. McNamara, told in his words and Morris' filmwork. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slightly preachy but engaging documentary offers war insights from former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. McNamara, still sharp as a knife well into his 80s, recalls his experiences with the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, including the infamous Cuban Missile Crisis and the beginning of the Vietnam War. He also takes us back to his early years and service during the Second World War, all the while telling us what he's learned.Though McNamara is a fascinating man, "The Fog of War" suffers from the overexposure of its star. It would have been nice to have brief interviews with historians or other key players in the events McNamara describes. Furthermore, although archive footage is effectively applied, there are times when the movie could have benefited from the use of actors recreating the scenes being described. And viewers who aren't up on their history may be lost.But, all of that is neither here nor there. "The Fog of War" remains a well-made, though slightly overrated, documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The life and times of Robert McNamara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the late sixties and early seventies Robert McNamara was a much hated man since it was widely believed that he was the architect of the buildup in Vietnam and therefore personally responsible for one of our country's most disastrous military engagements. After all, he was Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson.But there's a limit to what one man can do no matter how high his office, and that is especially true in a democracy with governmental checks and balances. Moreover, according to the spin of this brilliant documentary by Errol Morris (director of the almost equally brilliant The Thin Blue Line 1988), it was really President Lyndon Baines Johnson who insisted on the buildup and slowly, like somebody inching his way blindly into a quagmire, get stuck in a trap of his own making. Still McNamara, Boy Wonder, now a man in his prime, originally chosen by the ill-fated JFK to be Secretary of Defense, has some serious culpability, even though he is on record as telling President Kennedy in 1963 that we ought to get out. By the way, being offered the job by JFK was an offer he couldn't refuse, even though he protested that he wasn't qualified. JFK knew better. Errol Morris shows this point cleverly by having McNamara say he hadn't yet agreed to take the job as he stood by JFK even as the President publicly announced that McNamara was the new Secretary of Defense.Robert McNamara, who at the time this film was made was 85-years-old, long in tooth and watery eyed, yet full of an acute sense of history and of his place in it, was put on camera as he was being interviewed. Again and again the camera holds tight and close on his face and we can see that face asking for understanding, as an overwhelmed parent might ask of his children. Meanwhile, juxtaposed between shots of the man were scenes from his past, B-29s taking off and dropping bombs on Japanese cities, and then jets from the Vietnam era firing rockets and tracers at targets on the ground, bombs falling, falling, falling, and bursting and bodies lying in the rubble.McNamara would explain. He would justify himself. Or he would offer no excuses. There is the fog of war, he said, and Vietnam was enormously complex not just from a military point of view, but from a political and global perspective. And there was always Lyndon Johnson who could never be persuaded to get out of the bog even as the slime rose to his waist and then to his neck. Incidentally, as far as I can tell the phrase, "the fog of war" is a paraphrase of something Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his famous treatise On War (1833).Included in the voice-overs are recordings made in the Oval Office that were not available to reporters until recent years. Listening to them, I was stuck again and again at the Machiavellian personality of President Johnson, and at the Iago-like influence of Robert McNamara at his side--Iago in the sense that he whispered in the President's ear, and in the fact that they shared confidences they did not share with others. But Johnson was no easily-led Othello. Instead, Johnson was his own man, a stubborn man, and while he listened eagerly to McNamara, in the final analysis he went his own way down, down into the quagmire.This is also in a sense a biography of the public Robert McNamara. He talks about his childhood and his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley. There is a shot of him as a young man at the stove of an apartment with his young wife. There is his experience in World War II analyzing bombing effectiveness under General Curtis E. LeMay (who doesn't look good here), and then his phenomenal run at Ford Motor Company where he turned a floundering auto maker into a leader of the industry. There is also his remembrance of the Cuban missile crisis in which he makes it clear that we were--holding his finger and thumb less than an inch apart--"this close" to nuclear war.McNamara comes off as enormously hard-working, brilliant yes, but with the modesty that comes from hard experience. He seems confident that he did the best he could in a job that required everything he had. He allows that he made mistakes and he reminds us that people in high places who make mistakes make mistakes that can have horrific consequences. He now assures us that he knows war is the wrong way if it can be avoided since in the fog of war we all lose our way. I would add that the logic of war always takes over and has its way with us, regardless of intention. Once the dogs of war are let loose, they run and run and run until they are exhausted. And only then do they come home.In addition to being an extremely informative and revealing portrait of one of our most controversial secretaries of defense, this is also a marvelous artistic achievement. Of course it doesn't tell us the whole story or anything close to the whole story, and certainly were Lyndon Johnson and Curtis LeMay alive today, they might very well tell it differently.What I liked most about McNamara here is his willingness to be mostly candid and not only admit errors, but to reveal some of the very human processes by which monumental decisions of state are made. We can thank him for appearing in front of the camera and exposing himself so boldly for all the world to see.The Fog of War won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2003.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>"The Fog of War" is a truly powerful documentary. Robert S. McNamara, in a an obvious bid for personal redemption, reveals his critical lessons. They are tragic reminders that we, collectively as a species, continue to remain unable to put the word "civilized" into civilization or "humane" into humanity.This film should be mandatory viewing in every high school and college curriculum. the lessons of history... lessons that have cost so many lives for such pathetic reasons--fear, greed, hypocrisy, and intolerance--must be revealed to our children if we ever hope for something better and safer and more secure for them and their children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We were this close to nuclear war, and luck prevented it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what should be required viewing for all Americans, The Fog of War allows one of the most controversial American cabinet figures of the 20th Century to tell the story of the Vietnam War. Robert McNamara talks to us, the viewer, directly, through director Errol Morris' device known as the "Interrotron," speaking of American policies from World War II to the run up of the Vietnam war. If the movie were just McNamara telling us about what happened, that would be one thing. But the movie is much much more, as we hear from McNamara what he felt about each move, not only in his 85 year old body, but also through file footage and tape recordings made in Lyndon Johnson's White House. The Fog of War won the Oscar for best documentary, though it's wildly entertaining through the use of footage from the 1960s, making it almost a narrative movie rather than the "boring" documentary. There is a certain unsettling aspect of how McNamara and the viewer can look right at each other, with only the screen in between us, and he tell us about how orders he made killed hundreds of thousands of foreign civilians, how events he interpreted lead to the death of thousands of American kids in Vietnam, and how he tells us if the Americans had lost WWII, it would have been Americans tried for war crimes, instead of the other way around. The movie is presented almost as an autobiography, presenting each story as a life lesson, where there are 11 of them. I found this approach effective, as it gave the viewer an expectation of what McNamara has learned, and in turn perhaps what we as a country has learned. The present day parallels are obvious, take out most of the "Vietnams" and replace them with "Iraqs," give it 20 years, and the movie could be about Donald Rumsfeld. Errol Morris is about to elicit insights out of McNamara on camera by shouting out questions while McNamara speaks, asking the questions we want the answers for. This movie should be required viewing for all high school history classes, and maybe even for all voting Americans. It will make you think hard about the issues of war and national policy in a time went the debate is vital.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too generous by half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is an interesting and enlightening look at the Vietnam War and the fire-bombing of Japanese cities in 1945, it seems to me that Morris is much too generous to McNamara, a brilliant manipulator, who at 86 continues to attempt to shape his legacy. McNamara is much too smart and has too great an interest in the final presentation of the material not to be further challenged by Morris on his answers. That said, even his answers are cagey to the point of paranoia. This is obviously a very bright man. His rumination about whether why what he and LeMay did wasn't a war crime because they won indicts himself. Indeed, he indicts himself there. Also interesting is his qualification, perhaps fairly, of the meaning of the word "efficiency" in the execution of bombing raids in Japan in 1945. When the military employs him to find out how to run bombing sorties more efficiently, what does he think they're talking about? Saving bakeries? And he wonders, also, about his responsibility for LeMay lowering the elevation of the bombing sorties to 5000 (?) ft. when indeed, that is what LeMay does, given his suggestion. Well, perhaps you are not solely responsible, Mr. McNamara, but some of the murders of the Japanese living in those cities who died as a result of your counsel are undoubtedly your responsibility. It's also interesting, at the end of the film, that he believes that change is not possible because "reason has limits". The whole point of the farce of Vietnam is that reason obviously didn't govern the decision-making which oversaw the escalation of US involvement there. So it wasn't really limited-it was largely ignored. Even his acceptance of the position of Defense Secretary seems rather ill-conceived. As he says, he has little background in the area and tells Kennedy that. Kennedy responds that there is no school for Presidents either. But, even assuming Kennedy was uncomfortable (evidence I've read indicates this is not the case) in running for President, does that justify having ---two--- unprepared people running two of the most powerful positions in the world? Ugggh. An astonishing lack of reflection ("empathize with your enemies" being one of his "lessons") characterizes McNamara. Excuse the cynicism, but I doubt that the immediate relatives of men and women killed pointlessly in Vietnam would be much interested in McNamara's wriggling and wrestling with his legacy. I found him distasteful when he attempted to atone with his book 10 years ago and it's obvious the colors have dyed strongly and unchangingly. Personally, it seems, as I said, much too indulgent to give such a controversial figure a more or less unchecked camera for an hour and a half. All that said, the score is perfect and his comments on the Cuban Missile Crisis were fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this documentary. I'm not really a schooled film critic, but here's my feelings of this film. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful photography. Then, along with the photography was the editing of the whole piece, for what good is good photography without good editing??? I was just a little girl during the time of McNamara's term as Defense Secretary, so, I really didn't know who he was until I saw this film. I learned a lot about him and really liked him after watching the film. Mr McNamara's poise, ability to answer wisely, his humanity, his confidence, and so on, made me feel good about him. I really think the film maker brought all those qualities out. I like the way the film maker asked questions off camera. I liked the questions he asked. The research of papers, old films and photos of the era showed a lot of leg work. The flow of the film was like a ride on a cloud. Great music! The quiet parts of the film gave me time to let it sink in, allowed me to think about it. I think the choice of music helped with that, too. This was a great piece of work. I hope it won some kind of an award. If it didn't, it should have.</fullReview>

I was fascinated by his take on Vietnam, which he pitched as a struggle against a stubborn President, where Johnston wanted to win the war against Communism at all costs. I was moved by his moments of sadness and regret.But with no counterpoint throughout this epic-length interview, I still don't know what to take away from it. How much of it is his own personal spin, custom tailored to reduce the stain on his legacy? Why was he given such latitude on discussing Vietnam--going into exhaustive detail here, but clamming up there? And his reluctance didn't appear to be an issue of justified secrecy. I was impressed by his overall frankness, but this is far more an interview (although a very good one) than a proper documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few enough films that I watch twice, then there are the exceptional few that I will watch more than twice. That this feature length interview is one of them makes it rarer still. I watched this almost open-mouthed, for many reasons. The first is the subject matter. Any insight into the Oval office during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies is captivating because of the significance of those times and the events (Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam War etc.) The second reason is McNamara always was a masterful politician. Impossible to pin down, he nevertheless is crystal clear on the reasons, motives and actions he describes. How can a man talk rationally about the necessity of evil in war, particularly in reference to the incineration of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Japan &amp; North Vietnam. Well, McNamara can and does. I was left with the impression that it is all perfectly clear and makes complete sense to Robert S. McNamara but he is not going to let us in and spell it all out for us. We wouldn't understand anyway. It does not come across as arrogance, more gentle weariness and defensiveness. He is going to let us know some things, but not everything. Despite this he is not a cold, unemotional man. He becomes emotional several times during the interview, when talking about his family, the assassination of Kennedy, and the tributes paid to him by Johnson after the latter fired him. The descriptions of his relationship with Johnson was also fascinating, because it is a perfect example of two very different kinds of people utterly failing to communicate.Finally I find it a testament to old age that is as sharp and eloquent as he always was despite being 87 at the time! It's proof that you do not need to lose your abilities as you grow older. Frankly he puts Rumsfeld to shame.It did seem to me that the filmmaker has a leftist bias, but he doesn't let it intrude. There were more things that he could have gone into, particularly McNamara's tenure at the World Bank, but then again, the film is probably long enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert MacNamara was the famously abrasive Secretary of State of Defense of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, blamed by many for the escalation of American involvement in the Vietnam war. He himself was previously President of Ford, and afterwards President of the World Bank. Now in his 80s, but still sharp and lucid, he makes a fascinating subject for Errol Morris in his documentary, 'The Fog of War'. Morris is no great shakes as an interviewer, but he shows great skill in his selection of the archive footage and music that accompanies the interview, which is more of a monologue structured (very loosely) around 11 lessons about warfare that MacNamara claims to have learnt in his life (when in office, the man was famous for lecturing the military with his theories). MacNamara's intelligence, and candidness (up to a point) make him a refreshing change from today's politicians, and he asks big questions (such as, what is morality in war?) to which he has no definite answers. Almost the only problem with this film is that we hear no counter case, and the subject rules some topics off limits: it would be interesting to hear a response from his critics to the arguments he presents. But it's a gripping film nonetheless, and a reminder of how hard it is to lead a country (even when you do have a brain the size of a planet). While Morris deserves as much credit for spotting the potential in what might have seemed like an unfashionable idea, as he does for his flawless implementation of the plan: one suspects MacNamara would approve of the operation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this was a great documentary after watching movies by Michael Moore I thought he was the only that could present topics like these but was I wrong. Errol Morris won an Oscar for his work in this movie and it shows. Its just stunning imaginative, and hard hitting. There are no lies in the film, no ramblings of a Republican spewing out propaganda just cold hard fact. Morris interviews Robert McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and in great interview fashion McNamara essentially bares his soul to the viewer. Its not just a documentary buts its a reprieve of sorts for the guy who has lead and participated in some of the most notorious coverups and shames in American history from Vietnam to the Cuban Missile Crisis to World War II. Morris uses audio tapes captured from then President Lyndon Johnson and McNamara to show us the sham that was Vietnam. It wasn't about fighting the cold war people, it was about imposing our colonial ideals on a weaker nation. Just like we did with the Soviet Union and left that nation in poverty, there was never any proof they were going to attack us with Castro, these are just the paranoid beliefs of one President to the other. McNamara tells us what we already know, there was no planning for Vietnam It was a huge mistake that was financed merely for profit. We were not liberating the Vietnamese, in fact the Vietnamese did not want our presence. He mentions the poor military technology that often made mistakes such as when enemies attacked when they didn't. He mentions that all his doings have been wrong and it took many years as it usually does for a narrow minded individual to wake up to the truth. The 1995 meeting he had with a former Prime Minister sums it up "We were not fighting Communism, he says we were fighting for our Independence". This is just an awesome film like "FAHRENHEIT 911" that has to been and seen with a large gathering of people so we can learn from our mistakes so we don't repeat them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his 2003 film, The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara , Errol Morris conducts an extended interview with former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, touching upon his role in the second world war, the Vietnam war, and numerous other areas of American defence policy - including the Cuban Missile Crisis. The film is most notable for its compelling combination of primary source documents (such as video footage and audio recordings) with the considered commentary of a man intimately involved in the events depicted and examined, after having had many years to consider his reasoning and decisions. The film has an undeniably confessionary tone, with some of the most astonishing lines delivered by McNamara as he looks directly into the camera. McNamara's candour, Morris' cinematographic style, and the emotions evoked through dramatic vehicles - like the comparison of the American bombing of Japan to what an equivalent bombing would have meant in reverse - combine to make the experience of the film a personally introspective one.Fog of War is clearly a film with contemporary, as well as historical, importance. Accepting the Oscar for best documentary in 2004, Errol Morris stressed how the lessons of McNamara's life can be applied to the questions that dominate American foreign policy today. When McNamara says: "If we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merits of our cause, we'd better reexamine our reasoning," the present day importance is clear. The film exists within the intriguing genre of the memoir that seems to burn with present applicability. Certainly, that sense is highlighted by Errol Morris' editing decisions, as well as his public comments about the film: most notably at the 2004 Academy Awards, where it took the best documentary prize.The minimalist, piano and strings-heavy soundtrack of Philip Glass, often counter-pointing historical footage, conveys a sense of missed opportunities. After the debacle of Vietnam, the image of dominos leaping back to their standing positions as the film runs in reverse is a poignant one. McNamara's message ? and it is undeniably his voice and approach that dominate the film ? is one of the kind of regret focused on avoiding future errors. Human fallibility is a theme approached many times: in the examination of the supposed attacks on the USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin that provided at least the pretext for major escalation in Vietnam, for example, McNamara explains that "belief and seeing are both often wrong." In retrospect, and as presented in the film, the Vietnam War was predicated on the massive and enormously costly misunderstanding of the nature of the struggle, from the perspective of the enemy. The empathy that McNamara saw as vital to the non-violent resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis was, in this case, tragically absent. McNamara puts the failure of empathy down to a lack of understanding between the North Vietnamese and American leadership: a point that seems especially relevant at a time when the United States finds itself confronted with enemies that operate according to very different structures and beliefs and within a history perceived very differently.While he acknowledges his culpability in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians during the second world war, McNamara is less clear about his own overall estimation of his moral stance. Speaking of his conduct in the war, he admits that he and Curtis LeMay were "behaving as war criminals," yet he tells his story so as to stress acts that he sees as personally redeeming. Examples of those include the introduction of seatbelts at Ford while he was President of the company, as well as the decision to make sure all of the troops protecting the Pentagon from Vietnam protesters be armed with rifles that were not loaded. The fact that McNamara chooses to relate these things, and Morris chooses to include and even highlight them, gives some idea of how human beings are able to make sense of their own lives in retrospect, balancing errors against the successes they found whatever good opinion they hold of themselves upon.It is terrifying to see, from as close to the inside as can be managed, the decision making procedures followed in times of unexpected crisis, particularly in the nuclear age. When McNamara says that "the indefinite combination of human fallibility will destroy nations," he adds an authoritative flourish to a doctrine more broadly elucidated by many others. Indeed, few of his ideas are really new and he makes no new information known that was previously secret. The value of this interview footage and associated materials lies in the places McNamara and Morris choose to focus their attention, how they choose to make the argument, and how broadly different phenomena are tied together. The film, like all important historical work, is a dialogue with the period of time it examines, seeking to understand it firstly on its own terms, with the benefit of hindsight, and secondly with reference to the contemporary world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Errol Morris's Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Morris's: his voice-over on marginally-related/archival images, his free-flowing editing style which almost seems to have been achieved in a Zen state it is so seamless, his system which allows the subject to gaze steadily into the eye of the camera lens, the hypnotic use of music, and his undeniable morality--he is not afraid to accuse or challenge his subjects. Up until now, Morris's best achievements (in my opinion) were THE THIN BLUE LINE, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, and the oddly-riveting GATES OF HEAVEN. Here, Morris has pigeonholed one of the most intriguing and elusive figures of modern U.S. history, former Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, the figure who motivated the Vietnam War being labeled "McNamara's War" by the press. So, does he have anything to say, this faded figure of '60's politics? You bet he does! And Morris pays him the great honor of allowing him to state his case, recovering the trail nearly eclipsed by history, as he recalls his rise under General Curtis Lemay in the Pacific Theater of World War II (and the dismaying, formerly little-known firebombing of Tokyo), the transformation of the Ford Company under his aegis, his reluctant acceptance of JFK's appointment of him to his highest office in politics, the turnaround created in the wake of JFK's assassination and Johnson's slow decision to escalate in South Vietnam. Morris augments McNamara's unsentimental testimony with archival military footage, graphics, still photos, and a fine, moody Phillip Glass score. Like a spider spinning a web, Morris creates connections and intricacies previously unimagined. And, while assiduously staying out of McNamara's way, Morris still points the documentary to one unavoidable question: how personally culpable was McNamara in enabling one of the worst moments in U.S. foreign policy? McNamara, even in the final reel, is reluctant to say...but Morris's case has been made quite eloquently. More importantly, there are lessons to take away from Vietnam, and they've never been more relevant to events happening right now. McNamara is an intelligent subject, and a man humble enough to know that true wisdom comes from constant reassessment of the past. Morris allows us to sit as jury: judging these mistakes of the past, allowing us to assess the potential disasters of events today, and determine--each of us--our own individual courses of action. This is not simply a good movie; it is an important one. And one you're not soon likely to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just watched The Fog Of War the first thing I did was to take a deep breath and watch it all over again. I remember the Cuban missile crisis very well and all those who I spoke to at the time thought the Americans would use nuclear weapons because they were having their 'bluff' called. It didn't happen or else I wouldn't be writing this but did this stand-off with Cuba and the U.S.S.R. cause the U.S. to enter into conflict with the North Vietnamese? The world saw the U.S.appear to 'climb down' over the Cuban issue and maybe the administration just had to show it's willingness to go to war and flex it's muscles without the risk of nuclear weapons becoming involved. In any event history shows us the Vietnam war was entered by the U.S. for the wrong reasons and then the problem, as in Iraq today, is how to get out again without losing face. McNamara would, by most people's definition be classed as a war criminal but one with good intentions rather than Saddan Hussein who had only evil intentions. Perhaps this film should be shown to all to illustrate that even as I write this, the war mongers still haven't ever read a history book.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elegant, at times heartbreaking biographical documentary that is, on its surface, about former Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara. In reality, it is a compelling retelling of fifty years of Cold War politics and strategy as seen through the eyes of one of that era's most controversial figures.Director Errol Morris has allowed McNamara to tell his own story for the most part, and that's what makes it all so compelling. As assistant to then-Colonel Curtis LeMay during World War II, McNamara orchestrated the firebombing of Tokyo that killed 100,000 Japanese civilians in one night. Later on, he served as President of the Ford Motor Company, and practically pulled the company out of fiscal failure singlehandedly. His greatest public profile came as Secretary of Defense for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, where he oversaw the handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and, most infamously, the Vietnam War.The film is at its most effective when McNamara is caught off guard by the overwhelming emotion of his memories. It's rare, but when it occurs, it's a truly fascinating sight. It's clear to the viewer that McNamara harbors a tremendous amount of guilt over some of his actions, particularly the Tokyo firebombing and the escalation of the war in Vietnam - no matter how much he wishes that it wasn't. McNamara tells his stories matter-of-factly, almost drily, until confronted by Morris with a personal query about his own responsibility. Then he jukes and jives and tap dances his way around this huge elephant in the room. He tears up as he simultaneously takes and denies responsibility for his actions. "Good can sometimes only be accomplished through evil means," he says at one point. But even he doesn't seem to believe it.The most effective moment in the piece may be when he talks about Kennedy's assassination. He was very close to Kennedy, and his assassination represents something very tangible and personal to McNamara; he expresses the opinion several times that had Kennedy survived, the Vietnam War never would have happened. Given how McNamara's name and legacy are tied so closely to that most absurd of wars, one can understand how the thought of it never happening could inspire profound sadness. When McNamara talks about how he personally picked out Kennedy's burial site at Arlington, it's as though you're watching his dreams die along with everyone else's.A great documentary - certainly the best of last year. It would have benefited from some interviews besides McNamara's. I understand Morris's decision to let it be McNamara's story from his point of view, but from an audience perspective, McNamara's not the most dynamic or charismatic of men. Nonetheless, insightful stuff.Rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who thought they knew about Robert McNamara, Morris with laser clarity brought to light the reality of one of the most powerful men of the last 50 years. A self professed neophyte at the time of his appointment as Defense Secretary, McNamara delivers a poignant expose of the process behind war. Like the line from Chinatown, 'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough'. In this incredibly honest and clean documentary, McNamara tells the truth about a war, that like Iraq, the US had no business being involved in. Morris' genius starts with the use of his invention, the Interretron, a brilliant device that allows the interviewee to look directly into the camera and see the interviewer, from there, it is hard to describe precisely what Morris does, but it is easy to describe the results. Like no documentary of a man who so influenced world political power, Morris gives us the truth. Simple, elegant, masterful, truth. The information divulged should cause a 'coup d'etat', if Americans weren't so fat dumb and happy. Insights into decisions, that McNamara admits were wrong, that our current President is repeating at this very moment, are the core of the documentary, the icing is the nice old man delivering this horrible true message. By the end of the documentary you'll feel that McNamara was just a nice family man doing his job and that the world is a far more dangerous and evil place than you ever knew. Man is destructive and mean, and nice smart guys like McNamara implement the destruction and death, and then drive to their suburban homes. Seemingly pointless to fight, the evil nature of mankind is at least a little more understood after watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Strange McNamara had a remarkable and commendable career until he became SecDef. Plainly he had risen to his level of incompetence. The value of this film is in the human face it puts to the monster in the machine so long presumed. This old man admits of tangentials, deflects substantives and demures of the meaningful but demonstrates courage to speak at all. He's brought sympathy to the technocrat of a flawed technocracy.The 11 Lessons rubric is incoherent and quickly undone. The empathy with others is another's understanding of Kruschev and Bob has none with Niki nor does he learn it with Hanoi. No element has a universal beyond the given particular.Make no mistake. Bob MacNamara is the architect of the disaster that was the US in Viet Nam. Denied the bureaucratic interservice rivalry of JFK's fat defense budgets and with LBJ's blank check acceptance of the 'Best and Brightest' Mac the Secratary Of Defense had little on his plate but 'Nam. He concocted a scheme of graduated responses, escalating engagements(so much for proportionality), and even trifled with field weapons. He denied targets, designated safe areas and frustrated his own war efforts. Brought to account by his Georgetown cocktail party friends he freaked and left the mess in LBJ's ample and soon to resign lap. LBJ packed him off to a sinecure at the World Bank to keep his mouth shut.It's sad to see all the talk from this implying meaning for Iraq or whatever when the film is all about Mac and it's not his fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat flawed in its structure but very interesting and never had me bored. I didn't know McNamara much at all before watching this movie except from Thirteen Days. He is quite guarded and careful about how he presents himself, but he also gave a lot of good statements. The talking directly to the camera approach helped to give an intimate feeling of conversation. I also like the old recording of the conversation between him and the two presidents he served, especially with Johnson. One weakness I found is that for such a supposedly controversial figure, director Morris went a little light on McNamara and wasn't very critical of him. Overall, a good documentary to learn the history and associate it with the present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing - McNamara struggles with moral issues of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is an interview with Robert McNamara, former secretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, 85 years old at the time of the interview. McNamara was secretary of defense for a period spanning 7 years until he had a falling out with Johnson. Both the Cuban missile crisis and the runup of the Viet Nam war occurred during his watch.The format is a bit odd, showing McNamara reminiscing about his career and what he considers to be 11 important lessons that can be learned from it. He is apparently responding to questions and prompts from an interviewer who is never seen, but occasionally can be heard as a distant voice asking pointed questions. McNamara's soliloquy is interspersed with film footage relating to what he is discussing.What emerges is a visible struggle between two McNamaras as he attempts to make sense of his career: One looks back and says "My God! What have I done?", and the other looks back and says "It's all logical and OK, given what we believed at the time.".The movie is chilling, thought provoking, and timely. At the end of it I was wondering how it came to be filmed, and who McNamara thought should be listening to his message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real lesson is get the right man for the job.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is not a rehearsal but the real thing". ..... and its a pity the subject of this film did not know that lesson.Here we have a pathetic old man who if he had any guts could have amongst other things prevented what he in effect says was the unnecessary final bombing of Japan in the second world war; and who if he had any real courage or intelligence could have likely prevented 50,000+ USA personnel dying in Vietnam plus millions of locals. Had he been strong enough or astute enough he could have persuaded Johnson to stop troops going into Vietnam. But he did not have and still does not have any real courage and hence now in his guilt ridden old age he is trying to excuse his incredible weakness and cowardly behavior in the past.Interesting to learn that had Kennedy lived we would have been spared Vietnam.Amazing that this weak minded old man relates how he was well into adulthood before he realized we all have a responsibility for the greater good. But he failed to put this into practice and goes on about how his duties in government caused his family and himself such hardship, including leaving the Presidency of Ford Motor Company where he lost millions to take the job of Secretary for Defense.That particular revelation reveals the true character of the man.The impression I got from the film is of a devious, weak and still far less than honest individual full of conceit and self-centerdness. And judging by what currently is in control of government in the USA it seems par for the course.The picture that comes across in this film is of a "bagman" for the likes of stronger individuals who in their duplicity, stupidity, lack of experience and collective irresponsibility led to catastrophic wrong decisions costing the lives of millions.From the film seems the only right decision he ever made was helping Kennedy's widow find the right burial plot for her assassinated husband. And the arrogant and self-serving assertion he makes in the film about saving thousands of lives through his car safety recommendations seems a failed attempt to cover up his responsibility due to his incompetence and inexperience that led to millions perishing. Showing once again if the wrong person gets an important job it will lead to disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Disconcerting. Thoroughly Honest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When compared to the recent Fahrenheit 9/11, Errol Morris' Fog of War is presented in an unbiased, no-spin package. R.S. McNamara, explains his many unique life experiences but focuses on his primary public identity as Secretary of Defense with the fiery Kennedy and Johnson administrations, while offering his genuine philosophies and opinions on many of the White House actions in which he took part. Much of the film is shown in a candid interview format, which is surprisingly captivating. McNamara is painfully honest about his service in Washington, as evidenced by occasions of tearful discussion. This film could pass as a two-hour internship in political science.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but ambiguous about some things, clear on others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog of War is a film in the style of other Errol Morris films such as Fast, Cheap and Out of Control, or The Thin Blue Line. It's certainly a well-made film and it will leave you scratching your head when you finish. It's ultimately up to you to figure out what lessons you wish to draw from the movie. While Morris shows thematic road signs, he doesn't always present an overt agenda or strong point of view (though you will come to some conclusions). Certainly, Errol Morris has a strong agenda when he talks outside of his own documentaries.As others have mentioned, the 11-lesson structure seems contrived since many items talked about by McNamara don't fit neatly into any of the categories and sometimes don't support the points supposedly being talked about. It's unclear whether these 11 lessons are being imposed on the film by Errol Morris in order to structure the film, or if McNamara has stated these 11 points somewhere else, and Morris is trying to constrain the film to fit them. We're not really given any context to decide who has come up with these points. Whether based on Morris' or McNamara's ideas, these eleven lessons seem artificial to the interview taking place. I actually found them distracting rather than particularly enlightening because they felt intellectually imposed rather than fitting any emotional or intuitive needs.This is a worthwhile film to see because it gives glimpses into McNamara as a complex man, and to a lesser extent into the times in which decisions about war have been made. It is also a somewhat bothersome film since the viewers don't come out with any particularly clear conclusions about certain things brought up in the film. Is McNamara despicable and responsible for many unnecessary deaths? Did he actually try to moderate LBJ with respect to Viet Nam? Who really made which decisions? The viewer never gets particularly clear answers to these issues. Many things are ambiguous and unclear and Errol Morris doesn't give any easy answers, either, since his subject wont. The movie doesn't shy away from the ambiguity but simply shows it on these issues. McNamara clearly doesn't want to give a straightforward answer to certain questions or to explain certain issues.Aside from the ambiguity, there are certain things that become very clear in the film: McNamara is brilliant, analytical and interesting; he is loyal and emotional (you see this when he talks about JFK's death and being fired by LBJ); many things that happened in WWII against Japan were terrible; war is impossible to predict and control once it starts; other resolutions to a problem besides war are preferable.Overall, I give this movie an 8/10 since it's very good, but flawed in some ways (notably the imposed 11-lesson structure). The music by Phillip Glass generally works nicely and adds to the experience.On another note, Errol Morris' style sometimes rubs me the wrong way since he throws in a lot of visual metaphors which sometimes seem unsubtle, lacking in emotional tone, or insight. I find myself distracted by his style rather than really focusing on what is being said. Other people may not feel this way about his films since it's probably a matter of taste and style. Whether you like or dislike the signature style you will run across it in all of his films.</fullReview>

Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara is 85 years old at the time these interviews were shot. None the less his mind is like a steel trap. Forthcoming about many facts and guarded about others McNamara's vivid description of those days in concert with the director's artistry make for a vivid history lesson. McNamara's name will always be synonymous with the Viet Nam war. But the story of his life encompasses World War II, the Cold War and the World Bank. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Cold War years and the Viet Nam era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has recorded an interview for use radio or television knows that edits will nearly always be necessary in order to comply with time limitations, to remove errors, to reduce extended pauses etc. For radio purposes careful editing can give an apparently flawless sounding result. For television however we would see clearly when any bits are missing and aside from that being a distraction, we might start to doubt the honesty of what we're being presented with. So for television the usual trick (`noddies') is to mask an edit by switching to an image of the person who isn't actually speaking. The person shown is usually nodding in agreement, and there is no visual cue to indicate that anything has been removed. This is presented as if switching between two cameras that were running simultaneously ? however usually only one camera is involved, and it is indeed a trick.For `Fog Of War' no `noddies' are used, and so we see clearly that many edits have been made to the 25 hours of original interview footage of Robert McNamara. However the result is a very natural sounding dialogue with only a slight distraction caused by the visual elements of the edits ? and this is more than compensated for by the added assurance of integrity.`Fog Of War' is compelling, technically impressive and highly entertaining. It's also a significant document of the life and times of a man who was uniquely placed to observe the human condition of being able to rationalise at the most dangerous levels of personal and public risk ? and he firmly believes that `Rationality will not save us'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It cannot be doubted that Robert McNamara was involved in some of the key moments of the 20th century and this film details them well from his perspective. And, naturally enough considering the subtitle of the film, we only see things through his eyes. Thus, this must be considered as a film about Robert McNamara rather than an authentic history of the times. We see him at his strongest and weakest; we see him at his most influential and least. Most of all, we see him keep his cards quite close to his chest. He can be very unrevealing at times, particularly on Vietnam. As a historical source, this is a valuable insight into the opinions of one of the most powerful men of the 20th century. As a film, it lacks colour and clarity and looks like a educational historical source.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lessons" don't really teach much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly interesting, but not as successful as it could have been. It works on some levels, but not on others.This viewer didn't really care for many of the techniques that Morris used. The "Filmmaking 101" techniques are just way too obvious. Every time McNamara starts talking about one of the war hawks, Morris shows us a slow-motion clip of the person in question that makes them look very evil. Once can be interesting, but Morris does it over and over here and it costs him credibility because he's stressing style over substance.As far the substance goes, "Fog of War" falls a little short. I'm a firm believer that a documentary needs to teach you something and offer new insights into the subject matter. Watching this film, the audience does learn some interesting things about the Cuban Missile Crisis, the opening days of the Vietnam War, and what went on inside Kennedy's and LBJ's cabinet meetings.But this documentary isn't really about the Cuban Crisis or Vietnam. It's supposed to be about McNamara himself, and that's where the film fails. Aside from a few minor details about his personal life - I had no idea he was the President of Ford Motor Company - we don't walk away with any new knowledge about him. Yes, he's a tortured soul who's spent decades agonizing over the decisions he made as Secretary. But didn't we already know that? McNamara did all the interviews for the news magazines when he was on his book tour back in the mid-90s, and we gained a lot of insight into him then. Does this film offer anything new? Not really, and that's why it's a failure as a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fog of War is a stylish, historically significant, and thoroughly engaging documentary that is only hindered by director Errol Morris' somewhat clumsy, intrusive approach to assembling the material. The film's aesthetic, in particular the editing, feels imposed on the material rather than growing out of it, and the omnipresent ironic tone too often feels forced rather than inherent in the footage. Phillip Glass's score is most effective when you don't notice that he's plagiarizing riffs from his score to Powaqqatsi, which unfortunately isn't all of the time.Despite these criticisms this film is a must-see for anyone with more than a passing interest in U.S. history after World War 2. The central figure, Robert McNamara, in real life as well as in this film, is a walking symbol of everything that makes America great, and everything that makes America dangerous. Morris does a good job of allowing these contradictory facets of McNamara to co-exist on the screen without beating you over the head with his own opinions.Additionally, this film would be worth seeing alone for the fantastic archival footage of John F. Kennedy, McNamara, and Lyndon Johnson as they, one after another, get sucked into the Vietnam sausage grinder. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McNamara a Loyal Servant in the old fashioned American way, a thinker, although not as great as Chairman Mao Zedong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mcnamara did the best he can. He even thinks more clearly and correctly than the Presidents. Unfortunately for him, he can only serve the masters and dare not do the unthinkable. Because he was brought up in the old fashioned American tradition: Service, Honor and Loyalty. But even if he is the president, he is still no match of the Asian genius of Mao Zedong, the man behind the only 2 defeats of American military. Korea and Viet Nam. This man has never been outside of his country (except a brief visit to USSR). But he effortlessly knows the weakness of the "Paper Tiger" which is essentially: Arrogance, Too much dependence on military Technology and not Human endurance and courage, Looking down on colored people as if they are inferior (Unfortunately in the case of East Asians it is deadly wrong) and the lack of knowledge of "Art of War". The 11 lessons have long been stated in forementioned book by Sun Tzu 2000 years ago. Basically, Mao predicts instantly the failure of the Americans' adventure in Viet Nam as soon as it started based upon: 1) They don't have a justified reason to be involved, so if it gets bogged down, which will be the case with China and Soviet's support and the use of his brilliant "Guerilla Warfare" tactics, American people will lose the will. 2) Because American leaders' arrogance and looking down on colored people, its military will always underestimate the enemy and make serious mistakes. Sometimes they may be tactically correct but strategically wrong, like " winning the battle but losing the war" 3) Unfortunately for the American military, they are superior in the air and on the sea, but in Viet Nam, that is not a deciding factor. Bombing will not shake North Viet Nam's will (again Mao knows enemy leaders will never understand this until the war is over). On The Ground, his tactics will eventually win because enemy is in unfamiliar territory and does not have the support of the local populace and in close combat, soldier's determination and courage which Americans lack is a deciding factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog of War: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries are one of the most underused genres of film used today. There's an unlimited amount of material to show the public, and much to unearth. There are many styles of presenting it too, making it one of the most open genres, yet precious few movies are made like that. The Fog of War is certainly an interesting topic. Filmed by famed documentarian Errol Morris (The Thin Blue Line), it chronicles the life of former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who served under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.I had not even heard of McNamara until I had heard of this movie, but since I had heard good things about it, I decided to go. What I got was more than just a documentary, I was actually learning stuff. I don't know much about that time in history, so it was an eye-opener. Although the film seemed a little long, it was never boring because McNamara seemed like a genuinely nice guy. Although he sent thousands and more to their deaths, he seemed like a normal man. He wasn't the type of person who would bore you to death, and I commend Morris for picking an interesting guy to make a documentary on. And I have to admit he didn't look half bad for an 85 year old.The Fog of War is subtitled "Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara". That's the film's major flaw. Although having titlecards flash up with each lesson, what McNamara said after each one often didn't make sense in the context of the "lessons". The entire "lesson" concept could have been done away with. Also, the general idea of McNamara speaking his mind on what he felt and why he did what he did is a great idea. He also backs up what others do. It seems almost like propaganda, sticking up for himself like this, but I digress.Unlike other recent documentaries, The Fog of War isn't hard to watch. It's interesting and informative, and is helped by the aged charisma of the subject of the documentary. A strong movie all around.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for images and thematic issues of war and destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Fog Of War' Is Half-Full AND Half-Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert McNamara might be a lot of things, but he's not someone who fades into the background with his mouth shut and his wallet full. No doubt, he likes to talk about his past. And considering he's been the president of both Ford Motor Company and the World Bank, I don't think he's begging for meal money on the street. What's puzzling is why a man on top of the world would give up his great job working with autos to become an unqualified Secretary Of Defense. JFK wanted him for reasons not made clear by McNamara and not pursued by the documentarian, Errol Morris. His critics over the years probably wish he had just stayed in the business world. McNamara was an architect of the Vietnam War, which is the major subject of the film. Yet his comments (seeming to suggest that he regrets the conflict, only he won't admit it was wrong) are maddening. Just when you think you can pin-point the former Secretary's true feelings on the most-infamous military action of the second half of the 20th century, he essentially pulls a "no comment" on Morris and your hand closes on nothing.The 11 lessons referred to in the doc's subtitle are black-on-white title cards, which are probably supposed to be "words to live by". Some are highly controversial (Lesson #9: "In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil") while others make crazy sense (Lesson #2: "Rationality will not save us"). According to McNamara, the Cuban Missile Crisis ended peacefully because we---the whole world---got lucky. But McNamara seems to be forgetting that in one sentence he claims that everyone involved were rational men (Kennedy, Khrushchev, Castro) while later revealing that a '90s meeting with Castro himself proved to the former Secretary that the Cuban dictator was willing to let his country be destroyed. How is THAT rational?Morris' stylistic conceit is to use an "Interrotron", which sounds to me like a video teleprompter (allowing an image of Morris to be seen in the camera lens...then the interviewee can look directly into the camera while looking at the interviewer). This seems unnecessary. A man with the reputation of Robert Strange McNamara doesn't need visual aids. Let him talk, he does that very well. If only he would be even more forthcoming than he thinks he's being. The man will be 88 in June 2004 (he was 85 when they shot his interview) and he's incredibly lucid. Most men of his age could not even keep up with this guy. That's why you expect more from him.'The Fog Of War' is fascinating at times, half-empty at others. It's worth seeing and you WILL get some information about Vietnam, Presidents Kennedy &amp; Johnson, and WWII that you probably didn't know. I didn't know that McNamara was part of the firebombing which eradicated dozens of city blocks of Tokyo before they even dropped The Bomb. He says that his commander admitted they would have been charged with war crimes had they lost the war. Powerful. But for every dominating moment like that, there's one where McNamara brushes aside a point-blank question about why he didn't speak out against Vietnam when he was fired by Johnson. You'll learn things from this doc, just not as much as you should.</fullReview>

I have studied it and feel that I have a good understanding.The movie covers all aspects of McNamara's life and does a great job in bringing out the motivations which shaped his life as well as just how smart he was and still is at the age of 85. His mind is sharper than most at any age. His revelations of the tactical WWII decisions made by him and the military leadership, which could have been deemed as war crimes and the Cuban Missile Crisis are fascinating to say the least. However, the presentation of Vietnam as a whole leaves you thinking that he was a reluctant architect of the war and perhaps the label never really should have been his but on Johnson. That is a separate discussion, but I really liked the film and the style but at the end it felt like a last ditch marketing effort by McNamara to sort of ease his mind and clear his name....just maybe.</fullReview>

The phone recordings of dialogue between Johnson and McNamara were unbelievable and frighteningly insightful. This easily could have been titled, "The Fog of McNamara". Admittedly, he mastered the art of answering the question he wished were asked. Filmmaker Morris is no match for this most learned manipulator of words ... but it doesn't matter. McNamara is so self absorbed that the interesting info just continues to flow. I will say the superflous "movie stuff" that Morris tries to toss in merely interferes with the flow most of the time. McNamara's words and the historical footage and photos, set to Philip Glass' score are plenty to keep the audience mesmerized. Disappointingly, my daughter was the only high school student in attendance and maybe the only person under 35.

		<shortDescription>Only Morris could show the humanity of one of the most vilified technocrats in recent US history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Errol Morris' The Fog of War is the life and times of Robert McNamara - the Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam Era - and arguably one of the most vilified characters of US history. This hour and a half long interview with the 85 year old statesman is intercut with archival material and a soundtrack by Philip Glass. It's a follow up to McNamara's book In Retrospect (1995), where he lays out his `11 rules of war' which are the lessons he has learned from the escalating disaster that was the Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the bombings of Japan which killed over 1 million civilians BEFORE the two atomic bombs were dropped.Fog of War is like an insider's play by play of US foreign policy debacles of the 40's 50's 60's. Using some newly declassified material from the Oval Office, we see how close we actually did come to nuclear annihilation with Cuba. We learn how much McNamara was influenced by the character of his superiors rather than his own convictions. He also discusses his involvement in the bombings of Tokyo that killed over 100 000 civilians in one night. This last fact - even he admits - could have had them convicted as war criminals had the war not ended in their favor. This from the man whose first memory is of the armistice of 1918 which was supposed to be the war to end all wars.The film is not an exoneration of McNamara by far. In fact McNamara doesn't even seem to apologize for his acts. The media savvy diplomat essentially says he was just doing his job. But old age and hindsight has given McNamara a philosophical outlook. He says people make mistakes and sometimes people make the same mistakes 5, 6 times before they learn from them- such is human nature. He says it is better to learn from the mistakes than make accusations. This one must admit is a privilege reserved only for the winners of a war, the losers don't get a chance to learn from their mistakes - they get the firing squad.Morris doesn't seem to mind this inconsistency too much; even tough he himself had marched in protest against McNamara during the Vietnam Era. Instead he portrays him as an articulate and confident technocrat. McNamara's success is clearly accredited to his propensity for analytical thinking and practicality. His only ideology seems to be driven by the mechanics of efficiency. Morris, whose previous film Cheap, Fast and Out of control which was an exploration of the workings of the exceptional mind, seems fascinated with McNamara. Particularly his rationalisations of the events of his life.What Morris does challenge McNamara on however is his conscious? Was this walking living computer aware of the effects of his actions on the world? Where does the question of right and wrong fit in to the cost/benefit equation of waging wars. It is one thing to be calculating the efficiency of seatbelts for Ford, but quite another for dropping bombs on people's heads. Yet this man did both in his capacity as an executive at Ford where he implemented the collapsible steering rod and mandatory seat belts - which has saved thousands of lives, AND as the Secretary of Defence where he introduced the use of Agent Orange - which still claims countless lives to this day . Same man - different results. Therein lies the mystery that is the nature of a man.Fog of war also lends itself to different interpretation depending on your perspective. For those who want to see proof of American imperialism as an uncontrollable evil empire that has no possibility of redemption, then this film will give them more ammo in the arsenal against Americana. McNamara really represents the United States Psyche: confident, efficient and ruthlessly pragmatic. The timing of the film is also very a propos even though the film was started before 9/11. The parallels with the current US administration are uncanny - almost verbatim. LBJ had once said the US wants to `win the hearts and minds' of the Vietnamese.For fans of Morris who are used to deciphering the complexities of the mind, this movie offers great proof of the infallibility of the human condition. It is a fascinating portrayal of sophisticated societies still relying on archaic methods of resolving conflict. McNamara says war is part of human nature; that our DNA has not changed much from the 50 000 years ago when we were fighting for fruits in the jungle. But one thing has changed. With our modern weaponry we now have the ability to destroy all of civilisation. A chilling warning from - the man who was once - the `Minister of War'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm deeply sorry I had to betray my prejudices in my summary. I loved this movie, both because it helped me understand 20th century American History better, but also because it is the video memoir of one of the men who best characterized American military thinking at mid century. I summarize the movie this way because it should leave you with many questions.We were all very excited about John F. Kennedy back when the Vietnam war was still only a civil war, and not yet a war of America against the communist bloc. JFK was widely respected, both for the agility of his mind, and his ability to take advice from others, even those he was confronting as enemies. Unfortunately, as we all know, the JFK presidency ended suddenly and prematurely, and the Vietnam War was escalated by a very different type of man, Lyndon Baines Johnson. This is the story about the man who ran the war for him. It is not a story about the war, it is a story about the man, and because the man is a philosopher, in a way it is a story about all men. McNamara makes it very clear that he is not an elitist. The film depicts him as a person trying to do his job as he saw it, as efficiently and carefully as he could, and like many of us, a person who was sometimes afraid to admit mistakes.I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smug, grinning, insincere warmonger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started out enjoying Kevin McNamara in this fascinating film from the documentary expert Errol Morris. The early biographical background (president of Ford, WWII statistics expert, etc.) is interesting but in the end you realise, sadly, that Kevin McNamara has learnt and concedes nothing.This film is supposed to be some sort of personal testament (which reminds me of Hitler) yet he just grins at the camera - the same gormless, knowing, mocking laugh that is shown when he resigned/was sacked as Defense Secretary under the master war criminal, LBJ; the laugh of someone who has promoted killing millions of peasants but finds it all a big joke.In this film, he comes over as a likable, very fit 85 year old and yet he gives nothing away at all. Despite the banality of his '11 Points' - which he probably thought up in about 11 minutes (like most of his Vietnam killing policies while Defense Secretary) - he hasn't really changed at all; he will admit no war guilt or the folly and evil of his role in Vietnam. McNamara should've sticked with cars at Ford, where he seems to have spared life (through safety belts and stuff) rather than speared it in government.At the end, in his typical white macintosh, he is back in his Ford, driving past his old office in the Pentagon. Perhaps he should pop in and offer some advice on killing to the Bush administration; show them really how it's done, not this half-hearted assault on Iraq from Bush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not knowing what to expect, I followed a friend's recommendation and went to see this film, knowing that I disagreed with much of the man's politics.In fact, disagree might be an understatement.As an analysis -- in fact, a self analysis -- of a man and his actions in his life, I can't think of a piece of film of comparative quality. This is an absolutely excellent documentary film, and in the same league as the other great documentary of our time, Bowling for Columbine.McNamara is an engaging man coming towards the end of his life, and offers some amazing insights in which he is often self critical, but always reasoned and thought provoking.It's not often said, but this really is a must see that had me thinking for hours afterwards about what is truly a great man and his contribution to the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OR HOW I LEARNED NOT TO LOVE THE WAR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>McNamara, practiced broker in the corridors of power, preaches pacifism. His argument is all the more cogent for the blood on his hands. "Don't do as I have done," except he stops short of contrition or admitting guilt: "It was the President's war," an eerie echo of evasion of personal responsibility that must have been all too familiar at the Nuremberg Trials. Not to judge him too harshly, the 85 year-old didn't have to do this, didn't have to write his books, didn't have to appear in public or this film. He could have retreated into his millions and lies like Kissinger. Thus at the end, even though he never confesses, never opens his heart, you suspect the deaths of millions weigh heavily on him. It's unspoken, it's in his face and voice, and only adds to the terrible sadness of this film. His message: We humans are a truly savage species; we must face this, must act upon it. The carnage is piled too high to ignore.The "Fog" of the title refers to the blindness inherent in any military conflict. Reason and science, the best laid plans of mice and men, are helpless before the chaos unleashed. McNamara furnishes examples of how the most thoroughly thought-out, justifiable war plans and strategies turned out after the fact not only to have been utterly wrong and misguided, but heedlessly, wantonly dangerous and destructive.All throughout, of course, in back of everyone's minds, is Iraq. Is this the exception? Do McNamara's generalities also apply here? Maddeningly, he refuses to comment.Morris is to be credited for remaining neutral, transparently unobtrusive. As in his other films, he demonstrates his gift for allowing the subject to speak for itself. He breaks form twice, however, when we hear his voice in the background, twice asking McNamara if he accepts responsibility, feels guilt. It's as if even he couldn't stay silent.Three items of note surface in the interviews: 1) McNamara claims that the USS Maddox was actually shelled by the North Vietnamese. He claims to have boarded the ship himself to inspect the damage and have held the remnants of one of the shells in his own hands. This attack formed the basis for the Gulf of Tonkien resolution which authorized President Johnson to initiate war against Vietnam. Other subsequent attacks on the Maddox, however, did not occur; they were the result of human error, the misreading of instruments by ship personnel. It has long been held by critics of the war that the attacks never occurred at all, that they were just used as a pretext to attack North Vietnam. 2) McNamara relates that Castro told him, many years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, that nuclear warheads were already installed in the Cuban missiles at the time of the US embargo. Thus the US and USSR came within inches of mutual nuclear annihilation. At the time , it was believed that the Cuban missiles were as yet unarmed and that the embargoed Russian ships were carrying nuclear warheads to arm them.3) McNamara expresses his belief that JFK, had he lived, would have disengaged from Vietnam, and that it was LBJ who bore the responsibility for escalating the war and deepening US involvement. McNamara paints himself as a reluctant participant who advised against the war. Nothing on the record corroborates this, however.This is an "important" film not only as historical record, but as indirect commentary on the current war by a major American power-broker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog of this Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very informative for someone who lived through Vietnam, though quite confusing for someone who doesn't understand all the details of the Vietnam War. I found McNamara aggravating, stubborn, and insensitive; I away feeling morally ungratified. He in no way attempts to apologize for his actions, informing the audience that a politician (and presumably anyone) should only answer those questions they had wished were asked. I sometimes like such pathetic and jackass-esque characteristics in film characters. It is only too tragic that "The Fog of War" is indeed a documentary, and that McNamara's attitudes are . . well, genuine. The cinematography, too, was foggy. Sequences like a row of dominoes falling along a map and colored numbers (like bombs) dropping to the ground did nothing to aid the gravity of the film's message and are somewhat reminiscent of a pretentious college film. They seem to belong to an entirely different type of cinema. I must admit, however, that the shots of McNamara himself are great. In addition, McNamara's predictions (especially concerning unilateralism) are chilling. I believe the Bush administration, and specifically Colin Powell, could learn a thing from this movie.History repeats itself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McNamara fascinating, Morris boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog of War is a truly important film, for which its director deserves little of the credit. Anyone with the slightest interest in modern history will certainly want to hear Robert McNamara's reflections on his life, his career, and the ways of the world, but Errol Morris lacks the humbleness to take a light approach and let the man tell his story. Philip Glass's manipulative score is a poor substitute for appropriate silence. The repeated technique of accelerating montages of wartime snapshots and text closeups, flashed too quickly for the mind to properly register, is stolen from Rage Against the Machine videos.This material demands a coherent assemblage, free of pretension. If Morris simply turned his raw interview footage over to the 60 Minutes production team to have another go at it, a more enlightening film would surely result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Errol Morris came to fame in the late 1980s with his anti-police corruption documentary The Thin Blue Line, and has spent the last couple decades gracing cinephiles with controversial, yet distinguished, films. Last year's Oscar-winning documentary The Fog Of War: Eleven Lessons From The Life Of Robert S. McNamara is his best yet, and one of the best films- documentary or not- ever made. It works as a history of the American Military of the last 50 years, and a personal portrait of ex-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, architect of the Vietnam War, not to mention a philosophical foray into the nature of man and evil.Yet, delineated as those 3 points are, the film is not dogmatic. McNamara is not portrayed as sympathetic, although sometimes he elicits sympathy- his love and loss felt at the murder of JFK, nor dogmatic, although his actions in the film and out belie that, and led to his being fired by LBJ. Morris takes an effective tack by parsing the film as 11 lessons from McNamara- a very Oriental approach to a life. This is also reflected in the fact that the film rarely answers questions, in the general or specific, rather intent on making its viewers think. Great art usually provokes queries, not smooths with answers.Thus the film's essence and its title, which refers to the chaotic complexity, therefore unpredictability, inherent in war. This film has got to be the shortest 105 minutes in film history for, if the deleted scenes (culled from over 20 hours of interviews) are any clue this film should more properly have been a PBS miniseries. There are probably only a literal dozen or so films that will have relevance and cogence in 1000 years. This is one of them. Watch it. Understand it. Absorb it. If you don't you are likely to be as regretful as its prime subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>judging the hystorical facts yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I especially enjoyed the documentary for providing lots of hystorical facts through the eyes of the protagonist, McNamara. Among the others, the WW II, the Fordism, the crisis of Cuba and the Vietnamese war are told: a number of "behind the curtains" facts are explained through the use of audio registrations, pictures and raw data as well.Even if the point of view of the author is mainly justificative towards McNamara, I had the positive feeling that the plot was allowing the viewer to form himself his judgment, without a lot of filter within.By the way, this is why I didn't like a lot the new Moore's move, Farenheit, because its strong, explicit viewpoint represents a too big filter for us in better understanding the reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good thing, when people are aloud to talk without being interrupted. McNamara gets the opportunity here. Still sharp and clear he tells us his version of history, accompanied by authentic tapes from discussions with Kennedy during the Cuba crisis and telephone calls from LBJ.It's quite exciting hearing someone who really made history once, but one misses the background. If you're not updated concerning the Vietnam war, you might feel a little lost. It would have been even more interesting if McNamara got a little more personal and told us about what he really felt about the presidents, the generals, Dean Rusk and so on.Still you learn much from the McNamara lessons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed and emotinalized Infotainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This well crafted and admittedly impressive film is plain and simple not a documentary.The incapability of the director and the editing staff in distinctly outlining McNamara's personal interpretation on the era is shocking. Distance and sovereignty of the crew is missing throughout the most time of this infotainment presentation.The Glass score can serve as one prove for the thesis.In contrast to a documentary this represents either just a reassurance in opinion of parties with same interests/opinions or the intolerable glorification of war by a superficially produced portrait of an ex-secretary which did shape a good two decades of world diplomacy.The obviously personal and individual presentation of 'regret' intermixed with the (to most Americans) appealing affinity with the JFK myth (the best and almost infallible administration the US ever had, certain retreat from Vietnam (?),etc.) distorts any attempt to represent US (and in essence world~)history with minimized bias. It is rather the question weather producers, crew and director are aware of this shortcoming!Probably they would even argue it to be a strength of the film... which is even worse.And whereas the possibility of comparing earlier conflict to the situation in todays Iraq might have existed, it is clearly identifiable that the film manipulates heavily. People that accept the personal and witty 'show' of Mr. McNamara as an honest explanation to the question, why do so many people die daily in wars and conflicts (today in Sudan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Zaire, Somalia, long-forgotten Tchetchnia, and so many unmentioned conflicts) are passive or maybe they are of patient submission or acceptance.For those who claim utilitarianism as their reason to agree with McNamara's view the picture changes as soon as their sons, siblings, uncles or other relatives witness what happens in places like Baghdad, Falluja and the like as they are being sent there.It is our duty as civilized citizens of democratic states to be informed however tough it might be to gain information without too much distortion/bias/manipulation/editing! In this way I was happy to see this film as an example of how difficult it is to use available information/sources and to put them into perspective.There has to be done something about war, all the time. The fog will never completely rise but we have tools to permeate it, but only if we want to use them!!! [Example: check the Jonathan K. Idema case!]Richard, Berlin/GermanyPS: I'm well aware that this is an subjective opinion.Comical Ali might have liked the degree and perfection of this production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately most Americans don't pay any attention to foreign policy anymore. The cost of the current conflicts around the world is born by a small minority. Where I watched this movie last night on a Friday night there were about 8 or 9 other people in the movie theater.This was a very chilling film. McNamara is clearly one of the brightest analysts that ever existed. It was also clear to me after seeing this movie that he was not the right man for the Secretary of Defense position. He is a very different man at the age of 85 than he was 40 years ago. He has learned a lot of lessons. Few of these are profound, and I think a different man would perhaps not have needed to kill 100,000s of people in the process. How is possible that "you have to put yourself in your enemies shoes" was not second nature to someone charged with leading us through strategic conflicts of such magnitude.Fascinating documentary - 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything is not what it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>McNamara's movie is an enjoyable one, but it's just an opinion of him and there's hardly any analysis of him or other people's opinion of his statement from other experts in the field. It's the same thing as Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth. When one person monopolizes the party, his opinion may monopolize you. So this review is only a background information before watching the movie not to get lost into the propaganda of things. Public Relations is actually the same word as Propaganda. And the person who coined the word "Public Relations" - a cousin of Sigmund Freud, Edward Bernays actually mentioned this fact. Hollywood is not supposed to be historically accurate, nor does it really teach us much. It is filled with personalities, drama, action, comedy for the basic purposes of entertainment. I also love entertainment myself. But to confuse reality and semi fiction is dangerous. Remember the movie Blair Witch? People thought they were real people. They were actually actors. Can you tell if a politician is acting or telling the truth? Really. Or have you watched the old 1960s T.V. Show "To tell the truth". The life lessons of McNamara can't be summarized into 11 lessons. It's not even McNamara's lessons. It's Morris interpretation of McNamara. In fact McNamara in the DVD documentary has other lists too, and whether that is what McNamara learned is really anyone's guesses. Also if McNamara were actually agree to do a documentary, the directors BETTER make the look better and improved their image, otherwise there's no incentive to do it in the first place. Few actor in their right mind, would do a movie (.e.g Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford) do a movie for free when his personality and popularity is at his peak. One of the lessons, seems more like lessons of what the public perceives to be true for today (it's much easier to play along public sympathies). Such as war can't be averted, that might be true. But wars are engineered by governments so they can go into war. Pretext of war is a deception of the public opinion that they are indeed our enemy, when the enemy is us. History is filled with U.S. firing on it's own ship and blaming the enemies as a pretext to war. Remember the Lusitania, and the unsuccessful one President Johnson to get Israel to fire on a U.S. ship as a pretext to war with Egypt, unluckily the Russian jet knew and the whole war there had to be discontinued. The reason why war was stopped is not the benevolent government, it came from the Russians. KGB files revealed that the Russian's financed the Peace Protest in the U.S. which lead to Kent State University killing, that finally lead to a withdrawal of Vietnam War. A more accurate history account can't be told from one man's perspective. He can have a monopoly over you. Take for instance, Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth. People now know that it's the Sun, not CO2. In fact it's not even global warming, it's the entire solar system of all our planets that is warming as our solar system reaches an unstable equatorial region of the Milky way with black hole radiation emanating from it. General Idi Dada Amin (A Self Portrait) is interviews by himself, and he seems like a cute and funny guy, but then aren't leaders suppose to be good public relations? He's perhaps one of the most evil men in history. Robert McNamara some think (I don't think so)he's a smart and a man of wisdom. But that's self promotion. While Kennedy was the only one who opposed the war (he was killed for that and other things such as vote cheating by LBJ, firing of Allen Dulles - a powerful Rockfeller backed person), why is it news media avoided that and twisted the fact as if Kennedy was pushing for Vietnam war? A good history lesson I recommend, Professor Carroll Quigley, "Tragedy and Hope", which tells of a powerful economic and consolidation of power behind all the wars. If you are a fan of Carroll (Bill Clinton was one) then our civilization's downfall is near that if you follow his books written in early 60s or late 50s - The Evolution of Civilization. The whole issue of war and why we go into war is a clear one. It is no mistake of the administration. And some people are beginning to believe WTC is an inside job and an controlled demolition (especially thermite bombs and building number 7) as a pretext for the Iraq war. After the U.S. took over Kuwait on the war against Saddam, most of Kuwaiti oil now belongs to the U.S, and the sheiks who owned it was actually never returned. Therefore things is not what it seemed and you just have to dig deeper. You get different realities all together - the blue pill or the red pill. I don't know which, because the media made us color blind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, I don't know what got into everybody in order to praise this film to such an extent. I mean, this is a good documentary, but nothing that isn't produced almost daily on scores of different topics. Quite honestly, there are many excellent documentaries that have been overlooked and unjustly overshadowed by this one. I try to understand why the critics (and many viewers) seem to find this film so extraordinary, but I am nevertheless unable to find anything special about it.Instead of because it is a masterpiece as they say, is it rather not only because this is a rare interview with someone who shaped modern American (and world) history, and/or is it not because Mr. McNamara repents and states at one point that had the US not won WW2, he and many others should have been prosecuted for war crimes for their bombing of Japan? ...How very politically correct! Or is it also (and especially) because Mr. McNamara states that he had urged President Johnson to pull the troops out of Vietnam (how convenient - ergo: Mr. Bush, you are making a mistake, you should pull the troops out of Iraq) as well as stating that had JFK survived, the escalation in Vietnam would never had happened (again, how very convenient - ergo: if a 'real' democrat was in the White House now, Iraq would never have happened).Honestly, this type of "hidden" negative publicity makes me sick to my stomach. This is unworthy of anyone who pretends to call him/herself an artist, this is the work of a political activist. There's nothing wrong with political activism as such, but then please say so...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Former US Secretary of Defence Robert S. McNamara talks to documentary maker Errol Morris about his career,seeing over his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War and his own personal revelations and perceptions of what went on.The documentary has come quite some way over the course of the last year or so,as both an art form and a piece of entertainment,with Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me and Michael Moore's box office breaking Fahrenheit 9/11 pushing this fantastic genre above the boundaries of the art house and into the mainstream audience,an encouraging diversion from all the brainless eye candy cinema-goers would rather subject themselves to on a general basis.So it was surprising that I only learned of The Fog of War when it arrived on DVD,despite being the official selection at both the New York and Toronto Film Festival and winning an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.Despite it's interesting and compelling subject matter,the film is basically...boring.And this just shows how it's potential is wasted,because not only does the story sound good,but McNamara is certainly a very interesting character.For an 85 year old man,his physical,mental and verbal presence is in remarkably good shape.And it's not just because all he seems to do is talk to a camera,indeed on the contrary his facial and spoken manner throughout has engaging flourishes of emotion,between happiness where he lets out a little laugh and sadness where he appears on the verge of tears.The film is basically just stuck in a rut that all the other modern documentaries aren't.The film has a different style and presentation than all the other modern ones do.Instead of hearing a voice-over as stock footage is played and various key people are interviewed,the whole film rests on McNamara's shoulders to carry it.There are none of the tricks and gimmicks that are used in other modern documentaries like SSM and F/9/11 that have helped make them more interesting and propelled them into mainstream audiences.In an attempt to give it something of a modern edge,the camera shot of McNamara appears to vary in proportion between shots in a flashy,edgy kind of way,but this ultimately ends up getting just really diverting.And that brings us on to the film's main problem:the soundtrack.It never changes throughout the film,and ends up getting really droning and meladorous as events roll on.Overall,this certainly had the potential to be great and there's certainly a lot of interesting information to take in,but the film's inability to move out of it's old school style of documentary makes it the kind of thing that would be well-suited to assist a school history project and ultimately as interesting as listening to some old guy witter on for over an hour and a half can be.**</fullReview>
