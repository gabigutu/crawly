		<fullReview>We two 50+ grandmas went to see this film on the spur of the moment because we enjoy musical movies. We were probably the oldest people in the audience which ranged down to younger teens but everyone, regardless of age, was laughing and having a grand time. Much less schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer, and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur. Fun, feel-good and highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the people I saw Pitch Perfect with truly enjoyed it. They laughed and clapped and booed at me when I expressed my disgust. For many, this movie will definitely be enjoyable. Make no mistake, that does not make it any less of an awful movie.Several factors contribute to my low opinion of Pitch Perfect. The largest of these concerns is the cast of characters. While there are few complaints in the acting department, the characters themselves are among the worst set of "people" committed to screen in recent memory."Beca" (is that spelling supposed to be hip or something?) is an arrogant, brooding, selfish brat who spends most of her time sulking on her computer and complaining about being forced to go to COLLEGE and be with PEOPLE (blegh, right?!). This is a perfect setup for character development, right? Wrong. After a half-hearted apology for being a terrible human being before the climax, Beca morphs not into an upstanding social and moral butterfly, but a smug leader of the troop she so recently was kicked off of, and this is the image the audience is left with."Jesse" is the most cliché love interest one can imagine. Seriously, girls, if you ever meet a guy this perfect and blameless, marry him. Jesse prances throughout the movie being sweet to everybody, from his unrealistically nerdy roommate to the jerks he sings with. He pursues Beca valiantly for no particular reason and provides the cliché moral criticism Beca so desperately needs late in the movie (but of course he takes her back). While girls might be enthralled by this sentiment, no true development can occur through a character who is so blatantly one-dimensional.Worst of all are the two commentators for the sing-offs, Gail and John. These two buffoons spew dialogue that is not only shockingly inappropriate for television/radio, they simply aren't funny. While clearly trying to channel Fred Willard's comedic performance from Best in Show, the pair instead come across as amusing as your drunk middle-aged parents at a frat party.Other character "highlights" include the mind-bogglingly narrow-minded and stubborn team leader, Aubrey. Stacie provides the necessary college-aged sex-addicted tramp character (a character so over-the-top, you're guaranteed to squirm). Bumper (the captain of the boy's singing team) is a character so insanely arrogant and rude that he is not only hard to enjoy watching, he makes you want to kill every jock on the planet. Slowly. The movie's second fatal flaw is its achingly stupid sense of humor. Yes, boys and girls, Fat Amy is funny. She has several good one liners and lends the movie its only spark of humor-related vitality. However, all else falls flat. The most achingly obvious example is the vomit-laden climax. Seriously, was that girl doing vomit-angels supposed to funny? I guess I just don't get it.Also, for a PG-13 flick aimed at mostly female tweens, Pitch Perfect is surprisingly offensive. The movie takes heavy jabs at nerds, Asian people, Jewish people, redheads, and probably more that I fail to recall at the moment (not to mention several distasteful jokes like the one about eating another baby in the womb). Seriously, filmmakers, you aren't Sacha Baron Cohen, and you don't have the same audience. Finally, the movie follows the most cliché (I like this word, don't I?) storyline imaginable. Girl has trouble in college. Girl meets boy who befriends her. Girl joins team of has-beens. Girl pushes away boy away because of her past and her daddy issues. Girl forced off team. Girl "learns lesson" and wins boy back and helps team of has-beens win championship. Yay, ingenuity!Ultimately, the comedic sparks from the humorous character Fat Amy can not save Pitch Perfect. I'll be honest, this movie completely lost at the vomit scene(even Miss March was more tasteful than that!) I was quite aca-thankful when the movie came to its (very abrupt) ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Bring It On, Glee (not in the icky cheesy way, but because there's singing involved, the good kind), Mean Girls, and add some quick-witted, sharp-tongued dialogue and commentary, and you have the funniest of movies. At first I was leery: a movie about A Cappella singing groups; I thought at best, it would be a teen flick. Yes, I know, Anna Kendrick. But bigger (some better) names have made some doozies. But, I was unbelievably surprised. Every kind of humour is covered here, and done to absolute perfection. You will be adopting many, many of the lines into your daily lexicon. For me, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) and Elizabeth Banks (as Gail, the commentator) have some of the most hysterically smart lines ever committed to celluloid (right up there with Young Frankenstein).Loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never planning on seeing this particular movie after seeing the unfortunate trailer. However, I had heard good things about it from people who's opinions I used to trust. I won't make that mistake again. Pitch Perfect was awesomely terrible. It began innocently enough, but then it quickly devolved into a mash-up of just about every single cliché one can fathom. It has the loner girl who doesn't want to try new things but then she gets involved with a group and she has friends, yay! The girl falls for the guy, but she screws it all up, but don't worry they get back together in the end. The group starts out terrible, but then because of the new girl with fresh ideas they step up and win it all! So many eye rolls in one film!Even after this, the worst part of the movie has to be the awful sound mixing. The songs are so doctored that one is painfully aware of the actors' lip syncing and it takes you right out of the movie. They could have at least tried to make it sound like the songs were being recorded live, rather then using so much auto tune and other forms of voice manipulation. Then there were the plethora of jokes throughout that fell so flat it hurts. Some of those jokes were even repeated multiple times, because once wasn't bad enough. At least Rebel Wilson provides a few brief moments of relief from the onslaught of worn out and unfunny jokes.But, like, that's just my opinion. If you like terrible things like Glee, then you will probably love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has been years since I have seen a movie that I had such low expectations for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That I loved so much. I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.I am pretty confident that it is going to be the surprise box office hit of the fall and it is so much better than the films that it is bound to be compared to like Mean Girls, Bring it On, and even Bridesmaids. Speaking of Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson almost steals the show with every scene that she is involved with being hilarious, and in a lesser movie her scenes most certainly would be worth paying the price of admission alone, but there are so many other talents involved. Elizabeth Banks has never been funnier. Skylar Astin as the love interest is also terrific though he needs to change his name, because for me the name Skylar brings only one thing to mind and she is married to Walter White.This is no Oscar Winner, I am certain that I will see a dozen or so better movies this year, but none will having me laughing and smiling as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The single best thing I came away with after watching this movie was the wild relief I felt knowing that at least I didn't pay to subject myself to it. Some positive word-of-mouth made me curious enough to DVR it. An 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes got me to sit through the whole thing (albeit with a fair amount of time spent pressing fast-forward), just to see if there was something - ANYTHING - that could justify such an absurdly high score.Short answer: There wasn't.I'm given to assume it got its high rating only because the studio wouldn't allow any critics to screen it without first producing proof that they possessed an IQ of 70 or under.If you read the IMDb synopsis, you know the whole movie. Actually, if you've ever seen any film starring characters under 25, you know the whole movie. There is not a single unique idea to be found within a light year of its sorry script. Comparisons to Glee are inevitable, but the truth is, PP is so utterly dull and witless, so aggressively devoid of joy or humor or anything akin to real human feelings, it makes the worst episode of Glee look like Singin' In The Rain by comparison.Ostensibly a comedy, the film is mercilessly unfunny. Their idea of hilarity seems to run the gamut from projectile vomiting to juvenile puns like a singing group called "The Minstral Cycles" to inserting "aca" into every exclamatory phrase, like, "Aca-scuse me?!" and "Aca-believe it!". Isn't that funny?! Aren't you just gasping for breath from the amusement of it all? ...Yeah, me neither.The characters, who are either grotesque, shopworn stereotypes or dull, cardboard cutout caricatures, flap about from scene to scene without ever even accidentally bumping into a real human attribute or emotion. They're also supposed to be in college, but the movie is so bent on regurgitating teen film tropes that nothing they say or do is indicative of a person over 15.You know your film is bad when you feel compelled to reference other better films to move the story along or motivate your characters. For Pitch Perfect, that other better film is The Breakfast Club, which the 2D heroine's would-be 2D boyfriend regards as the most meaningful thing ever. There's a scene where said heroine (she had a name, but really, who cares?) is sitting on her bed watching the flick on her laptop, tears welling up in her eyes to indicate some grand epiphany ...which, under the circumstances, must be her devastated realization of what a GOOD teen movie looks like.In sum, this is a film I'd recommend only for use as a torture device on terrorists. Badly written, directed and acted with characters as irritating as a rash and music numbers so awful, even the editor's attempt to slice them into bite-sized bits couldn't make them any more palatable. Funny only for people whose sense of humor atrophied at age five and entertaining only for people who've never seen a movie before. I give this a "1" only because IMDb does not allow me to score in negative numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an absolute, total, pitiful, dismal, ridiculous waste of time. I cannot possibly believe that anyone enjoys this movie. There is nothing meaningful and important, and the only reaction I have after watching this is the reaction to punch the face of the person nearest to me. I cannot relate to the characters whatsoever, and the story is maybe the weakest thing since my mother's homemade teriyaki sauce. If someone forced me to watch this again, I would gouge my eyeballs out with a spoon to avoid seeing it. Seriously, it's that bad. Never watch this movie. Ever. I cannot believe that there are people who view this as the best movie of all time. I know someone who has watched it at least 12 times and claims that it is her favorite movie. She thinks it is impacting and wonderful. The only impact that was associated with this movie to me was the impact of my fist smashing the disk into several bite sized pieces. I will never watch this movie again as long as I live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low point for this genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert (though hardly necessary for this predictable flick)If you read IMDb's synopsis, you already know the entire story. It's the "group of teen misfits who band together and win a competition" movie. You've it a dozen times before.This one has an updated, 2012 soundtrack, but all the other overdone cliché's for this genre are fully intact.If, however, you find slick, unrealistic, overproduced, a cappella singing to be pure joy (Glee fan?), then you may find this movie tolerable.On the other hand, if you value your free time, pass this one up. You will be spared several scenes of projectile vomiting, and the "riff-off" (which will likely induce your own nausea).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensive, Sloppy and Heartless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is certainly a wildly popular movie, that came highly recommended by countless friends and family. I had no idea what it was about beyond 'singing,' so I fired up the DVD player at Château Pulpitel, and eagerly awaited the many laughs I was assured this film would provide.Now they never really came. This film is as best I can gather, 'Glee: The Movie' with the basic plot elements of your 'Bring it On' style films. So if you love any of that stuff, stop reading now and go watch it. You'll love this film so you needn't bother about my opinions.Okay, it's just us now, right?Where this movie falls apart is in two aspects; firstly its complete disinterest in logic pertaining even to its own universe, and more worryingly, it has an offensive attitude that is nothing short of racist, sexist and more suited to your standard right wing attitude in its portrayal of non-Caucasians, Jewish people, people with eating disorders and women in general. This movie doesn't care about what happened before, or why something is happening now. It's one big Deus ex machina from beginning to end. Why did Ben Platt's' character Benji, turn up as stage manager at the regional sing off event? Everyone else had to drive on the bus to get there. Where was he? Why was he a stage manager at another university, when he is a freshman amateur magician? Why was it that the best way to get rid of Adam Devine's' character Bumper was to have a hastily created scene with him immediately leaving to work with John Mayer- negating any interest in his relationship with Rebel Wilsons' appallingly offensive and unfunny Big Amy character? Why does no one EVER study? THey don't even carry books, or pens, or seem to talk about their subjects! This movie shows us countless avenues of interest and then never refer to them again. It sets up characters and dumps them never to be seen again. We are shown four acapella groups, one of which NEVER does anything, at all! Why bother with all of these settings if you never refer to it again? Because no one cared that much, would be my guess.More shamefully however, is the constant prejudicial attitudes displayed in this film. This movie attempts to be funny by being daring, and outrageous. So we get not one, but two Asian characters who are simply awful stereotypes. One is a racist angry dorm- mate with the main protagonist, who manages to be an unlikeable bitchy Asian stereotype. The other is a 'crazy Asian' stereotype, who is a pyromaniac who rolls around in vomit. You know, because Asians can't be complex and meaningful. They are either bitchy nerds of perverts. We aren't allowed to hear non-white characters speak too much either- our token black character gets around 4 lines (you can't count the singing, because its all clearly auto tuned and added in post) but gets to be a problem gambling lesbian. But there's no motivation given, no reasoning. And after the moment of confession, NO ONE CARES. Maybe it's because she is black? The script writers were right to think that you can do great joke about racist stereotypes, but they missed the concept that you make fun of the behaviour and attitudes of racism, and expose the ridiculousness of it. What they do here is reinforce stereotypes, which should not be amusing for empathetic, caring members of the human race. But we plough deeper into this morass, with obesity, bulimia and deafness copping a serve. I strongly feel that no subject is off limits for humour, but you need to be funny. Making fun of Deaf Jews, Lesbians and Asians is not the same as being funny.I found this to be a fairly heartless film, where morality and heart are irrelevances, and not one that I could recommend to others. This is not what comedy should be, if we're a truly civilised people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the musical?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of fans could hardly wait for the sequel to come out, and now that it's here, I went back and watched PP again to see if I missed something. Nope, all that junk is still there. I was hoping to see a musical, but a vapid teen/college comedy showed up instead with a sprinkling of "music" in it. Most of the major roles were occupied by actors closer to 30 than college age at the time the movie was made. The music is spotty, at best, and the lip-syncing/dubbing is terrible. A lot of "fat girls are funny" humor involving Rebel Wilson's character (can she actually do comedy, or just Funny Fat Girl stuff?) And when they resort to vomit humor more than once, you know a movie is short on writing talent. The only bright spot is Anna Kendrick, and her solo with that coffee mug. I can hardly wait for PP2 to come out - - - at the $2 video rental box, it's a sequel I can wait for....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on cable last night. My friend who suggested we watch it told me she'd heard from many that it was very funny. I did not think it was funny at all. We watched about half of it (maybe the good parts were in the second half?) Doubtful. As soon as the girl projectile vomited I just sorta knew it was going to be awful. NOT because I don't like silly humor. Actually I love it...when it's done right. But this in my opinion was just done wrong and I did not laugh once whereas clearly this was meant to be a comedy. I loved Rebel Wilson in Bridesmaids. She was hilarious. I was hoping she would make this more entertaining but that was not the case. I don't know what it is with Hollywood lately. It's either vampires or glee club. Its a little too much already. I would have liked to have watched this movie with people who claimed it was hilarious and have them explain to me what about it was funny. I just did not see it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Saw an advanced screening and the entire theater was laughing and clapping throughout the movie! Refreshing to see a comedy and musical combo. A lot like Glee (minus the cheesy factor) mixed with witty comedy like in Bridesmaids and other modern popular comedies. Great casting! Any college girl is bound to love it. This is a movie even my mom would enjoy. It held my interest throughout and i think it was well produced. My boyfriend even enjoyed the comedy aspect of it! A great girls night out movie choice or even a date night movie. I feel like overall everybody loved it, I definitely did. I hope this movie earns the recognition it deserves. Its going to be a hit among young audiences like myself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh what to say about this garbage of a movie? Oh yea I wish I were be able to give this movie a 0/10 but due to IMDb I have to give at least a 1. That is how awful and stupid this movie is. The only 2 good things about this movie are the Universal logo and when this movie finally over. Although I haven't really sat through this piece of crap I'm still giving it my review y'all could hate on me but I don't care. Okay, so yea I've only sat through like half hour or so but I had to turn off the TV because it was really stupid and unrealistic in terms of college and probably the worst movie of 2012 that I've seen. This movie is not funny it's stupid and inaccurate when it comes to being in college. The students in the movie are not even carrying any books around, so what do students do in the movie? Do they learn anything? Another thing, the selection of music. The selection of music in this movie is absolutely horrible, I hate modern pop it's really stupid and overrated and they only played that in this movie and with People in this movie messing it up even more now it's even more annoying now and then they try to rap to a throwback from the 80s or 90s, wow really why? That's my jam there and they just messed it up with their annoying ass auto tuned singing voices. Plus this movie is not funny it's dumb, annoying and overrated, critics why are you giving this piece of crap so much credit that it does not deserve at ALL? That goes for people too that suck this movie's dick. Seriously the score for this movie is too high, a 7.2 is way too high for this movie . I'm not even gonna bother finishing this movie, half hour is already a lot of time wasted on this bull-crap, okay Fat Amy is not funny at all people I didn't laugh at her jokes once, because there stupid and unfunny to me and all the rest of the humor in this damn movie is dumb and unfunny. I do not recommend this movie, If you like stupid ass overrated movies or crap like Glee or anything like that you'll like this one but otherwise if you do have common sense, do not waste your valuable hard working time, your time is much much more important than this movie. I would NEVER pay money to even get this on DVD. So yea people don't watch this movie this movie sucksand is stupidly overrated and over-hyped. Well people if you get mad at me, you should be grateful that I'm saving you from wasting your valuable time from this movie. Well anyway this it people bye have a great day. Please do not your waste your time on Pitch Perfect it is so absolutely God awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What "Glee" Wishes it Could Be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" is basically "Bring It On", but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleaders?and it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel, "Pitch Perfect" tells the story of Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) an aspiring DJ attending Barden University, who's hobbies include seclusion, nonconforming and listening to Mashups (which kind of makes her a conformist). In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active, her father (who is also a professor at the University) urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club (especially the glee clubs) she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is, until a rather awkwardly nude run-in with one of the members of the The Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition, Beca, as well as a multitude of other "a ca-losers"; including Fat Amy (as advertized) and Lilly, the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper, are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Glee-esque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough, there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK, so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen, about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids (that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie) win their something-or-other championship/tournament, only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing, then that is only because, from synopsis alone, "Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off, let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious, eccentric and immensely engaging cast, which include the likes of Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick, giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre, but also as the new Kristen Bell, but with talent, "Pitch Perfect" does elevate itself far above the mundane-ness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious "Best in Show"-esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, "Pitch Perfect", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments."Pitch Perfect" vs. "Glee": The main reason "Pitch Perfect" works so well is actually quite simple. Where "Glee" is so in love with its self-proclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new "cool", this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups, glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song, while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So, if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of "Glee" (or that awful show "The Sing-Off") but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways, no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what "Pitch Perfect" has to offer.Final Thought: Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side, this is still a PG-13 venture. In short, "Pitch Perfect" is not the raunchy female buddy comedy, filled with overlong skits about feces that "Bridesmaids" was. But good news?"Pitch Perfect" is so much more funny and (more importantly) more accessible than "Bridesmaids" will ever be. What I mean by "accessible" is, men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase: "You wouldn't get it because you're a man." All kidding aside, I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since "Easy A". So, in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012, filled with half-assed attempts such as "That's My Boy" and "The Watch", "Pitch Perfect" is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year, but also the funniest movie of the year (so far); narrowly edging out "21 Jump Street".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

		<shortDescription>What a piece of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprised by the unexpected success of the Pitch Perfect 2; I decided to give a try to the first part. Not that I was planning to see the second but out of curiosity. Let's clarify; I like music but know nothing about the mechanic of it. An acquaintance; well versed in opera, told me that you can get sounds with your mouth and throat than no other instrument can; so the premise of an "a capella" movie must be something interesting.Well; do not lose you time. There are a few know songs but it is hard to believe the music was not instrumental. Choreographs OK; but not better than GLEE which is free to watch. The story is so full of clichés that the characters predict the outcome. The situations and motivations are absurd; but the resolution are even worse It is really not a surprise since characters are not properly defined; so their behavior change according to the movie needs.Acting is terrible. Brittany Snow is able to cause empathy follow in a second place by Skylar Astin; but the rest of the cast is awfully forced or uninterested or boring(like Anna Kendrick ). The worse surprise was Rebel Wilson; she is absolutely not funny.How poorly is this movie directed and scripted that John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks are there also (she is one of the producers and future director of the second installment ) like in Greeks plays as "narrators" basically informing us that performance is good or bad.Again; I know nothing about mechanic of music; but I am pretty sure judges in this kind of competitions evaluate sound quality and originality over modern songs.In brief; do not lose your time.In fact; the only the only moment trying to do something smart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable teen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about a tomboy girl who joins a acappela girlgroup which is in a fight with a boygroup. The girl falls in love with a boy, wants to change the boring stigma of the acapella group, gets in a fight with the lead girl (queen B) and has a troubled relationship with her father: all the classical ingredients for a teen movie.The only reason why I don't give this movie a 1 out of 10 is because of Rebel Wilson: an extremely talented actress who improvised a lot in the movie which made it a little bit more bearable.Pitch Perfect is just a typical teen movie: predictable jokes, predictable characters and a predictable storyline. So its not a surprise that this movie can be described in one word: predictable.If you are between the age of 14/16; I'm sure you will enjoy this movie, especially if you haven't seen a lot of these kind of movies. But if you are in your twenties and pretty much watched all of the classical teen movies, this is just a waste of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a big letdown. Here you have a good cast, a lovely college setting, good costumes and camera-work and great music. I feel the problem is the characters and the script. Intentionally or not, the characters come across as very white-bread and narrow minded. At first I though they were denigrating anyone who was "different" as a way of highlighting that such behaviour is wrong. But actually I think the script is genuinely making fun of anyone who's not a blonde bimbo or jock. Anna Kendrick is sweet but too serious for the lead role of Beca. And her character is too dark. The plot is air thin - guys you've got to give the audience something a bit meatier to chew on. But all that seems to happen is that a group of shrill young women stand around messing up their rehearsals. The End. Great teen movies like Bring It On and Ten Things I Hate About You have some depth and meaning and feeling to balance the goofiness. This movie is pure sugar and that's not good for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who knew that a movie about collegiate music could be so classless?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, I find myself in the minority, but aca-believe it - I didn't enjoy Pitch Perfect. Pitch Perfect has no storyline. It is a droning Cinderella story minus the charm, and based on that knowledge, you won't be surprised when the Barden Bellas (yes, that's their real and extremely uncreative name) finally pull out a win in the college acapella contest against their sworn "enemies" after the proverbial mean stepsister gets out of the way. It has some corny quotes, some of which are funny but can easily be dug up on Pinterest or IMDb. You'll find the same amount of amusement in just reading them, and you can skip the crude "humor" and barfing scenes too! Many PG-13 films I have watched are rather mild and the upped rating is primarily a marketing tactic. This is not one of them. There's some pretty risqué content in this one, so NO, Pitch Perfect is not a cute and harmless movie about a collegiate singing contest. Neither is it really about college or going to class, but maybe Barden is just a hangout for disenfranchised and clichéd misfits and not really a location for education. Fat Amy is somewhat likable but the rest of the one-sided characters are nearly excruciating to watch. Characters are supposed to be the center of a movie in which there is no action, and all I got was a bunch of singing contest commentary and a headache from the absolute meaninglessness and vapidity of this film. I'm disappointed. Unless you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie (like yours truly was), you can easily skip it. Even if you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie, just look out the window and listen to the music instead. The music is (kind of) enjoyable. However, nothing will beat your own pair of headphones or some earplugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer stated: "...Rebel Wilson plays an amazing part and has given the Mean Girls script a run for their money..." I immediately felt the need to speak up and say that this movie is not even in the same category as Mean Girls. Mean Girls is meant to be ironic and satiric. Pitch Perfect was meant to be a plain ol' comedy, but whatever, that's beside the point.The Music: Cliché, stupid, lame - they tried to put some throwbacks in there, but apparently no one knows about music that existed before the 80s. The movie tries to make the "mash-up" a hip new thing. It's not. People have been making mash-ups since music began. What do you think a medley is? Calm down. The lip- syncing was SO obvious and I could hear the audio engineer pitch correcting every singer.The Acting: It wasn't bad. But my next point is...The Writing: The plot was old and overused. The characters were exaggerated to the point where I wasn't sure if they were part of the joke or if I was supposed to take them seriously. The jokes sucked and were sort of racist. Rebel Wilson's lines weren't even that good, but her presence was sort of nice.I get it. A writer tried to cash in on a profitable idea, and it worked. What I don't understand is all the rave reviews this crap got. Was it because a bunch of older men wrote reviews about hot young actresses? That's my best guess. (See Lena Dunham's girls.) I'll never know. What I do know is that I could not watch the whole thing and I had to turn it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new comedic musical is right on pitch. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a student at Barden University whose dream is to move to LA and become a DJ. Beca is uninterested in college, to say the least. Her father is a professor at her school and he advises her to join clubs to get more involved. Beca starts to work at the school radio station along with her admirer, Jesse (Skylar Astin).When Beca's voice is heard by Chloe (Brittany Snow), one of the main girls of The Barden Bellas a capella group, Beca is recruited into this singing group. Jesse ends up joining the rival all-boys a capella group called The Treble Makers.Beca soon realizes that The Bellas need some new music in order to improve their reputation and make it to the finals. However, the leader of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp), is quite headstrong and refuses to change their music. The tension between these girls and The Treble Makers continues to grow and everything begins to unfold.Walking into this movie with very low expectations, I definitely was pleasantly surprised. It is a musical done right. There is no breaking out into song; the only time people sing is during competitions. In fact, the music is terrific and I can't wait to download the entire soundtrack.I was expecting slapstick comedy, especially with Rebel Wilson in the cast, but "Pitch Perfect" rests at the borderline. Speaking of Rebel, this movie would be nothing without her. Hilarious lines mixed with her perfect comedic timing equals a workout for your abs. It comes very close to stupidity but it doesn't quite cross the line."Pitch Perfect" is cute, silly, and fun. If you're looking for some laughs, take a watch. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't want to like it. Despite what you may think I don't want to like movies like this . I hate myself for it. But there's such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just can't help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and gross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this got rated higher than Mean Girls is beyond me. At least Mean Girls managed to be raw without losing its class. Pitch Perfect was so desperate for cheap laughs its cringe worthy. I actually watched it with a group of friends, one actually fell asleep and the others weren't laughin, or at least not at the movie. First of all, (if i remember correctly) a bunch of misfits join a choir to go against a rival group. Okay, where did they even come up with this idea? A UNIVERSITY choir so desperate for members they pick ALL weird girls. But I digress, thats not the worst. Just the immaturity of the plot all throughout. Rivalries like that don't exist, normally people move on and don't dwell on the fact they were teased. Who are they to them anyway? Its just a bunch of pranks and childish competition from adults. And if Anna Kendricks character was supposed to be an average boring girl then they did a perfect job with her. The humor was just gross, the girl throwing up and then having the whistle land in there ughh I almost puked. And the Asian girl saying "I ate my twin in the womb" thats not funny! Or relatable. This is what I mean by "desperate". Then the scene with the puppets singing "F. U. F U very much" OH HO HO is funny becas she said eff you OH! I cannot quote anything except for fat amy talking about her nickname, whereas i can quote almost every scene in mean girls "you go Glen Coco!". There's not that many funny girls' movies out there so there's not much to compare it to. But this movie further emphasizes why there's not that many funny girls' movies out there...The only reason this got a one is because of the effort in the music and choreography. If you like fart jokes and pop songs then this is the perfect movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hideously predictable, cheesy and formulaic. The music is horrific chart pop drivel to match its commercial Hollywood style production. I waited to laugh throughout the entire movie but there was just nothing to laugh at. It is one of the very worst movies I've ever seen. You might just about like it if you happen to be a 10 year old girl. If you have seen any of the 'comedies' where a group of 'quirky misfits' compete in an obscure competition and triumph 'against the odds' and the girl and the guy fall in love at the end and live happily ever after then you have already seen this one - just probably executed in at least a mildly amusing manner. Please don't spend your money on this film. It's just the marketing people of Hollywood cashing in on the dumb and gullible who cotton onto the latest crazes like Xfactor and Britains Got Talent, the latter of which, predictably sparked a series of 'street dance' videos which I'm am sure everyone who loved this film also enjoyed. There are no original ideas here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife told me to come over and sit on the couch with her and watch this funny/cute movie. She had caramel corn so I figured, what the hell, at least I get a snack. From the opening I had a sneaking suspicion this was going to be a movie version of Glee. I asked and she said, "Not really, but there's some singing..." I immediately began to shovel as much caramel corn as I could get, paying close attention to globules of sweet goodness until the bowl was empty, whereupon I got up and went back to work. My sometimes tedious job of localization engineering held far more appeal than a group of angsty college kids slogging their way through a contrived script, towards a plot that Helen Keller could have seen from halfway around the globe.There are no surprises here other than barf. That's right, BARF. The only redeeming moment of this wet turd was the projectile vomiting. Had she vomited on the made-by-kids-forced-into-slave-labor MAC, I would have given this movie another star.The whole, "oh dad just leave me alone to be me" thing has been absolutely beaten to death year after year by Hollywood to the point where I didn't think anyone in their right mind could possibly consider funding this garbage. I guess when you are going to piggy back off the success of a (only the gods know why) hit TV series, anything goes.I honestly don't see the appeal in ripping off everyone's music to make yet another version with lame electronic beats being thrown about.Dear wannabe DJ rejects,Owning a MAC doesn't make you a DJ, sorry. Anyone can own a iPod, MAC and or better notebook/laptop/tablet and download MP3s and then play them at a party.Owning a giant pair of headphones with a lot of bass doesn't make you a DJ either. Anyone, literally ANYONE on this freaking planet can buy headphones.Ruining original music by slapping whatever garbage beats you think are fresh/phat/sick/dope doesn't make you more innovative or interesting at all. Could you be more unoriginal? A one year old crapping himself while giggling can come up with this stuff. Just put the MAC in front of him and let him start slapping away at the keys and before you know it, a rave/party/whatever will break out.It takes 0 talent to cut and paste some MP3s together, layer your own BS you've ripped off of someone else, then start altering the pitch while holding one earphone up to your head and gyrating like a complete idiot. Go learn to play an instrument and get some musical background and before you know it you'll be tossing all that electronic crap in the garbage where it belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply love acapella music, I might be actually interested in a soundtrack if the songs sampled are actually full-length.BUT - the predictability of this movie is simply unbelievable at all levels: the plot, the ethnicity and sexual choice of 'misfits', the 'romance', the twist, the ending. You name it you have it and more. The characters are cartoons of the flat B&amp;W sketched type. I am not a big fan of political correctness but the jokes when not 'punny' where quite offensive to many people. I'm beginning to suspect that it may have been generated by a free smart phone app. This best-before 80's formula self-describes when one girl enjoys wallowing in another's vomit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly thought this would be a new favorite movie for me. However even half-way through I just knew I would never want to see it again. I am stunned that so many people think it's fantastic. Honestly a lot of the people I know who adore this movie are really immature. But I guess that's beside the point. Pitch Perfect reminded me of that movie that you think is awesome when you're thirteen, and when you watch it again in your early twenties you can't believe you ever liked it. The characters are unlikable (besides Fat Amy because she's the only one who says anything slightly funny), and it's a really predictable story that is WAY too cliché. Granted, there are some okay movies that are predictable that you still enjoy watching (The Proposal for instance), but this is not one of them. Bottom line; this is a movie that was extremely overrated and made out to be some fantastic, enjoyable favorite, when in reality it was boring, dumb, and on the verge of annoying. I am truly shocked at the high reviews people gave it because I think it is one of the worst movies I've seen.</fullReview>

And that's the core: Most of the people in this movie are just RUDE. If you laugh at the opening vomit-scene there is no doubt you will love the rest of this movie but gosh was that scene in bad taste!Worst part is: The sining is not half-bad! It's the dialogue that drags it down and these chliché group of teenagers whose try desperately to be "special" (which is good) and then fall in the same trap most other modern teenage movies like StepUp3D do.After so many anabolic-muscles and girlish overacting girls it's just black magic to me that no one seems to question this film's message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good and bad takes turns in this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem of this movie is that there are some very good scenes and some horrible ones. Let's have a look at it, shall we?The good: The romance between Anna and Skylar was set up nicely. The scenes in the radio studio were cute. The acapella performances were cool. (I'm no expert) The super-nerd who is finally allowed to join the group and turns out to be really good. Nice. The bad: - I don't like Rebel Wilson as a comedian. Even though her character had some killer lines, she delivers them with little comic timing or joy. (Let me clarify the term "joy": The character she plays is not a cheerful one. I get it. But have you seen Kevin Spacey in Horrible Bosses? Now there's an actor who enjoys his work. Or Melissa Mc Carthy in Identity Thief? See what I mean?) I don't understand why people think she's funny. But that's just my (very) personal opinion. - Some ideas of the movie are half-baked at best. Like for example Anna Camps character. The entire movie she behaves like a jerk and at the end the're all friends. Just like that. I expected more of this conflict. Or the arrogant DJ who doesn't listen to Becas music. Then he does listen to it and thinks it's good. What happens then? What about Becas DJ career?? - The Bellas are pretty boring (performance wise) 90% of the movie. Then they come up with crazy-genius performance for the finals. Out of the blue!! Wouldn't they have had to practice for this? Seemed pretty complex to me, considering how they sucked as a group before. - The group is the usual mix of clichés. We have a colorful mix of people. But none of them really matters.The ugly: - Some elements are just plain stupid. The Asian girl of the group has no voice, but gets picked for the team. They had an audition, man! What was the point of that? Then her character utters these ridiculous nonsense one-liners here and there. She appears to be a total sociopath, but everybody is OK with this? Please... - Becas roommate is (again: for no reason at all) really hostile and unfriendly. We get no explanation. It makes no sense and should not be in the movie. That's bad and sloppy story telling.So all in all it's a decent movie that has some scenes that sort of ruin everything and prevent it from being a really good movie. Pity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a movie made out of weaker Glee episodes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the everywhere-talked-about release of the sequel to this 2012 movie, I thought it was high time finally give the original a watch. It proved not a good idea. The humor in here basically includes the level of vomiting, terrible word plays about penetration and menstrual cycles. This is a 105-minute movie directed by Jason Moore and written by Kay Cannon based on Mickey Rapkin's novel. Cannon returned for the sequel, Moore did not. Instead they went with Elizabeth Banks as director and she has a common past with Cannon, who is mostly famous for writing "30 Rock" episodes. I quite like this television series, so i was really baffled how bad her writing for this film here was. Anna Kendrick is an actress I actually quite like. She has charisma, looks and talent, a combination which is not too common these days. And she tried her best so that her performance could make up for many other flaws with this movie, but in the end it just wasn't enough. The script is just too bad. They start the film with giving Beca's main rival in the group a moment as embarrassing as it gets, so we could dislike her right away and prefer Kendrick's character. Rebel Wilson is like a younger Melissa McCarthy with the difference that she is entirely unfunny. I mentioned bad plays on words earlier and there are more of these. The repeated use of "aca-scuse me" was a negative highlight. Another flaw with this film was the ridiculous idea to include a guidebook according to which the singers were not allowed to have relationships with the guys from the rivaling men-only singers group.I said in the title that there are some connection with Glee and it is true. They picked band members of all kinds of ethnicities, of all kinds of sexual preferences and of all kinds of body shapes, only they did not elaborate on it any further really. Basically, we know nothing about any of the character's except Kendrick's and that is quite an achievement for a film which has so many characters and runs for not too much under two hours. A very very negative achievement. One of the very few positive things about this film is the music, which wasn't as bad as the rest really. However, the band's final performance which apparently blew everybody away did not particularly wow me. I was pretty disappointed by this film. I hope Kendrick's next projects will be better. She showed us a couple times in the past that she is one of the best actresses from her generation, but movies like this one here do not do her justice. Not even close. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not here to rain on someone's parade. If you enjoy this kind of stuff, it's OK with me. But I don't understand how something so inane could be so popular. It fails on so many levels. First of all, there is absolutely no realistic character development. These kids are just boring. They are types, thrown together because of their quirkiness, their ethnicity, their race, or even their sexual preference. The sad thing is that doing this doesn't lead to anything interesting. Ooh! You mean a fat girl could actually be talented!! I'll admit they have good voices, but so does everyone else in this film. So, where's the conflict? The leader threw up as they were performing for a national championship and is trying to get a second chance? Then there's the sullen main character. I got tired of her and her whiny portrayal in about five minutes. I couldn't care less if they won because I didn't like any of them. Throw in those boorish idiot commentators who never say one funny thing the whole show, and it becomes a snoozefest. A couple numbers are OK but there is no suspense or interest built up. When the big face off comes, we don't wonder for a second what is going to happen.</fullReview>

In fact, I find everything about this film to be wrong. First, the two judges keep saying very mean things about contestants, and on many occasions say degrading things about female contestants. They just don't seem to respect women.Second, all the ethnic minority characters are portrayed as freaks. The Korean roommate is super rude, the Asian singer is mute, and the Negro singer is lesbian who takes advantage of every situation like a nymphomaniac. Third, they are an acapella group, yet they have background music when they sing. The story is not inspiring or gripping either. I just don't understand what's right with this film.</fullReview>

I gave this movie a 2, and the only reason I gave it that is I have to save 1 star for a movie that is worse than this one. Just to let you know, the acting was horrible, the plot was not in evidence anywhere in the film. At least they were consistent the writing was just as bad as the acting, and let's not forget the brains behind this whole pathetic movie the director, he was just as inept as everyone else.The story is somewhat of a "Bring It On" melded with "Glee", and a little "Full Metal Jacket" not that anything in the movie reminded me of Full Metal Jacket", but it did make want to eat my gun, just like Private Pyle.Oh and while I am on the topic the little lie I told myself was that at least once they got to the competition at least these kids would be able to sing, wrong again, the music is not even any good. I suppose when you bring a lot of no name actors/actresses into a movie that was poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted then you probably shouldn't expect much from it, hence the generous 2.Do yourself a favor, don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this, I would rather watch Curling Finals from Quebec, at least it's funny.</fullReview>

Beca decides to join the group but is in conflict with the Aubrey who seems to think despite evidence to the contrary that selecting safe songs from the last century will beat her all male rivals from the same college, the Treblemakers.The film has a feel good feeling with plenty of songs new and old sang in pitch perfect a-cappella, great if you are a fan of the TV series Glee.The film is however pitch perfectly predictable, schmaltzy and with all the stereotypes under the sun with some racist undertones (what a surprise its a Universal picture, the company well known for killing off the black guy in the first ten minutes!)People from Far Eastern heritage have a hard time getting decent representation in films but here they make one Asian person out to be a weirdo and another to be socially intolerant and racist against whites. The black lady is a butch lesbian and the guy who gets his group disqualified because he was not a student is black as well. For some reason because the the filmmakers want you to think they are equal opportunity racists they also picked on deaf Jews in order to make a DJ joke.Anna Kendrick's character is dislikeable and her love story subplot was poor. Aubrey is so bossy you wonder why she is not on stage as a soloist as no one else would ever sing with her because of her attitude.Aubrey never realises that getting nearly beaten by a glove puppet singing group might be more to do with her failings.On the positive side the songs keep things bubbling along, it presumably would make for a good date film even though there is some gross out humour here and there. Rebel Wilson keeps things fun playing the bubbly fat stereotype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this movie 5 stars (instead of say, 1) because it was watchable enough to hold my interest, some of the singing scenes were fun, and the characters were all right. I understand that this movie is aimed at the tween set and the need to go "a bit deeper" wasn't really seen. That being said, this movie was extremely surface level - it doesn't have the makings of the classic I thought it might be based on its level of popularity, and what's sad about that is that it did have the ingredients.The main problem with this movie was that it wasn't SATISFYING. Part of the thrill of movies like this is that the mean characters finally get what they deserve or learn their lesson, and the hard work or effort of the more likable characters finally pays off in a triumphant series of scenes, but that just doesn't happen to any of the "bad guys" (I use that term loosely) in this film, and when the various climaxes hit, it was very hard for me to truly give a crap. The little bit of depth required to take this movie into the realm of "memorable" just wasn't put in. The result of this is that we don't care as much as we could, and a feeling of vague annoyance permeated my overall enjoyment while I was watching. I do understand that this is supposed to be a light, fun movie, but I'm sorry, there are dozens of classic light, fun movies (including those aimed at a younger audience) that have that WEE bit of substance that make them truly affecting and inherently non-shallow. The film tries to teach lessons, but ends up sending very mixed messages. Thus, the movie is shallow, and that is different from being light. Not only that, but the storyline was fairly weak (though the premise was pretty good, although there are plenty of affecting movies with fairly weak story lines, so that is not the main problem for me) and the dialogue at points was truly the opposite of terrific (again, that is not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it didn't help matters).SPOILERS:Examples of bad guys not getting what they deserved: a) Aubrey. She is the perfectionist leader of the group who refuses change, and there are many, many scenes with her bossing around (and being a total B*TCH to) Chloe, Beca and the girls. We spend the whole movie waiting for her to "get hers" but guess what, it never really happens. Whenever Beca tries to stand to Aubrey, it is so weak it is practically out of character, and no one ever really backs her up. So finally there is a very weak scene in which it all the girls finally decide to *kind of* stand up against Aubrey, (which is begun when Chloe FINALLY takes a stand against the abuse, and we are totally robbed of the satisfaction because Fat Amy directs her "stop fighting, guys!" at CHLOE and not Aubrey?!?) it ends in a ridiculous group fight complete with Lilly making angel wings in Aubrey's vomit. What the heck? Yes, the troop changes and tries something new and wins as a result, but I found it extraordinarily unsatisfying, and the climax utterly fails to penetrate the heart. b) Bumper. This is the leader of the Bellas' rival a Capella troop the Treblemakers, who is a gigantic buffoon. This guy insults and dismisses people constantly, but instead of getting any payback he turns out to be the most successful guy in the whole movie, exiting upon getting some kind of audition in LA. Um, excuse me? So being a ruthless jerk that doesn't care about people and throws burritos at people from a moving vehicle is your ticket to success. Is that it?c) Beca's Dad. Yes, we get it, she is super rude to him and wants nothing to do with him because he and her mom got a divorce. Even though they eventually reconcile, I was still expecting there to be some back story that explains why he doesn't seem to care that she is obviously extremely hurt over their divorce. On the flip side, he also doesn't get the apology he deserves from her, either. Final scene with them: completely unsatisfying. Light. Fluffy. Whatever.d) Beca herself. She treats the guy that loves her (and that deep down inside she also loves) like crap for scene after scene, and gets on his case for doing wonderful things to help her. He *finally* stands up for himself, and it is slightly satisfying, but um, still, not really. But out of all the examples, this one was the most well-done, thankfully. I actually did enjoy the dynamic between Jesse &amp; Beca and thought it was one of the best aspects of the movie, cliché as it was.That aside, it wasn't funny, although I believe it was intended to be. I myself have found plenty of movies really funny when the critics say they weren't, etc. so this could be a personal thing, but I didn't laugh once. (I am the type to laugh at barf and farting and diarrhoea in movies, so I'm not THAT hard to please in this department.) But anyway, the example that stands out the most is the banter between competition commentators Gail and John-- it was bizarrely non-witty and unfunny, whereas this could have been the best part of the movie. For instance, another one of this movie's ultra-weakly executed lessons was to show that "girls can do it, too" and that ties into John's (and Gail's) anti-girl attitudes and comments. However, there's no payoff at the end. The girls finally do something original. Gail tells John he's a misogynist. John doesn't appear to care, or to have leaned his lesson, based on admitting they did a good job.&nbsp;Dats all folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God if you're squeamish, don't watch this film. The vomiting in this movie is just, it's just too much. Especially the climax where she throws up everywhere is just absolutely gross and disgusting, it's not funny in the slightest, I could barely eat the entire day. The comedy is really cheap and the jokes are absolutely awful, I only gave this a 3 to be nice. Fat Amy is probably the best character in the entire film, which is decent, she was pretty good in Night at the Museum, which was great, but this isn't Night at the Museum, this is PitchPerfect, bitch! If you get turned on by puke, then oh BOY do I HAVE a movie for you. So Ya, eggplants suck, Believe in the Shield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to watch this movie, I like Anna Kendrick and everyone had amazing things to say about this. I'm not a fan of musicals at all, I always skip the singing parts in movies. But I actually liked the performances in this. I'd never buy the soundtrack but the performances didn't bore or annoy the hell out of me. The first half of the movie was way more enjoyable than the second part. Anna Camp's character was getting on my nerves, and the conflicts with the Bellas ended up going on and on and it was so obvious how it would end up, and I was just annoyed and waiting for them to get the hell over it and skip to the part where they all listen to Beca. The film is highly predictable, you can guess everything that is gonna happen 10 minutes into the movie. Because of this, I was getting impatient waiting for things that I knew would happen, to finally happen. The movie had quite a few moments, but I wouldn't watch it again. I understand why people would enjoy this movie and look pass its flaws though. It wasn't the great movie I was expecting, but I don't regret watching it either. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure I don't need to tell you that this film wouldn't even exist if not for Glee. We have a team of misfit girls including a gay one, a fat one, a quiet psychopath, a projectile vomiter etc. who take on professional singing harmony groups in a contest. They start off terrible, and are the laughing stock of the school. But gradually, when the leader of this kooky troupe realises that OTHER PEOPLE'S ideas besides hers could work, and when they APPRECIATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE SKILLS while BONDING AS A UNIT, things start to click. Then come the final contest... they finish last before killing themselves. I kid, I kid.There is a tune in this movie called The Cup Song in which an auditionee for the competition improvises using only a beaker to perform a catchy little ditty. This has quickly become a much imitated fad on Youtube, with many wannabees trying (and usually failing) to copy the scene. It's a shame then, that the rest of the screenplay is as predictable as Katie Price's latest pregnancy, being stuffed full of obvious jokes and hoary old plot devices. The production numbers are good, even show-stopping in some cases, but is that enough to recommend it? Not really.Still, if you're young and haven't yet been rendered a cynical Statler and Waldorf clone by this strange, cruel world, you might be able to enjoy it more. To which I respond by saying: I don't envy your taste, but can I have your youth?! 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but Problematic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film aside from the racism (against Asians), sexism (slut shaming), and homophobia (against lesbians). Let's start with the racism - the Asian roommate almost never speaks, only has Asian friends, calls the main character "white girl", and is the only one (along with her friends) depicted playing video games. The Asian character that is in the "Bellas" speaks so softly you can't hear her, and says she ate her twin in the womb. The only possible joke here is one based on the stereotype of Asians as meek, and it is both unfunny and confusing.Next, the sexism. The film focuses on women in a largely positive light, but there are still harmful undertones lurking throughout. Women are kicked out of their troupe for having sex with members of competing troupes, but the men are not subject to the same punishment. This could just be an over the top description of reality (and fits the troupe leader's character), but when coupled with the remaining character who "has sex a lot" and admits it as if it is a bad thing, it seems more problematic. Finally the homophobia. Really not a fear of gays, but rather a distasteful mocking of them. The members of the troupe are constantly wondering if the character played by the black actress is a ~lesbian~ like it is some taboo subject and something to laugh at. Then, when she admits that she has a gambling problem, and later reveals she is a lesbian, the other characters seem to get some type of weird joy like "OMG we knew she was gay the whole time!" Literally the whole (unfunny and dragged out) joke was that this character was lesbian. Ha. Ha.The rest of the movie was pretty funny. Without these three unfunny, problematic, and hurtful lines of "comedy", I would probably rate it as an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chick-flick that will either annoy or amuse you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I didn't like this movie very much, I'll give it a less biased overview first, then talk about what I personally disliked in it in the back half. This is a very strong chick-flick comedy. I haven't seen very many movies like this since it's not really my scene, but I suppose the producers did a decent job with the movie. They included some rising stars that will probably be remembered for this movie. The film is memorable with lots of things to replicate and quote such as the aca- prefix and the cup beat. So in that regard, the filmmakers did their job well. Even though I didn't appreciate the comedy, I suppose it was well scripted and acted with decent proficiency. The characters, though, were a bit more of a problem. It seemed to me like most of them were poorly written. Almost every character either acts like a jerk or is put in a position where they are laughed at because of being a certain stereotype or whatever (e.g. Cynthia Rose being lesbian, Benji's nerdy magic acts). They are, however, redeemed by having very distinct personalities. The only characters that I feel are exceptions to the previous statement are Fat Amy and Chloe. Fat Amy is able to generate humor without being mean or picked. This holds true for Chloe as well, though her character has below average depth and personality. However, Chloe is rather pivotal in the eventual transformation of the Bella group. I'll touch lightly on the other three main characters/groups of the movie, being Aubry, Beca, and the Trebles. Aubry is basically an antagonist for most of the movie, and is pretty hateable, and potentially annoying, but her obstinacy in retaining the Bellas' tradition was insufficiently explained. Beca has a detectable personality, but her character has relatively little depth, and she's rather unlikable and too easily irritated as main characters go. This especially detracts from her character since she basically becomes leader of the Bellas toward the end and hasn't really connected with the other girls in the group, though she has gained their respect and sympathy. Lastly, the rival Treble Makers are the main villains and have three key characters of Bumper, Donald, and Jesse. Jesse becomes kind of a protagonist and is more likable than the other Trebles since he tries to ingratiate himself with Beca. Bumper is a character that you can hate without trying, which is good since he's a villain. Donald, which is the Treble with glasses and a lot of screen time, fits the cinematic a Capella guy mold of dorky and annoying, which is established early in the movie.The storyline is set up like a sports movie, and this is mostly accounted for by the various a Capella competitions throughout. It's fairly predictable, like lots of sports films though this is fictional and comedic of course, and there aren't any surprise ending style elements. The humor seems to be fairly mainstream female comedy, though my knowledge in that field is limited so don't take that as fact. There's a fair amount of sexual jokes and such in it, accounting for the PG-13 rating. There are also a number of running gags that mostly pertain to the characters (e.g. Aubry's vomiting at the beginning of the film). Beca's being promoted to leader of the Bellas near the end was kind of corny and inconsistent with Aubry's character, but they made the scene into a joke so that kind of made up for it.That's about it for the unbiased portion of the review. I'll try to keep my opinions fairly brief in this back half. This movie did not really fit my personality. I wouldn't have chosen to see it and definitely wouldn't have chosen to sit through it. The only reason I did either is because I felt like I owed my brother for having him go to Battle of Five Armies, and he said I could pay him back by sitting through this. As I said before, I felt like the characters were all either picked on or were jerks throughout. The comedy wasn't really that palatable to me, so that caused me to have more of a problem with the smaller issues of the movie throughout. I can understand why other people enjoy it, but it just doesn't have the same affect on me. Most of the characters were really annoying, especially when they involved the Trebles, the two competition announcers, or the aca- prefix. I was considering having "Pretty aca-nnoying" as part of my headline, but there are enough of those already, so there's no point. In short, nothing from the first installment makes me want to go and see the sequel that's coming out in a month or so.You can watch this under almost any number of circumstances. It's fine to see it on your own. You can watch clips of it and enjoy each individual scene. It's good to watch with a bunch of friends since there's not really any big plot points that will be missed if you don't catch a few lines. So while, I hated this movie, I suppose it's worth a shot for anyone looking for a decently executed comedy. Overall Rating: 4.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beca joins her college a Capella group in order to get more socialized. I have heard too many things about pitch perfect, but watching it now seems like going back to those old good glee days. The new window that glee had opened for musicals and social school mainly matters, with the outcasts being the main focus, is, now days, too over run. So pitch perfect is nothing original. It can bring back memories of high school musical even. Some of the scenes were funny, except from the puking. I mean, after the first scene, the constant reminder of it and its repetition is just annoying. For the rest of the movie, things are just too predictable that you can guess what will happen from the fist few minutes of the movie. So 3 for pitch perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny and not about singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday and I couldn't find almost any humour in it. I giggled a couple of times and that's it. About the musical side, I think that good singers sing for the love of music itself, not to celebrate themselves, which appears to be what moves those "singers" instead. Singing it's a matter of heart, not only of vocal cords, a thing that x-factor-like performers, like the characters of this movie, fail to understand. In my opinion these kind of performances should be held in circuses, because of the kind of skills involved.Anyway I suppose it's a passable teenager movie, but not for particularly bright kids, which can choose among many other better movies if they're interested in music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like camp rock, but college</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen I've never written a review on here before but looking at that score I just kind of felt like I had to. First off it's almost impossible to stand Anna Kendrick's character, she's always complaining about something, which I could get behind if she wasn't complaining about things that us normal people can only dream about, such as free college, the most perfect guy ever likes her (seriously no guy on earth is that perfect), a big group of people want to be her friends. I know it's awful right? The reason she complains about the free college is because her dad is making her go (he's a professor, that's why it's free) but she's an adult, if she doesn't want to go she doesn't have to, but if she didn't go there wouldn't be a plot. Anyway, I didn't think it was that funny either, Rebel Wilson was the only one that made me laugh, and even then I didn't laugh that often. Maybe I just don't get singing humor. Even then they keep using the same gags over and over "aca-awesome" and the one girl that's really quiet and the lesbian, it gets old, it wasn't even that funny the first time. Anyway, the plot is boring anyway, self-absorbed brat joins a club she didn't want to join and finds out she likes it and makes new friends. How original! By the way, Becca mentioned her "stepmonster" one time and she was never brought up again, was she really a monster? Because she tends to exaggerate I mean she made free college sound like prison. Sorry that my review is a train wreck, but it doesn't make the movie any less of one. Also I typed this on a phone there are bound to be typos.</fullReview>

I'm Japanese, so I don't know much about what is the young in America and their school life, so I can learn those things from this movie. Off course, I don't have much knowledge about American music, so when I watched this movie. I didn't understand which song was old or how famous song it was. However, characters in this film do excellent and energetic performance, so foreigners can enjoy all the time, I think. Also, riff-off is a must-see. There is it in the middle of this film, all singers are so sexy and they sing very famous song, so I sang to myself. Main characters have a great individuality and you will also enjoy their joke and dialogues.If you watch this film, you will understand why it became so popular and be loved by people whole world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect stars Anna Kendrick,Skylar Astin,Anna Camp,Brittany Snow and Rebel Wilson and tells the tale of an up and coming DJ named Becca(Kendrick)who is picked by a group called The Barden Bella's(ran by Brittany Snow and Anna Camp)after they had a disastrous final last year and they are setting up new members to try and pick up where they left off. Becca of course falls for a guy called Jesse(played by Skylar Astin who I swear could pass off as Zachary Levi's twin brother may I add)and of course The Barden Bella leader doesn't want any romance whatsoever involved cause that could ruin their group. So the new found group that involves Becca,and a few more including the hilarious Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who is the showstopper here and they try and compete in the accapella finals.Overall I really enjoyed this movie as I got it on DVD recently and I was watching it last night. For those of you that don't know what Accapella is its basically a group of people that sing without any backing tracks as they do the backing tracks themselves with their mouths. The story was good and I liked the songs they did in Accapella style like Don't You Forget About Me from The Breakfast Club,The Tin Cup song,Let's Talk About Sex,and a few more. If you love Glee the TV show or if you watch YouTube and you listen to accapella music on that site then you will like this movie.Elizabeth Banks (who co-produced this film and directed the sequel which I also got)stars.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this film was about singing, and I knew a couple of the female stars in it, as for everything else, I was looking forward to seeing this sleeper hit for myself. Basically at the annual International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAC), at Lincoln Center in New York City, the Bellas, from Barden University, are the first all- female group to make it to the finals. But they cannot compete against the all-male Treblemakers, as they perform uninspired arrangements, outdated girl songs, and they are humiliated by Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) vomiting during her solo. Four months later, freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) is a new arrival at Barden, she has no desire to attend college, but her professor father (John Benjamin Hickey) has forced her, she wants to pursue a career as a DJ and music producer in Los Angeles, she spends her time making mash-ups and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). Beca's father finds out she has not been attending classes, so he makes a deal with her, if she joins a club and still wants to leave college after a year, he allow her to do so, and will pay her way to Los Angeles to pursue her career. Beca is persuaded by Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow) to join to Barden Bellas, Aubrey initially disapproves, but she sees Beca has talent, and soon other members join, that do not fit the group's typical mould, including Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie Conrad (Alexis Knapp), Lilly Onakuramara (Hana Mae Lee) and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). The new Bellas lineup perform at the southeastern regional competition at Carolina University, but at Aubrey's insistence they perform the same medley they did at the finals the previous year, but they do get second place and will progress to the semi-finals. Disaster strikes when the Treblemakers cause an uproar with the Bellas after the competition, Beca accidentally smashes a window with the trophy, she is arrested by the police, but Jesse, who joined the Treblemakers, bails Beca out, but it gets worse when her father gets involved and tells her he will no longer pay for to go to Los Angeles. Beca is infuriated and her friendship with Jesse is soured, and Aubrey will not listen to her suggestion for the Bellas to be more daring, at the semi-finals, during the Bellas' "traditional" performance, Beca provides an impromptu back-up of one of her favourite songs, the audience enjoy the remix, but the Bellas come third, behind the Footnotes and the Treblemakers. Aubrey is furious with Beca, who in turn quits, but things improve when the Footnotes are later disqualified from the national competition, because the lead singer was actually still in high school, meaning the Bellas can take part instead. The Bellas reform after spring break, without Beca, Chloe stands up to Aubrey for her stubbornness, the group fall apart, Beca meanwhile is declined an apology from Jesse, so she returns to the Bellas, apologising for her actions at the semi- finals, she wants another chance, Aubrey eventually allows it. Having had a heart-to-heart conversation, the Bellas decide to adopt Beca's more modern and original music style, meanwhile Treblemakers group leader Bumper Allen (Adam Devine) leaves after being offered a job to be backup singer for John Mayer, Jesse convinces them to let his previously rejected roommate Benji Applebaum (Ben Platt) join the group. At the a cappella national competition, the Bellas, with Beca's arrangement, sing a modern song, plus a performance of "Don't You (Forget About Me)", featured in The Breakfast Club, one of Jesse's favourite movies, this acts as a more effective apology from Beca, following the performance Beca and Jesse kiss, the Bellas win the competition, and six months later, they audition for new members. Also starring Elizabeth Banks as Gail Abernathy-McKadden, John Michael Higgins as John Smith, Alexis Knapp as Stacie Conrad, Ester Dean as Cynthia Rose, Hana Mae Lee as Lilly Onakuramara, Kelley Alice Jakle as Jessica and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Tommy. Kendrick is likable as the determined would-be DJ and new talent to the gang, Camp is convincingly annoying as the uptight soloist, and Wilson with her Australian accent and big screen presence (literally) gets many of the laughs being the loud eccentric one. It is a simple story, an a cappella girl group struggling get a new talent and improve dramatically, there are clichés and stereotypical characters, but the script is smart, the energy is razor-sharp, and the singing talent and soundtrack in splendid, it is a most enjoyable musical comedy. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Were we shocked when Jason Moore a musical director was announced as director of Pitch Perfect? Of course not. The story is based on a book but brought to life using Kay Cannon's writing of the screen play and Jason Moore's musical background. Pitch perfect is a teenage comedy with a musical twist (cute, silly and fun). The star character is Beca who joins and a Capella group but has high hopes of becoming a DJ. The film is gripping with ups and downs. Obviously! It has silly goofs, falling, puking and love. Beca is a freshman at Barden University. She Joins the Bellas, an all-girls singing group due to flattery and persuasion. The girls re-energised enter a campus competition against the other groups. The Star of the show is Anna Kendrick playing the beautiful Beca. The funniest character is Rebel Wilson playing fat Amy; revealed to the audience later why she has this nickname.The characters are bubbly with the girls being silly and the guys being bad boys. Of Course! It's a good musical with amazing song choice and no random breaking into song. God that would be annoying! There is no manly action but a lot is happening at any given time. The comedy is different we expect adult humour or clown like humour but what we get is immature childish humour thanks to Rebel Wilson's remarks and improvisation.In Conclusion, I would recommend this film to anyone who's as immature as me if not you will hate it, so don't watch it. I would strongly recommend it if you enjoy childish humour with an adult twist due to some inappropriate language and scenes.</fullReview>

It would not WoW at all, If the movie hint about Blumper's careers but it's WoW and not hard to believe because it's always hint with Blumper's characteristic.On the stage when Benji's show the magic, it would be just cool but no meaningful if it wasn't that his "weird" hobby made him fail to join the group. ... Yes! that was counted.And this movie great enough to avoid the cliché scene when the lead role get the trophy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom and sister saw this before me and said it was really funny. So i watched it with a friend and we both really enjoyed it. I thought it would be a cheesy chick flick but it ended up being a really funny movie that is now one of my favorites! Pitch Perfect tells the story of Beca, a girl who goes to Barden University for college. Her father is a professor and he tells her that she has to join a club. She decides to join The Barden Bellas, an all-girl acapella group who only sings the same 3 songs every year. When Beca joins she decides to shake things up and tries to add new, more relevant songs. Aubrey, the controlling, dominant leader of the Bellas, freaks out at her. Later, she realizes that no one likes her controlling, boring ways so she lets Beca join again and lets her be the new leader and they take the championship and win! It is hilarious and very enjoyable to watch and afterwards, you just immediately want a sequel to come. Pitch Perfect is a must-watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi my name is Carlo I watched pitch perfect 2 the last week and I thought it was fantastic and brilliant and funny too the acapella music in the film was outstanding. I've been thinking negative, last week but when I heard the music in the film it made me think positive as I've got learning difficulties. And it really hit me deep down inside emotional and the last song you did (flash light) really got me emotional. Finally the last I was going to say that I forgot mention was the dances in the film was really good and the cast were fantastic especially Hailee Steinfeld she was brilliant at singing by herself. I hope you guys like my comment as now I am be a crazy pitch Pitch perfect fan like I'm like a fan of my favourite girl group little mix. thanks c.crolla</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a movie like this gets great ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and even my well trusted friends, I expected great things. But in reality the movie is clichéd and relies way too heavily on popular songs to please the audience. The writing is poor and the funny moments are rare to come. As much as I love music, films focused on music or musicals are never my thing. Pitch Perfect is obvious not a musical, but it's pretty close to a Camp Rock film with a PG-13 rating. In reality, the film could have easily passed for a Disney Channel movie if it weren't for a few swears and sexual jokes.Anna Kendrick stars as Beca, a hopeful DJ who is pushed into joining a college a cappella group by her father. Sound like a Disney film so far? Just wait until the film is then flooded with an excessive amount of clichéd 'dramatic' relationship moments. We have the prototypical jealous girl who wants to do it her own way but is eventually accepting of the new girl, Aubrey. The overweight character who provides comedic relief by making fun of herself, Fat Amy. Finally, the guy who is on a rival team but falls for her anyway and of course there's a falling out and rekindling just like every other film. Now, there are some redeeming qualities which include Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins strange and outrageous commentary during the performances that give us a few chuckles. Rebel Wilson also has a few funny moments but for the most part the jokes fall flat. The performances are entertaining and well choreographed but it doesn't save a below average film.There are just several contrived moments such as the fight scene that put Beca in jail for a little bit. It's scenes like this and one where Adam Devine's character just flat out leaves the movie that make it a poorly structured film. It turns out to also be incredibly predictable which can be forgiven if the movie was fun to watch, which it wasn't. I just hope the second one is more enjoyable. Just because these films aren't my niche doesn't mean I cant enjoy them, so here's hoping.+Performances &amp; mash-up of songs +Rare funny moments from Banks and Wilson -Contrived plot elements -Disney channel clichés -Cringe worthy writing 4.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Barden Bellas, a female a-cappella group, add University freshman Kendrick to the club, but she brings with her a creative freedom demand that is much needed but might tear them all apart; however, they'll have to agree on something if they hope to stand a chance against their male rivals in a campus competition. The ensemble cast delivers excellently in both acting and singing, and the musical choices are quite sound (pun?). Worthy date-night movie, but all the laughs are targeted to the female viewer. The hypocrisy of Kendrick ranting about how predictable movies are is quite a turn off, considering how textbook the unfolding of this story is. Loosely adapted from the non-fiction PITCH PERFECT: THE QUEST FOR COLLEGIATE A CAPPELLA GLORY by Mickey Rapkin.**? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great music, so-so story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'll admit to not being a fan of GLEE and I don't really get the fascination with acappella. It's just singing without instruments, and the most fun I can see people having with it is as a novelty. Still, I decided to check out PITCH PERFECT and see what all the fuss was about. My general impression was that the musical numbers were pretty good across the board, and quite creative. Everything else just kind of drags it down a bit. The basic plot is that an all-girl college acappella group is trying to redeem themselves after an embarrassing loss at the last year's finals. It also served as an opportunity for a diverse group of girls, who normally wouldn't be together, to get to know each other and become friends. The cast isn't really filled with a lot of recognizable faces, but they all give decent performances. Still, the lack of character depth is apparent and none of them really approach anything past caricatures. Everyone has a couple of characteristics or quirks that get mined for laughs throughout the whole movie, and it did get old after a while. Plot-wise, no new ground was broken either. Everything happens exactly how you expect it to, complete with a last-minute crisis that gets resolved a little too quickly and cleanly. And really, outside of that there really isn't any conflict or reason to care about any of the characters. Still, the musical numbers are quite impressive, and the only reason I'm rating this as high as I am. While the core group, the Barden Bellas, stick to the same songs for the most of the movie, only changing up their act in the final part of the movie, everyone else varies their material and gives it a nice touch. There are a wide variety of songs chosen, and they're performed in visually interesting ways and have good choreography as well. The contemporary soundtrack was also quite good too. Overall, I thought the movie was OK, but nothing to rave about. Despite the great soundtrack and musical performances, the plot is rote and the characters all one-note. It isn't horrible by any stretch, but the only reason to see it is for the music or if you're a GLEE fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Competitive collegiate a cappella. Is this really a thing now, or is it made up for the movie? There were some solid performances here, from Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, and Rebel Wilson. It seems like the ads for this film were all about Miss Wilson, but she is a medium character here. The singing was first-class, but you probably have to like a cappella to truly appreciate it. The plot was exceedingly formulaic. And I suppose that if you are in your teens, or maybe twenties, then teenage angst can seem important, but it is quite boring for those of us who are older. Overall, it was kind of okay, but found myself looking at my watch several times...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music Is Very Good Here, Anna Is OK&lt; The Rest Is Definitely Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why musicals are so popular - nice actors, cool songs, great choreography, excellent soundtrack, merry atmosphere. Yeah, right. This movie, Pitch Perfect, tries hard to be the one, too. It succeeds in several fields, it fails in several other. Yeah, music is very good. Especially, all those a Capella arrangements of such hits as Don't You (Forget About Me) or some more are very good, and really first-class. Yeah, Anna Kendrick is sweet, she performs very realistic, and her vocal delivery is way too great. Her dances are nice, too. But then, the rest goes. Almost all other actors are so all over the place, thrown on a kitchen sink and exaggerated that one can only eye them in utter disbelief. They overdo, overplay, overact almost everything, so the comedy quickly falls onto a farce and a mockery. The film is long, as well, it would've been better if it were shorter. By so far, what we have is a mediocre movie with some unfunny gags, sick scenes and trite jokes. Can be watched once and then quickly dismissed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, But the Song Numbers Can Be Hit or Miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only got wind about this film after I saw a couple of teenagers singing a song a capella while rhythmically flipping tumblers during a birthday party. They said it was from "Pitch Perfect" so I sought out a copy to see what this film was all about.This film's theme is very much like "Glee." Some misfit girls try to make their mark in college by joining a disgraced a capella singing group called the Bellas. The story follows the girls as they try to be the first all-girl group to win Nationals. However, with all the drama queens in their small group (ala "Mean Girls"), it is not going to be easy an easy task.This film is very popular with the teenage set. However, for me, the humor is already very much at the boundary of raunchy comedy at times. Definitely, it crossed the gross-out comedy boundary of PG with all the inexplicably voluminous projectile vomiting scenes. There were some weird comedy like the mousy Asian girl Lilly whose voice was so soft you'd wonder how she got into a singing group at all. (She is cute though, but she says the darnedest things, if you actually hear what she says.)The personality of Beca, as played by Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick, was so unlikable. She sticks out like a sore thumb playing it so seriously while the others were obviously having fun with their characters, especially Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy). I can't really say I was rooting for her at all.The singing scenes, which were supposed to be the highlight of the film, were hit and miss. Some were very good, like "No Diggity" and the other songs sung during the sing-off in the gym. However, there were those where the mix was not too good. The final song number by the Bellas in particular, while generally good, was marred by a terribly pitchy solo by no less than Beca herself.Anyway, despite all my problems with the execution of this film, in general it was entertaining to watch. I can completely see why the teen set loves this film with all the hip song mash-ups and the funny scenes and lines, but I do hope they are mature enough to recognize that is only "comedy," so far from what really matters or happens when they are in college.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was fun, whether i wanted it to be or not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Glee type of movies. Same story, same characters, same perfect improvisational abilities every average teen has (?!?). This movie doesn't differentiate much from the picture, but, somehow i can't give it less than 7/10. OK, the plot is not very innovative, we have the cliché romance string and most of the characters in this movie are generic, but what happened here is that we have a leading female role which is not at all your typical chick. Although many people see and understand her as an 'alternative' girl (she is portrayed like by other characters), she is just an ordinary girl, somewhat socially awkward, trying to follow her dream. Not at all dramatic as an 'alt' person could be, and definitely not emphasizing that what she is. To be said, she doesn't even listen to 'alternative' music, which is a thing that somehow bothers me. If she doesn't listen to that kind of music, doesn't really act like she does, but tries to look like she does, we have a case of a badly put together character. They made her 'alternative' just for the sake of it... Anyways... A bit phlegmatic, she wouldn't fit the role in, let's say, Bring It On, but, she does fit this flick perfectly. Other characters were a variety of templates. The Bellas' leader Audrey and The Treblemakers' leader Bumper were the queen and the king of the cliché, but somehow i got to connect with Audrey. Others like Fat Amy and Lilly were refreshing.I am a musician so this affects me heavily. I HATE the performances of all of groups!! They jump all around the stage and have like the perfectest pitch. It just bothered me to the point i had to sustain myself from skipping the scenes. Not to mention they are auto-tuned to the max. Unless they all had Melodyne in their mics, which they didn't, i find it wrong, unrealistic, even utopistic. And yes, this is where the perfect improvisation skills fall into. You just can't improvise if you don't know the song at all, and if you can, you are a godly talented chap, but the rest of your singing group sure aren't clones of yours. And this is generally what i hate about music movies. You can't convince me if you make mistakes like this. I don't believe anyone could enjoy their 'live' performances when they sound so unnatural. At last, i find John and Geil highly inappropriate and not at all funny.When i read my review i feel like i've given this movie a negative grade, but it actually made me laugh from time to time, i found some of the characters appealing and the overall impression it left after watching it was positive, so, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strains mightily against its PG13 rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" becomes a somewhat painful experience for empathetic souls who can feel the writers struggling against its PG13 constraints. The biggest confirmation of this is a joke involving one of the a Capella singing groups covering Lily Allen's "F*** You". It has to pull its punches by only suggesting bulimia jokes around Anna Camp's character Aubrey. Seriously dark lines are uttered at a whisper by Hana Mae Lee's Lilly although these are some of the funniest in the piece (as a bonding ritual she's asked her biggest secret to she stops the show with "I ate my twin the womb".) It's unfortunate the producers didn't abandon the tween market and go for the "Hangover" hard-R crowd - while funny this could have been hilarious. As far as the cast Rebel Wilson's "Fat Amy" ("it saves you having to call me that behind my back anyway") stands out among a group of actresses not sufficiently distinguishable from each other. In short, while short of its potential, an entertaining film.</fullReview>

Also, I like the main character starts singing with using a cup on the stage at the audition.

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect (2012): Dir: Jason Moore / Cast: Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow: College musical with a title that not only references the music but also the efforts placed on relationships. Anna Kendrick stars as Beca who arrives at college in hopes of becoming a disc jocky. She lands a position at the radio station and then is thrown in the middle of a female singing group called the Bellas, when she is overheard singing in the shower. From there the screenplay details their high spirited competition with an ending we can all see coming, but the music numbers are fetching. First time director Jason Moore seems to be taking the music element seriously while also creating a partial parody of the Step-Up films. The cast are passionate with roles that elevate beyond conventions. Kendrick is fetching as the determined Beca who battles the political side of the Bellas while proving to be the function that is most effective. Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy also steals scenes with the best comic lines. Skylar Astin as Beca's potential love interest who works at the radio station as well as sing in a rival group. His ambition is to write scores for movies. The rest of the cast are amusing types that steal the odd moment but Anna Camp highlights as the spewing Bella leader, and Brittany Snow who overhears Beca singing in the shower thus resulting in a creepy introduction. Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins are also funny as cynical commentators. The film is a tribute to music and culture and it is pitch perfect for its target audience who know the lyrics to the songs as well as the merge in performing arts. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, but not as bad as it could of been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I simply thought: no. I knew it was going to be like any other team based competition movie where the main team we're supposed to be cheering for works their way through the competition until they hit a low point, but then still wins in the end or at least wins morally. I'm not saying that's completely bad, but it gets tiresome watching those types of movies after awhile, and there is always a steady flow of them being released. My friend and I usually agree on what movies we like and dislike, so when I heard he wanted to watch Pitch Perfect 2, I was a little surprised, but I decided to finally give this movie a chance.The main character, Beca, is the most relatable character in the movie to me. She's that person that has a dream of doing something, but is still going to college for other things, and a loner. The most prominent male character, Jesse, doesn't act like a complete idiot. There are scenes where I just wanted to yell "What are you doing!? Sit your ass down and think about what you just did.", but for the most part he is just your average nice guy. These two characters are the ones I looked to for sanity while everyone else was acting stupid or crazy. It doesn't always work, however, because there are bumps in their relationship that I thought were stupid. "Oh, you wanted to help me? I hate you now" "Oh you hate me now? Fine, I hate you too" And then later after the final song:"You sang the song I showed you, so let's kiss". That leads me to the next thing: the other characters are too over the top to be believable. Aubrey was against the changes Beca was trying to make irrationally. It makes more sense when she reveals what her dad's stance would be on them winning: "If at first you don't succeed, pack your bags.", but still. When all the Bellas were in Beca's room and Beca was about to play some of her songs, Aubrey still refused completely even though it would take no effort at all to just listen. Also, the way Bumper treated Benji when he was trying to introduce himself was extremely obnoxious. Who acts like that in real life? I guess if I hated them so much during those scenes, they are doing their job right, but it is too unbelievable for me, and not in a good way like the ridiculous announcers. They were hilarious.Some time early on, I wondered if the Bellas actually deserved to win because at times they seemed like just a bunch of annoying girls, but we got to see them work at it and rehearse. Besides that, there was also significant character development, so that by the end, the main characters were much more likable. We don't get to see the other team practice, but I kept thinking: why would they allow that jerk to be in charge? Near the end, Bumper leaves them to do his own thing, and they realize that he was a jerk, so that was kinda nice.The singing itself, and the performances were entertaining to watch, and nice to listen to. That's to be expected, though, and without them, the movie would fall apart. My favorite was when the teams were having a singing battle outside of the competition. I forgot what they called it, but I liked the spontaneous feel it had to it.I picked up on a couple of general themes throughout the movie. The first being that music is for the ears, and it doesn't matter who is singing as long as it sounds good. Examples: Benji, Fat Amy, Beca. Second is ironically that the same formula won't always work.Like I said, the actual singing holds this movie together, and keeps it from being an irredeemable clichéd college movie. The other scenes can be hard to watch, but are not all bad.</fullReview>

First of all, it's rare that I find NONE of the characters likable. I just hate all of them twenty minutes into the movie. And at thirty minutes, I was already wondering if I should stop watching it. The racist and homophobic jokes are utterly tasteless. What was the director thinking about when producing the movie?If it wasn't for the last twenty minutes, I would've given this movie a 4/10. The plot is slow until the last twenty minutes; the major swerve at the end is nice but is not really plausible for me. I'm seeing Pitch Perfect 2 and I don't have a high hope.

		<fullReview>Acapella performances always amaze me. The fact that this film was based on acapella singing, choreography and musical arrangement makes it fantastic in that sense. If you're really into musicals, this one is a unique and original twist in that genre.But besides that, everything else was meh. Plot line was predictable. Angsty, "different" freshman joins a preppy, all-girls acapella group (The Bellas) in dire need of a makeover in preparation for competition season against their *gasp* All-male rivals, the Treblemakers! In fact, their rivalry is so intense that romantic affairs are forbidden between the two groups *shocker*So what happens next? It's pretty obvious. Characters themselves are also pretty flat, one dimensional and sometimes a bit confusing. They stick to their stereotype and don't deviate much from it. This makes their personalities and plot choices in the movie also easily predictable.So, in conclusion: watch for the music. It's definitely a different approach to the typical "high school musical" genre. But in terms of everything else - don't expect anything too groundbreaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would've enjoyed PITCH PERFECT a lot more were I into acapella, so for most of the movie's runtime, it was fundamentally not my thing. But the similarities to GLEE (and I'm obviously not the first to draw this comparison) are unavoidable: the backstage drama, the love story, the staging of the big stage numbers and the song selection. It'd be GLEE writ large if the tone were a little more fantastical. Still, it's hard not to appreciate the ablities that went into this movie, and it's evident that everyone here is doing their own singing. You've gotta respect the talent here. It did need more Rebel Wilson. And Elizabeth Banks. They're the comedic core of the movie. But this was definitely geared toward the GLEE crowd, which doesn't include me. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The ending is the best part"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quote which is the title of the review is repeated only twice in the whole movie, but serves as an adequate summary of my opinion of it. Another appropriate title would be "Sing 'aaahhh' on three." As the discussion between our main characters Jesse and Beca goes, the endings of a lot of movies (even, apparently, The Empire Strikes Back) are predictable, but the ending is the best part nevertheless. The ending of this movie is obvious from the second Beca and Jesse are introduced, right down to the fact that the final sentence is never completed. But nevertheless, the ending is the best part. The final 30 minutes of this movie make the tortuous parts of the first eighty minutes worth watching. I only liked Jesse at the beginning of this movie, but I liked most of the characters by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The a capella music is great but the story only serviceable and a trifle too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is set at the fictional Barden University, featuring the rivalry between an all-male a capella group, 'The Treblemakers' and an all-female group, 'The Barden Bellas'. The protagonist is Beca Mitchell, played by the talented Amy Kendrick. Beca wants to be a DJ and move out to LA, much to the chagrin of her father, who is a professor at Barden. He strikes a deal with Beca, that she must participate in one college activity and if after one year, she doesn't find it fulfilling, he'll finance her trip to the west coast.'Pitch Perfect' is most successful, when the music groups are performing their a capella numbers. The film begins with the introduction of The Treblemakers and The Barden Bellas at the national a capella finals at Lincoln Center in NYC, during the previous semester. Aubrey, the strident co-leader of the Bellas, ruins their chances when she throws up on stage (the workaholic and seemingly in control Aubrey, obviously can't stand the pressure). Act 2 begins nicely when the a capella auditions begin at Barden, each candidate singing parts from Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'. Desperate for members, the Bellas end up selecting a group of odd balls, including Beca, who comes in late for the audition, only to wow the audience by singing a folk-rock tune, with a cup as a percussive accompaniment. There's also 'Fat Amy' (Rebel Wilson from 'Bridesmaids'), Stacie, a self-admitted nymphomaniac, Cynthia-Rose, a lesbian with a gambling problem and Lilly, who sings so softly, no one can hear her (she later is revealed to have talent as a beat boxer).There are a number of scenes in 'Pitch Perfect', where the film's scenarist, Kay Cannon, veers away from the music and bores us with dialogue heavy narrative. A good ten minutes could have been cut from those scenes which involve the initiation of the new members of each a capella group as well as the following scene, some kind of 'mixer', where the boys and the girls get a chance to interact.It's at this point where the love interest begins in earnest, with Beca rejecting the advances of Jesse, who has just been selected to be one of the new members of the Trebelmakers. Jesse initially bores Beca with some dull zombie conversation but eventually woos her by appealing to her romantic, visual nature (first, he hides his face with a set of old record albums; later he convinces her to watch old movies (which is not her thing), especially the 80s film, 'The Breakfast Club'. In the finale, Beca utilizes the 80s hit, 'Don't You (Forget about me), the key song in 'The Breakfast Club', which helps the Bellas win the final competition. The Bellas manage to get by in the regional competition, after one of their competitors, lamely feature Muppets, as part of their performance. The scuffle between the Treblemakers and another group afterward, goes on a little too long, and Beca ends up getting arrested after sticking up for her schoolmates. Jesse also infuriates Beca after he calls her father. The conflict between Beca and Aubrey escalates, as the latter wants her mates to wear the same uniforms and perform the same songs, they've used before.The dark moment of Act 2, occurs when the Bellas lose in the semi-finals. Beca infuriates Aubrey because she did a little improvisation during their final number and quits the group. Beca must do some soul-searching and she finds it watching 'The Breakfast Club'. She's now receptive to her father (no longer rebelling) and agrees to rejoin the Bellas. It should be noted that Cannon's screenplay contains two moments of outright political incorrectness. First there's Beca's dour Korean roommate, who for some reason seems to dislike non-Asians. Then there's the black lead singer of the Footnotes, who's disqualified from the finals because he's not a high school student. This is the reason why the Bellas get a second chance to sing at Lincoln Center in the finals.Meanwhile, there's an additional sub-plot which I failed to mention before. Bumper, the Treblemaker's egotistical lead singer, quits after being offered a gig as a backup singer to John Mayer. That allows, Jesse's quirky roommate, Ben, a magician, to realize his dream of singing for the Treblemakers.The finale isn't very hard to figure out. Beca is appointed the leader of the Bellas and they adopt her new costumes and arrangements. In a rousing face-off, both groups perform magically, but the Bellas have the edge, with Beca leading the way.'Pitch Perfect' is an enjoyable, musical treat, featuring some fantastic a capella arrangements of both contemporary hits as well as classics from an earlier time in the rock/pop era. As for the story, it goes on for about twenty minutes too long and some additional, judicious editing, could have markedly improved the storyline. I would recommend seeing 'Pitch Perfect' and purchasing the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually watch this movie a few weeks before it opened worldwide and I really loved it! Anna Kendrick was the reason why I decided to watch this movie because I only knew who she was, oh well I had watched some movies with her before (including The Twilight Series) and I think she's an okay actress.I like musical movies (not such a fan of High School Musical though even though I like them) and this is that kind of movie that makes you realise how much you love musical movies.It contains great songs, great acting and great story line, in my opinion at least.Would love too see more movies like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I saw this movie today, and I'll say that Anna Kendeick has still the most beautiful smile that has seen in the movies after Ingrid Bergman. Just the smile... Well, the movie is so predictable all the way, so I think this is not a spoiler. Bit boring occasionally, but I think this is the first movie in a long time where there was no kissing! Kissing makes the movie slow and stupid-musicated, Musicish? Anyway, this is the most enjoyable movie, if you don*t seek any "artsy" stuff. This is just an entertaining comedy with a flow. Story is predictable, but it is well done. 2 stars gor the smile of Anna Kendrick, one star for the music. 5 stars go to the director for making this movie bit interesting and funny that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I saw this film a lot later than most people meaning a lot of it was ruined for me by friends quoting it and pictures of the quotes. My expectations even before I watched the film were extremely high, standards set by what I was told about it. That meant when I eventually came to watching it I was a little disappointed. I thought it was going to be the next "Mean Girls", where when asked if you've watched "Pitch Perfect" you'd reply "who hasn't watched Pitch Perfect?" (which my cousin did so when I'd asked if she'd seen "Mean Girls", bearing in mind none of them have seen "Pitch Perfect"). "Mean Girls" is the most quotable movie of all time people could say, but saying "Pitch Perfect" is a close second you'd be lying. Even so, within the week I watched the film 3 or 4 days in a row whilst packing for my cadets camp and I've already watched it once again since coming back a week ago. All the singing is great and I especially liked the scenes revolving around "The Breakfast Club" as I also love that movie. Without Skylar Astin (Jesse) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy), this film would've been terrible. Astin is a great actor and was definitely the best singer in the whole film, his voice is amazing. Wilson's character was so funny and lovable, without Fat Amy there would've been nothing to quote from this movie.Rated 8/10 for Wilson, Astin and the great singing by everyone, but disappointed with my expectations being set so high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Glee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people who think that movie is nothing more than Glee goes to college, you people are half- wrong. While it's still covering hit songs, it's not hitting you over the head with cheesy high school issues. What makes this move even greater is that the majority of actors in this film already have some acting chops and have appeared in other films and TV Shows e.g. Anna Kendrick has starred in multiple films prior to this film compared to Lea Michele from Glee who was basically an unknown actress prior to the show becoming popular.The covers of popular songs in this movie are very well produced and actually makes accapella sound awesome. My personal favourite scene in the movie was the "riff-off" where multiple teams have to spontaneously perform a song from a randomly chosen category e.g Ladies of the 80's, Songs about sex.I don't many criticisms about this movie except for I kinda disliked some of the personality traits some of the characters portrayed at times but other than that the cast were spot-on with their roles. A big kudos to Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Austin and Adam Devine for their characters were all outstanding.if you are looking for a musical but without the epic scale of Les Miserables or the campiness of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert than look no further to Pitch Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Watching! - It's Pitch Perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilers in this review, nothing that will ruin the experience for you though!This movie was literally Mean Girls meets Glee and I must say; what a wonderful combination. Now from the outside that must seem like a terrible idea but keep an open mind because it's worth it!The tagline 'get pitch slapped' gives you a good enough hint to the theme of this movie. It begins with misfit Beca (Anna Kendrick) who is trying to settle into college, only finding that she doesn't quite know where she fits in. So where does she go whilst on this quest? Well to the all-female a cappella group known as The Bellas of course. Somehow Beca is persuaded to audition for this group (not sure if the alternative girl would really do that?) to help them beat their male rivals in the annual a cappella competition (that they shamefully lost the year before). So who joins The Bellas? This oddball group has the most diverse and peculiar bunch of girls, ranging from the quirky to the tough then right to just plain weird?and it's brilliant! Anna Kendrick is great as the tough lead in this film, as one would expect from her previous movies. She is one reason I watched this film (along with Rebel Wilson). Which brings me to Rebel's character Fat Amy. She's called Fat Amy so 'people like you won't call me it behind my back' (I may have altered that). One of Rebel's short but witty lines in the movie. Rebel's character brings a lot of the comedy in this movie, mostly from the words she says. Most of the time it's not what she says but how she says it. She effortlessly delivers her lines and you don't feel like they were just put there for a laugh, which makes for a lame comedy. In fact, I must take a moment to praise the writers of Pitch Perfect because this movie could have gone one of two ways, either superb or super-awful! With its sharp writing and a fitting cast, this movie was Pitch Perfect! Too much?...As brilliant as these main characters are, the one who had me falling off my chair was Lilly. She just comes out with brilliant one-liners throughout the movie and she says it in such a way that had me laughing out loud! She's the kind of weird that I absolutely love! For me, the secondary characters made this movie what it is. The main story in this movie is about The Bellas and their determination to win the a cappella competition but there is a side story with Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin). Jesse is Beca's love interest in the movie. But don't worry, it's no sappy love story, it fits in well with the main story and doesn't take over at all.Even though this movie was full of singing, the music wasn't the highlight or the important part in fact. The singing was pretty good and the arrangements of the songs fit brilliantly (The riff off is a prime example) but the relationship between the characters is what made this movie what it is. But, be prepared for glee-like renditions of current pop songs! This is what I didn't care for, it wasn't a bother as they were actually enjoyable but it wasn't why I enjoyed the movie. One thing I do like was the mention of the 80's teen flick 'The Breakfast Club'. They even include the song 'Don't You Forget About Me' in a mash up. This did get me smiling and bobbing my head along to the beat, so it wasn't all that bad!Pitch Perfect has a little bit of romance and a lot of comedy that will have you smiling throughout. Now at first, I was sceptical. I thought this would just be another teen flick with a bit of singing and dance moves only your Grandma could look cool doing. But (to my delight) I was wrong. A-ca-scuse me? (You'll get the pun if you watch the movie). There have been talks of a sequel already! That shows you how successful this was with audiences. I'm not sure how I feel about that. If a movie is great, does it need a sequel? It's clearly for the money and I don't blame them, but if it's anything like Pitch Perfect then it's going to be hilarious. This movie is definitely worth watching, so what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fat Amy Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Horizontal Running" "What's your name?" "Fat Amy." "You call yourself Fat Amy?" "Yeah, so twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back." In Pitch Perfect, Rebel Wilson most accurately conveys the character of Fat Amy by the material and direction she was given by the director. However, much of the credit is given to Rebel Wilson as an actress. This movie was one of the most surprisingly prosperous movies, being described as "The spirited a cappella singing in Pitch Perfect makes a predictable, feather-light coming-of-age film irresistibly fun," by Claudia Puig, from USA Today. How easily Fat Amy's comments were delivered, her timing, and her sheer "fat power" make Pitch Perfect the successful movie it is, and gives Rebel Wilson the reputation she has as an actress today.Fat Amy is so naturally comical that the jokes and one-liners that she delivers just seem to roll off of her tongue. In one scene, she approaches two of the members of the Treblemakers, the rival a cappella group, and she asks, "What are you two turd burgers doing? Dressing for comfort?" It is just the right amount of insult and sarcasm mixed with the courtesy of asking how they are doing, that it makes it acceptable to find it comical. Another example of her sheer, natural humor is when she is talking to one of the over-confident men from the Treblemakers, Bumper, and he says to her, "So I have a feeling that we should kiss. Is that feeling a good feeling or an incorrect feeling?" and Fat Amy quickly replies, "I sometimes have a feeling I can do crystal meth, but then I think, mmm... better not." This is one of the most quoted lines from the movie because of how natural it sounded and how easily it was delivered. She is not afraid to be brutally honest and that is what gives Fat Amy her edge, making her even more likable. Timing is of the essence when doing any type of comedy. It determines how the joke is delivered and received, and it can also alter the meaning of the joke. Fat Amy is particularly good at this aspect in her role of this movie. "It helps that Fat Amy is played by Rebel Wilson, my favorite eccentric Aussie practitioner of lip-curled comic timing," is how Amy Biancolli, from the San Francisco Chronicle, describes her. In one scene, the Barden Bellas, an all girls a capella group, are revealing secrets to one another so that they can grow closer. One of the members is suspected to be a lesbian, whom Fat Amy voices her hunch about throughout the movie, and when Cynthia Rose, the suspected lesbian, is about to reveal her secret, Fat Amy says, "We all know where this is going. Lesbihonest." After she says that line, Cynthia Rose admits to having a serious gambling problem. Everyone from the group is surprised that that was what she admitted too, but then she says, "?It all started after I broke up with my girlfriend." Right then, Fat Amy says, "Whoomp, there it is." The timing of when she delivers her line is perfect. She leaves enough time for the audience to recognize what was just revealed and react to it. If they were not delivered in the way that she does, the comical value would greatly decrease.Rebel Wilson is a larger woman and portrays her character perfectly. She is very aware of her weight and she leads with calling herself "Fat Amy" when she meets new people. One of the many instances that Fat Amy displays her "fat power" is when she is talking to the "Deaf Jews Club" and she says, "Alright, I'll give you my number," as if they were interested in her. She does this after she is very insistent that "Shalom" isn't a word when the two Jewish men greet her. She has such confidence in herself, regardless of her size, that she actually plays it up and flaunts it. One of the other instances is when she is sitting in a pool with two very chiseled, good-looking men. Her swimsuit is very loud and very colorful, her sunglasses are on, and she is showing the utmost self-confidence. During an argument between the Bellas, she admits that she joined the a cappella group to get away from all of her boyfriends, who are possibly the two men from the vast amount, that are in the pool with her. This is such an unexpected quality that Fat Amy has, that it not only adds to her character, but to the movie as well.Pitch Perfect is one of the very first movies that is completely about a capella. It is one of the most surprisingly prosperous and entertaining movies that came out last year, grossing $65,001,093. Rebel Wilson as an actress, and Fat Amy's character made this movie what it is. It was the ease of the delivery of her lines, her comical timing, and her "fat power" that she so boldly showed that brought this to the next level of hilarity and gave the movie its social standing. Without her, this movie could have been just another mediocre comedy. Fat Amy is who made horizontal running possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect starts on an off note but ends on a high one that knocks it out of the park. Pitch Perfect shows us a lot of what singing groups in college are like. The soundtrack to this film is one of the best ever made. The writing is decent as is the acting. There are a few reasons I didn't give this film a 10; One of them being there are some people in this movie that are so annoying you just want to shoot yourself in the foot. Second, some of this movie is really crud and there's really no reason for it. In the end this is a great movie for the weekend and for those who love music/singing I highly suggest this film to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, "Pitch Perfect" is full of clichés. Moody rebel Beca reluctantly (Anna Kendrick) joins campus singing group of misfits, led by comically conservative Aubrey (Anna Camp). Despite their shaky beginnings, the misfit singers come together &amp; eventually decide to "be original". But just because it's clichéd doesn't mean "Pitch Perfect" isn't a great film! The film has a great cast full of fun colorful characters. Rebel Wilson in particular is hilarious as "Fat Amy" delivering most if not all the laughs. There's plenty of musical sets, most of which are pretty entertaining. Basically, the film is like an infinitely better, much longer episode of "Glee".This film delivers exactly what you expect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pitch-not quite perfect, but not-quite-terrible like the rest of these anyway - only mild spoilers(nothing to spoil really)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The redeeming quality here is that "Pitch Perfect" is a genuinely funny film.Not exactly up my alley, and that's why the mere fact that I considered this for a 7 star rating means you might think about adding this to your watch-list.I make it a point not to watch films like this, and after watching one of this caliber I believe I should lock away the key to the teeny-bopper-dance-musical genre forever, consider myself lucky to have procrastinated for so long, and run out of the casino like a thief on ACME jet-propelled skates.THe film is far from perfect. It suffers greatly from a completely ignored and under-developed relationship subplot. Too bad too - the actors seemed primed to pull it off in the few minutes that they were given to work together. The film also battles itself as it tries to tell the audience how "tire-old" music just doesn't work anymore, and then uses it in the finale'. I mean, they got it backwards... the lead is literally the character put into the plot to finally break through and get these girls out of their funk by giving them fresh new music, and then she dishes out a classic in the end. Ironic to say the least.I think there was a point in there about classic movies/music that ended up in the trash of the editing room along with the love story here. There's another subplot that gets dropped like lead penny, and that's the musical aspirations of the lead character.I had another little issue with how the girls got into the final competition. The film, at times, really did seem like it was in the fight club scene where Norton was fighting himself, or Ash fending off evil in the evil dead series.I laughed my way through the first-half of the movie, but the second-half does lose some steam, and the final showdown doesn't stand out as much as needed to move this into this years top 25. Might make the top half of the 80-90 films I'll eventually view from '12(about 60 so far - would put this at about #26-27 rt now).This is usually where I put a "If you Liked This You Might Like" list, but this was an out-of-the-box selection for me. Pardon the assumption that other films in this genre aren't this good. I don't wanna find out either way.64/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Musical in a Bad Storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was definitely nothing special about the story of this film. Its plot has been used and reused in various Hollywood movies. I knew from the beginning how the story will unfold and end, and I was right. It was so predictable. I didn't like the acting of the lead actors although they can really sing. At first, I mistaken the leading man as a gay so I was bothered that he was the leading man. The female lead, on the other hand, was trapped in a confusing role. The saving grace of this movie is its musical aspect. The acapella rendition of Party in the USA and Marry You by the cast was awesome. I wouldn't have finished this movie if not for the enjoyable musical performances and the good set of songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is nominally about college A Cappella groups, but that is not what it really is about. It is about young people realizing what is important in life and relationships, and the participation in the singing groups is just the vehicle.Having said that, I am a fan of singing and a fan of the TV show "Glee", and while "Pitch Perfect" is a far cry from "Glee" I enjoyed it on about the same level. Anna Kendrick who was already a star as a singer on Broadway when she was a teenager is Beca, who doesn't really want to go to college but her dad makes her, he is affiliated with the college and she gets a free education. But she really wants to go to Hollywood and maker her career in music production.At college she meets Skylar Astin as Jesse, and they both end up working as interns at the college radio station. They get friendly quickly, but Beca pushes back when it seems they will get closer.Brittany Snow is one of the singers in the girls group, Chloe, but the leader of the group is Anna Camp as the senior, Aubrey , just wanting one more chance to go to Nationals at the Lincoln Center and hopefully win. She is an unyielding task master, who rejects any input from others, and this causes a rift.My favorite is Australian Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy (that's what she calls herself), she has such good comedic timing and great facial expressions. (Her real name is Rebel, she has siblings Liberty and Ryot.)A fun, fun movie, but not for viewers who don't enjoy lots of singing. My wife said the campus looked familiar, as it turns out it was filmed at LSU, where she was a student 40 years earlier!SPOILERS: The girls group is set to lose again, but a disqualification of another team with a non-college member gets them to Nationals. Aubrey gives in to good sense, she allows Beca to incorporate novel performance elements, and they win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first heard about this movie, it did not interest me much, even though iam a fan of comedy movies. I assumed this to be like the pathetic "street dance" type stereotype movies. Hell no. This is not only a unique version, but also a truly aspiring performances by the startsThe movie starts and ends at the same place as like any other stand off competition, but then this one focuses a bit more on the story part of it and the typical fall out happens, people reunite and pull it off. Sounds a bit boring isn't it? But not so. It is very difficult to take such a standard 2-liner story so entertaining and worth watching.I think the success of the movie is mostly due to the acumen performances of the starts Anna and Anna. Although the group boasts of acoustic singing group the song in the grand finale did not sound realistic and was a give away. Nevertheless it was toe-tapping and very energetic as one would expect.The movie does not use erotica as the selling point, which is a very good attempt. As a stereotype in Hollywood movies, with beautiful there is always a nudity round the corner, but the director had made sure there are no such nonsense in the movie.Also the fact that girl dolls such as Anna would turn out to be a rapper was a stand up factor and sure deserve a round of applause. The movie had a few scenes which made me go back to remember "Scary movie" ugh!!! But thankfully its over very soon and does not deviate the screenplayGirls on a stand-off and they do win!!

I expected this to be cliché at best but was surprised at the incredible mix of music and the talent by the actors. I am officially a fan of Anna Kendrick now as well. Like most of us, the first time I saw her was in Twilight and her ditsy character came off annoying; which was the point, however, I think this film really showed her acting talents and I admit I completely underestimated this movie!

		<shortDescription>Great family movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those that think that this movie will suck (like I did before watching), you won't be disappointed. During a family party, we were deciding to pick a movie to watch just to pass some time and do something. We chose Pitch Perfect and I never seen the movie, but just looking at the cover just gave me an immediate dissatisfied reaction. However, I was TOTALLY wrong. As the movie progresses, I was getting more into it and whenever someone said something I hushed at them xP. It's very interesting and the musical performances are great and sound amazing. Some songs will just get you and give you goosebumps. I recommend this movie for those watching with a group and some children, everyone will be happy and entertained. On the other hand, don't expect an "Oscar-type" movie but rather an enjoyable, pleasing, and feel-good type of movie. Yes, you can already predict what's going to happen and how it will end, but that's not what it's meant to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's so WONDERFUL!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't shown in Japan, so I saw it when I went to France in March, 2013.I love this movie because there are a lot of my favorite songs in the story. Especially, I like "Just The Way You Are" which is sung by Bruno Mars originally. Bellas' voice was so nice and I was moved when I listened to it for the first time.Also, the final performances of the Bellas and the Troublemakers was wonderful. I really like it!!!!I recommend all people who loves comedy and A Capella to watch this movie. If you are interested in it, please check it out!:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect (2012) Director: Jason Moore Writers: Kay Cannon (screenplay), and Mickey Rapkin Stars: Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, and Rebel Wilson Genre: ComedyPitch Perfect is an absolutely hilarious comedy that takes place nowadays at Barden University. The main star of the show, Beca (Anna Kendrick), is a freshman who is an outcast and has no desire to attend college. Her father forces her to go because he is a professor at the university, which means Beca can receive a free education. Reluctant to make any friends, Beca joins the all-girls a Capella group, The Barden Bellas. Beca, along with a bunch of other talented misfits, audition for the desperate Bellas and make the team. The Bellas go on to perform in the regional competition where they perform a very boring set list. In spite of their boring and outdated song choices, the Bellas place, allowing them to move on in the competition, but Beca knows that the group's outdated set list will not help them become champions. The Bellas receive an update to their set list, all thanks to the musical mastermind Beca. With a fresh new group style and song choices, the Bellas battle their way through the rest of the competitions.The dialogue of this movie was spot on. The comedic one liners were perfect to get more than just a chuckle out of the audience. The commentators at the competitions are absolutely hysterical! The viewer wouldn't expect their characters' roles to have such funny lines, but those two really add some inappropriate humor to the movie. Each character had so many witty lines it is almost hard to pay attention to all of them. The character Fat Amy was so oddly entertaining that she was sometimes found to be a bit eccentric. One scene in the movie, Fat Amy is showing the captains of The Bellas how she can mermaid dance. This movie is one that can be watched multiple times because each time you watch it you're bound to hear a joke that you didn't pick up before. This is definitely a movie that is not just meant for women. The movie does have a romantic side story, but it's not a chick flick, the jokes aren't just designed for women, they are meant for men too.&nbsp;The screenwriters really did a fantastic job developing a dialogue that would captivate a wide range of viewers. &nbsp;&nbsp;The use of camera shots in Pitch Perfect were mostly far away or medium shots. Since the movie was a comedy, there was not a necessity for close-up or intimate shots. The shots used were basic and mostly used to capture the movie as a whole. Once in a while there would be a close up shot, but it was to see a funny facial expression or to hear the whispering girl speak. Medium and long shots were used for a majority of the film because it allowed you to see the characters and sometimes a little of the background. The shots were not designed to take away from any of the jokes. In comedy movies it is sometimes important to see the characters body language because it might intensify a joke. Overall, the use of camera angles helps enhance the humor throughout the movie. &nbsp; All in all, I thought the movie was comically genius. The wittiness of the script never failed to make me laugh. Although the plot was predictable, I found that it didn't take away from the continuous delivery of jokes. The character development was fantastic and each actor really performed amazingly. They went above and beyond to fit into their rolls and bring their characters to comical life. Pitch Perfect is a movie that will keep the one-liners rolling and will definitely liven up any viewers' night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anna Kendrick Is My New Crush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" may not be the kind of movie that will change anyone's life, but it did push me a little bit further into falling in love with Anna Kendrick.She plays a bit of a loner who gets involved in her college's acapella group (the members put "aca" in front of all their adjectives, like "acamazing" and "acaxcuseme?") and has to fight the group's uptight leader to freshen up their act in the hopes of winning a big annual tournament. The screenplay is completely by the numbers, and you can call out the film's plot developments three scenes before they happen. But if it's lazy in the categories of character development and dramatic tension, it does have a knack for one-liners, and the jokes come fast and furious, keeping things moving along nicely. Kendrick is an absolutely winning and adorable presence, and the film ably pokes fun at acapella groups while paying tribute to them at the same time. It does for acapella what "Miss Congeniality" did for beauty pageants.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing film, I utterly enjoyed it! At first, when I saw this film advertised, I thought it would be cheesy but as soon as the first five minutes were over I was intrigued to find out more!!!! Anna Kendrick was fabulous in this film as was the other characters, especially Rebel Wilson who, whenever she is on the screen, made everyone laugh and still makes me laugh every time I watch it. Also Ben Platt, well what can I say, this is his first ever film and he blew me away! He was amazing in this film and made all other competition forgotten in one of the last scenes of the film.I highly recommend this film to anybody who likes to laugh...a lot!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is a movie about a girl named Beca who is a DJ's music and wants to produce and make music. But along the way she joins a all girls acapella group called the Barden Bellas. So she is still having trouble because Aburey is giving her such a hard time. While that is going on a guy named Jesse is flirting with Beca but being in the rival acapella group called the Treblemakers. Throughout the movie there is funny moments from different characters such as Stacie. There is lots of older to modern songs in this movie that will having you dance in your seats. For the younger kids such as 8 and younger shouldn't really watch because of language and what some songs are about but otherwise it was very enjoying to watch and I would recommend this movie to people who like music comedy and romance raveled all up in one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it. I've seen it like four times. I downloaded some of the music to my iPod. I heard "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone" on the radio on the drive in yesterday. That was a moment. Someone has picked it up... Yep it's on the internet. That was nice. Good story, good characters, good acting. What am I saying; it's all music. If you only know two songs and one of them is Yankee Doodle and the other isn't you will not like this. I love the shower scene. That little red haired girl can sing. There is better music out there and I want it. Oh cool, all 2:41 of the shower scene is on YouTube. That tall brunette is about a 10; wish there were more of her. It reminds me of my "Pump Up the Volume" experience. Like every radio station claims to play the most music but it's all inane chatter or worse. Seriously hello MORE MUSIC! I must warn you. I would like to rate this movie higher but it has some sour moments. Otherwise, I wish there were a few less look aways but I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 15 year old niece forced me to watch it, even though i thought it sounded pretty lame... I mean, i'm 27 and she's a teenager, i'm not gonna enjoy the new teenage movies and the hot guys in those kinda movies are waaay too young to be appealing to me. But, i was really surprised to see that even though it's a movie that teen girls will love, i actually loved it too! The mixing of songs from different genres is really great and i learned about some new music i've never heard before, which is always a good thing. There's all kinds of characters, from the rebellic girl(Beca) to the uptight kinda snobbish control freak that you wanna choke because she's such a bitch, the sex-addicted girl and the one who's so adorably weird and fun, the guy who's the biggest f*cking jerk, the weird one who's into magic and the hot one that you can't resists because he's sooo damn cute! - Actually there's several hot guys who's damn cute, even if you're 27 years old :P So... just watch the movie - you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked "Mean Girls," "Easy A" and especially "Bring It On," here is the perfect final movie for that box set you've been building of smart, very well-written, insightful young adult films. Possibly - barely - just a step below the rest in quality because each one had already set the bar so high, but very equal to their attempts to make intelligent comedies in a day when dumb, tone-deaf, and formulaic all rule at the box office. Kendrick is charming and sharp, Wilson manages to wring one more funny variation on her standard character, and Astin more than holds his own as leading man among all the strong women surrounding him. Looking forward to seeing what each of the people involved does next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it's not talking about the lead actress in here. While I do love Anna Kendrick, the movie has a phenomenal cast throughout. It's not a "musical" mind you (something that has been mentioned here by other reviewers), but it does have singing in it. It is a comedy version of the recent dance movies we have seen. Of course there is also dancing in this one and there is romance in it too.While the romance part does not work quite as well (mostly towards the end of the movie) like the rest of it, it doesn't really take much away from it either. It a fun light movie, that you can watch with almost everybody. And it brings a smile on your face (actually more than one)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an awesome musical. The singing is amazing as well as the acting. I think that this movie is an amazing movie to watch with the girls, that's what I did ;-)Well basically this movie is about a girl who is new to college, who needs an extracurricular activity. She decides to join one of the show choir groups on campus. She has amazing talent and she passes the audition for the best female group. She brings the girls into a new stage of singing when she decides that they need new songs to win. Of course since we love her lol, there has to be someone trying to ruin it all. The someone I speak of is the leader of the group. The group disbands, and then by some empirical that you will see lol they get back together. Through this all we see a romance spark between our favorite girl and one of the guys on an opposing team. Signals gets crossed and they 'break-up' but they get together in the end so we are happy about that ;-)</fullReview>

But I absolutely LOVE rebel Wilson and in this movie Anna Kendrick as well! I loved everyone pretty much thru out the whole movie.

Anyone complaining about being offended needs to lighten up, it's just a movie and isn't meant to be a statement or something just jokes and a good time. Seriously I swear some of these reviews on here are ridiculous, people just trying to find a problem or point out offensive behavior where there is none! Lighten up a little and stop taking a MOVIE so damn seriously! Enjoy it it's a definite must see, I say 10 stars no doubt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from this movie, the previews didn't give you a good idea of what it was about, so I kind of skipped seeing this one in theaters and waited for it to come out on DVD. I threw it on my laptop while my boyfriend was playing video games because I like to catch up on my girly movies when he does that...needless to say, he stopped playing halfway through and made me stream it to the TV. This movie is gold! It's hilarious, it has great music AND mashup music which is my favorite, awesome actors make appearances at random (MCLOVIN!) and it by no means is a girly movie. My boyfriend is the manliest they can come and he likes it so much that just last night I caught it on HBO while he was on his way to bed and he stayed up to watch it for our third time with me. It's hard to say what the best part of the movie is...the hilarious commentators, Rebel Wilson who makes me geek out even when she doesn't say anything, the music or the disgusting (yet funny) vomit scenes. This movie will inspire younger people to get into A Capella, without it being too much of a corny musical. This is now one of my new favorite movies and I highly recommend for teens and up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film if you just want to have fun watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you just want to watch a film and have a lot of fun then this is the film for you. Could it be technically better? Of course it could, but most, if not all, films also could be technically better. It is hilarious and doesn't take itself too seriously, which adds to the fun. There's many great characters to enjoy, from Lilly's one liners that no one can hear (including the viewer if the sound is too low and/or you don't have headphones), to the permanently horny Stacie, to the always trying to get into Stacie's pants Cynthia-Rose and to the brilliant Fat Amy/Patricia who, regardless of your enjoyment of the film, you can't deny was one of the best things in the film.Could they have used better songs? Of course they could, but that's just a matter of opinion. Whatever songs they used there would be many who don't like them, but the cast did a great job performing them anyway (even if it was obvious they were miming to songs they already sung (at least that's what it looked like to me as half the time they were still singing when their mouths/throats weren't moving)).This is one of the few films which I could watch every day and not get bored (and some of my favourite films ever aren't in that list). Lots and lots of fun.Finally I guess I should explain why this (and many films I've put a rating on) has got 10/10. Unlike many, I rate films based on my enjoyment, not on whether the acting or music or script or whatever were brilliant. That's why a technically brilliant film can get 3/10 and a technically awful film can get 9/10 from me. This got 10/10 because as I mentioned a few times, I had a lot of fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anna Kendrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is a surprisingly fun film that goes about as emotionally deep as it needs to without getting overly mushy. The storyline is of a reluctant college student (Anna Kendrick) who learns to open herself up more to people and possibilities through joining an a capella group. Anna Kendrick, who's been nominated for an Academy Award, is probably too good for a film like this, but thank God the producers were able to get her because she gives her all and elevates the film significantly.The film, adapted from a book wherein the author spent significant amount of time with 3 college a capella groups, delves deep into the a capella world and it's clear that the filmmakers have done their research and this sets this film apart from the typical coming-of-age college film as we're taken deep into the world of this subculture. The music itself is also very entertaining..Although there's a sort of love-hate romance (wherein the boy's primary method of winning over the girl is annoying her to death), the film is all about girl power and how this loner learns to bond with other females for the first time and (excuse the pun) make beautiful music. With Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam Driver, Anna Camp, and Rebel Wilson, the supporting cast has a great chemistry despite the fact that it's difficult to believe some of these people are 18-22 years old (Anna Camp and Rebel Wilson in particular)The film's screenplay is by Kay Canon (who has written for 30 Rock and is well-known in comedy circles) and while there are some laughs, it's not primarily a comedy. It IS a fun film.</fullReview>

So I was happily surprised when I found that it was hilarious, quotable, had great taste in music (not something you can about every film, eh?), great cast and characters and good sideline romance. Also, there were some improvised lines by Rebel Wilson aka Fat Amy, that were pure gold...Recommend to anyone, especially other girls my age!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this film not knowing very much about it other than what my girlfriend told me. I knew that it was about singing, it was a comedy and it had Anna Kendrick in it. i have enjoyed the films that i have seen Anna Kendrick in before so i was mildly interested in it. Anna Kendrick plays her usual sulky self until she finds something she's really interested in, and then she gets happier, less annoying and actually is a nice person. the film itself is funny enough and i found myself really enjoying the characters.The singing is rather good but it is quite slow at the beginning but certainly makes a vast improvement towards the end. The love story is a nice side-line in the film but doesn't really add that much to it. I did enjoy this film very much but wanted more of the battle singing than the choir based singing.I would certainly recommend this film to anyone just looking for a nice distraction or on a date, it is a nice simple comedy with some good singing and some great songs thrown in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the film was excellent with a great cast. I particularly enjoyed the performances of Anna Camp, Brittany Snow and Rebel Wilson. Beca and Chloe's rendition of 'Titanium' in the shower, the Nodes, the confessions and the Barden Bellas never being able to work out when to take their hands out of the 'hands in' ("on three, or after three?") were my favourite scenes and moments. "I think we all know where this is going - lesbi-honest".The best characters: AUBREY: Even though she went about the place as if she had a pole stuck up her arse, she was still likable (and I suppose the fact that Anna Camp is rather fit helps as well). CHLOE: I love her. That scene where she reveals she has Vocal fold nodules was funny as *beep*, especially the part where she was talking about being a survivor. I almost died laughing when the inspirational music kicked in. The shower scene - I'm not saying anything but this: lesbi-honest.FAT AMY/PATRICIA: "I think we all know where this is going - lesbi-honest" "I'VE JUST BEEN SHOT!" "I sometimes get the feeling I can do Crystal Meth, but then I think: 'nah. Better not." "I'm horizontal running!" "Vertical running!" "Well, at least it's not Herpes - or do you have that as well?" Need I go on? It's defiantly one of the best films of 2012. Maybe even of the 2010s so far. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this movie last week, it's not a musical but a movie about transformation of Barden's Bella acapella team. This movie actually has the potential, all the girls has their own background which means there are several side stories which could make it more interesting, ie about Aubrey, why she throws up when she stress, the sex-maniac Stacie, or about Fat Amy, a fat girl but seems very popular among handsome men. But it's focus on Beca's life which I think it's just plain and dull. This make the scenes between those fine acapella composition passable.The acapella compositions on the final are good but it's not as exciting as the riff-off scene.</fullReview>

Highlights, for me, were the song mash-ups, Beca's audition for the Bella's, her singing at the riff-off and any scene with Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy. This won't win any prizes, is not terribly original, but it's well cast and the actors and script are both seriously funny. An enjoyable movie for a girls-night-out, a date and if you are in the mood for some uncomplicated fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The misfits get in tune for Pitch Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the popularity of Glee, it was only a matter of time before a movie of some kind was made to try and capitalize on the subject. With Pitch Perfect, they take on this same idea but attempt to do something a bit new. With a cast including Brittany Snow, Elizabeth Banks, Twilight's Anna Kendrick, and the always funny Rebel Wilson could they have delivered something special or will it just be another forgettable musical? Pitch Perfect follows an all-girl a capella group who thrive on their good looks and pop sings, but after a disastrous performance during the previous year's finals, they are forced to regroup and take on a new unlikely group. As far as story goes there is nothing new here. It's pretty much just the normal underdog story bringing together the misfits to deliver something special, but thanks to some fun cast members and outrageous moments delivers something a bit more. Rebel Wilson really steals this movie every time she steps onto screen. There will be some people that are annoyed with her, but she delivers on every level. She clearly isn't afraid to make fun of herself and it takes her performance to another level. The rest of the cast do a fun job of bringing this film together including some musical numbers that weren't just over the top annoying. The music choice worked better than most of these types of stories. Where Glee uses a theme to tell their story and sometimes works, here it was used to tell the story as well as establish the characters personalities. There are even moments where they seem to be mocking some of the characters and works really well. If there is a complaint, there is the expected evolution in the underdog group, but their final performance really never delivers that satisfying punch it needed.Pitch Perfect was an unexpectedly fun film that works whether you are a fan of musicals or not. This young cast works well together and performs their songs effectively to take an otherwise average film and make it something that stands out a bit. There is talk of a sequel, which is no surprise, and if Rebel Wilson is back then it might work given the right story, but either way give Pitch Perfect a try, it's a pretty fun time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect was on TV recently and I had nothing else to watch so I just decided to put it on. I was expecting to turn it off after 10 minutes thinking it would be unbearable...but I actually ended up enjoying it.I just couldn't stop watching, the characters all had their own traits and most of them were likable. The vocals for the music were on point and the whole film was just good lighthearted entertainment.The reason I was so surprised that I liked it is because I usually cannot stand musicals but to me this one just had something different, it felt fresh. The characters were interesting enough (Anna Kendrick is adorable) and there was just enough laughs to keep my attention all the way through. It strikes me as one of them films that you could just watch over and over again because its good fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.I will be watching the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Family Film for Summer Vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who are on the fence about musicals, this self aware, comedic film will make you fall in love with the genre. It makes fun of the potential "nerdiness" factor that is often bestowed upon Acapella groups, while thoroughly convincing you the singing thespians truly are the coolest in the crowd. Though sexually explicit at times, it does not exploit young women, in fact, it does just the opposite. It promotes young women finding their own road to happiness and being successful at it by working as a team. There are not many "buddy movies" out there starring women. The actresses in the "Pitch Perfect" are given original personalities that differ from the usual stereotypes we see on the screen. Kudos to the producers Elizabeth Banks, Max Handelman and Paul Brooks for starring strong, complicated women in a very entertaining film. Be warned, you will get hooked and watch "Pitch Perfect" a few times. There is so much going on that some of the jokes get lost the first time you see it -- so you have to watch it again, and again. This is a good thing, because now you've got a great film with which to look forward. The first time you accidentally call something "acca-awesome" and the person next to you recognizes the meme, you know that you have met another convert as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline was a bit transparent, not necessarily bad. The performances were super fun and the songs were quite current (older viewers might not adore that, but they still should watch it!). This comedy is kind of daring, but that's what makes it even funnier! The main character, played by the sweet Anna Kendrick might be a bit too Kristen Stewart, too straight-faced for your taste at times, but that did not bother me at all. Everybody loved the inspiring Rebel Wilson in this movie, she is funny and adorable! The beautiful Brittany Snow played Chloe, one of the girls who mostly helped Beca fit in, but she didn't really have a background story, which I think she deserved. You are going to love all of the girls in the Barden Bellas, especially the uptight Aubrey or the weird Lilly. Their opponent The Treblemakers is also composed by hotties like Jesse, Beca's. You should definitely check it out, I think it's one of the best musical comedies out there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun movie with lots of laugh in between some good singing numbers. Other than the lead actress Anna Kendrick actually sang with her own voices, the rest were mostly lip singing especially the two white girls. It gave me a lot of fun. Mainly the musics has been selected very well. Especially Bulletproof was very good. And jokes were good too. I haven't seen any 'cliché' in the movie. Its very fascinating because we had missed no cliché containing movie since this was released. One of the best movies I have seen this year. If you proclaim like 'Oh yes one more High School Musical' , don't do that because this movie is different all of others. I guarantee the joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'PITCH PERFECT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Anna Kendrick shines in this comedy-musical about an all-girls college singing group competing against their male rivals who always best them. Kendrick plays a freshman named Beca who reluctantly joins the team, giving them the talent and energy they need to put on a good show once again. The film also features Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin, Ben Platt and Adam DeVine. It was directed by Jason Moore and written by Kay Cannon (two former TV filmmakers). It's based on the book of the same name by Mickey Rapkin. I usually stay away from films like this and when I do give one a try I usually find them painfully unfunny and boring. I gave this one a chance because of it's good reviews and solid box-office and was pleasantly surprised. It's very funny and full of likable characters. Nothing spectacular but a decent comedy-musical that's definitely entertaining. Kendrick plays Beca, a new freshman at Barden University who attends the school only at the wishes of her father (John Benjamin Hickey), who is a professor at the university. She dreams of moving to Los Angeles and pursuing a music career so she takes an internship at the school's radio station. There she meets another music lover named Jesse (Astin) who develops a crush on her. Beca doesn't have time for boys though and wants to get to LA as soon as possible. Her father makes an agreement with her that he'll help pay for her to move to Los Angeles if she tries harder at school for one year and joins a club. When the local all girl a cappella group discovers how talented a singer she is they talk her into joining their team. Beca, plus a few other misfit girls (that aren't usually given a chance to sing with the popular girls), give the group just what it needs to finally compete with their male rivals (the Treblemakers), who always win the local competition. The movie is surprisingly witty and fast paced. It's filled with good and likable performances highlighted by Kendrick's soulful lead. Rebel Wilson has been receiving a lot of critical praise for her comedic turn but I think Anna Camp is even funnier as the film's leading female antagonist and Adam DeVine is also a scene stealer as the film's male bad guy. There's plenty of pretty girls to look at; especially Camp, Snow, Kendrick, Alexis Knapp and Elizabeth Banks as a commentator (Banks was also a producer of the film). The performances are equally as likable though. Most of all the movie is just funny. It's been compared to similar films like 'BRING IT ON' and I'd say it's at least as good as that. I'd also put it in the same league as something like 'MEAN GIRLS' or 'CLUELESS'. For it's type it definitely works.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ4Gr6CX0-g</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie i had very low expectations and boy i was so wrong. I thought this was pretty darn funny. You could see that the acting was spot on and i loved Anna Kendrick, i really hope to see some more of her in the near future. And she actually can sing. She stars even on Broadway on some occasions. Off course i was surprised about Brittany Snow, i had no idea she could actually sing like this, so this was a double surprise for me!Music was spot on and i really liked the male and female voices so much harmony, even thinking of buying the soundtrack. If your in need of a movie for the weekend or just for a movie night? You can't go wrong really, this is a movie for almost everyone.You won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irony...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the way this film was done and I loved the story however, I happened to realise that there was no scenes in which you saw Becca in class or any of the class and it also seemed like none of the girls or guys for that matter had any homework or classwork to do.I really liked the songs, the singing and the dancing. I really got hooked on Becca' character she subverted all the stereotypical main characters in these types of films, For example In 'HSM' Gabriella is a loser whose shy, 'Another Cinderella story' again shes classed as a loser, Whereas Becca is not shes a bit of an emo and a goth shes not a typical popular plastic. They've given teenagers a chance to watch this film and connect with each character in this film, Which then made you really feel like this could happen. I really enjoyed the choice of songs in this film.I did not like the Irony, how Becca and Jesse were talking about a typical movie ending where the guy gets the girl, And then surprise surprise Jesse gets Becca, Its a bit of a downer but then again it also makes the audience think that this could happen to them.Overall this film was very enjoyable and I would gladly see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't like chick flicks, they are all too predictable and at the very end they don't surprise you. Pitch Perfect is not that different from any other chick flick I know, but it was fun watching, the build up to the grand ending is the same as others, but the comedy is more matured and that made it easy to receive, other than the weak dialogues and lame script writing that are common in other chick flicks. I recommend that a guy should watch this with a girl.The thing that first turned me off in this movie was when I saw them singing, (I really don't like chick flicks and I hate music competition films) I just sat at the cinema hall thinking yikes!!! Then things started to turn and then I actually found myself laughing, the comedy that Pitch Perfect brings is very entertaining. It makes you over look the strings and loose ends in the movie.The funny thing about this movie again is that it is actually a non- fictional story, based on a novel of the same name by Mickey Rapkin. The movie stars Anna Kendrick (50/50 (2011)) as the lead in this college flick and it was produced by Elizabeth Banks (Man on a Ledge (2012)) who also can seen in this movie as she plays one of the commentators alongside John Michael Higgins (We Bought A Zoo (2011)).The movie is about two a cappella groups from a university but kind of like focuses on one of them, The Bellas and all female a cappella group, who recruited new girls into their group after their previous year disappointment, which led to them losing all but their two lead members.Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins The Bellas, and starts to shake things around a little, causing one of the lead members Aubrey (who is controlling) wanting to get Beca off the team as soon as possible, so she can regain full control of her group.The movie is directed by first timer movie director Jason Moore who is a regular stage and TV director, who in my view needs to work on his movie direction too, because the movie directorial was kind of weak, there were incidents where things happen for no reason what so ever. The lead girl Beca (Anna Kendrick) who happens to be a DJ, but all throughout the movie her DJ skills are not in any other way influential in the movie plot as a whole. Then the cheap Apple Macbook advert, comon we the viewers are not that dumb.Pitch Perfect made a good bunch from the box office making more than 84 million dollars compared to its 17 million production cost and it is highly rated having a 80% approval ratings from critics in the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes. Pitch Perfect is a perfect chick flick, but guys can have fun watching this too.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undemanding comedy with music. Or musical with comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would-be record producer Beca starts college at the behest of her father and gets drawn into a competitive all-girl a capella singing group.Anna Kendrick plays a likable if mildly conflicted young woman in this musical comedy. The musical sequences are nicely done, if somewhat improbable (the number of times groups drop into perfectly realised vocal arrangements ad lib strikes me as unlikely), the cast are all personable, and the humour is solid albeit occasionally drifting towards the unsavoury (which, admittedly, generates a couple of the biggest laughs). Rebel Wilson steals the show: she is very talented and comfortable with her size, but I wonder if her market (and therefore her career) is going to be rather limited unless she loses weight.My only real criticism concerns payoff. The situation as regards Beca's nemesis within the group is resolved satisfactorily, but the hostile oriental roommate thread is left dangling (so what was the point?) and obnoxious Bumper from the rival male group not only receives no comeuppance, he actually ends up rewarded, which was not what I wanted to happen at all.These minor quibbles aside, if you want a relatively clean and swear-free comedy with music, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebel at the Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This afternoon my husband and I braved the holiday crowds and saw the film Pitch Perfect. I loved it but my husband hated it, putting it in a category of films like Broke Back Mountain (which almost destroyed our marriage after I insisted we see it) and Moulin Rouge. Pitch Perfect is about a college singing group. Throw in a love story, some really great singing, a few laughs and that's about all she wrote. It won't win any academy awards and my husband certainly won't be getting the DVD. However despite our varied movie tastes, we both agreed that the young Australian woman Rebel Wilson was a stand-out in this otherwise very Hollywood film. She was funny, charismatic and absolute engaging. What an amazing career she has had since she wowed the world with basically two small scenes in the earlier film Bridesmaids. However, it needs to be asked were the constant fat jokes and bullying taunts really necessary? According to the IMD base website, she improvised most of her scenes proving that she is true comedic talent that can hold her own amongst the A listers. Despite this, her character was called "Fat Amy" and the taunts about her size continued from there. In a world where we are trying to teach our children to be better, I felt sad seeing this kind of bullying legitimized on screen. Good on you Rebel, you are achieving the impossible, living your dream and entertaining the world. As for your size, we couldn't care less. You are a beautiful Australian treasure! As for the rest of the film, it is funny, a bit like Glee but worth the coins. Take my advice though, send your husband to the pub.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was kind of forced to go to this, it would never have been a film I would have chose to see. When the movie opened I first thought it was an Australian film with that unique humour on the "strictly ballroom" vein, so things were looking up. When I start to recognize the mainly American cast I was already into the film. Its one of those basic story lines where a group of no hopers overcome their little problems with the usual love interest as a side plot and then it all comes good in the end. It's perfect bubblegum, I smiled and laughed all the way through and the next day I found myself re-watching some of the songs on youtube.The cast are great and IMO Rebel Wilson as Fatamy steals it. The music is great and its a perfect date movie and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But LOL don't tell my mates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A formulaic but entertaining comedy with toe-tapping musical numbers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is a winning musical comedy. The lovely Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a girl studying at Barden College who wants to become a music producer. After some pressure from her professor father she joins the all-girl a capella group The Bellas. When going to see this film I didn't know what to expect. But to my surprise the music scenes here turned out to be very entertaining. A good deal of humor is milked from a capella singing. The soundtrack consists of catchy old &amp; new hits including tracks by Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Kelly Clarkson, Salt-N-Pepa, Madonna and Toni Basil. The characterization too is strong, and Beca is only one of several characters with a distinct personality. Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy is full of humor. Brittany Snow plays Chloe, a good girl who persuades Beca to try a capella singing in a funny scene in a shower room. Director Jason Moore and the producers (including Elizabeth Banks) tried to make the film hip &amp; cool and they sure did succeed. The director and the cast promoted the film, and I recommend that you see their interviews on the internet. In conclusion, Pitch Perfect is one of the funniest films of the year. It's fresh and I definitely recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect- "Acca-amazing!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Acca-hilarious!" Pitch Perfect taking acapella to a new level of competition. Who ever knew that acapella groups even existed before this film? These types of groups make show choir seem amateur. The Bellas, an all-girls singing group, changes when all was lost at the last year's competition and needs to find new, yet talented singers. As you watch the comedic scenes of trying to 'stabilize' the new members, major characters will definitely not be forgotten because of their funny ways.Beca, an aspiring disc jockey, stumbles upon the world of acapella. While her father forces a college education upon her, she starts to see how she can incorporate her talent to her new life-changing experience. Beginning a new life chapter, she leads us to great characters and a romantic, Romeo and Juliet type of situation.Rebel Wilson a.k.a. "Fat Amy," gives the film great humor. Other characters like, Lily the quiet Asian to Cynthia the lesbian can't compare to Wilson's character. The film would not be complete enough without the antics of "Fat Amy." Her interjections within scenes are too die for and you will just have to watch it to understand. Along with that, Lily while being a 'stereotypical' depiction of Asians, being quiet makes her character funny without saying. Get it? Without saying? Anyways, when watching this film, these characters will definitely get laughter in the air. No doubt about it.As the original Bellas, Chloe and Aubrey try to figure out how to work with their new members of the Bellas. Chloe and Aubrey are both portraying two blonde stuck up girls who think they are both better than everyone else. It is quite funny to see how they go from all thin 'perfect' girls to 'different' yet somewhat talented girls. This type of portrayal makes it stereotypical and hilarious to watch when they see what the ending results are for their new group.Throughout the film, music is definitely the other element of this film connected to comedy. The Bellas, known for their old school ways, Aubrey continues this idea. Beca, a new Bella, can see right away that it is time for change. Sometimes old school is good, but this time around it just wasn't cutting it. The scenes of tension and trying to deal with the new group are too funny. Music definitely gave it an 'humph' and transitioning from old school to present day music is very hard to accept at times. Although, old school music is always good and all you really need to do is add a little bit of surprise and comedy.With this type of film, the actresses exceeded the expectations of comedy. And the talent is unbelievable. So for anyone who is a music addict or just wanting a good laugh with some music pizazz, this film is definitely it. You have to remember that, comedy plus romance and multiply it with music will always make it worth your while. Well at least for me it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie!! I LOVED this movie! I really do love A Capella music, first of all. I really enjoyed this movie on many different levels, even though my girlfriend did not. I knew this wasn't supposed to be Rent or Fiddler on the Roof, I assumed that, going in. I thought it looked like a spoof of some sort with actual singing. It exceeded my expectations. I found myself laughing out loud during many scenes and the singing was absolutely sublime. The casting on this movie was dead on. Anna Kendrick was great in the lead role, opposite Skylar Astin. Anna Camp turned in such a superlative performance that I wanted to throttle her beautiful neck 30 minutes in because of her stubbornness. I have to say that Rebel Wilson absolutely stole the best laughs, though! That girl IS talented. I can't wait to see her next role. So, even though I kind of thought this would be a chick-flick going in that I would just have to tolerate to listen to the singing, I was very pleasantly surprised. This was a great movie for the comedic acting AND the vocal performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie that I have literally just seen was absolutely amazing! Freshman Beca starts college with low expectations -- all she want to do is go to Vegas and be a DJ, much to her father's disappointment. However, when one of the "Bellas" hears her singing, it seems Beca has no choice but to audition. Of course, she gets in, with her amazing voice. That was a brief summary. A more accurate summary of this movie would be: you will laugh from the very start when you watch this film! If you don't think someone being sick loads and loads is funny though, it will still be for you, because there's plenty more humour to be found -- if witty one liners is your thing or your humour is more sexual-related...this film is for everyone! To make the film even better, it is full of up-beat, mainly modern music most people will want to get up and dance to! Mainly for teens, I'd say -- but that doesn't mean to say this film isn't for everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amusing, uplifting and really enjoyable movie. I was chuckling throughout. It had a lot of smart and sometimes off-the-wall humour. Yes, it's girly stuff mostly, but it's done in a way that would appeal to anyone.The songs and performances were great. I hope the performances were all real, but you never know of course. And perhaps it doesn't matter.Imagine a university subculture based on a cappella music performances. Really good performances. The students in this subculture are nerds with issues, but sheesh are they talented. And some of them are attractive too. This university has no less than four aca-groups. (Does this sort of subculture really exist at American colleges?) Shows like "Glee" and "America's Got Talent" are barely on my radar, but even I can tell that this movie is of that ilk.I can't remember the plot. Something about competitions, boy meets girl, letting people in, pleasing dad and not being controlling.All the characters were well portrayed by the various actors, but the one young lady who stood out for me was Brittany Snow (who plays Chloe). This is a young actress to keep an eye on.Jason Moore and the writers have done a good job with this, as has everyone involved in producing the music and performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it; the New Year hasn't been great for films-excluding The Hobbit. I wasn't heading into the film with high expectations; Relatively unknown cast, touted by some as a Glee movie and lot's of teen-girl hype.First Half: Forgettable with a fair amount of humour and wit but nothing really gut busting in ways that Ted and 21 Jump Street proved to be. Too many musical numbers and not enough comedy, perhaps restricted by the 12a/PG13 rating? The film could have pushed the boundaries a bit more, it could have been raunchier, touchier and had more sexual humour.Second Half: Perhaps the funniest 50 minutes of any Teen-Comedy I've ever seen, that's comparing it to films like American Pie. The jokes came thick and fast and the musical numbers were a lot better and jokes were tied into them. Rebel Wilson is simply hilariously brilliant. Her character "Fat Amy" is one that should go down in film history as one of the funniest of all time. The film is more than a chick flick and deserves some high praise. It's only let down by the first half.Could have been funnier if it had dared to push the boundaries. But overall a good solid comedy; 8/10</fullReview>

I was skeptical about seeing this as most 'gleek' fans were into this but me and my friend were blown away. I have now downloaded the soundtrack and can't stop playing it. So yea call me lame I don't care. I am very excited about seeing this film a few more times and owning it on DVD. If there is a sequel I hope they don't ruin it just look at films like 'Save The Last Dance' sequel... Went straight to DVD and everyone hated it.

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a movie with such great music, likable characters,ever. Add into that, the movie is hilarious, it will surely win your heart. If you love music, you need to see this. If you love just great movies, this is one that slipped your attention, and you won't regret watching this movie. You'll find yourself laughing, dancing, and enjoying cinema in the way it should be loved. The movie truly succeeds when it lets go and let's the music do the storytelling. The movie mixes new music with some older stuff which should appeal to all. Anna Kendrick steals the attention with every scene and is very likable and relatable. To the fans of the sing off show that was prematurely cancelled, wondering if the singing is on par with what was on the show? You won't be disappointed. The movie mixes romance, comedy and just plain fun to give one a very enjoyable hour 52 minutes well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fat Amy is da Bomb!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely a film targeted towards all the GLEE fans out there. A 100% predictable film that leaves very little to your imagination, with the whole movie being totally laid out in the opening five (5) minutes of the film. However, the a cappella numbers are done well (mostly anyways, the Bella's numbers are really bad), and the music mash-ups really rock; I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this film, another guilty pleasure for my coffers.This film is set on the mythical campus of Barden University, where acapella groups rule the roost. There are four rival a cappella troops on the Barden campus including last year's National 'A Cappella' Champions, The Treble Makers. However, the film actually centers on an all-girl troop, The Barden Bellas. The Barden Bellas were the campus buxom beauties with great vocal ability, but due to their antiquated routines and poor song selection just cannot complete nationally with their Barden counterparts, The Treble Makers. Eager the meet her father's demand and attempt to blend in on campus in order to make her way to Los Angeles, Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins the struggling Bellas a cappella group. Beca is an unknown, yet-to-be- famous, innovative, talented mix-master DJ with the ability to blend multiple genres of music into incredible 'mash-up' remixes. The only problem is the Barden Bellas are unwilling to change their song selection format from their current obsolete standards.The film is filled with various stereotypical characters; however, its best character by far is 'Fat Amy' (played marvelously by Rebel Wilson). When asked why she wanted to be called 'Fat Amy', her responds was brilliant, "So skinny bitches like yourselves wouldn't do it behind my back!!!!" Even more amusing scene was when the Bellas reached a bonding moment of the film when the troop is trying to grow stronger together, and the members are asked to share their most personal / intimate secret with the group? 'Fat Amy' confesses that 'Fat Amy' isn't her real name?. the group gasps and leans in closer to hear this startling revelation? "it's really Fat Patricia!!!" The scene is done so seriously, that it's absolutely hilarious!!!!Again, this is really a very cheesy film, with little or no thinking required. However, if you are a fan of GLEE, you will undoubtedly enjoy this film. If Glee makes you skin crawl, then this film should be avoided like the plague. Recommended for home viewing, perfect to rent, download, Netflix, or Redbox. This film is not going to win any Oscar nominations, but if you are in the mood for some light chuckles, and some really nice music numbers, then maybe this is the film for you.See more of my reviews on FB @ "The Faris Reel"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I start..... Hmm, this movie really surprised me, in a very good way. I loved the way they was singing, I loved the way they acted.Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy in movie) I think is a funny rising actress.Anna Kendrick is so adorable, I fell in love with her cute style of acting in the very good movie "50/50" she played a psychologist.This movie "Pitch Perfect" will leave you with a smile. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it for all to see. The movie won't be a classic but it's definitely a good enough movie to pay to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you'r totally depressed just watch this movie , it's fun , joyful, funny, smart, and completely different and fat Amy is one of the best things in this flick she's so confident it'll blow your mind , Anna Kendrick delivers a carefree, smart , mysterious and sexy performance her best yet and all the girl power is incredible. this flick has a fat heart and allot of juices that will make you want more*part 2 perhaps*.on the downside there is the lack of explanation about some of the key characters like Becca and fat Amy because you can't help but feel there is some thing more to them the movie is not telling and on certain occasions you expect them to act in a different way but the don't and that's disappointing and you keep waiting but it never happens maybe there is a message behind that. all in all a great musical and a brilliant chick flick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie, is INSANE - Golden Arts Review on Pitch Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trust me, this is NOT my favourite genre when it comes to movies, most musicals are horrible, the only one I liked was Moulin rouge and Johnny Cash ofc, If that can be called a musical.The main problem with musicals is obviously, the music itself. Its probably a lot harder than most people think to pick the right music for a musical and there's so many genres out there that most people never heard of at all, there's only one way to go with this, they have to go with the most popular pop records or more or less known classics here and there.Im myself a Trance fan, that doesn't mean that I enjoy "normal" music, for example Rihanna, Girls Aloud, or even Nicki Minaj's Super Bass. And around that is basically what you can expect from this movie.Im quite sure, that most boys/men who watched this turned it of at the start when the so called ( on pirate-bay ) "gay guys" come running in screaming... erhm, singing... BUT Don't, if you'r a open person that enjoys all kinds of genres and love music, you will LOVE this movie.This movie is one of the years best, sure, sometimes it gets to much but I forgive that, because they turn it around from to much to perfect.Acting is good by most parts Music is insane. Entertainment value is insane.But the biggest part I took noticed of was the "mixing" the girl was aiming for in the last performance.As a huge Trance fan, you get to know what mixing is all about, and they almost nail it in this movie, the transitions between songs are excellent and the small touches of other songs during the songs is excellent.If you love music, you will love this.On a entertainment level, which I review all my cases in, I give this a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pitch Perfect", a Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect was an amazing, musical comedy anyone could enjoy. This film has a fantastic touch of humor, great mix of music, and a dash of competition that keeps everyone's attention on the screen. I love this movie, and I'm positive everyone else who has watched it would agree.Obviously, no one can say no to a comical film, like Pitch Perfect. Jason Moore, the director, does a fabulous job finding the strengths of his cast and displaying it in this movie. Rebel Wilson, who plays the wonderful Fat Amy, is the most hilarious character in Pitch Perfect. With her overflowing confidence, witty lines, and her marvelous spunk, Fat Amy is one of the most memorable characters of 2012. Jason couldn't have found a better comedian and lines to make this cinema more hilarious than it is. The humor gets better when a controlling singer, a freshman with an attitude, and a whole group of unlikely girls get together to form an a cappella group, the Barden Bella's. Additionally, the movie has a mix of music that blew me away. Music performances involved in this film are not the cheesy glee kind or the Broadway numbers; the numbers performed are a clever mixture of modern music and old favorites that have everyone's feet tapping, for example, when the Barden Bella's sing a clever mash-up of "Just the Way You are" by Bruno Mars and "Just a Dream" by Nelly. My favorite part of the movie was the riff-off, a competition between a cappella groups where they have to make up performances based off a random genre selection. One of the category options in the riff- off was actually songs ruined by Glee.After the movie, I even bought some songs from the movie off of iTunes. Pitch Perfect inspires to start singing, along with the friends I saw the movie with.However, no movie can be perfect. Along with the movies wit and humor, comes some judgment. I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger audiences; Pitch Perfect has some comedy meant for older ages. With that said, great lessons are learned in this movie like when Fat Amy said, "Even though some of you are pretty thin, you all have fat hearts, and that's what counts." There is one part that sickens some, like when the performers vomit, but the rest of the movie is worth the ten seconds of disgust. Furthermore, competition makes any audience glued to the screen. With the constant tension between groups, the pressure of winning, and reputation on the line, the cinema catches the audiences attention. Along with the competition, members of each group battle friendship, romances, and college on their journeys, which really showed me how relatable the movie actually is. Jason does a fantastic job creating this movie, and I wouldn't change anything about it.Ultimately, Pitch Perfect was a pleasant surprise as soon as I walked in the theater. My goal is to have people enjoy this movie as much as I did. This film is a comical musical that I will never forget. See Pitch Perfect, you won't regret it. This combination of comedy, music, and competition is a great way to enjoy your day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laughs is what sets this "misfit saves the day" singing movie apart from other teen and/or singing movies. Laughs and a satiric wit ably presented by an engaging cast. KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Victoria Burns, age 14, calls it "surprisingly really funny" and says she intends to watch it over again ? which is also surprising as she shares that this type of movie is not usually one that's for her.Pitch Perfect Reviewed by Victoria Burns Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL3LAga_WzQI went to see Pitch Perfect and it is surprisingly really funny. I do not usually like musical types of movies, but this one was one of the best. At first I thought that this movie would be one of the ones with random outbreaks of song, but this movie has a nice storyline and it is funny. The singing is amazing. Plus, since the move is about an a capella group, it is interesting and kind of impressive to see the actors make the track to the music with their voices. This movie is about Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who wants more than anything to be a music producer but her dad makes her go to college first. Finally, her dad says that if she goes to college for a year, joins a club and really tries her best, he will let her drop out and go to California. This gives her some incentive to do well in school and join the Barden Bellas, the school's all-girl a capella group. The Bellas' arch rival is the all-boys group, the Trebles. Beca starts to fall for a member of the Trebles, Jesse (Skylar Astin), which is forbidden by the Bellas' uptight leader, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp). The Bellas are old-fashioned and Beca is tired of it so she quits, then she rejoins and makes the Bellas better than ever, new, and ready to win. Whether they win against the Trebles is a mystery that you'll have to watch to find out. I love this movie, and the characters are very eclectic to say the least. My favorite character is Fat Amy because she's hilarious and says whatever is on her mind, and it shows because she calls herself "Fat" Amy. I absolutely love this movie and will definitely be watching it repeatedly. I give it five out of five stars because I like that the actors can sing well, and the way that they make the music track with their voices is amazing. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes music and comedy, because together it is a great combination. I like that the movie is not just about the singing and that it has a good storyline as well. I recommend this movie for ages mature 12 and up because the movie has some foul language but overall is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising humor takes control of what could've been just a college comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing about the premise of "Pitch Perfect" suggests it should be a funny movie, or anything more than a diversion for "Glee" fans who've burnt out on the hit show after three-plus seasons. A cappella groups might be a change of pace for Hollywood, but college humor isn't, with most college comedies going straight to DVD bargain bins these days.So even after seeing "Pitch Perfect," it's a total wonder how it manages to stay fresh and entertaining. College movie clichés lurk around every possible turn of the plot, but "30 Rock" writer and producer Kay Cannon, who essentially wrote the movie (it resembles Mickey Rapkin's book in name only), artfully dodges, embraces and twists them in surprising ways, and the cast working with it fulfills its end of the bargain too.The film stars Anna Kendrick as Beca, a freshman at fictional Barden University who's an aspiring DJ preoccupied with mixing her own mashups. Reluctantly, she's recruited by the Bellas, the school's all-female vocal ensemble, led by the authoritarian Aubrey (Anna Camp), who's hell-bent on taking the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (which exists, actually) away from the school's all-male group, the Treblemakers. Problem is, Aubrey wouldn't know hip if it bit her in the ass. Beca rolls with their old-school ways and never- ending performances of Ace of Bass' "The Sign" until it's clear they need a shakeup if they want to win it all.But "Pitch Perfect" isn't some competitive singing movie that plays out as a "will they or wont' they win?" drama. In fact, there's almost a total disregard for that element of the story. Audiences who go primarily for the music might even be a tad disappointed that most of the songs are kept to snippets, and director Jason Moore does little to emphasize the quality of the singing or the music itself. The script sticks squarely to comedy, hoping to surprise you with its sense of humor. The best comedies have strong supporting characters who can take attention away from the predictable core story, usually a romance, in this case Beca's friendship and eventual spurning of Jesse (Skylar Astin), a freshman Treblemaker who interns with Beca at the campus radio station. "Pitch Perfect's" ace is Aussie Rebel Wilson, the recognizable roommate from "Bridesmaids," who plays Fat Amy, a new Bella with boisterous personality and loads of confidence. Wilson's one-two punch of deadpan and self-deprecating humor takes the edge off the "Mean Girls" dynamic established between Beca and the two older Bellas, Aubrey and Chloe (Brittany Snow).The other girls in the group possess just the right amount of quirkiness to be memorable rather than stereotypical. There's a black lesbian, a whispering Asian and a tall slut to name a few. The guys of the Treblemakers, led by Bumper (Adam DeVine of "Workaholics"), act cool, but in the nerdiest way possible. The script is keen on reminding us that these characters are all in singing groups, and therefore by definition, nerdy.The laughs extend as far as the competition commentators, played John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, who frankly don't exist. No one is listening on the radio to these things, and it's not even clear they're even being broadcasted. But they're for our enjoyment to be sure. Not since the team of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman in "Dodgeball" have commentators been this funny."Pitch Perfect" thrives on this genuine wit, which perfectly masks how irrelevant the rest of the movie is. As the director of hit Broadway show "Avenue Q," Moore understands how humor and music work, but even he would concede "Pitch Perfect" is about the former. The script's sharpness is matched only by it's conscious effort to avoid the clichés that comes with this territory. Even if you think you know what the joke is going to be, there's some twist that will come later. The ending, always the worst parts of these movies, avoids all the gooey stuff too. It's so nice to see a conscious effort to deliver something unexpected in a genre that filmmakers so often use as an excuse to lean on the conventional. It just so happens that a movie about college a cappella was lucky enough to be the recipient of this refreshing approach.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait for this movie to be released. I am not a singer, not a dancer and not typically into musicals. Anna Kendricks has become a favorite of mine over the past few years and i was curious how she would do in a more central role. She impressed me yet again. I absolutely loved this movie! I thought the execution by each character was phenomenal and the movie was very well put together. The singing talent of Anna Kendricks was a huge surprise. Having seen her in several movies I was shocked at just how amazing her voice was. The movie has just the right balance of humor, romance and gritty-girl-claws-out digs.I saw the movie with a friend (couldn't get my significant other to go). We loved it so much that we literally dragged him to it the next day - he laughed through the whole movie and thanked us for threatening his life and limbs if he didn't come with.Great date movie, great girls night movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dry, witty, sarcastic, and a bit corny. "Pitch Perfect" is a solid movie that seems to come off the success of TV's "Glee," which has spurned a number of quirky, A-Capella related shows and movies. But this is not "Glee." There is drama and comedy, but at the end of the movie you have a smile on your face, you don't feel like your life has been wasted away."Pitch Perfect" follows Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, a freshman in college, who isn't really looking to find her way. She loves music, in fact she composes DJ mixes of different songs in hopes of working in Los Angeles one day. While walking through the quad, Beca comes across an activity booth for a college all-female singing group, the Barden Bellas, where she meets Chloe, played by Brittany Snow, and Aubrey, played by Anna Camp. Chloe and Aubrey try to entice Beca to join the Bellas, but Beca decides that she is above all that and moves on. Later, while singing in the shower, Chloe hears Beca's voice and convinces her to come try out for the Bellas, which Beca does. Beca also meets Jesse, played by Skylar Astin, another freshman who tries out for, and joins, the Treble-makers, the all-male A-Capella singing group on campus. They have a rocky relationship throughout the majority of the movie, as Beca has a hard time letting people into her life. Fat Amy, portrayed wonderfully by Rebel Wilson, also becomes a part of the Bellas, where she becomes good friends with Beca, Chloe, and the rest of the Bellas."Pitch Perfect" is solid movie, that makes you laugh, wince, and, well maybe not cry, but feel some kind of sad emotion. Rebel Wilson is that actress that really steals the movie with her one-liners and just shear humorous presence. The music they sing throughout the movie is good, and the whole idea of the collegiate A-Capella groups really does work in this movie. It's nice to see that this dry and sarcastic type of humor that was really made famous by "Monty Python" is coming back, and audiences are loving it. Overall, "Pitch Perfect" was not perfect, but a definite B+ for sure.Check out http://www.ommoviereviews.blogspot.com for more reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly Cast, Spanks the Formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The diversity of the crowd drawn to Pitch Perfect was quite surprising. It was as if everyone had favorites in the cast (mine is Rebel Wilson). There is just enough raunch, predictability and formula-dedication in the film to relax the audience. Individual characters really bring the picture alive. A big surprise is Ben Platt who plays Benji: from his IMDb profile, it looks like this is his first role and he nails it. Despite a bad haircut, he can't hide being smokin' hot.Another favorite is Adam DeVine, he has just the right amount of annoying cockiness to carry off his music nerd persona. The quiet Asian girl who speaks in whispers (played by Hana Mae Lee) steals every scene she's in and she utters -- or, more accurately, mutters some of the best lines EVER! Some of the predictable moments are such utter giveaways, it's actually funny. And as I had hoped, Rebel Wilson is an awesome, funny, unexpected powerhouse.How does Anna Kendrick do? She's beautiful and has an awesome voice. Skylar Astin -- despite his porn star name -- is wonderful, until the writers turn his character into a jilted mess. He has a knockout voice and it's certain he's adorable in the shower. PITCH PERFECT is everything GLEE wants to be when it grows up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a girl with a dream to keep to herself and her music. All she needs in life is to get done with college and find a job composing music, working with what she loves. However, this becomes more of a challenge than expected for Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) who ironically runs into a group of girls who are compiled of complete opposites, but yet at the same time, these girls are more similar to each other than any of them could have ever imagined. Directed by Jason Moore, Pitch Perfect creates an "acca-amazing" film that has its viewers hooked from the first a cappella performance, building climactically through each musical number , revealing new friendships and relationships, all comically displayed; don't be surprised, even the least musically inclined few may be astounded to find themselves singing along with this hysterical uproar. When Beca arrives at Barden University with no expectations, looking for a place to just fit in, she comes across the Barden Bella's a cappella group. With reservation, she participates in practices and performances all while fighting off the charming new freshman, Jesse (Skylar Astin), part of the all male, rivalry, a cappella group, the Treblemakers. While the Barden Bellas aren't exactly your typical "pretty-girl" group, the diversity adds to the laugh-out-loud humor that appears to be present throughout the entire film.To Moore's credit, Pitch Perfect isn't simply a remake of the popular TV show, Glee. Originality abounds in this admired film, creating its own storyline unique to the industry. Besides the fact that the music is completely brilliant (because who doesn't love elegant, beautiful harmony) , writer Kay Cannon deserves a standing ovation for crafting this masterpiece with strategic humor and a legitimate plot. To be sure not to exclude, much credit also is due to the acting; especially by Rebel Wilson who plays Fat Amy, called such a name "so twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back". Wilson is the primary source of laughter in this movie and never ceases to amaze her audience in providing good, clean, humorous entertainment. She is essentially the comedic relief to an already amusing film. Similarly, Benji (played by Ben Platt), originally denied from the Treblemakers because of his obsession with magic and Star Wars, adds to the movie with his quirkiness. It seems that every cast member seems to fit in perfectly and was excellently selected by Moore. Pitch Perfect may possibly be one of the more unique, comical productions of 2012. With its originality played out perfectly and its musical accents throughout the film, it will have viewers running right back to watch it again. An outstanding combination of this and the well- casted, phenomenal acting, Moore earns himself five stars from this "acca-awesome" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big musical fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a lot of good comments about this movie throughout the Internet, I decided to give it a shot. Big surprise, I was very impressed! This is a good movie that balances character development with jokes and songs. It takes a lot of jabs at Glee, all in good fun of course. Honestly, I didn't have a lot of hope for this movie, but now, I'm glad to see that I was wrong.Pitch Perfect tells the story of Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who just enters college as a way to achieve her dream of becoming a DJ. Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) are members of the Bellas, an all-female a cappella group who seeks members to enter a national competition. Upon seeing Beca sing, the Bellas see Beca as the key to victory. Beca is not interested, but her father convinces her to give the group a chance. During her time of the group, Beca begins to learn the value of friendship. She also begins to fall in love with Jesse (Skylar Austin), a member of a rival group. Needless to say, hilarity ensues.In this movie you fall in love with all the characters, from the quirky and irresponsible Fat Amy to the incredibly nice Chloe. At first, i thought that musicals were only to have fun and nothing else, but this movie proved me that even in musicals, you can be emotionally invested in the characters. You can sympathize with their struggles, you get to know their hopes and dreams.I hope this review can convince you of watching this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well made teen film in every aspect !!! must watch .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect was one of the best college - going teen flick which had a very good content coupled with riveting performances.Pitch Perfect tells the story of a school singing competition at Barden University where a group of girls take on their male rival.Jason Moore takes in a very challenging of voice-over concept which is based on a book of same name. The very beginning of the movie is mesmerizing and the next moment you are into the film. Audition scene of Beca(played by Anna Kendrick) is simply outstanding. It would have taken good practice to master the voice-over singing and the girls were excellent at it. Hats off to the director for choosing a challenging script and directing to the perfection. Story is simple but it is the script and performances which makes it watching at least more than once. Anna Kendrick gives another stupendous performance. The actress of 50/50 and Up in the air is growing stronger day by day. She is the next super star. Rest of the star cast do justice to their part.Overall , a very well made film in every aspect.

		<fullReview>This is probably the best comedy film of 2012, it's irresistible, it's effective, it's funny, it's lovable, it's relating and it's entertaining. From beginning to end, the movie never fails to make its audience laugh and smile, with it's usual and cheeky scenarios, people can actually relate easily from the film. This is indeed, one of the best musical-comedy of all time. If you know the songs from the film, you might even sing along with it and even if you don't want to, you can feel the urge to join them clap and make beats with their hands. The movie delivers short punch lines that gives you exceeding laughter. I, myself, can't help but make noise while hooked in its punch lines.Rebel Wilson, probably, is the perfect ingredient in the film. Her undeniably crazy aura brings more spice and kick to the film. I love the combination of different characters with different attitudes and personality, it gives the movie more color and life. The different personalities of the character gives the audience a wider perspective and story, it also makes the characters fun to watch and once you see these characters, it gets even more interesting. It's a good thing this film doesn't focus on the lead role too much and leaves enough space for other characters to fill in.This film also gives you a full dose of musical entertainment that will make you run to the record store and buy the soundtrack right away.Unlike other musical films and chick flicks, where women are usually the baddies, in this film, the guys are the baddies influenced by one of the characters, Bumper. I think that's a good change and a right turn. It's also good that in the film, the two competing groups are not trying to bring each other down by sabotaging each other all the time unlike what happens in most chick flicks.I definitely enjoyed the film throughout, I have nothing to complain about it, in every corner, it is perfect. You are totally going to get pitch slapped so hard, your men boobs are going to concave!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the singing in this movie is very good... and those bits are fun.However so much of it is so over the top that it spoils the film.It feels like band-aids have been stuck all over this movie to hold it together. The plot is barely continuous in many places.The character development sucks... and it felt like the characters were trying not to say the stuff they were scripted to say. At least what you see is not what you hear.Do we really need to see a deranged Chinese chick make vomit angels? The cute head of the choir who won't compromise? The chick with the nodes on her vocal cords is blown out of proportion. Fat Amy is a bit over the top... but is one of the things that kind of works. We have the compulsory nymphomaniac (why exactly?). Also the lesbian (also why?). It sounds more like a deranged group of girls rather than a choir. Vomit scene? Once was stretching it... second time it was just cheap laughs.You squirm your way through this movie... when you should be enjoying it. It's like they started off with a clean slate and then added songs, jokes, characters... and at the end it was long enough to be a movie. Pity it could have been a really nice movie.:-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute blast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read a synopsis of Pitch Perfect, it just sounds like your typical rom-com, coming-of-age, singing movie; but I swear to you it's not. After being forced to see it by my stepbrother and his girlfriend, I was very, very pleasantly surprised. Pitch Perfect is probably one of my favorite movies ever now. As soon as the credits started rolling I knew I was in love and I needed to see it again. So I did, a week later. The music was aca-mazing! The soundtrack is absolutely off the charts! I am obsessed! My favorite song from it is the Bellas finals. The plot was a bit cliché, but good. The acting wasn't fantastic, but the goal here clearly wasn't to try and get nominated for an Oscar. They just wanted us to like the movie, and I more than liked it, so they succeeded.Anna Kendrick played Beca, an amateur DJ who wants nothing more than to leave college and move to Los Angeles, causing her to be miserable all the time and shutting out everyone who cares about her. Her main love interest Jesse, played by Skylar Astin (Ugh, I just melted when I said his name), is everything a charming college boy should be. Plus, he can sing. He tries to bond with Beca and sweep her off her feet, but she just shuts him out. This causes Jesse's heart to break and every girl in America to get tears in their eyes. Needless to say, I fell in love with him. Brittany Snow and Anna Camp were hilarious as the Bella's head voices; and Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins were scene-stealers playing the commentators for the competitions. But, no one (not even Skylar) stole the show like Rebel Wilson did as Fat Amy. I won't say anything else. Go see Pitch Perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" was an outstanding movie! The acting was incomparable for a first. Furthermore, the performances filmed were very interesting to watch and had a perfect sound. The movie also had a comedy feel to it also. I would recommend this movie to nearly everyone I know.Moreover, the acting played a contributor to excellence of the movie. Some of my favorite characters included Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, and Rebel Wilson. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, the main character. Beca is rebellious and has the dream of making music. Kendrick really seems to pull of the look and act of her character with her very chill personality. Conversely, Brittany Snow plays a very different character. Chloe is another member of the Bella's, yet she is very perky and always goes along with the group. Strangely Beca and Chloe seem to get along with each other very well. Ultimately, there is one of the rebels. This would be Skylar Astin, who plays Jesse, one of Beca's only friends. He also loves to create music but for something different. For movies. Finally comes Fat Amy. This character is played by Rebel Wilson, who is hilarious. Fat Amy seems to be most of the comedy in this movie. I consider her to be the cherry on top. Additionally, the musical performances were beyond excellence. Evan note was hit perfectly and the combinations of artists were very interesting. These women seemed to mix the most unlikely artists together. Some of the events in the movie involve lots of singing, some of it serious, such as competition, and others just for amusement. And what really seemed to catch me is that they don't sing about their emotions, they just sing because they love doing it.On the contrary, many people would expect the movie to be another version of High School Musical. I have heard many people say that this movie will be all about singing out randomly just to express themselves and their feelings, yet it really was not. They all came out saying that it was amazingly funny and would totally watch it again.In addition, the movie seemed to be a true comedy. One of my favorite parts was when Jesse exclaimed "Organized nerd singing? This is great!" The characters really seem to express their minds, and when they do, it just makes them seem all the more funny. I believe that the director, Jason Moore, made an admirable choice by making a funny script because the media on this movie shows mostly good reviews. I think that this movie will leave you laughing for days after seeing it. If you ever have time to go and see a movie, I would completely recommend going to see this one. Do you like comedies? Are you one of those people that loves to laugh at your movies? I really hope that you enjoy "Pitch Perfect."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews of this movie is completely in line with what you would expect. Fat Amy was hilarious in the movie and the character made the movie go from serious to a comedy. I loved the Bella's that reminded me so much of the southern classy women that are prim and proper. Then, Anna Kendricks character comes into play and is the modern hipster. She remixes a lot of music and I immediately went and purchased the album. There are so many great songs that are covered in the song. My Favorite is the rule the world from the classics in the 80's. This made me feel like this movie was the modern day Breakfast Club with a slight twist. I was shocked about how amazing the voices were in the movie. I had no idea these actors had such amazing voices. Honestly, i walked away with some crushes in the movie. Well worth going to see and can't wait to purchase this on DVD. I will be doing that asap. Not to mention i'm constantly listening to the album now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I was very hesitant to see this movie. After all the hype and build up (of what has seemed like an eternity) in commercials and previews I was worried this would be a repeat of the let down and disappointment I had when I saw Couples Retreat. THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC! I don't think I have laughed that hard in a long time, and I wish I could have stayed and watched it again, because I am pretty sure I missed so much because I was laughing so hard. Rebel Wilson absolutely stole the show, and she is amazing!!! Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow &amp; Skylar Austin delivered! Go see the movie, it is worth EVERY penny!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just took my son and we had a blast. The dialog was really funny and there were parts that I totally did not expect. I had to restrain myself from singing along - there were great songs to mix in with the one-liners. The commentators - especially Elizabeth Banks - provided a comic flair from the adult side. I love Anna Kendrick and I thought she, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp and the rest of the Bella's cast did a very nice job - smart - sassy - sexy - fun! There were a couple of times where the story line was a tad slow, but the singing and dancing by far made up for those few minutes. If you like to have fun and laugh then I would highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie in an advanced screening through my university and I have to say, I was blown away. I usually like these types of movies so I was gearing myself up for satisfaction (I mean if you saw the trailer how couldn't you?) and boy, did they deliver! It was hilarious, fresh and just plain awesome. Yes, some of the vocals were a little auto tuned or weak compared to real acapella groups and the actors are all pretty much over the age of 25 but I still think they did a good job. Rebel Wilson was hilarious as Fat Amy. If you thought her jokes in the trailer are pretty funny, there is even more where that came from! Skylar Astin is thoroughly adorable as love interest Jesse (and his AMAZING VOCALS brings me back to his days as Georg in the original production of Spring Awakening with Lea Michele and Jonathan Groff) and he makes me fall in love with him from the very first scene. Anna Kendrick is believable as a college freshmen, although the fact that she is actually 27 (along with Brittany Snow who is also 27, Anna Camp who is 30 and Rebel Wilson who is 27) kind of puts a damper on that. Overall the movie is great and I would totally spend money to see it in theaters when it comes out on October 5!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing and entertaining "musical" comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PITCH PERFECT (2012) is a surprisingly clever comedy about, of all things, the world of collegiate acapella groups! I guess Hollywood has covered virtually every competitive arena out there, so this one might as well join the ranks. Starring up-and-comer Anna Kendrick (already an Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress for "Up in the Air" and also one of the co-stars in those insanely popular "Twilight" movies), Kendrick takes on the lead role this time and does an excellent job carrying this flick. Kendrick has great comic timing and manages to lift the sometimes predictable, yet generally witty, script to another level.Kendrick is by no means the only plus of this film, though! The supporting cast is wonderful . Skylar Astin (Jesse), Brittany Snow (Chloe), Anna Camp (Aubrey), Alexis Knapp (Stacie), Ben Platt (Benji), Ester Dean (Cynthia Rose), Hana Mae Lee (Lilly), Adam DeVine (Bumper), and ESPECIALLY scene-stealer Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) all deliver the goods and they really help make this movie from degenerating into a cliché vehicle, all really bringing their characters to life. Wilson in particular as Fat Amy had me in stitches for the entire film! Although the main plot has been done a million times(rebellious outsider must overcome obstacles and personal issues to fit in and bond in a new environment and lead group of acapella misfits into a final showdown against the abrasive, cocky acapella group), I found myself enjoying the journey of these group of ladies thanks to (1) a refreshingly funny script (2) a collection of great songs and mash-ups and (3) the sweet, believable love story of Beca and Jesse.The plot centers around the Barden University "Bellas", an all-female acapella group that was embarrassed at the prior year's nationals (film's opening scene). The Bellas are eternal lapdogs to the Barden "Treblemakers", a group of uber-talented aca-nerds who won the championship. The Bellas leader is the extremely uptight and frigid Aubrey (Camp), who along with the more friendly and effervescent Chloe (Snow), must recruit a whole new squad since the rest either graduated or quit after the nationals embarrassment. As the Bellas leaders, Snow and Camp have a wonderful, mature "Mean Girls" rapport with each other. The potential aca-recruits (for the Bellas, Trebles, and two other campus acapella groups) must sing "Since You've Been Gone" in a hilarious audition scene. Among the new Bellas are the rebellious Beca (Kendrick), the loopy and caustic Fat Amy (Wilson), slutty Stacie (Knapp), the uber-quiet Lilly (Lee), and powerhouse singer Cynthia Rose (Dean). Special mention should go to "other 3" Bellas Jessica (played by Kelley Jakle), Denise (played by Wanetah Walmsley), and Ashley (played by Shelley Regner), as they, along with Lilly, do a lot of the non-verbal sounds required of an acapella group to mimic musical instruments.Jesse (played with utter charm and sublime confidence by Astin) gets recruited by the Treblemakers, of course, and a "taboo" romance (Bellas and Trebles don't mix!) between he and Beca forms during the course of the school year. I really enjoyed the sweet Beca-Jesse pairing. It was a refreshing change-of-pace as they bonded through their love of music (Jessie wants to be a film scorer and Beca a DJ) and actually had an "old-fashioned" courtship, on a college campus no less where sex is probably rampant! Kendrick and Astin had a natural underplayed chemistry that flows, giving the film it's heart.What's stunning about this movie is that virtually all of the main cast are not professional singers or dancers, yet you couldn't tell by watching the film! Whatever training they had to endure in the making of the movie, EVERY actor actually translates to the screen as having musical and dance talent. While it's obvious that Astin and Dean are natural and experienced singers, stunningly, actors like Kendrick, Snow, and Wilson held their own and really sounded great, as well.My favorite scenes included the aforementioned audition scene, the "riff-off" scene where different acapella groups strung off a sequence of diverse songs, the "Just the Way You Are/Just a Dream" mash-up scene, the "Party in the USA" bus scene, the Trebles nationals performance, and the climactic "payoff" scene of the Bellas final routine at nationals, an energetic, sexy, uplifting performance of mashed-up songs, with one particular song that symbolizes the Beca-Jesse relationship.Although the musical performances are great, I actually think Pitch Perfect excels in the comedy department as well, and I wouldn't enjoy this film nearly as much if it weren't so funny. Amazingly, I think the film manages to avoid a lot of clichés that one would expect, and even though the climax is predictable, it's the getting there that surprised me. Examples are: (1) the "nerds" of the movie, the Trebles, were pretty proud of their nerdiness and actually make fun of the "cool" types and didn't get bullied as one would expect in such a movie, (2) the Bellas were accepting of each other's uniqueness; there was tension, but mostly due to the pressure of competition; they all actually LIKED each other; there was no "evil" versus "good"; Aubrey and Beca had believable conflict with each other; Aubrey was controlling and stern, but not in a mean-spirited way; she was under immense pressure and felt threatened by Beca, while Beca was nonconformist and cool, but too much of a loner; there were shades of gray, and (3) in the end, it wasn't about Bellas versus Trebles or winning, but about compromise, teamwork, friendship, and love. I know it's cliché, but comedy ain't easy! Director Jason Moore does an excellent job with this musical-comic keeper!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Pitch Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the ending of Pitch Perfect rolls by, you can just about guess that one day, this will make it to the stage as a musical. After all, it has all the necessary ingredients for a more up close and personal experience, with a zero to hero story, great songs that can be changed each time it's staged (and keeping it fresh of course), and characters that are feel good, funny, with nary a villain just opponents battling it out for the top prize in acapella singing.Directed by Jason Moore, who cut his teeth in Broadway and at the helm of his debut feature film, here's something that had the battle of tradition bubbling beneath it, dealing with adaptability to change rather than sticking with the old that can only get you so far at times. And it can be applicable to any field, because while it may be OK to embrace tradition, sometimes sticking to the same old doesn't produce results when others have already moved along with the times, and developed key changes to put them ahead.For the Baden College Bellas, the all girl acapella group that finally made it to the finals of a competition amongst college peers, they literally choked up, and find a new school year being their year of redemption, if only they can recruit new blood. Leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) and her lieutenant Chloe (Brittany Snow) eventually do so, with a riff raff of college freshies who make it through the auditions, before finally find it an uphill battle to try and convince them to do things the original, strait-jacketed way. It's typical of a zero to hero that the Japanese have perfected in their similarly themed films, where a motley bunch have to unite to achieve a common goal, but having to battle internally first before they can do so with others, personified in their college rival, the all male team calling themselves Treble Makers.Anna Kendrick has top billing for headlining the freshman group, starring as Beca, an aloof girl whose interest lies in mixing music and aspiring to become a club DJ. Skylar Astin gets thrown into the mix as the newcomer to the Treble Makers, who also tries his best to hit on Beca, if not for her rejection of his advances. Yes, this is as rote a development of a relationship between the two, especially when the Bellas have a sticky no-dating-of-Trebles rule that didn't make too much headway in the film.While the many caricatures in the Bellas have some of the funniest lines and scenes, perhaps it is Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who stood out the most, since she exhibited perfect comic timing with her performance, and is very much self-deprecating for the most parts. What's more, coupled with an awesome voice and great stage presence, she steals everyone's thunder in the movie, and is undoubtedly one of, if not, the favourite with everyone who had come to watch this. Her performance is probably the only thing you'll remember, besides the musical arrangements, days after you've watched this movie.Loosely based on Mickey Rapkin's non fiction book of the same name, which had the writer spend significant time exploring the real world of college acapella singing, Pitch Perfect boasts an almost insightful look at the squabbles and rivalry amongst members, especially when ego and distractions come into play. The story has its usual college student angst, with laugh out loud comedy peppered all around that makes it fun especially when things aren't taken too seriously. But what made this movie about acapella singing work, is exactly acapella singing and the performances themselves. Credit goes to the music producers of Ed Boyer and Deke Sharon from real acapella communities to know just about what works, and what doesn't, and to design a formidable set list for the film, ranging from the bland (deliberate for the Bellas robotic, lacklustre show), to the mind-blowing mash up of genres that begs listening to.Oh, and those who have not watched The Breakfast Club, too bad that this film will spoil it for you with the ending literally highlighted time and again. Pitch Perfect may not be perfect given a rather straight-forward narrative, but it's the showcase of songs, and individual performances, that makes it a champ. A definite recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect directed by Jason Moore is one of the most acctastic movies in A Cappella history. Beca (Anna Kendrick) the main character an alternative singer wanting to be DJ who is heading off the college for the first time. While she arrives on campus she meets many new people one of which acca awkwardly forces her to try out for the all girl Barden Bella's A Capella group. This movie brings comedy, relationships, and music to the world of college.Pitch Perfect is one of the most easily funny quoted movies of all time. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is one of the funniest characters that most people can relate to. Everything that comes out of her mouth is extremely hilarious and quotable. This movie is purely based on comedy and every scene has you laughing so hard you'll end up in tears. Even when the movie is at a serious part the characters are still saying something funny to keep you engaged and laughing. There will not be a scene in the movie where you are not in tears from laughing. Pitch Perfect is somewhat of a romantic comedy.When Beca joined the A Cappella group for the first time she knew no one. Soon she began forming historical relationships with her fellow A Cappella singers and a boy named Jessie (Skylar Astin) from the on campus rival A Cappella group the Treble Makers. Beca went from the freshman that no one listened to too the person everyone looked to for help. With each friendship/relationship she makes it relatable to the audience by showing how no matter who you are you can always make friends. The friendships Beca makes with her A Cappella friends are extremely funny and keep everyone on the edge of their seats because the audience never knows what they are going to say or do while the group is together.The music in the movie is creative and grabs the listener's attention. Once you here the songs you will go right to iTunes and want to buy the talented, catchy, and creative songs. Even the background music in the different type of scenes grabs the listener's attention. There is not one dull song in the background or in the songs that the cast sings. In the scenes with background music the songs relate well to what is going on in the movie. With the songs that the cast sings they are mashed well together to create an original song that has never been sung or heard before. The voices of the singers are amazing and every character is musically talented with their vocal chords.The producer could not have picked a better cast in the creation of this movie. The movie keeps you in tears from laughing so hard. The movie is definitely an original motion picture. This movie has you surprised the whole time through the comedy, relationships and music. Pitch Perfect was perfectly executed and it couldn't come out on DVD soon enough. I rate this movie 5 out of 5. It is easily one of my favorite movies of all time and I recommend it to everyone who has not seen it to watch it because it is extremely funny and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After joining a college all girl a cappella group Beca (Anna Kendrick) sees the group going nowhere unless some changes are made.How many of you knew there were a cappella singing groups on college campuses? Everyone I asked had no idea there were such things. I didn't either. Yet, in here a big deal is made of them and we see several groups vying for first prize in the Nationals.What was wrong. The Barden Bellas, the group Beca joins hurt themselves the previous year when one of the lead singers vomited all over the stage during the finals. A new group was formed. Aubrey (Anna Camp) the leader, kept insisting on the same songs to win the competitions. Beca disagreed and felt a new direction was needed. The music and choreography were passable but one did notice a lot of lip syncing. One girl, who no one could hear because her words went back into her mouth as soon as they were spoken, was also a member of the group. Why? She couldn't project anything. Oh, I see, that was supposed to be funny? It wasn't . This was intended to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny anywhere. The script is shallow with Beca not wanting to be in college in the first place and has an on-going battle with her father regarding this. Rebel Wilson, who played Fat Amy, tried to lighten things up but that didn't work out. The girl who did vomit angels wasn't funny at all. Vomit Angels? Give me a break. The romantic angle with Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin) was too contrived to be a serious thing and we just didn't care. With a title as Pitch Perfect I expected something more along the lines of the King's Singers who are the best at a cappella singing. Something??.something close. Didn't happen. (3/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest film of 2012</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨You're one of the a cappella girls. I'm one of those a cappella boys, and we're gonna have aca-children. It's inevitable.¨I laughed so hard during this entire movie, Pitch Perfect is this year's Bridesmaids. The dialogue was so funny that I actually thought the screenplay was written by Tina Fey, but I was surprised to find out that Kay Cannon (30 Rock and New Girl) was the person responsible for adapting it considering this is the first film she works on as a screen writer. What is even more surprising is that the film was also directed by first time director Jason Moore. Two relatively unknowns in the film industry have made what in my opinion was the funniest movie of the year. I could watch this film over and over again considering it has a funny script and an excellent soundtrack. The film is very catchy, but at the same time it knows the material is ridiculous and plays along with it. I felt like it was a sort of satire on Glee at times, but it balances really well the idiotic moments with some cool choreographed a cappella songs. Several scenes will remind you of Bring it On as well. I just had a lot of fun with this movie. Another thing Pitch Perfect has taught me as well is that Anna Kendrick can carry a movie as a lead actress. She's been amazing as a supporting actress in other films, but now that she had the chance to have a lead role she delivers. She should get bigger roles in Hollywood because she has proved she has the talent. Some might find this film ridiculous, because it does borderline on several whacky situations, but at the end of the film it's impossible not to leave it with a huge grin on your face. Becca (Anna Kendrick) is a freshman from Barden University that dreams of going to LA and becoming a DJ, but her father is a professor at Barden and urges her to study there at least for one year. If she doesn't like it, then he promises to help her out with her plans to go to LA, but under the condition she get more involved in the College activities. That is when she decides to join the Barden Bellas, an all girl a cappella group headed by two other students: Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp). After a disastrous participation in last year's collegiate finals, Chloe and Aubrey are having a hard time recruiting new blood. Besides recruiting Becca, they also call on Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean), and Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), some very unconventional picks but needed in order to face last year's champions: the all male group, The Trebles. They are managed by Bumper (Adam DeVine) who recruits Jesse (Skylar Astin), a close friend of Becca's. The Trebles are the favorite to win the competition again this year, but the Bellas will do whatever it takes to go one step further and win the championship.Pitch Perfect is a cross between Bring it On, Mean Girls, and Glee; although it takes itself way less seriously than the TV series does. Anna Kendrick is great in the lead role; she shines in this film and has a great voice as well. Rebel Wilson gets the most laughs with all her impromptu monologues. She is extremely funny in this film, as she had proved in the past with Bridesmaids. Elizabeth Banks also has a small role as Gail, the commentator of the collegiate competition, and she is really funny in this. Every comment she makes is hilarious. I was really surprised by this whacky comedy, and what I enjoyed the most was the feel good ending with some great musical performances from the a cappella groups. This is in my opinion the funniest film of the year and one I wouldn't mind to watch over and over again. Be prepared to laugh.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MUCH BETTER than I expected. Received preview ticket, and went reluctantly, braced for a shallow, mean, trite and petty movie. (Sorry! Maybe the photo or writeup on the ticket misled me...) I'm a frumpy, conservative adult. But I very much love music as a teacher, consumer, and performer. I GRINNED throughout the entire movie. The rating is fair, though movie does border on R, so be warned. The MUSIC is up and fun. This is not a musical in the sense people talk to each other in songs. It has a LOT of singing, partly because people that like to sing are with people that like to sing, so they SING. If you've been on a bus headed to camp, and joined in a song, you know how that can happen. The script just built in a lot of opportunities to sing. The dialog is snappy and clever. Characters are stereotyped artfully and quickly, allowing the banter to zing along and entertain with breathtakingly little setup. Just enough explanation is given to account for motive, even regarding the "mean" behavior, and make it understandable. "My Cousin Vinney" has no "villains", and in the end maybe the same can be said here. The only movie in my limited experience I'd compare it to is "She's All That", because it is at school, there is a pretty, talented, aloof main female character (here, Anna Kendrick), some romantic suspense, few adults anywhere to be seen, and it lands on its feet. But compared to "She's All That", "Pitch Perfect" moves quicker -- it is lighter on its feet ---, has more interesting, likable characters, and is LOADED with entertaining performances---song and choreography --- which are pitched too perfect to be live, but presented in movie form in a way that is bound to delight and energize. Left theater happier than I arrived by a long shot. I would like to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie when you are sick and take look at your DVD's you will pick out and watch to feel better. It is in the range of Sister Act and High School Musical, movies you definitely watch more than once. Anna Kendrick carries the movie with ease and leaves enough room for the rest to blossom. The singing is pretty good, Brittney Snow an Anna stand out for me. The "Just the way you are" clip is on youtube and will give you a good impression. Off course there's a girl meets boy story in it, there should be. A nice guy is hitting on here and she let's him in one bit at a time. Simple and well written imho. The final performance you have to watch and listen more than once to understand all the detail and appreciate the arrangement. There's only one disturbing thing in the movie and that's way to much puke, way over the top. But not one movie is perfect ;) If you like feel good movies with singing, you will enjoy this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't quite dragged to this but nor was I rushing to sit in a cinema full of 500 teenage girls to watch a Glee rip-off. It didn't take any dragging to get me back in the second time. This movie is being so undersold. It should be bigger than the Hangover.This is what Glee should have been. The music is awesome. The dancing is awesome. The script is awesome. The performances are awesome. Some of the set piece performance scenes had people in the audiences spontaneously clapping. Anna Kendrick is amazing!! She is angsty and grumpy when she needs to be without ever losing out on being sexy and alluring and smart.Rebel Wilson is hilarious! She takes set-up gags and lines that deserve a snort of derision and makes you fall off your seat with her delivery.Elizabeth Banks (with more than a little help from John Michael Higgins) almost steals her own movie out from underneath them all despite having less lines than Arnie in the Terminator.And the supporting cast are fantastic. Even where they are trying to play stereotypes they take enough of the edge off them to make them lovable in their own right. The musical director and the script writers for this absolute gem deserve to be picking up armloads of awards. The script synopsis is basic, nothing clever at all, you know the ending from the start. But that doesn't matter, the journey to that ending is simply fantastic.And it is worth going twice. Some of the jokes are well hidden. Tucked in behind others so you are still laughing at the first and you miss the follow-up. Some are even hidden in plain sight but you are too busy watching something more obvious. The rape whistle gag (in the trailer so not a spoiler, sneaks back in near the end but in such a hectic scene you can easily miss it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Pitch Perfect first came out every single person I spoke to raved about it. Even my wife saw it multiple times (a rarity for her) and loved it. So the bar was set very very high for when I finally sat down to watch it. Well, no matter how high your expectations Pitch Perfect will certainly meet and probably exceed them. Now don't get me wrong you have to know what you're going into. I've read reviews on here that trashed the film as though they had no idea they were heading into a film that is essentially a musical, a teen comedy and in some ways...yep...a Glee knockoff. In fact, Pitch Perfect blends together a lot of different films and TV Shows. I saw a little bit of Bring It On, 10 Things I Hate About You, Glee, Breakfast Club...it's a genre mix of very popular movies in the same genre and why the heck not? Those are all great movies/TV Shows. It adds its own flare and unique characters and enough so that you will laugh and be moved and you'll wanna groove to the unique soundtrack with various mash-ups. The film is just really well put together to appease even the most critical movie goers.I enjoy Anna Kendrick but have never really seen her in a role that truly impressed me. Well this role truly impressed me. It was very stereotypical and certainly not a huge leap for a decent actress and yet it was a different type of role for Kendrick and she made it her own and made her character fun and likable. Skylar Astin plays Kendrick's love interest Jesse. He was good, but not great. He wasn't on the calibre of similar roles in other teen flicks that I previously mentioned. The chemistry between the two of them is good but not outstanding. Brittany Snow is cute and funny and enjoyable as she usually is. This isn't a stretch for her but she's perfect doing what she does best. Anna Camp is the loud and demanding Aubrey. Her role is pretty straightforward for the genre film but she also fits it well and does perfectly. I heard so much about Rebel Wilson in this film and how hilarious she was. My concern would be that they would overuse her in her role (Jar Jar Binks syndrome) but I was completely wrong. She was awesome, very funny (apparently ad-libbed most of her lines) and she wasn't overused at all. She was outstanding just as everyone said. I wish I could mention everyone in the supporting cast but I simply don't have the space. Everyone played their role very well, and you will certainly easily find your favourite character amongst the misfits. I particularly enjoyed Hana Mae Lee as the quiet weird Asian girl Lilly. Adam Devine made a great pseudo-villain playing a very Jack Black type character (even looked and sounded like him.) I've used the word stereotypical a lot because this film is. Its very set in its genre and the characters are all very typical for this type of successful film. If they had broke the mold and done something even a little different, this would have been a HUGE 10/10. As it is, it is insanely fun, the music is just feel good and well performed and the cast works so well together that you can't help but fall in love with the whole zany bunch. I could have turned around and watched this again just as many people did in the theatre. Jason Moore who comes from Television but most importantly comes from Broadway instantly weaves together everything in a perfect little bow. The movie is fun and sassy and just a hoot to watch. Absolutely the perfect entertainment for something truly fun. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should admit that I am not a fan of on-screen projectile vomiting (was scarred as a youngster by the pie eating contest turned barfarama in "Stand By Me"). "Pitch Perfect," contains not one, but two scenes, one extended, where a character pukes, and we get treated to every gruesome detail, including another character lying in the puke making snow angels. If you have a delicate stomach like this reviewer, you may want to close your eyes a few times. Otherwise, "Pitch Perfect," is pretty standard fare.Anna Kendrick plays a first year at Barden College, who becomes involved in an all-women's a-capella group because she wants her dad to pay for her to go to LA to become a DJ eventually. Bitter over her parents' divorce, she has no desire to make friends or even boyfriends, but slowly things begin to change, as she gets involved with the on-campus culture of a-capella. Her fellow "Bellas," include Rebel Wilson, a self-named warbler named Fat Amy, who is treated much better by the script than most plus-sized characters in movies and emerges as a strong, likable presence. A love interest in the form of Skylar Astin, who belongs to the Bellas' rivals also tries to capture Kendricks' interest. The outcome is predictable, but the musical numbers are fun, and if you don't mind a few gross-out gags and are a Glee-ster, you should enjoy "Pitch Perfect."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much of this movie. I was aware that this is probably just another teen / comedy movie for some kind of relaxation (a.k.a not thinking too much while watching movie). But I was so wrong, because this is one of the WORST movies ever. Awful plot, even worse acting, anti-charismatic actors, not one laugh during movie. There is no description for this movie - this is just so bad that it can't be described. I really hope that my comment about this movie will help someone to save two hours of their life and decide not to watch this movie. At the end, I really can't understand how this movie can have such a high score. If someone is only reading last sentence - REMEMBER - It is more amusing to stare 2 hours at the wall than it is to watch this movie or should I call it THE WORST MOVIE EVER!</fullReview>

The mainly female cast was pretty weird and funny, in all the right ways.I liked the different mixes of the songs explored in the movie. And liked how 'The Breakfast Club' can influence people even today.Anna Kendrick is charming as always. But Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks are the ones who deliver the most shockingly funny lines in the movie.Philip French from 'Observer UK' says, "It's 80% affectionate parody of this sort of musical, but the numbers are taken seriously and are admirably choreographed, and the performances are sprightly." - and it's quite apt.Anyone who loves music and musicals will easily like the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, after watching the commerical I thought Rebel Wilson looks quite funny in this movie. After going to the theaters and watching this movie, I was deeply disappointed. People kept laughing at scenes I did not think were funny at all. Punchlines were stupid, acting was bad as well as singing. The plot was just a general cliché, predictable. One of my favourite movies is The breakfast Club and the fact they made references to it pisses me off. When she's watching the end, and crying, I thought that was stupid. Her acting was bad and it was just cheesy. Also, my idol is Elly Jackson (Bulletproof, 2009, La Roux) and the remix they made to her song was AWFUL. I wanted to shoot myself after hearing it. It ruined a wonderful song. My sisters love this movie but I really can't stand it. Don't waste your time or twenty bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Disappointing to Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically, there is one character (Fat Amy) who singlehandedly makes this film almost-pseudo-watchable. She's irresistible. Without her, it would be 1/10. Extremely clichéd and unimaginative plot, with humor that is often unbelievably weak and forced, frequently over-sexed and in many cases, not really genuinely funny. All of it adds up to something that you might expect to see on Disney (although I enjoyed High School Musical far, far, far more), but with enough crude content to justifiably preclude that target audience. Pitch Perfect is not a really good, emotionally believable story; neither is campy/ironic/self-aware enough to be the good kind of ridiculous. Maybe it is only I who am to blame for going to see this, and it is only my opinion, but this is the worst movie that I have seen in recent memory. (Even Zoolander seems better in retrospective comparison, and that is saying something.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect hits all the right notes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect (2012) it is a musical comedy film and I love it so much. The same way that I love Bring it On (2000) which I love sport films and this is a team completion of a singers on a Capella University. Anna Kendrick is fantastic as Beca Mitchell who changes everything in the singing group. There is a lot of funny moments scenes, this film has a lot chemistry, it is a fun film and the music is good! This film is good I actually don't like music films they aren't my cup of tea. But this film is surprisingly good. I just watched in Friday Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) which was pretty good, I love it, I just love this film much more. Just recently saw this but I love it and have seen the second 3 times already. The singing is good and it's a hilarious movie. There's nothing more refreshing than when a movie pleasantly surprises you, and "Pitch Perfect" does exactly that. We've all seen plenty of flicks in which a group of singers or dancers struggle with adversity and end up winning over everyone with their earnest performances.The formula hasn't changed here, but it manages to improve upon it with a hugely entertaining cast, some consistently unpredictable humor, and a series of awesome a Capella musical numbers. Everyone in the film is fantastic, but it's Rebel Wilson who steals the spotlight from everyone as the hilarious Fat Amy. If you thought her lines in the trailer were funny, just wait till you see her in full-fledged action. Anna Kendrick is also memorable as the film's down-to-earth protagonist, as is Elizabeth Banks in a small but enjoyable role as an a Capella commentator. But without a doubt, it's the enjoyable stage performances and impromptu sing-offs that make this flick so much fun to watch. The best battle is in the middle, when the girls go against the guys in a game of song tag. The only thing that sort of drags the movie down is the forgettable side story featuring Anna Kendrick and Skyler Astin, but at least it leads up to a sweet conclusion. With a solidly hilarious script and some phenomenal a Capella numbers, "Pitch Perfect" is easily one of the year's most entertaining films, bringing together a strong, original, and eclectic cast with actual singing abilities. Sure, some of the physical gags do go a tad too far at times, but the flick's cheeky sense of comedy and Rebel Wilson's knockout performance make it all worthwhile.Pitch Perfect is Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story for the Glee set. Or the anti-Glee set even, and it's in that tricky middle that director Jason Moore's quasi-irreverent musical comedy sings. It's never quite the pitch-perfect genre it could be -- oh come on, you knew that one was coming -- but it pays just enough respect to raw talent, takes just enough cheap but affectionate shots at the collegiate singing competition circuit, and strikes just enough of a balance to emerge a full-fledged crowd pleaser. Add to that a well-cast ensemble that knows how to earn a laugh and belt a song and a series of a Capella arrangements primed to convert the unconverted, and you have a comedy that deserves a shot. I love this film to death it is my favorite film. Pitch Perfect is a 2012 American musical comedy film directed by Jason Moore. It features an ensemble cast, including Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, John Michael Higgins, and Elizabeth Banks.10/10 Score: A Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Adam DeVine Ben Platt, John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks Director: Jason Moore Producer: Elizabeth Banks Screenplay Kay Cannon Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 58 Mins.

		<fullReview>Just finished watching Pitch Perfect. Had no clue what to expect. It was highly recommended from a friend, but not given any insight before watching. Must say I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, I wasn't bowled over in tears laughing, but it certainly was funny. Slapstick comedy with physical humor and the singer's voices were pretty good. Long and short of the story is a bunch of college kids competing to win every singing competition. Winning seems to be the most important thing in life. Ironically, the only link to the college is the campus setting. We don't see them attend even one class. It's all about outdoing each other's team. Don't expect any moving life lessons, but it's a fun, light mix of college pranks, comedy, sarcasm and guy gets girl. I'd recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i hate musicals, generally, but i freakin' loved this movie. the plot may be "formulaic" but honestly, all plots are derivative; it's been said there are really only the same stories, told over and over again throughout history. the acapella performances are stellar, making me an instant fan, but even better, the multidimensional and highly original CHARACTERS are simply amazingly fun to watch. This is a fantastic comedy, lighthearted without being simply fluffy. It does not take itself too seriously and yet is executed with enormous creativity and integrity. The chemistry among the players here is phenomenal. Fat Amy is the BOMB, i'd never seen Rebel Wilson before, i fell completely in love, and Fat Amy not my only favorite character. Rarely have I seen a film where not only the leads are engaging but every single supporting player has some special and intriguing quality. Every performer shines here. I enjoy a lot of comedies, but not many make me laugh out loud multiple times. The humor ranges from outrageous to quotable to subtle ("we've been here the whole time") to simply visual to the simply strange but it all works. And I love the cultural references. Producers hit this baby out of the park, and Elizabeth Banks (producer) with John Michael Higgins has some of the funniest lines in the whole movie as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, I did not know what kind of a movie this is... I knew Anna's name from the Billboard charts but nothing else. I was kinda surprised that it is a teenage comedy with elements of musical comedy.What I liked about the movie is that it has a good mix of songs used - both sung by various groups who compete and as a background music. The blond Fat Amy was very cute in the film. The main girl - Beca was too reminiscent ( name and appearance) of Bella from the Twilight saga. Her love interest is kinda too similar to American Pie boy. I don't know if it just for me similar or it was intentional.All in all, the film is OK. Kinda funny, not boring. Good to pass the evening while there is storm outside.So, there is the follow-up... I guess it is not too much different than the original one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to watch this with my cousins(who are all girls) I thought it would just be some dumb chic flick girl musical type thing. But damn was I wrong. This movie is hilarious and the musical numbers are amazing. The cast all shine but the top prize definitely goes to Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy who steals every scene. The movie focuses on a girl called Becca(expertly played by Anna Kendrick) as she starts her life in college. She reluctantly joins the all girl occepela group, The Barden Bellas, as they try to claim their title. The song sequences are awesome and the jokes are really funny. The entire cast shine. I think what makes the film so funny is the diversity of the Bellas. There is the lesbian, the fat one, the slut, the control freak, the rebel and the goofy quiet one. Basically it is a funny musical and I hope the sequel is just as good as this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming in to this movie I couldn't help but think: Is this gonna be another cheesy chick flick? Well, it is. But its on the better side of the chick flicks and, like Bridesmaids, it provides solid entertainment for what it is. I can say I thoroughly enjoyed most of the movie and thought some of the characters were actually pretty realistic. And these girls are HOOOOT (Fat Amy OMG)! The downside of the movie is pretty much that it is basically a chick flick and therefore intended for the feminine side. Also, some things escalate pretty quickly, like Anna Kendricks kind of transition from being the hot dark hot topic type girl to being the hot A Capella singer. But the character of the guy that works with her in the radio station, AWESOME! I am that dude in real life, seriously. In the end, I enjoyed Pitch Perfect, I laughed and will say it is a good, enjoyable comedy, even for dudes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a supposedly edgy girl who is forced to attend college by her professor father. He's as cool as a film aimed at teens will allow him to be (see Harry Dean Stanton in "Pretty in Pink"). More than anything, I think "Pitch Perfect" wants to be a John Hughes film, but there are numerous similarities to other films (like the cheer films). Beca wants to be a producer of music, but she find herself a member of the Bellas, an all girl a cappella singing group dedicated to conservative dress and tame renditions. Beca plays the adventurous girl cliché we have seen in many other films. She is the welder who bring flashdance to the ballet world. She is the white girl who brings hip hop to the ballet world. She is Baby, bringing dirty dancing to the stodgy world of the middle-upper class vacation resort. What revelation does Beca bring to the glee world? The layering of songs. Earth-shaking.Beca has a rather uninspired romance with a guy who sings for another a cappella group, The Treblemakers. He, unlike her, is a movie fan and he recommends she watch "The Breakfast Club" (by John Hughes). After finally watching the film, she suggests that the Bellas reveal secrets about themselves, but nothing is really revealed.There also is the clichéd fat girl, named Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who is sexually aggressive and loud--surprise!"Pitch Perfect" is a Glee-ful tribute whose best attributes are the music and the voices that sing the music. They make the film worth listening to. Also worth watching are Adam Devine as Bumper ("Modern Family) and Brittany Snow as Chloe. Too bad the script was not strong enough to support the other talented actors in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i am a little late to this party, well actually really late but with the sequel right around the corner i thought why not see why there is a sequel in the first place. And i can just say that i have no idea why or how i managed to miss this movie over the last three years. In terms of modern musicals it is definitely one of the biggest ones out there. This movie utilises great musical pieces and manages to incorporate an interesting plot and quite a bit of pretty good comedy that connects with the personalities of each of the characters. I will start with saying that i thought the characters were very well written, there may be some stereotypical hints in the way they act but overall you have a group of women who are all very different and recognisable for different reasons. This diversity really helps to keep interest in the film have certain jokes last for the entire duration. In terms of the performances they were all very good, especially Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson who just steal the show in mostly every scene. Rebel Wilson's comedy was one of the highlights, always lightening the mood every now and then. The only issue i had with the film was it being just a tad inconsistent for the first two thirds mainly. I constantly found myself gradually enjoying the film and then not as much and then really enjoying it before kinda wanting it to move on again. It felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride in terms of interesting and not so interesting parts, a more balanced film work have worked a lot more. So in the end, apart from that i really found myself enjoying this film, there was a good plot, likable characters, plenty of comedy and some great songs that really get you singing along. - 7.7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is easily the most enjoyable film of 2012, Pitch Perfect isn't Glee or any of that annoying rubbish, it's something different, it's as eventful as the Eurovision and as entertaining as putting Britain's Got Talent and X-Factor together. An exceptional ensemble of hugely talented actresses own the stage/screen taking chart topping hits and mixing them up with an extraordinary style. It's unpredictable, crazy funny and there's a great pace to it, no boring moments, just all out fun. There are very few moments where some of the male singing is cringe and hard to listen to, but the cast's comedy timings more than make up for that. Anna Kendrick is brilliant, Rebel Wilson is hilarious, her one liners, stage strutting madness and overall nuttiness will have you howling with laughter, same with the Chinese girl whose whispers everything, and then suddenly bursts into song, this movie is so uplifting. Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp and the whole Bella group are spectacular, they are so entertaining to watch. The song performances are so infectiously brilliant that you can't help but sing along. I guarantee you'll be smiling throughout, and the ending at the finals is 10 minutes of musical greatness, I was smiling the whole way, a must see movie.</fullReview>

Now, while I don't believe I had the same reaction I did a year ago, it was still a ton of fun, funny and had a ton of cute guys I had forgotten about ? a big shout out to Treble backup singer #2 (Michael Anaya,) who had zero lines, sadly, but my eyes were never anywhere else than him when he was on screen. Unfortunately, this was his one performance, but here's to hoping to see him again. I digress?while I had a ton of fun with the great music and dancing, the characters and their dialogue was, in fact, perfect. Fat Amy, Jesse and Gail were all great, but the actress I'm not a real fan of, but completely won me over, was Anna Kendrick (Beca) who just elevated this movie even higher with her hilarious wit and delivery. If you haven't seen this?do so now. I mean, the sequel's coming out soon, so hip hop to it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crowd pleaser that makes its clichés work and stays consistently funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just from the premise of "Pitch Perfect" you can probably predict what the storyline will be like. What you won't see coming is how cleverly written, funny and well performed the film is. I have a theory that for every genre, for every story that's been done time and time again, for every cliché there has to be a few instances where all the pieces fall together so well that you won't mind that you will be able to tell where everything is going. As evidence to back up my theory, I present to you this film.Beca (Anna Kendricks) dreams of making it big in the music industry and is reluctantly attending college as per her father's demands. In an effort to make the year more bearable she joins an all-female a cappella group (the members include Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Kelly Alice Jakle, Wanetah Walmsley and Shelley Regner). This rag-tag group is disorganized and can barely get through a single song... You might call them underdogs. With a bit of practice and bonding though, the Barden Bellas might stand a chance of beating their rivals and winning the national competition.I had heard good things about the picture prior to going to see it, but this musical comedy caught me totally off-guard. The a cappella musical pieces are well sung, original and (when dance is involved) well choreographed. I thought the bits where everyone sings were well integrated into the story too. The writing is very smart, particularly when it comes to the jokes. We have everything from witty plays on words to inappropriate surprise humor with a bit of gross-out thrown in as well and even some a cappella puns. I found the soundtrack to be particularly enjoyable, which should be a given considering it's a musical, but it deserves special mention nonetheless. This is a film that will have a lot of re-watch value because you're going to want to memorize and sing along with the characters at home and with your friends. The numbers are catchy and are truly original because they're not just covers of popular songs done without instruments, they're often remixed or mashed-up In clever ways and often, their inclusion comes as a laugh-out-loud punchline.I found the film to be consistently funny because it knows how ridiculous the premise is. A cappella competitions taken as seriously as college football? It's ludicrous and everyone here knows it. Instead of rolling your eyes as you would in something like "Yu-Gi-Oh! The movie" though, you embrace the characters with open arms, you sing along with them and you get excited to see the film play out the way it's going to? because in this case that's the way you WANT it to play out. Not all of the jokes work but the performances alone make it worth seeing. You'll have a great time and more than a few laughs with it.

		<fullReview>Beca (Anna Kendrick) is that girl who'd rather listen to what's coming out of her headphones than what's coming out of you. Arriving at her new college, she finds herself not right for any clique but somehow is muscled into one that she never would have picked on her own: alongside mean girls, sweet girls and weird girls whose only thing in common is how good they sound when they sing together, in the new out-loud comedy Pitch Perfect. When Beca takes this acoustic singing group out of their world of traditional arrangements and perfect harmonies into all-new mash-ups, they fight to climb their way to the top of the cutthroat world of college a cappella. This could wind up either the coolest thing they'll ever do or the most insane, and it will probably be a little of both.</fullReview>

I may not be Australian but that doesn't matter because I'm working on my amazing accent. I am also in an A Capella group called the Star Shine Bishes. We just started out but you you'll being hearing about us soon. We may not be the best but we are the most entertaining. The two white girls are our lead singers. Yen is our alto. Cookie Jesus is awesome at throwing down beats (and making cookies for us on the road). The Other One is amazing at overthrowing the two white girls for lead singer even though she is terrible at singing. She also makes our routines up. Come check us out coming to a convention center near you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good take on old and overused plots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly enough Pitch Perfect is based on a book, shocking I know, and a non-fiction at that - WTF? - I can't imagine reading a book about collegiate a Cappella groups much less watching a movie about it.The Pitch Perfect plot has every single textbook cliché to make the film a lot worse than what it is but they were smart enough to use them well. Although, there's a boy who meets a girl it's not all about the romance, there's a group who is clearly the underdog but it's not a pity party, and there's a type of good guys against bad guys situation but it's downplayed to the point that they are hardly any bad guys in the film. So what's left? The music, the competition, the camaraderie, and slightly stereotypical but strong women characters. Add in a dash of over the top comedy and it kinda works.Pitch Perfect does not take itself too seriously, it's entertaining with good one-liners and some bad ones. It's weird to say but the movie has personality, those quirky characters are easy to like and even if you know where it is heading - because it's that predictable - it is still an enjoyable movie. @wornoutspines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had NO idea what a fantastic movie I was about to watch when I rented PitchPerfect. I was looking for something other than the dark dramas that are the rave the last few years, and I'd just read Anna Kenndrick's IMDb bio, so I had to give this movie a try. What I thought would be an entertaining movie turned out to be an INSTANT addition to the list of my all-time "Best Movies I Ever Saw" list.PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise hit. It has a solid plot, genius blend of actors and actresses that represent the quirks, humor, talent, personality traits that anyone can relate to - blended to present a visually artistic, inspiring, and unforgettable experience for the audience. I have watched the movie almost 30 times already - and each time, it makes me laugh, and feel those warm fuzzies and goosebumps during the outstanding climax.It is SO hard to find an artistic and inspirational movie these days, especially regarding music and dance, portraying the depth and inspiration of a character who attains the dream of reaching their full potential of their natural talent. This movie delivers that promise with an awe-inspiring, unexpected thrilling climax that'll have you cheering, jumping up and dancing with them, sharing in the joy of their success.I cannot finish my review without mentioning the following worthy "traits" that made this movie such a hit: 1. Rebel Wilson is FANTASTIC, hysterical, lovable - personifying the human nature to overcome one's tendency to feel self-conscious when life hasn't dealt you what society values today. SHE is beautiful, funny, extremely self-confident, and in-touch with herself, exemplifying that we each are special, unique and very worthy if YOU believe you are. 2. Gail and John, the "DJ's" for the Acapella competitions are a total RIOT! Listen carefully to their witty commentary. 3. Anna Kendrick displays yet more of her exceptional talents - not just acting, but what a voice! 4. Aubrey and Chloe - ALL the Barden Bellas have amazing voices! The same goes for the Treble-makers.I'm so glad they are making a sequel, and so looking forward to it. This movie is sure to be a hit for ANYONE and everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast.It's a ton of fun from start to finish,the music is beautiful,very well choreographed and the cast clearly had a load of fun working together.The writing is hilarious,quite similar to Bridesmaids,there are many scenes that had me in stitches and also some parts that were so good simply because of how unexpected they were.The main girls are immensely talented,they were well able to both sing and dance,they are all charming in their own way and this movie really helped them showcase their talent.Pure fun and entertainment, Pitch Perfect is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. An aspiring musician tries to add a touch of cool to her college a cappella group.Best Performance: Anna Kendrick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>before a year, I saw the first half an hour of it and I didn't really like it, I thought it was lame. this year I told my self that I should give it another try and watch all of it focus on what is happening. I did watch it again and I found that it was PERFECT. the songs are so nice and performed in such an accurate way. I was really surprised and I loved it so much. if you watched it then you must look for the song right round, its so nice. Anna Kendrick performance was absolutely incredible, I became a very very big fan of her after watching this movie. I watched up in the air, 50\50, the twilight saga the 4 movies, Scott pilgrim vs. the world, which Anna has starred in. she is my favorite actress of all time. I just love her and her movies. I am really looking forward for pitch perfect 2 which I just watched its trailer, it looks nice. looking forward for it. ANNA KENDRICK IS AMAZING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I felt that it handled the expected comedy very well. The music performed was exceptional. The cast was one of the best possible. When I first went in to view this movie I did not expect it to be phenomenal but it exceeded all expectations. The movie is based off the oncoming popularity wave of Capella music. The main character, Beca, is one of those college students that doesn't really want to be there but is forced to. Her father makes a deal with her, saying that if she joins a club and really works at it he will help her move to LA and quit college.All round, a great movie.</fullReview>

The story is predictable, a group of girls wanted to win some competition, failed at first but winning at the end, like every single movie there is, Bring it on, Glee, Step Up, etc, etc. But that's not the point. The best of this movie is the cast, their acting is great, the comedy is funny, the drama is well built, especially when the team is almost break apart. So, the story might be predictable but with perfect cast, perfect comedy line, and of course perfect song, this movie nailed it! This movie make you wanna sing along. It's rare to see such thing. It's highly recommended. Really waiting for Pitch Perfect 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect is one of the best comedy film I've seen in recent years. Not only was it funny but it was also very clever and the actresses performances were quite good. Anna Kendrick was definitely the best out of all of them. I loved the way she performed as the main character. Her best scene was singing her hit song "Cups". Fat Amy, on the other hand, was the funniest of all. She manages to deliver some of the funniest one liners ever.The movie is very similar to the television show Glee, mainly because of its charm and its plot centered on singing. The singing and dancing were very decent but the best scene I would say would be the scene when the girls are trying out during the auditions. This is the scene that made me laugh the most. The scene with the girl vomiting profusely in the midst of the girls arguing was also pretty funny as well.I recommend this movie everyone, especially teens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard great things about this movie and it came highly recommended. Whilst it certainly had it's moments (a lot of laugh out loud ones) I was left a little disappointed. Plot In A Paragraph: Beca (Anna Kendrick) a freshman at Barden University, is talked into joining The Bellas, her school's all-girls singing group. However she finds herself enjoying it and she ends up injecting some much needed energy into their stale repertoire, The Bellas take on their male rivals in a campus competition. Anna Kendrick who I loved in "Up In The Air" with George Clooney is great here and Rebel Wilson brilliantly stands out as self deprecating Fat Amy, Skylar Austin is OK as Jessie, Becca's love interest with great taste in movies. Of the rest of the cast wanetah walmsley is fun, as is Ester Dean and Shelley Regner, whilst Adam DeVine is great fun and easy to dislike as the smug Bumper Allen.</fullReview>

I thought it would be you average cheesy chick flick movie and that you knew how it would all pan out but it surprised me and that's one of the reasons why I love it. Every second you fall off of your seat because anything that comes out of Rebel Wilson's mouth is pure comic genius. My personal favorite character is Stacie because she brings a lot of funny moments and fat Amy (who is Rebel Wilson's character) is a close second.

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movies Of All Times!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not ashamed to admit that I've seen this multiple times and it gets better on each viewing. On paper, this all looks oh-so High School Musical: The College Years, but the beauty of Pitch Perfect is they way it turns its formulaic moments into unexpected hilarity. There are great moments and the songs are well put together and catchy. m would enjoy. It held my interest throughout and i think it was well produced. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining. The Barden Bellas are a collegiate, all-girls a cappella singing group thriving on female pop songs and their perfect looks. After a disastrous failing at last year's finals, they are forced to regroup. Among the new recruits is freshman Beca, an independent, aspiring DJ with no interest in the college life. But after she meets Jesse, from the rival all-male a cappella group, Beca has a new outlook and takes it upon herself to help the Bellas find their new look and sound and get back into the competition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Place me firmly on the "enthusiastic thumbs way up" team. Movie reviews by definition reflect the opinions of the reviewers. I have seen some very positive and also some extremely negative reviews of this title. I found it refreshing with excellent performances by a talented group of young actors and actresses (and a couple of slightly older models in John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks adding some excellent dead-pan banter to the proceedings as the commentators who may or may not have a past with each other). Where do I start? For me, the music is first rate. I was in glee club and drama club, way back in the Jurassic era known as the 1970's. A Cappella singing, when done right is about as much fun as it gets in my opinion. The comedy: well most reviewers are enthralled with Fat Amy, and I certainly found her laugh out loud funny. Still, I am becoming a huge Anna Kendrick fan and found her more subtle humor even more enjoyable. The other cast members are equally adept. A shout out here for Skylar Astin's Jesse character. I saw where one reviewer commented that if a lady ever finds someone like him, she should marry him. For what its worth, that is exactly what my (late) wife did. I don't understand why male characters in film all have to be jerks. Granted, there are plenty of jerks, male and female in real life. It is nice to see a good, sweet, guy be celebrated and (finally) get the girl. I was Jesse in real life, still am. Right down to the music in movies, as opposed to simply movie musicals-there IS a difference. I am a huge fan of musicals, on stage and on film. Both Skylar and Anna have backgrounds on Broadway by the way, Anna was the second youngest Tony nominee ever and Skylar was in Spring Awakening which won as Best Musical. I think Jesse had an excellent point about the movies he chose for great scores. There are others I could name also. You can never go wrong choosing a John Williams score though. Whether it was done on purpose or not, choosing The Breakfast Club as a plot point is a subtle tip of the hat to perhaps the King of teen movies: John Hughes. And even though his movies were not musical in general, he seemed almost clairvoyant in choosing his soundtracks. (Don't You) Forget About Me is just one example of his ability to anticipate teenage taste in music and be right there backing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching Pitch Perfect, I was a bit skeptical. It didn't really look that great, but my views quickly changed. While watching, I found myself laughing until I couldn't breathe. The lines were delivered perfectly, for the casting was done to a point. The story line got a bit muddled at times but was quickly covered up by some more hilarious dialog. Many of the comedic moments can be repeated among friends and they'll be funny all the same. I felt that the character development was also done well, with good amounts of growth and diversity. I give Pitch Perfect a 9/10 only because of the slightly muffled story line. The story will surely be corrected in the upcoming 2015 sequel, Pitch Perfect 2. On the whole, Pitch Perfect is a movie for all of those who like to laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect happened to come out of nowhere by surprising people on how great this film actually is. I know people were not expecting much from the trailers, but this is a film that comes straight from the heart. I am not a fan of today's music, but I do like a cappella and there is some talent here. There are several top-tapping songs that you can sing and dance along with. The characters are surprisingly relatable and depending on what kind of person you are, there is someone here you can relate with.This film is about a girl named Beca who is starting college against her own will. She is recruited to a women's a cappella team, the Barden Bellas because of her singing talent. Now with her involved, it's up to them to win the national championship.This film has some solid acting. Anna Kendrick is really good in the lead role and I never thought of her as a good singer. Some noticeable stand-outs amongst the team is Brittany Snow as the mean-spirited Aubrey and Rebel Wilson as the funny Fat Amy.Overall, this happens to be a better, much better musical than expected. It may have a formulaic plot, but the fine performances and the abundance of comedy overcomes that issue. It's a funny and moving portrait of life in a modern college society. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

Apart from these I was jubilant to listen to acapellas of 500 miles and Final Countdown. "Cups" song took me spellbound. Among the actors I pick Fat Amy's Character, who hit the correct aca-note every time on screen. On the aca-negative part, I couldn't believe myself of viewing the movie for a-ca-lmost 2 hours because of aca-amazing songs but still sucked at multiple aca-levels. Comical elements are rusted and seen many time before in earlier movies. I hated the makeup, they were too unreal and all female actors looked like Barbie dolls.

		<fullReview>This movie is okay but not great. There's so many little tiny things that bothered me that it overruled everything else. This movie's plot is like Glee, when there's no relationship crap to watch it's all about nationals and regionals and competitions. Things like that. That basic plot didn't bother me much. I wasn't expecting that much in that department. The actors are interesting. They're pretty good at what they got in the script. I like the performances and singing because I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. So where should I start with the things that I disliked so much that made me mad?Let's start with the characters. The main girl Becca? A total bitch for no reason. She shuts people out and its annoying/painful to watch her interact with people. So you're already going into this movie with a character that you know is going to overcome her bitch self and I find that annoying. Onto to Jesse. A cliché. He's a nice guy and he likes Becca for no reason. She's so mean to him. Jesse is played by Skylar Astin who is incredibly hot and could do so much better than Becca. Let's go to Bumper, a jerk for no reason. We could have gotten a flashback or something to explain why he's such a jerk? Torments for no reason. I don't get it. The other girls in the Capella group seem like stereotypes: weird Asian girl, crazy girl, fat girl, black girl. Not enough development to me. I don't like the announcers for the competitions either. They're obnoxious and say incredibly stupid things. And the last person I wanted to talk about is Freddie, the guy who works at the radio station? A useless character. He's nothing but a pair of abs because there's no depth to his character. He's there to be hot. I don't like the amount of vomit in the movie. It's too much. It' s not funny. Are they trying to get guys to watch? It's unnecessary. Beca's job at the radio station is useless after her and Jesse meet. Honestly, I thought her job would conflict with her going to competitions or something. But no, nothing. It's nothing. They could have attempted at character development but they didn't really. And lastly, the hype. It was too much. I hated it. It wasn't that good. Anyway long story short: Okay plot, underdeveloped characters, great performances. You know, what 14 year olds want.</fullReview>

Koreans, Jews, Blacks, Lesbians, Deaf people, gays, East Indians, fat people, ... and that's just in the first 10 minutes. I was hoping to watch a funny film but this one left me feeling sick at all the hateful jokes. Am I the only one out there that had this reaction? Really bummed out that we aren't any more enlightened than the stupid 80s films that slammed anyone who wasn't white and thin. WIsh I hadn't watched this. I'm a major fan of Glee, love a Capella singing (have "STraight No Chaser" music CDs), and am a sucker for cheesy, over-the- top mash-ups of oldies along with choreography, so I would've loved this film if it weren't for all the hateful jokes. I think this must've been written by a bigoted old person, because do kids these days really watch the Breakfast Club and relate to any of that? Honest, I don't mind puke jokes, don't mind sex jokes, don't mind corny jokes, but racism/homophobia/making fun of disabled people is just inexcusable in my opinion. I'm middle-aged, but a teenager that I interacted with recommended this movie when she heard that I was a Glee fan. It depresses me that Hollywood churns out this stuff that makes kids think that bigotry is okay and funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gender Roles in Relation to Pitch Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna Kendrick as Beca and Skylar Astin as Jesse are the prominent stars in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect. This comedic and musical film follows college students at Barden University in Atlanta, Georgia. Beca is a freshman at Barden University and appears at first as an outsider with her interests lying heavily in music and minimally in the college life. The Barden Bellas are a female a-cappella group who previously left a poor impression at a competition when one of the members vomits during the performance. Beca is a new recruit to the Bellas after she was discovered singing in the shower by Aubrey, a Bella returning from the previous year. Beca soon meets Jesse at the radio station where she works, and since he is in the rival male a cappella group, Beca joins the Bellas and works to help them rediscover their voice, their passion, and their talent so that they can find success at future competitions. By placing a male a-cappella group against a female a-cappella group there is an emphasis placed on gender. In the beginning, the male a-cappella group, the Treblemakers, are clearly superior the Bellas, and they win the competition in the opening scene. This establishes the males as being dominant, more talented and superior to the females. As the film progresses, Beca helps the Bellas become more successful. This increase in success level helps to reestablish the females in the film as being equal to the males and shows them as being co-dominant with the rival group. Based on the movie, the director had a goal of making the film light-hearted and easy to view, without making the audience think too deeply about what was being presented to them, while at the same time passing on the message that anything is possible to achieve if you try, and that all it takes is a little bit of help from those around you. The emotional scenes were filled with comedic interludes, making the film more entertaining than serious and thought provoking. This film was not intended to be serious, which is clear based on the comedic qualities. This film is an excellent comedy with familiar music and a talented cast. The comedic style keeps the viewers on their feet for the next pun or jab at pop culture. This film is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice singing can be said regarding this film. Other than that, forget it, as it's your typical high school or college fanfare without the usual academics, everyone has fun and there are always problems, eventually being resolved.Anna Kendrick, who got a supporting Oscar nomination in 2009 for "Up in the Air," is a college freshman who loves music. She joins in basically with a bunch of losers to form a singing group. Naturally, there is always one person who dominates by giving the orders, and it will up to Kendrick to challenge her authority. There are an assortment of characters in the group who are memorable including Fat Amy, whose real name is Fat Patricia, and an Asian girl who speaks just above a whisper.Naturally, Kendrick has problems with her father, a divorced comparative literature professor at the school. Naturally, there is a group who is disqualified since a member of the group wasn't even a college student.What's with the Jewish guys wearing hearing-aids? This should have been explored further. The plot in the film is entirely thin.</fullReview>

Reality Sinks in, knocks and tells me to quit daydreaming.now that i'm slapped awake, the movie's on the average, really. not much to rave about but i guess it is well appreciated, mostly by me, i guess. i like that there's a bit of development in the story. there's reason behind their actions and they somehow improve and learn from whatever it is they were dealing with. they learn team work and unity and blah, blah, blah. the unity of their group is probably the breaking point of the story that made me excited as to what performance they'll pull off.the only thing that left a bad taste in my me about this movie was the exaggerated barf scenes. ASDFGHJKL!! why'd you ruin this movie with that scene? gross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After repeatedly watching the short advert for this movie during TV ads, I caved and rented it. Expecting an sing song version of Step Up, I thought I'd be entertained enough with possible decent dance choreography mixed with funky tracks. However, turned out to feel like a Glee rip off (I don't watch a lot of Glee). Cheesy top 10 tracks, although some I can listen to, felt tacky and weak. Bit too stereotypical for me, but hey, people seem to love it. Some love able characters, Anna Kendrick in particular and Fat Amy provides the most laughter being a new female face in comedy (Rebel Wislon). There's enough laughter and musical numbers to keep many entertained so hats off to them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The soundtrack to Pitch Perfect is a flawless blend of many different musical genres turned a Capella. The energetic Please Don't stop the Music by Rihanna was knocked out of the park by the all male group, the Treble Makers. The Barden Bellas, the all female protagonist group, has a very hackneyed and repetitive line up throughout the movie. The audience, the judges, and even the majority of the Barden Bellas end up tired with their routine. The Trebles keep bringing one high energy performance after another. The Bellas do not show any of this energy till the Riff Off. The Riff Off is the peak of the Pitch Perfect soundtrack. In this scene the four groups face off in a competitive, categorized knock out singing competition. The selection of songs go from Pat Benatar to Dr Dre. The way the groups riff off of each other in the Riff Off is phenomenal. All in all, there is a wide range of music and a mastery of a Capella is demonstrated by all groups in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has enough quirky bits to be enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" is an enjoyable comedy that will appeal to a wide audience. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a girl starting college. She wants to go to LA to get involved in the music industry but as her father is a professor at the college she is getting free tuition. Initially she has no interest in mixing as she intends leaving as soon as she can but her father insists that she participate in college life so she joins an all girl "A Cappella" singing group in the college, because wouldn't you know it, she has a terrific voice.The group came close to winning the National title the previous year but one of its leaders (Anna Camp) had an unfortunate nausea caused event on stage in the final, ruining their chances. Therefore the group's leaders are even more determined to do well this year. However they aren't interested in trying out new styles of performances that Beca suggests. Even more importantly members are not allowed to fraternise with members of the all male group in the college. You can see where this going.There are rehearsals to find new members and a varied bunch of girls (including a black lesbian, and a whispering Asian) is recruited. This part of the movie has some good laughs in it. Of course Beca REALLY likes one of the members of the male group but as she finds herself taking her participation in the group more seriously she decides to avoid temptation by avoiding him.There is nothing very original in the movie but it doesn't take itself too seriously and there are enough quirky characters and dialogue to stop it becoming too bland. The cast also seem to be enjoying themselves. Rebel Wilson has a lot of the best lines as "Fat Amy". The singing sequences are good and don't last long enough to bore viewers who aren't "Glee" fans.Elizabeth Banks is a producer of the movie so I presume it was her own idea to play half of a commentating double act we see at each competition, along with John Michael Higgins. I think they are trying to something similar to what was done to good effect in "Dodgeball", with Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the ESPN 8 commentators. However here the lines just aren't funny enough.An undemanding but enjoyable comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing but Far from Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical comedy "Pitch Perfect" qualifies as an entertaining but uneven comedy. Freshman director Jason Moore and scenarist Kay Cannon have adapted Mickey Rapkin's book about a behind-the-scenes world of competitive collegiate a cappella. Although it boasts an attractive cast with sympathetic, multi-cultural underdog characters galore and a genuine bitch villainess, this PG-13 laffer about an all girl college a cappella group and their antics struggles to be sincere and silly at the same time. Primarily, "Pitch Perfect" is silly. The Barden Bellas are a hard-luck gal group who enter vocal competitions but suffer because they sing old-fashioned songs. Worse, one of their founding members has brought them no end of bad publicity because she projectile vomited into the crowd during a competition. This is part of the problem with "Pitch Perfect." What turns out to be an ostensibly pleasant, engaging comedy is marred by some boorish humor. The projectile vomiting is hilarious in an outrageous sort of way, but it doesn't blend well with our protagonist's antics with her girl group or a fellow radio station intern. Some of the sight gags are funny, like Baloney Barbara. The other problem is the lackluster romance between beautiful Anna Kendrick and a woefully miscast but nice Skylar Austin. They don't generate any sparks. The musical selections and the vocals are terrific, and "Pitch Perfect" looks polished in every area. The heroine, Beca (Anna Kendrick of "Twilight"), tolerates attending class at an all girl's college. She would rather be in sunny California in the music production business, honing her skills and paying her dues as a disc jockey. Beca's annoying father, Dr. Mitchell (John Hickey of "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"), who teaches Comparative Literature, convinces his daughter to give college a try. If she doesn't like college, Mitchell promises to foot the bill for her to go to the West Coast. During move-in day, Beca encounters a warbling fellow in a car, Jesse (Skylar Austin of "Hamlet 2"), and it is love at first sight for him. Later, after she has moved in with a weird Asian roommate who wants nothing to do with her, Beca heads off to the shower. Earlier, she had conversed with Chloe (Brittany Snow of "Hairspray") and Aubrey (Anna Camp of "The Help") about joining the Bellas, but she assured them that she couldn't sing. Chloe hears Beca in the shower, confronts her, and persuades her to join their group. Along the way, Beca stumbles over Jesse who has joined the prestigious Treblemakers, a collegiate a cappella group, and they start seeing each other. Jesse turns Beca into a movie lover.This entertaining romp has some good scenes and some not-so-good scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music makes this the best chick flick I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You do not need to watch Pitch Perfect for the storyline. New member joins downhill-sliding club, changes things around, and everybody lives happily ever after: been there, done that. Also, the film's humor is on more than one occasion in exceedingly bad taste: think dubious sexual references and several scenes with vomit that could have come straight out of an Adam Sandler-movie.You do need to watch Pitch Perfect, however, for its music: the vibrant musical episodes make the movie sparkle and the audience dance in their seats. The picture boasts some strong vocals (contrary to, for example, High School Musical), although it is a shame that the actors are mainly lip-singing. (And I do hope that we are hearing the actual singing actors themselves, instead of 'ghost-singers'.) The obligatory love story is not quite as predictable as in other chick flicks, and the main protagonists make a cute couple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute and funny, great date movie.. reminded me of Mean Girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go see this!Pitch Perfect is a fun comedy with some great songs and good characters, but it still gives a predictable story. This movie is one of the best comedies of the 2012 and gave me some great moments to remember, and even being a guy I felt this was a fun movie. I sometimes enjoy comedies that are aimed at females, like how I even enjoyed Mean girls because it was a good high school comedy. Its also got a lot of heart between its characters so its not one of those comedies that has no soul. Its a goofy comedy with jokes aimed at singers, movies, and a lot of other pop culture references. The story has a romantic interest between the two main characters, which was predictable as usual and I felt it could've been left out of the movie. I also could've been fine without all the vomit jokes. Its true genius lies in the performances of its actors, which includes the hilarious Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who just steals the movie completely. I enjoyed the performance from Anna Kendrick who is sweet and lovable as always, and Skylar Astin who was a fun actor to watch. John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks also were great as the announcers for the competitions, and they return to the screen together after the 2007 film Fred Claus. Another hilarious performance came from Adam DeVine who plays on the show Workaholics, and uses his comedic talents in this film. I loved all the cover songs, and I felt they really did a good job at singing. The finale of the movie gave me goosebumps, and I was surprised that they were able to do this. Pitch Perfect was a fun film to watch and I had a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, snappy, hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The verdict: it's okay. Unfortunately, at it's core the film is a very well-worn path: bunch of semi-losers manage to win.Anna Kendrick is the only one who manages to infuse a character with any sort of personality, but she's too hot to be a genuine outsider, and her lines are way too scripted at times. She also listens to pure pop music, despite sporting various body piercings and being supposedly "alternative". Like, who at that age doesn't know who David Guetta is? Her character wants to create music, but all she does is cut up pop songs and remix them (which you never actually hear anyway). At college age if she isn't either DJing up a storm or at least writing her own material, then it makes her look like a naive kid.The rest of the cast are cardboard. Rebel Wilson is funny-ish, but not in any way that another actor couldn't have done.Some funny lines, some snappy dialogue, and overall very staged scenes. Almost every scene actually feels scripted, rather than organic. The "awkward" scenes are highly unbelievable. This caused me to get taken out of the film's narrative.The Glee-style music is also way too good, especially for people who are mixing in high-energy dance moves. In the space of about 10 minutes the Barden Bellas go from getting kicked out of a fraternity show because they suck to managing "pitch perfect" improvised singing in a disused swimming pool. It's like no one ever thought of singing anything other than 80s songs. That kind of simple naivety unfortunately makes the film feel a bit immature, like a Glee version of Step Up.Overall it's a pretty good attempt at a lite chick-flick, but I wish it had been directed and handled better. It's let down by the cookie-cutter nature of the plot, heavily scripted moment, and no heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bring it on, but more advanced. Glee, but if Glee was more edgy, sarcastic, and sounded better. If you're going to say this is Glee 2.0, you're sadly mistaken. This film combines wit, irony, sarcasm, and the talents of Rebel Wilson (who steals the show), Anna Kendrick (who continues to find her stride in good films) and a surprising turn from Brittany Snow. The supporting cast also does well to add onto the hilarity and delight of Pitch Perfect. If you're a fan of music and comedy, you'll love Pitch Perfect. The only digression for me would be the romantic sub-plot, which the predecessor (Bring It On) progressed better. A fun, witty, and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, the movie industry has been preying on teens with stupid, underdeveloped, and unoriginal films. Pitch Perfect is a stylish and bouncy film about a cappella singing groups who know how to make a show. Though the story is not necessarily original, the way the film is presented is what makes it thrive. Rebel Wilson and Hana Mae Lee practically own this film with their hilarious performances. Anna Kendrick is as impressive as ever. Brittany Snow shows off her talents of singing and acting. Overall, this is a fun film to watch. If the singing and remixes of songs don't get to you, the characters and little love story will. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to enjoy themselves and get a very good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fat Amy: Even though some of you are pretty thin, you all have fat hearts, and that's what matters."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it suggests itself as "Glee: The Movie", "Pitch Perfect" is, pleasingly, something closer to "Mean Girls: The Musical". The plot, with miscellaneous educational misfits a-singing' their troubles away, is straight out of "Glee", but it's interesting how the girls, especially Becca (Anna Kendrick) remixes and adds flavors to two songs or more. It has "Mean Girls" catty wit and shrewdly observed characters, but with some originality and freshness to the jokes it offers. It's certainly among the best teen movies to come along in a while.The music side is also very engaging and interesting, especially coming from the acapella groups. The arrangements are pretty slick and catchy (for the most part) and it doesn't come off as dweeby. It's still plenty of fun, bopping along nicely and building to the big finale, spiced up by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins as competition commentators ? la DodgeBall.It truly is one of the best ensemble comedies I've seen in a while. Becca (Anna Kendrick) hits just the right amount of cuteness and personality. But the spotlight is not purely hers. Jessie (Skylar Astin), Anna's love interest is much more interesting than the standard talking six-pack. Anna Camp and Brittany Snow are stomping Valley-ish as the heads of the group. And Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy ? she calls herself that so bitches won't do it to her behind her back ? steals scenes shamelessly.There's a few scenes here and there that I wish they either cut or they expanded on, but it so rarely happens, so I'm hardly complaining. As long as you have some strong characters with a good story, you can have some very goofy scenes alongside a few scenes of character interaction that is pretty good, you have a strong movie. It's charming, fun, and worth a few re-watches. It's got some funny and good writing, which makes it odd and funny at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect: more of the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Jason Moore. Starring Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin, Ben Platt, Anna Camp, Adam DeVine, Elizabeth Banks, John Michael Higgins. Written by Kay Cannon (screenplay) and Mickey Rapkin (book). Runtime: 112 min.If you do enjoy geeky musical comedy, choreographed pop songs, like in the TV series Glee, and predictable happy endings, you are totally invited to watch Pitch Perfect. Anna Kendrick stars as Beca, a freshman who wants to be a DJ in LA. But her dream cannot be achieved because her father ? a professor in her University ? forces her to give a shot to the college and all that it has to offer as well. That is why Beca joins the Bellas ? an all female 'a capella' singing group. Aubrey(Anna Camp), the captain of the Bellas, doesn't understand why Beca has joined the group; that's because she wants to escape from the traditional performances and Aubrey doesn't. She thinks they can only win the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella if they repeat the same repertory, the same clothes and the same choreography as in all their competitions. Another 'a capella' singing group at Barden University, which will compete with the girls, is the Treble Makers, an all male group from the same university as the Bellas ? and their main enemy.All the boys in the group are popular, including its newer member Jesse (Skylar Astin), who will fall in love with Beca, but during the whole movie she doesn't "realize" she loves him as well. Actually, one of the commandments to be a Bella is not to fall in love with any Treble Maker. Besides all this melodrama, one question keeps in mind: Will the Bellas beat the Treble Makers? If you do want this answer, be prepared to see the entire Apple's products placement. In summary, the energy of the movie is its soundtrack and maybe some laughs with Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who plays, again, the outrageous "fat" character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Glee-like than it's willing to admit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect wants to be Glee plus Easy A, but it's more Glee than it wants to admit. Littered with high school clichés in a college environment, it's surprising that it's more endearing than I thought it could be. The most pleasant surprise is that Anna Kendrick is a great lead. She does a charming job of holding the film on her shoulders when I've only seen her in light supporting roles. However, I did struggle to buy the main premise of the film. They wanted her character to be apathetic to the whole acapella thing but it can't be that hard to ignore that self-aware fad, right? Oh well, this isn't a film that really concerns itself with that. Instead it's half-catchy covers and remixes of popular songs I don't know with a half-assed tribute to 80s movies rammed in there. There's good intentions so it isn't too irritating. Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks steal the show with the best lines. The three actresses totally make it worth watching. But it's overall mild entertainment with an occasional edge to its humour.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to be honest, this movie bored me. When it comes to comedy, this movie disappointed me. I was expecting a movie that would make me laugh on a consistent basis. What I got was a movie that was unbelievably humorless except for a few lines from "Fat Amy". When it comes to the story, it was very cliché. How many times have us movie-goers seen a story of a team (in this case an acapella group) fail in the beginning and claim victory at the end. Overall, I give this movie a five because it has one trait that most movies today lack, a realistic storyline. Even though this storyline is way overused, it still could happen and there weren't many loopholes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I saw an advanced screening of Pitch Perfect in Atlanta, and it was amazing! The singing and dancing done by the different groups was really great, and I thought it really portrayed the dynamic within the a capella group very well, along with the competition between girls' and boys' groups at the same school.I was honestly not expecting it to be as hilarious as it was. Rebel Wilson of Bridesmaids fame had the greatest one-liners, and almost every word out of Hanna Mae Lee's mouth made me laugh. Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins had that super snarky, bitingly bitter air that you imagine commentators having, playing off of each other weirdly and perfectly.I was a little disappointed by the story lines: it felt like they tried to introduce some of the cliché Hollywood story lines to flesh the movie out, but abandoned them halfway through. But that didn't even occur to me until after, since I was so dazzled by the amazing singing and dancing--which is what the movie is really all about. If they had to sacrifice one for the other, I'm glad they focused on the musical numbers, because it's great to see these great singers and actors really perform and entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect (2012) - Get Pitch Slapped!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" is that rare movie where by seeing the trailer, you can probably already tell that it's going to be one of those "Step Up"-type movies, following the predictable and formulaic storyline of competitive groups of a certain activity. Only this time, it involves professional singing. The movie stars Anna Kendrick stars as a young freshman at her new university who enjoys remixing music on her laptop, creating new and original fresh beats. She ends up joining this all-female acapella group that always sings the same boring songs over and over in almost every competition. In order to defeat a group of all-male acapella singers, Anna Kendrick is here to make everything more hip and edgy, giving more newer and fresher songs to the beat. Now, we have our movie filled with impressive acapella singing. I'm not really the demographic for these movies, so I had plenty of doubts before watching. But, as it turns out, I surprisingly had a real fun time with this movie. There are tons of great songs that made me tap my feet and sing along to. It's an entertaining film that knows it's general audience really well. Anna Kendrick is a great actress, and is always super likable in every film she's in. She's also really likable in this film, and she shines in nearly every scene, with her great singing talent to go along with it. Although this movie still does follow the formulaic romance plot, Kendrick delivers decent chemistry with Skylar Astin, a.k.a. "the Dane Cook look-a-like", who is very likable as a guy who dreams of being a movie composer, and falls for Kendrick after showing her the final scene in "The Breakfast Club". Those references to the film alone made me smile a lot. The film can either go any direction in the comedy department, at times it can be very funny, while some jokes fall flat. But the movie does have some entertaining musical numbers to help back up the film's quick 112-minute pace. Now, "Pitch Perfect" does suffer from a few gags involving projectile vomiting that wasn't really funny, a few annoying "d-bag" characters, and sometimes it gets really obnoxious when characters would often add the word "aca-" (prefix of "acapella") to almost every sentence. Although sharing a few funny lines, Rebel Wilson, who plays a character that decides to call herself "Fat Amy", so others won't say it behind her back, is sadly given little to say or do for the majority of the film. She sadly felt wasted in the film, and I expected more screen time from her. I also still stand by my opinion that the movie still has the formulaic plot told a thousand times before, knowing each certain plot point coming a mile away. However, "Pitch Perfect" is still a very enjoyable movie with fun musical numbers, great song, a likable performance from Anna Kendrick, and a few funny moments from here and there. I still wished that some problems could have been fixed, but overall, "Pitch Perfect" was a huge surprise, and it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. "Pitch Perfect", in my review, "undeniably fun, but nothing remarkable".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if your only goal in attending college was to appease your father so he'll subsidize your true ambitions? Would you simply slack off and plan the future you really want? Or would you find a group of students anxious to have you and stick it out?During the opening scene of the film, we're introduced to the Bellas, an all-girl a capella group from the fictional Barden College who are performing at Lincoln Center. During a solo, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp) vomits on stage and turns the Bellas into a national joke. The following semester, new student Beca Mitchell (played by Anna Kendrick) meets Aubrey (Camp) and Chloe (played by Brittany Snow) who are desperate to rebound from their previous embarrassment. Becca (Kendrick), however, is only biding time in college to please her father while composing mash-ups on the laptop in her dorm room. Conversely, Fat Amy (played by Australian comedic actress Rebel Wilson) is confident in her singing ability and anxious to join the Bellas, who used to be composed solely of traditionally beautiful co-eds with vocal talent. Then, while singing in the shower, Beca's talent is discovered by her dorm-mate Chloe. While Beca is noticeably unnerved by the uninvited presence of another nude member of the student body, Chloe refuses to leave until Beca joins her in song. After discovering the fact that Becca has yet to attend a single class, her father (a professor at Barden played by John Benjamin Hickey) tells her that if she wants him to pay her way to Los Angeles she must attend her classes and join at least one student organization. Despite performing Cups at her audition, Beca's invited to join the Bellas along with Fat Amy and the nearly inaudible Lily (played by Hana Mae Lee). And so began a new season for the Bellas under the dictatorial direction the veteran performer with a nervous stomach, Aubrey.Now, I wasn't expecting much a movie intent on lampooning something whose ridiculous nature is pretty self-evident. Still, there were things about it that I liked. Beca's unfiltered contempt for college clichés and the majority of the student body inspires a lot of laughs. At the same time, the gross-out factor is in full-effect during this music- oriented comedy and I don't really care for that kind of humor. Also, Beca's rejection of Jesse (a kindhearted coworker at the campus radio station played by Skylar Astin) wear thin long before she relents. Since the problem I have with this film is essentially the same as the one I had with Bridesmaids, I'll give it the same score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got very interested in watching this movie when I found out, here on IMDb, it was shot on the LSU campus here in Baton Rouge which my movie theatre-working friend didn't know about till I told him just before the matinée. We both recognized some landmarks from that university when they showed on screen and I myself recognized some drinks from a local hangout named Zippy's (though I have yet to go there) and a sign for Kean's was also prominently featured (though that's a local chain of dry cleaners, not gas stations as in the movie). Anyway, I noticed players like Brittany Snow, Donald Faison, that woman playing Fat Amy from Bridesmaides, and John Michael Higgins with Elizabeth Smart as those funny commentators. They and the unknowns were good though the script was pretty slight concerning some plot points and I thought the vomiting of one of the main characters was a bit much. Still, I mostly enjoyed the singing of mash-ups and the using of that teen movie The Breakfast Club as another plot point. So on that note, I recommended Pitch Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly Amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore makes and attempt to step away from the small screen (e.g. Dawson's Creek, Everwood) and onto the big screen with this very predictable and mildly entertaining film. I really wanted this film to be funnier than it was. All the good parts were depicted in the trailer, so there is really not a whole lot forward to. The one scene in the trailer that did not make the cut was the car wash scene (which I thought would have been hilarious). There was some repetitiveness that made me think, "not this song again". The story centers on a singing competition of a Capella groups. The girls group contains mean girls, weird girls, crazy girls and girls of all shapes and sizes. The film is mostly about an aspiring DJ, Beca (Anna Kendrick) whose dream it is to ultimately move to Los Angeles and fulfill her dreams; however she must become more socially involved in order to do this. So she decides to give the Barden Bellas a shot. By far the standout in this film is Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). She is the reason that I wanted to see this film in the first place and she did not disappoint. Rebel was on the Ellen show earlier this week and I have to say that she is hilarious. There are some people who and act funny and then there are people who are funny; she is the latter. She first caught my eye when she played Brynn in Bridesmaid. Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Beca's roller-coaster relationship adds a little more content to the film and depicts a typical college relationship. Best friends Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) are responsible for assembling a new team for the upcoming school year. Aubrey is quickly stamped as the mean girl and has some serious issues in this film. I was surprised to see Donald Faison in this film. I was like, "hey, that's the guy from Scrubs". I do not think that Pitch Perfect was a bad film. I think that the teens out there will actually enjoy this film and can probably relate to it. Also, some of the music numbers were really good. It just didn't have enough substance for me. With all that being said, I am not sure that this film is worth the price of a ticket. I am going to give this film an amber light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance to cheer for, low-grade comedy, but musical numbers both predictable and perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pitch Perfect" is kind of like taking "Glee" and putting it into a college environment, but is more like mixing the popularity of "Bridesmaids"-styled humour and the popularity of a cappella singing. The Barden Bellas are a struggling all-girl singing group trying to succeed with female pop songs from yester-year and showing off their bikini bodies, but after an on-stage meltdown, the team is left with two high-strung seniors and is forced to rebuild.Beca (Anna Kendrick) is an aspiring DJ with no interest in campus life, but after a deal made with her father (a small but good role by John Benjamin Hickey), Beca considers joining the Bellas. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who calls herself Fat Amy so twig bitches like the Bella leaders don't call her that behind her back, is not what Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) have in mind to rebuild the group, but she can match pitch perfectly.What makes "Pitch Perfect" a good movie is the supporting characters. Fat Amy is a fully-realized character where everything she does and everything she says matches what we have come to know about her. Stacie (Alexis Knapp) and Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) have even less screen time, but are almost just as complete of characters. Amy, in particular, is hilarious and provides all of the humour in the movie.The lead characters aren't nearly as well thought-out. Aubrey is a screeching, high-maintenance control freak, one-dimensionally so, and her few moments of humour are very low quality and very poorly realized (her aforementioned on-stage meltdown is almost laughably bad it's so poorly edited). Chloe, unfortunately, has a very simplistic role as Aubrey's only sidekick who also shares Beca's vision. Snow is a better actress than that.As the Bellas are trying to find their groove as the competition regionals and finals approach, Beca has met a boy who belongs to their all-male rivals. Jesse (Skylar Astin) is cute and extremely likable (an actually very impressive feat considering he got in over his quirky but cute roommate). Jesse aspires to create movie scores (yet another excellent character trait), and through his friendship with Beca, hopes to introduce her to some of the classics. All movies, as Beca complains, are predictable. You know that the boy is going to get the girl and you know what is going to happen before it happens. Jesse says that doesn't matter because the perfect music can still move you to tears. His prime example is "The Breakfast Club".Of course "Pitch Perfect" was predictable, and while that might drag during some of their early competition performances, the predictability works for the type of movie it is. Sometimes the comedic dialogue went too far for a joke, other times the humour was just a cheap gag, but overall it was still funny. With better, more original comedy it could have been a very good movie. Beca and Jesse made a great on-screen couple and had the audience cheering them on. In fact, "Pitch Perfect" works very well as a romantic comedy with a non-romantic primary storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess IMDb is not what it used to be! Probably because of young "critics" who obviously have no clue what movie is! First, let me be honest by saying that there are some cute girls in this movie and some good singing, but Jesus! To give it above 7 is just ridiculous! Law abiding citizen has 7.3 and this nonsense has same rating like that masterpiece!? We lost all common sense I guess! I do hope, however, that at least someone who rated this movie will ask them self "what is the story about?" and than you'll see that there is no story! Simple as that! Just bunch of kids doing nothing. Also, and I'm not saying this just because I'm from Europe, but if this movie shows American youth...you really really need to change something in your society! This is complete and utter BS! This movie rating is living proof how things are not as they should be! Just some tits and legs are enough to call something great!?!? What happened to high quality storyline, hard and complicated dialogs and stuff like that!?I do understand that sometimes we need nobrainers but this is no- nothing! Some singing (which is not bad), some tits and legs! But hardly 6...and no way above 7!</fullReview>

And that is what this movie did to me in mins I watched it. I love musicals like Sweeney Todd, Mamma Mia but this one is just the nightmarish type, I feel so bad i just don't know if it was the stupidest movie mins I ever watched.People who want to see good acting roles, some standard emotions, some class, are advised to stay away from this awful creation. What are those junkies doing the characters in the movie are total junkies I don't get it, it is such a nonsense, such a waste of time and money, such a bad feeling, pitch perfect is the dumbest movie I ever seen in my life and this day is my sad day that my wasted mins are adding up due to fact I am forced to review this title. Sensible people should stay away from this movie, that is my suggestion, if you got no taste go ahead and watch it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About a few months ago, a friend of mine introduced this to me. I kinda thought it was a movie about drama, but I watched it to find out. It was hilarious, the quotes the characters say and their actions. It was an excellent movie for me, and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it wasn't the best. I would have gave it a 10 if it wasn't for the ending (hint: post-performance), but it's a 9. It was still a funny movie that is full of entertainment. Also watched it with a few friends that have not heard of this. Highly recommended for comedy lovers and fans of A Capella. Loved this film, and for some reason I cannot stop watching it. I also loved the music and the voices of the Bellas and the Treblemakers. I watched it about eleven times. Love it.</fullReview>

I thought lets have a look what kind of a grade IMDb gives this shitty movie and when i saw the 7.5 which is completely idiotic i thought lets give it a fair grade.. however it seems you can't go lower than a 1.0. Probably teen chicks who give this movie a high rating because the movie blew chunks..letterly and figurly. The end "song" was absolutely awful. Breakfast club theme? There is no way in hell to mix that into a cool mix. It was just a painful try to make an over the top comedy version of Glee. It's a f-ing joke that this crappy movie has the same rating as comedies like 'The hangover'. Still trying to figure out which movie sucked more any Twilight movie or this. It has to be a draw.</fullReview>

To start of, this is an awesome movie, anybody would like it. It's utterly hilarious, I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. If you're a person who's musically involved in any kind of way, you'll like it THAT much more. Great movie, automatically one of my favorites! The acting was superb. Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy stole the show, but the others, such as Anna Kendrick playing Beca and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Tommy were extremely good. I'm not sure if the actors themselves actually did the singing, but if so, they are all extremely talented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch Perfect was genuinely funny and didn't take itself too seriously. The musical arrangements were actually pretty decent though and the comedic elements were not traditional at all making them even more humorous. The only things that hold hack the film, in my opinion, are the generic plot and Anna Kendrick's lack of any charisma whatsoever. The plot is the exact same as almost every single other music, dance, etc. movie made in the last decade: Protagonist joins team/club/group that is struggling, they go through bumps along the way, protagonist either quits or comes close to quitting, protagonist gives it one last go and helps the team/club/group achieve their ultimate goal all while experiencing relationship issues throughout. As for Anna Kendrick, I think this movie showed that, while she's talented, she's not capable of being the focus of any movie. Characters like Fat Amy distract the audience from Kendrick's utter lack of charisma or charm. Honestly, her character is one of the least interesting characters in the entire film. Regardless, this movie is still worth watching because of the humor alone and the musical arrangements are a nice bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitch PerfectOne of the easiest jobs has to be roadying for an a cappella group.Unfortunately the instrument-free group in this comedy only has openings for singers.After a disastrous performance at last year's A Cappella championship, The Bellas are looking for new vocals.Co-founder Chloe's (Brittany Snow) first prospect is aspiring DJ Beca (Anna Kendrick), a freshman with a fresh perspective on music.Also recruited to the underdog squad is high pitch hitter Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson).However, the group's other co-founder (Anna Camp) would rather stick to their 1990s repertoire than allow Beca's 1980s mash-ups to be performed.Despite its numerous missteps into vulgar humour, and its inauthentic attempt at being fashionable, Pitch Perfect does contain more than one comical moment and performance worthy of note. Regrettably, one of the major drawbacks of an all-girl a cappella group is that they have a tendency to sound like harmonized nagging. (Yellow Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Insert "Aca" pun here*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Pitch Perfect expecting a very different film. After seeing so many lame, easy-going, fluffy tween pictures that do little to drum up anything but the awareness of the clichés they are heavily relying on, this film is a breath of clean, lively, and somewhat subversive fresh air as it shows a group of collegians in their school's a capella program trying to make it to a prestigious competition and hopefully change the face of the entire a capella world. It's also pretty apparent here that a capella beats all extra circular activities at this college, including football. And even academics.I approached Pitch Perfect with the same hesitation I did Mean Girls, which I went on to dub one of the smartest, most relatable teen movies of the last decade. I feared that Pitch Perfect would become obsessed with the idea of cheekiness, rapidly descending into the bowels of self parody, with jokes that screamed childish and characters that defined caricature. The film is rather cheeky and self-aware, but it presents itself in a light-hearted way, completely knowing its origins, and while respecting them, simultaneously not taking them too seriously, creating warmth and vibrant atmosphere for the film's entire runtime. It understands the inanity of its idea, yet can still conduct itself seriously when needed and jokingly when applicable.The story concerns the fine arts-driven school Barden University, where incoming freshman Beca (the lovely Anna Kendrick) enters with something a little less than a hungry, open mind. Her tuition is free, thanks to her professor father, but she envisions herself in Los Angeles, enjoying the warm sun and pursuing a niche career in music producing. Her father fears that her field is too specific and it's more of a hobby than a formal career (don't get me started on my aspirations, which I'm learning fall along the same lines). Yet we know she's serious; just look at all the hip beats and uniquely composed instrumentals on her laptop, one of which replicating and sampling the fantastic ballad "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by The Proclaimers.After seeing her miserable and uninspired after a month of school, Beca's father strikes an abrupt and unusual deal with her; if she can find a club and show genuine passion for it, she can go to Los Angeles and he will help her with her dream of being a producer. She decides to join the Barton Bellas, an a capella team at the college, that made headlines (or blurbs, depending on how seriously a newspaper handles a capella news) after an embarrassing incident at the International Championship of Collegiate A Capella. The Bellas are looking to rebound their reputation of being a joke, and hire Beca as a new member despite her notably quirky, "alternative" personality.The leader of the Bellas, a dictating woman named Aubrey (Anna Camp), keeps the group on a very tight schedule that is anything but mailable. She prohibits talking to or "penetrating" members of "The Treblemakers," currently the number one a capella group at Bardon University. Unfortunately, Beca has become somewhat entangled with Jesse (Skylar Astin), a charming movie-geek who has fun bringing energy and joy to the students of Bardon. Jesse also takes pride in introducing Beca to the limitless wonders of film scores, telling her that John Hughes' The Breakfast Club has one of the best movie endings of all time. I couldn't agree more. And on a final note, all the a capella tournaments are announced by Elizabeth Banks (who too serves as one of the several producers on this film) and John Michael Higgins, who assume a witty and often charming "Statler and Waldorf"-like personality during the competitions and clearly have fun reciting the material, which comes off as practically improvised. For all I know, it was.One of the many charmingly realistic things about Pitch Perfect is it steers clear of the typical teen romance trap, and collectively subverts them by staying focused on the misfit Bellas and the competition at hand, rather than the relationships they may go on to form. Consistent readers know how I tire from the incredibly senseless humor that, thanks to attention span-shortening shows like iCarly and Victorious (and if we're talking film, the pathetic Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise), has now become increasingly common. This was a more mature film than I expected to see, with a stable commentary on the quirks of life and the beauty of being different. Even the film stays away from lackluster character stereotypes, making The Treblemakers pompous and self-consumed, yet truly showing that they have talent and possess serious singing skills.During more than one of the numbers, I questioned how, um, authentic some of this singing was. Sometimes, we can tell that the beautiful Anna Kendrick (who spent much of her teenage years on Broadway) is singing songs like David Guetta's "Titanium" and see that The Treblemakers are perfectly recreating a beat-less version of Flo Rida's "Right Round," but at other times we can see that some of the sounds are rather unnatural. Let me just say that the vocals occasionally sound widely overproduced and some of the musical sounds mirror those of synthesizers.Yet this isn't enough of a problem to distract the viewer greatly. Director Jason Moore makes smart decisions about keeping the direction fast-paced, and screenwriter Kay Cannon is aware of the female adolescent culture and can near perfectly replicate it. Not every decision is a surefire hit, seeing as there are far too many jokes about projectile vomit (two instances of it) and one random and unnecessary scene that takes place shortly after the second instance. Regardless, it can be noted that Pitch Perfect is one of the most impressive and complete tween efforts of the year, showing little immaturity, but a grand amount of understanding of the increasingly complex teenage demographic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect is a sweet and colourful musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anna Kendrick once again shows she can light up any part on screen and this time she is front an centre singing but also providing some comedy in this sweet tale of an all singing a Capella girl group" Singing in modern times has seemed to be brought back to life by FOX's Glee, that has helped making this story come to the screen. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is your normal college girl who is roped into joining an all singing girl group which includes characters such as "Fat" Amy (Rebel Wilson), Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp). The group for only including girls of course will lead to cat fights and makeups especially when trying to make this girl group more appealing to win New York singing competition.The film could mainly be compared to the teenage classic Bring It On but the two separate movies do have a lot of differences. Firstly is that unlike Bring It On being about cheer leading Pitch is about a Capella singing and how people can become popular by singing these type of songs. Secondly this film with some cartoonish one note characters does have some heart by setting up the main relationships between the characters but also how the music is used so well and also sung so well. Going into the film I was worried that the concept of this type of singing would be boring but I was really enjoying most of it mainly because these women have very good singing voices.Anna Kendrick plays Beca showing once again the screen loves her because she does a very good job at a character that has been done so many times but she just supplies Beca with her usual comedic timing but also making us care about her character especially when everyone does not listen to what she has to say. Rebel Wilson has been doing so many small roles for some time now and with this role she finally gets to give us a character that could break her out more into the public. She is so funny and nails all her one liners almost stealing the film from everyone involved. Everybody else in the cast plays their roles well with some mentions going to Anna Camp, Skylar Astin and Brittany Snow.The film does suffer from some normal story lines of a girl falling in love with a guy and when we first meet Beca she does not come off as that type of girl but like most romantic comedy's the main girl must fall in love with a boy. The singing is strong throughout providing moments that make you smile but also that make you laugh at how ridiculous the staging is. Overall the film is strong but some moments just did not work for me just brings down it's score for me.MOVIE GRADE: B (MVP: Anna Kendrick)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shows yet again that anything and everything can be a competition. I have never even thought about a capella singing as a competition, but once I saw the trailer for Pitch Perfect I was immediately interested because of the No Diggity cover. This film just seemed like Bring It On with no cheerleaders, the whole tryout, outlandish rules and the build to the Super Bowl of a capella. The story centers around the freshman year of college for Beca (Anna Kendrick), who is less than thrilled to be on campus. Primarily due to the fact that her Dad is on staff, so we have a sub story of daddy issues, which brought a bit of drama into this comedy. I will say that Ms. Kendrick is a bit of a chameleon, to play a student after playing a business woman in Up In The Air and she can sing. I actually Googled to see if she was lip syncing, she sings. The Treble Makers cover of the Dazz Band's Whip It, was the worse version of the song imaginable. But the Treble Makers were very good at what they did, singing. The film had some really good a capella singing and since the majority of the story was in competition or preparing for competition there was inevitably judging. The banter between the judges Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) was too funny mostly because of the clear disdain for each other. There were several players in this film that stood out for various reasons. Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) looked too old to be college students even if they were seniors. Fat Patricia (Rebel Wilson) just kept the funny coming. I didn't realize in what film I had previously seen Ms. Wilson until almost the end of the film that she was in Bridesmaids. I'm sure she will do great things after this, she's very funny and more than anything she seems very comfortable in her own skin. I liked the fact that they didn't do the whole Stomp The Yard final competition and make it a tie, but clearly the story ended with more to tell. I wanted more substance and less regurgitation. After I waited for my No Diggity and it was done, I just didn't have a whole lot to look forward to. This was a fun film, it wasn't bad, so I give it an amber light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect(2012) Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 1/2* Out Of ****.Rated PG-13 For Sexual Material, Language And Drug References.1hr 52min/112min.Pitch Perfect is a great contender for the most overrated film of 2012. This film is astonishingly bad. I went into the film with an open mind and had actually heard really good things. What I eventually thought of the film after watching it was that not only was it overrated but it was jawdroppingly bad. The film has absolutely bad jokes, horribly written dialogue, no memorable performances and surprising to vulgar for a PG-13 rating. The film was of course slapped with a PG-13 rating so that way 12 year old girls can watch 500 times and annoy everybody with renditions of The Cup Song Anna Kendrick does in the film. Let me take you through all of the problems I had with the film and why I think it's overrated.The film follows Becca(Anna Kendrick) who wants to go to L.A. to be a full blown record producer. Instead she joins an accapella group called The Barden Bellas who, four months ago, had a tragic mishap in which the lead singer vomited all over the stage. Among the group is Fat Amy(Rebel Wilson) Chloe(Britney Snow) and much more. They go up against an all male acapella group called The Treblemakers led by Nicholas(Adam DeVine) in a tough competition to see who is the best acapella group on the campus.First, there are two things that save the film from a Zero Star rating. They are Adam DeVine and Rebel Wilson. They have the smartest and best and funniest written dialouge in the film. DeVine is best known for his performance on the extremely funny Comedy Central TV show Workaholics and transfers to this film quite well. Rebel Wilson is sweet and funny but I feel like she is just the predictable comedic relief with the typical fat person jokes but she does it well. That's about all I liked of the movie. But they are not in the film enough to warrant a 1 star rating. Half of one star is all this movie is getting. Also the acapella singing of the Universal Pictures logo was a nice touch.First off, this movie has a fascination with vomit. It's gross and also wants to make me vomit. The dialouge is poorly written filled with some of the worst puns I have ever heard. "Aca-scuse me?" "We are gonna be Aca-Awesome!" ENOUGH! If I hear one more "Aca" pun I'm gonna shoot myself in the foot! Anna Kendrick performance is surprisingly boring and is the least interesting character which surprises me since her performance, albeit a small one, was fantastic in End Of Watch. Here, it looks like she could care less. The MPAA should be closely evaluated. I think this film should been given an R Rating. They give Bully, a really good film an R for language(Later re-rated to PG-13) but this film has drug references and sexual references galore to warrant an R but Because 11-12 year girls want to watch BOOM, PG-13. The joke are really bad. The only one I laughed at besides the ones said by Wilson and DeVine is the Rape whistle joke. This movie should be banished to depths of Cinematic Hell. Before I go I just want to say that shame on you the people that told me that this movie was good and funny. This is a great case of over-hyped cinema. Talenteed actors like DeVine, Wilson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are wasted in this pile of Garbage. To quote the Schmoes of Schmoes Know, this movie STOINKED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Pitch Perfect: Laugh All Night Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See Pitch Perfect! Laugh All Night LongSeeing Pitch Perfect is a witty smart, fun aspiring movie with modern music and eccentric club mash-ups of popular hit songs mixed even with some 80s movies classics. Some of the songs may relate to an emotion stirring around with the characters involving Beca and Jesse. One of the reasons to come this comedy, witty, fun, lively movie is for the acting done by a gifted cast. Light musicality and romance. Not to mention, the brains to put it all together to make it the best Friday night out movie of the year.Beca is stared by Anna Kendrick; our protagonist an inspired young woman wanting to become the next power-housed D.J. In L.A struggles, due to her father, a professor at the school she attends. It is clear to her father that she has no particular interest her father makes a deal, to make the best memories possible and then see if she still wants to leave. In the time given Beca has a bizarre run in to audition for a Capella. With her help an inspirational arrange songs Beca makes; it helps the Bella's make a come back in the national a Capella competition betting their rivals the Trebles. Jesse played by Skylar Astin , another freshmen to the college and to a Cappella, is lucky enough to get on the undefeated team of the Trebles, sworn enemies of the Bella's. on the first day he meets Beca and chemistry is sparked in between them. Rebel Wilson plays probably everyone's favorite character "Fat Amy" a girl who does not care but will live life to the fullest in her own funny ways with her amazing vocal skills. The list for this cast is incredible and you should see the movie to truly appreciate all of the work into making this movie.Laughs are at every corner of the film. As the Bella's and Trebles try to defeat each other in the "Riff Off" and the signing round to the finials. Also not to be confused with this movie being a musical; there isn't any random singing and dance number. Some of the songs may relate to an emotion stirring around with the characters involving Beca and Jesse. Due to the humiliation that the Bella's had gotten the year previous, only made the burning fire of hatred to the Trebles worse. In addition, to the confused feeling that Beca and Jesse have, Beca has a difficult time to let him in when he is trying his best to just be there for her when things go a little bit hay wired.Even though this movie is was rated PG-13 it is definitely on the brink of being rated R. With some of the characters attitudes and actions. Moreover, with the inappropriate scenes such as how Beca was asked, forced to audition. In every other scene to retaliate to Anna Camp's character Aubrey a bossy, controlling, cyclic person, Beca or Fat Amy has something. However most comeback are sent to the Trebles' leader Bumper. The director Jason Moore and producers Paul Brooks, Max Handelman, and Elizabeth Banks are brilliant people who help make the best Friday night movie of the year.To conclude why Pitch Perfect is a knock-out movie and why you should see this movie is because it is better than Glee and Bring it combined. Due to the fact that it has all the good parts, without the cheesy factors that the general public wish they would leave out. The next weekend when you don't have something to do, wouldn't you rather enjoy your night with a group of friends laughing of bored out of your mind trying to figure out what to do? Its like running veridically, wouldn't you rather " horizontal run?" (-Fat Amy)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The actresses are talented for sure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing this movie about college level a capella singing competition demonstrates is that the actresses involved are multi talented from the control freak played by Anna Camp to the lovely Brittany Snow and of course Anna Kendrick. They can sing dance whatever. But Anna Kendrick as a the lead wasn't quite right. She is better in a supporting role. Anna Kendrick's face can't express different types of emotion, eg anger sadness happiness - it's all the same showing a bit of teeth like a beaver. The girls are the stars here. The leading boys are rather dorky and forgettable. Breakout comedic star Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy provides comic relief.The writing isn't that good some scenes could have been funnier. But at least it isn't as hyper and freakish as Glee. Some rather surprising negative stereotypes shown but overall it's quite a feel good pleasant movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazingly funny! This is a movie I could see over and over. I watched the trailer and I was nervous that all of the funny parts would be in the trailer and the rest of the movie would be dull, but that is not the case at all. Some of the best parts of the movie are not even in the trailers at all. If you are worried about the movie being a corny chick-flick, don't worry, it is very funny. After watching the movie, I also downloaded the soundtrack. It is full of amazing music and all of these people can sing really, really well. It was refreshing to see people to have incredible voices and are not just putting on a light and laser ruckus show. Very talented. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful look at college days with singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beca (Kendrick), an entering freshman at fictional "Barden College," aspires to be a DJ in L.A. But her father, a professor at Barden, insists she attend college at least a year plus join some activity group. Last year, Barden's male 'a cappella' singing group, the "Treblemakers," won 1st place in national collegiate competition. Barden's female group, the "Bellas," had 'ill fortune' and, trying hard to do better this next year, is actively recruiting new members. Beca joins it. At "Barden College" these 'a cappella' singing groups seem to serve some of the same roles that Greek fraternities &amp; sororities or membership on college football/ basketball teams do in most colleges: group socializing, achieving, winning school honors by competing for victory with other colleges. Beca's reluctant to join and, once committed, is reluctant to trust or be close to anyone, e.g., a boy (Astin) in the "Treblemakers" who's interested in her. "Pitch Perfect" with its sexual jokes (and projectile vomiting that rivals a fire hydrant: make "snow angels" in the vomit on the floor, anyone?) is funny throughout, especially so to the 18-30 year age group with college experiences and, among those, probably more so to its females. My girlfriend &amp; I saw this in a college town where audience laughter drowned out our hearing many lines. The music with lively choreography was great; wish there was more. (Many say that Rebel Wilson as "Fat Amy" wins the acting credits.) Its view of contemporary college humor was fascinating to this grad from decades ago plus I loved the music. (FWIW: IMDb's gender X age ratings are also fascinating.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly as I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't see too many differences than Glee.IT SUCKED. I laughed for like a second and that's it.As a singer myself I can say that the singing was hardly professional. First of all, Fat Amy doesn't know to sing, she just knows how to make the audience laugh. The only one who was somehow close to giving me goose bumps (but still didn't) was Becca.Simply another foolish teen movie mixed with a few familiar actresses, trying hard to stand out in their low vocal capabilities, in order to show they have other "skills" beside acting. My advice: just stay with the acting, sweeties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly excellent performance by Rebel Wilson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*The Quickie* 8/10 ? Definitely a must watch. Catch it this weekend people!*Pros* Great performances Excellent performance by Rebel Wilson*Cons* Average story Bland characters*Pitch Perfect* The trailer for this movie, while interesting at first, got me really jaded recently because it kept being played everywhere. Also, while the jokes in the trailer were funny, there wasn't really much to it. Pitch Perfect looked like your typical dance movie, except with A Cappella singing.I am very happy to say that Pitch Perfect is a fantastic movie and I had an incredibly enjoyable time watching it.*Synopsis* Beca (ANNA KENDRICK) is a freshman in college and is one of the new recruits of the A Cappella group known as the Barden Bellas. The Bellas are led by senior Aubrey (ANNA CAMP) who is looking to prove herself after choking during the previous year's competition finals thereby costing the Bellas the competition.However, Beca soon realises that Aubrey's insistence on sticking to old and tired routines is proving detrimental to the group. With their rival group, The Treblemakers, being as good as they are, the Bellas have to come together to come up with a new routine that is good enough to win them the national A Cappella championships.*Review* To be honest, I really wanted to hate this movie. I've never been a huge fan of dance movies and this In all fairness, the story isn't anything original. It's the same cookie-cutter story about how a newcomer to an underdog team inspires the team to come together and they eventually go on to beat the odds and win the championship (and no, I'm not spoiling anything). It's not a literary masterpiece but it works and is actually really competently written.The actual singing and performances I thought were really good. Sure, there were some songs that were just alright but for the most part, the scenes with the characters singing A Cappella were goosebump-inducingly enjoyable and I loved every second of it. There is some dance choreography in here as well but it isn't all that great and takes a backseat to the singing.I think special mention has to be given to the character of Fat Amy (REBEL Wilson). This one character was what made this movie as good as it is. A lot of the jokes in this movie were written around this character and the jokes themselves are hilariously crafted. Rebel Wilson absolutely killed this performance. Her deadpan delivery of already well-written jokes was such a delight to watch. It's been a really long time since a movie made me laugh that hard.However, I have to say that the other characters weren't all that interesting. The main protagonist, Beca, is likable enough but there isn't anything very interesting about her character to make her stand out from any other protagonist in this type of movies. The same can be said for her love interest, Jess (SKYLAR ASTIN).In addition, while a lot of time is spent on Beca and Jesse, and to some extent Aubrey, the other characters have almost no character development. You never get any idea who these people really are other than what archetype they're supposed to be. For example, you get the girl who is extremely promiscuous, a very masculine lesbian, a soft- spoken Asian, etc. I guess it's good that they're different enough from each other so I could at least tell them apart that way. Other than that, nothing else is made known about these characters.*Rating* I really enjoyed this movie and thoroughly enjoyed sitting through this. The performances were entertaining and the jokes were awesome. While there are certain flaws to this movie, that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a fantastic movie and deserves to be watched.I rate this movie a high 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, To the Point, and did I mention AMAZING!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie and I got exactly what I wanted from it. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen and it had a very predictable plot. However, as stated in the heading, this movie is amazing.What makes this movie work so well is the perfect cast, great acapella music, and of course the incredible Fat Amy. Also this movie is very to the point. What I mean by that is there are no scenes that aren't vital to the plot of the movie. The movie could not have been a minute shorter without some serious plot holes. That was the only surprising part of the movie was how fast it progressed. It was very clever of the writers to do it that way because of the predictable "underdog rising to the top" type of film it is that everyone has seen before.This movie will keep you laughing, thoroughly entertained and if you are like me, you will be very anxious to see what the Bellas end up putting together at the end.Back to Fat Amy for a minute, what can I say, she's hilarious. I see Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) as a female Chris Farley for this generation. I predict she will become a huge star in the years to come and everyone will know her name.I recommend this to anyone for a good movie experience. If you are a Glee fan, or a music fanatic, you will especially love this movie as much as I did.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Goes For The Covers. Only The Covers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another typical high school (err, real life) musical comedy which misses the comedy part.Yes, the music covers were awesome but there's nothing new for you to grasp from this piece. Yes, the actors have acted well, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to watch this. If you skip it, then you are only going to lose a couple of slapstick, vanity &amp; jealousy strings which are sporadic in this clichéd, hyped and over-rated piece of gimmick!Bottom line is you watch it if your girlfriend is in the church choir or college Capella! Duh!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: Yes Nudity: Very Slight Violence: No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing movie to sit through if your a guy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a awful movie but it's not a good one either. Movies where a group of students that come together to beat another team in a competition has been done before. And there are so many cliché parts in this...Just watch "Drumline" it's a way better movie. There are bunch of characters in this movie but a lot of them is not developed enough at all. This time around a group of students are competing in a acapella tournament. I guess this movie is for girls that are into mainstream music cause a lot of them was cracking up and laughing throughout this movie. Despite it having very corny humor that is hardly ever clever. Most of it is toilet and sexual remarks humor that isn't clever or witty. The main girl in this is Becca played by Anna Kendrick who I am not a fan of although some critics and audiences seem to really like her. She basically reminds me of a female version of Adam Scott. And like a lot of movies of this sort she is like the only normal character in this entire movie and she is surrounded by weird or awkward characters. And it depends way too much on how weird and awkward the other characters are to get in some laughs. Sometimes it can be effective but not in this case although a lot of the female audiences which made up most of the audience members was actually laughing. Nothing about this movie felt like your watch real college students at all cause the mannerism and dialogue just seemed so fake, it almost seems like a Disney drama show with more toilet and sexual humor. Also everything about this movie is predictable from start to finish and it doesn't really try to do anything different. It isn't a uber awful movie but it's far from being a good movie. Skylar Astin as the male lead in this is a very likable character though.4/10</fullReview>
