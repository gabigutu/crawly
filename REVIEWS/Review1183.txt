		<fullReview>Face it folks, the Jonas brothers are atrocious. For anyone comparing them to LEGENDARY bands, you're forgetting a few things.1. Legendary bands possess musical talent (i.e. they write their own music, have good voices, are skilled with instruments, etc)2. Produce honest to god good music, are innovative, beautifully arrange their music, etc.3. Are NOT whores of the Disney media machine. There's a reason they're plastered all over the Disney channel; it's because Disney is brainwashing their target audience (pre-pubescent girls) into thinking the music they make is good. IT ISN'T. It's rubbish...it's absolute rubbish. It actually manages to be more horrid than the trash boy-bands of the 90's put out. It flat out reeks of failure.I'm a movie reviewer for my college newspaper, and to be perfectly honest, the movie was the worst piece of poorly scripted, overly cliché crap I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. Aside from the concert (which wasn't "incredible" chiefly because of their awful stage presence and even worse music) EVERY LINE was hand fed to these idiots. It's as if they were not capable of any conversation past the remedial level. In addition to that, the theatre was LOADED with girls who SCREAMED every time they came on the screen, it felt like there were over 9000 of them in there! God almighty...get over yourselves. Screaming at a screen isn't going to get you anywhere with and Jonas FailuresWant to see a real documented concert experience for a great band? Pop in Depeche Mode 101; an epic band who pushed the bounds of music in the 80's, and even today, and it's documented by one of the best, D.A. Pennybaker. Or, if that's music isn't your thing, listen to: Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, U2, NIN, basically, anything that has the 3 criteria listed above. Not this spoon fed drivel passed along as "music" (which it isn't, it really, truly is awful)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Walt Disney Pictures doing this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In honest truth, whether this was for getting paychecks or just putting on a pretty outfit for the girls to see, Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience was a film that should of never made it past movie critics. This is proof that the music industry is failing on the surface and is desperate to put any no-talent jockey on the music scene.Look, I'm not all for critics or casual onlookers, but there was no need to green light this crap. The Jonas Brothers can prove to us that we can make it big by putting on a pretty face, and getting your popularity based on your image. The sad truth is that they didn't have to work that hard to make it to the top, so they steal elements based on other music artists and they try to regurgitate them into something new. They do so with flying colors, that is, with failure. Their music sounds so horrible I can make better sounds on my computer. That's really not saying much. Their poor guitar play, horrible singing, and a stale drummer add up to the realization that they possess no talent. Certainly nothing that would make a music critic go crazy about.A sign of decline in this day and age is there are people dumb enough to compare the Jonas Brothers to great bands and artists of the past. Don't even try to compare them with Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Ramones, AC/DC, Aerosmith or the other great music artists who helped make a difference in the music scene. They set the stage for what was to come and were music artists that were actually liked for their musical influence and talent. The Jonas Brothers, on the other hand, seem more fit to be a quick fad that will fade out by the year's end.The worst, and perhaps the most shocking aspect of the movie is Disney's involvement with the Jonas Brothers. Just seeing the Disney logo slapped on the front is enough to make any classic Disney fan cry in terror. Who is running this show? Why should Disney be involved in any of this? What is the purpose of putting on a terrible concert show in theaters? This is simply a message that Disney does not care anymore. Back in the day, Disney was something that every child and parent looked forward to. From Snow White to the Lion King, Disney entertained audiences for generations and set the bar for creating animated masterpieces and original shows. Walt Disney was a highly respectable man and was simply ahead of his time. Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience has none of the magic or innovation of the old Disney. It is simply a title of greed and misconception.The Jonas Brothers need to leave our general conscious. If any idiot would stump so low to actually waste a hard day's paycheck to see this flying piece of crap, then that person should seek a mental hospital. The Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience is nothing redeeming, nothing new, nothing special, and nothing exciting. I'm very upset that Disney was involved in any of it, and the fact that idiots out there don't realize how bad this is, makes me very frustrated. People out there need to seek talent that is higher than the average person. All this is is a publicity stunt that can show us that any moron can go crazy over a band that was stale from the beginning.This is why much of mainstream entertainment is failing to put out something of influence. Instead, they are promoting crap like Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience in order to have the mind-controlled sheep buy more fluff. The people behind the box office should be ashamed of this title. Don't believe the hype, just ignore the title and hope that the Jonas Brothers won't come back for a sequel. Critics should know what passes for a movie, and this doesn't qualify.A title that holds nothing to the Disney name.One out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How Can People Listen to this stuff. It is just plain torture. These people are not a band they just want attention and money. They have no respect for the art of music. These idiots do not compare with any good rock band of the past. AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Metallica...Those are real bands not this manufactured garbage. It is just terrible that music has sunken this low. And the fact that this useless movie exist is just a disgrace. Disney REALLY needs to start trying before they lose all their credibility. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE OR LISTEN TO THIS BAND IF YOU DO YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION BRING GOOD MUSIC BACK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear god, this is a disgrace. I'm baffled as to why anyone would like to see this. They are untalented, fugly boys who STILL haven't hit puberty, even though I'm pretty sure they are at least 15. If you want to see a movie that has talented actors, a good script, as well as excellent musical performances, why not see "U2 3D", or the best ever, "A Hard Day's Night", by the Beatles. They showcase excellence bands that can actually play music. I am convinced that the Jonas Brothers are sent here from Hell by Satan himself. I miss the days where musicians played music, not manufactured Disney crap that is meant only to sell sell sell.btw- love that the movie is exactly where it belongs, it is officially the WORST movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hurts less with the glasses off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hot on the huge red heels of Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, another joylessly choreographed gig from Disney's stable of pop stars; so squeaky-clean they probably leave their internal organs soaking in buckets of Persil overnight. Nick, Kevin and Joe are the kind of all-American, all-processed poppets comedian Bill Hicks would have torn into like a school of piranha were he still alive. That job fell to Russell Brand, who mocked their no-sex-before-marriage 'Purity Rings' at 2008's MTV Video Music Awards. Yet instead of being forced to apologise, Brand should have been paid off by Disney for raising the band's profile.For squillions of kids, however, the Little Christians That Could are already Olympus-sized. This becomes immediately apparent the moment we and our 3D glasses float, as if borne on angels' backs, into New York City's Madison Square Garden arena. Here, 20,000 screaming tweens waggle their glowsticks like unsullied pregnancy testers at the preening boy-men who emerge to bombastic strings and spurting sheets of flame. It's like Triumph Of The Will for under-12s. And everywhere you look, hydraulics. Hydraulic platforms to elevate the Brothers to the vertiginous level of ascetic monks, literally looking down on their fans; hydraulics to pucker their cyborg lips, offering the promise of a chaste, metallic-tasting kiss.At various junctures, songs occur; as substantial as farts in a wind tunnel. At one point a baby gazelle with perfect hair called Demi nearly blows them off stage with her superior number, before being chased away again. Jonas songs are accompanied by a fey, second-hand gesture from lead vocalist Joe, in which he clenches his thighs together and raises one knee, as if frantic for a pee. Stage-moves as old as pop, courting reactions older than pop, from hormonal girls expertly shaken up like soda bottles, until diverted at the pass to explode their passions into waiting cash registers.It is breathtaking in its contrivances and blatant in its borrowings. With an opening scene of three young men being chased by a swollen mob of rabid girls to a waiting helicopter, this mindlessly apes the beginning and closing moments of A Hard Day's Night. Director Richard Lester might have cherry picked from the greats - everything from Mack Sennett-style tomfoolery to stylized shots swiped from Fellini - but he did at least end up with something fresh and funny and new. This doesn't possess one-tenth of that film's warmth, naturalism or feral thrill. In his opener, Lester had expertly caught a sense of the Beatles as prisoners of their success; it's clear those girls meant business, that if they were to catch up with the lads they would have literally ripped them apart like latter day Bacchae. This lot look like they'd just text their prey to death.Where there are stars, there are satellites. Here are three jokers in wigs and waistcoats posing with the multitudes outside the concert hall, engaged in what the Americans call "goofing around." These are the 'imitation' Jonas Brothers, buzzards pecking at the crumbs of celebrity. Robe-stroking lepers. If "the Jonas Brothers are living the dream, we're dreaming the life" they say. Trouble is, they actually appear to have more charisma than the real things who, on this admittedly scant evidence, lack strong, or even vaguely likable personalities of their own.This personality vacuum is a real problem in a film that purports to depict a day in the life of young pop stars audiences can actually relate to. Straitjacketed into their roles (back-flipping; power-sliding; looking cute), and unable or unwilling to offer any organic or even semi-improvised conversation, the Jonas trio are obliged to traipse through shamelessly staged scenes of purported verite, such as belatedly catching the cameras 'accidentally' filming them taking their tops off backstage. Bad camera! This occasionally backfires, as in an early sequence where the breakfasting Brothers arrogantly shoo away their Trump Hotel waitress, who happens to be hovering in shot, either star-struck or, more likely, patiently waiting for another order. It wrong-foots, as do the 3D effects, which mainly consist of Joe hurling guitar picks or his sunglasses straight at us. How would you like to have a pair of sunglasses flung in your face? Watching this feels like working for Naomi Campbell.At time of writing, this has achieved 1.3 out of 10 on the IMDb, the site's lowest ever score - for a documentary at least (it doesn't count this as a feature film). Yet this intensely polarizing movie has clearly been subject to some tactical voting, given the overwhelming majority of glowing, hysterical reviews. Meanwhile, the site suggests that "If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends Gimme Shelter". A slightly reckless juxtaposition, given that the film, which documents the Rolling Stones' tragic 1969 Altamont Free Concert, culminates in the on-screen murder of an audience member by the Hells Angels. The only thing being murdered in Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience is music.Well, alright. It's fairly safe to assume this reviewer is not the intended demographic for this movie. And couldn't be any less suited were they also blind in one eye, and thus unable to get anything out of the 3D experience. Not to belabor the point, but in the Jonas Brothers management boardroom there's a flip chart sporting this reviewer's photo and the word 'No' underlined three times in thick black marker pen. This will probably more than satisfy the audience it's aimed at. But for the rest of us, a tour called 'Burning Up' suggests only one thing. We are in Hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Jonas Bros was in the movie "Rock Camp" or something like this (by accident). I admit this was the lethal and final hit!!!!! Now I know why young people do drugs.I know I am rough on this but please DO NOT TORTURE PEOPLE LIKE THIS.I did also grew up listening the good and the bad music of my time (80's - 90's) but man, this must be stopped. It is beyond everyone can imagine.Thank you for assuring that people can always go lower and you are helping more to do this. I hope that this will be stopped also.Anyway, that is enough for me too. Really, before starting to write this comment, I thought about it very much, but I cannot sit watching pathetic Disney people giving 10 stars just to raise the bar.Kids, please PLEASE, ask someone older that can actually tell you what is good and bad. No, not please, I am BEGGING you to get out of the mass and try something different like reading and writing and drawing. I can assure you that this will be the best things that you have ever done. And when a good movie comes out you will see that you will have a much nicer time watching it than ever before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a mother of two and I brought my two children to see the movie and it was outright the worst movie ever. My children walked out! And I had to persuade them to stay because I paid $10 for 3 tickets and I didn't want to lose my worth so I stayed through the movie. To my horror, it was as bad as my children thought it was. I almost projectile vomitted on others. DO NOT WATCH THIS. If I could less than 1, I would have. WORST MOVIE HANDS DOWN. If you have to watch a GOOD movie, I would suggest the Hannah Montana movie that will be coming out soon. Save your money, save your breakfast, SAVE YOURSELF. It's time to watch Jonas Brothers - where's your kids?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut it, Jonas lovers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I swear, their fanbase is pathetic. Heaven forbid we should ever say anything bad about the Jonas Brothers. It's just like running over their dog or something. Shut up, already. They are horrible "musicians" and I use that term loosely. It's laughable that you think we are jealous of them. What do we have to be jealous of? Last time I checked, I have no desire to write crappy songs and target pre-teen girls. At my age, that would get me arrested. You all say we have no life, yet you're doing exactly the same thing we are so I guess that means you don't have lives either. I'm sorry you all have closed-minds towards real music but that's not our problem. You can all give in to their shameless pandering all you want. Every time I see a Jonas fan spouting off whiny little rants, it makes me even more glad I'm not part of that fanbase. I listen to bands with way more talent than them like AC/DC, The Beatles, Metallica, R.E.M., etc. Who cares if we haven't seen the stupid movie? The point is, we don't NEED TO see it. We KNOW what this lame movie is about: the Jonas Brothers in concert. Lah-de-freakin'-dah. Like seeing the movie is going to change our opinion of them? It won't. I would think you'd be smart enough to realize that. To the person who wished death on Jonas haters, real classy. I hope karma comes around to bite you on that one. We hate the Jonas Brothers and seeing their stupid 3D movie isn't going to change it. Now go back to kissing your Jonas posters and daydreaming about being their wives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonas Brothers 3D makes "Disaster Movie" look Oscar worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, no no no no, the assumption that we cheered on N'Suck or the Bareback Boys is, to be quite honest, as wrong as is the belief that the Jonas Brothers produce something besides trash music. When the afore mentioned bands, and their contemporaries were popular, I was listening to Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Hendrix, NIN, and I knew many people in my age group (those who these so called bands targeted) with similar good taste in music. Face it, they are a rotten band, and if you think Nick playing a guitar in one video elevates their status from landfill worthy to anything else, as you rightly pointed out, it was only one video he played in. As for them not wanting to be in the publics eye?I won't even dignify that with a retort, as the only way you could possibly think that is if ones I.Q. is equal to the number of days in a week, or if one is simply so infatuated with them, no amount of reason could sway your beliefs.They are media whores, and their sole purpose (even if they think they are hot stuff, and a new wave in music?LOL?) is to make cash. As soon as the public shows signs of disinterest, Disney will too, and the Jonas Brothers will disappear, maybe only to be remembered in a Distant VH1 special documenting their short claim to fame, built on the backs of pre-teen girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonas Brothers have inspired my toilet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't agree more with most of the comments here in IMDb. Disney has brained washed young people's minds by drowning then with the Jonas brothers. Jonas Brothers are simply a money making machine masterminded by corporate Disney. I have to admit that they have achieved their goal and have profit immensely by making a totally untalented boy band to stardom. But why are they so popular? Simple, Disney have invested millions on commercials and they have the means to make a toy band famous. Know they bring a 3D concert to the big screen, which in my opinion is totally horrific. Like one of the comments say: "Jonas Brothers are whores of the Disney's media machine." I still haven't heard a single song of the Jonas brothers that had become a hit, and still, they are famous. I really don't understand. They are not original, they are not talented, and they don't even write their own songs. Again, if it wasn't for Disney repetitive promotions Jonas brother would only be a wannabe boy band. What people need to understand is, that they are not a real band, but a brand to sell t-shirts, posters, lunch boxes, CDs, and concert tickets. God knows, perhaps they soon will have their own sitcom.Like many other who have rated this, I would rate this 0/10 if it was possible! For the young people, don't keep falling to Disney's media machine and support real talent, not this pseudo-band!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are quite a few of 10 star ratings in this review section, if you happen to see one don't listen to it. 99.9% of those reviews are by biased fan-girls who just want everyone in the world to love the Jonas Brothers. But coming from a non-biased person these are my basic thoughts. This is barely a movie. I know tour based movies fallowing bands aren't usually great, but this is just horrible. The acting by the Jonas Brothers is some of the worst I have ever seen. Also the jokes I find on the back of Laffy Taffy wrappers are funnier than their so-called humor. The actual signing is probably the worse. If Alvin and the Chipmunks were 4 year old girls that sucked in a tank of helium they would still sound better than these guys. Also the special affects in this are just so poor its just mind blowing. One more thing, why did this movie need to be in 3-D? Just because you can make a movie in 3-D doesn't mean you should. Do yourself a favor and never see this movie. No matter who tells you to just don't do it.</fullReview>

It was like having my balls run over by a steam roller. Not only did the Jo Bros. movie prove that they make terrible music, it also demonstrated how low Disney has fallen. Disney Channel has raped the once glorious franchise and left it for dead in a ditch. This movie for some reason was made in 3D. Not that i have something against a 3D movie (excluding anything Brendan Fraser was in) but they went WAY overboard. I nearly passed out. After nearly 50 minutes of utter nonsense and "comedy", i exited the theater knowing that there was no way to heal the wound this movie made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with concert movies. I love music, and try to embrace all genres, I love film, and I admire anybody who comes out and gives it a go. However, Jonas Brothers:The 3D Concert Experience is a dud in my view, I actually saw this out of curiosity being somewhat indifferent to them, and seeing this "film" has done very little to change that.A major problem is the music. I like pop-rock, didn't used to, but it's growing on me, but the pop-rock tunes are completely forgettable as are a vast majority of the renditions. The melodies are rather unmemorable and the lyrics are on the whole uninspired. Even worse are the 3D effects. Like the Jonas Brothers, I am actually indifferent to 3D, there have been times when it's worked but I have seen too many films where it doesn't. The 3D here does not work. It is very lazy and unimaginative(water bouncing off a drum kit is the most imaginative it gets) and distracts rather than enhances.Then there is the voice over comparison to the Beatles and David Cassidy. The voice over was unnecessary and irrelevant, and Cassidy also doesn't really add anything to the proceedings. The cinematography is odd sometimes and shoddy, while the lighting gets too much. I also hated the audience, I know it's for the atmosphere but seriously this audience is annoying and sometimes the screaming gets so loud in places the lyrics, singing and melodies are indecipherable.The singing and performances don't do much to improve either. The Jonas Brothers actually sound bored, not only with their music but with themselves too and each other. Demi Levato's rendition of This is Me also has little effect, Levato is talented and she sings it nicely but the song itself is rather forgettable and slows the film down in my opinion. In fact, Taylor Swift actually out-shines them all, and she does do a decent job actually.All in all, very poor and not really worth the watch or wait. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible experience to push us further into 3D land</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical documentary showcasing the teen stars performing in front of their legions of fans at Madison Square Garden amongst other locations in America.Dragged to see this by my best friend, I found it hard to express much enthusiasm, a emotion made much harder as the credits rolled and the American trio were awoken by their colleague and are all acting like the egotistical stars that their reputations seem to cement them as.What intrigued me however was how this film would be any more exciting in 3D rather in normal viewing. Perhaps used as a device to bring people into the cinema for the ultimate experience of spending extra money to gain a headache from the ridiculous looking spectacles, who knows, and it goes without saying that in the grand scheme of current proceedings, making this in 3D will not break minds.Monsters vs Aliens, Up! And up and coming every other film is to be showcased with the extra charge of the spectacles so we will be looking for outstanding experiences for our money and this 2009 release doesn't give much for its so proclaimed diversity.Having heard the odd song by the teen sensations, I must admit my expectations were not high once the first song rolled around and Nick Jonas did this funny little twirl to make him look like he had back pain or something but oddly, as the film progressed there was an undeniable uplifting. Of course the beginning was so atrocious it could not have been any worse but it is hard to deny that the continuous use of positive songs and odd excellent sweeping shot of the arena is beneficial to the fans of the pop stars.But as with most pop acts in recent times, the songs became one with similar beats and a continuous repetitious use of ideologies in their own lyrics. The inclusion of Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift sparked initial interest before their songs came to sound similarly like their co-acts.What is really bad however about this "film" is the portrayal of the brothers. At first being awoken just makes them lazy, then the ridiculous run across town chased by fans who happen to have the "I love you Jonas Brothers" signs handy as if ever going to run into them, makes them inappreciable of their target audience. One moment they turn up to buy their new album, where all their fans are gathered, and then leave without signing or making a speech or anything. After seeing this particular snippet of their day to day lives, it is hard to like even their odd good song.Living in England, I am unaware of the hype surrounding the Brothers in America, but found it hard to believe they are that much appreciated in their own backyard. Whether déj? vu or not, you may even see some similar faces in the audiences at various events, which to me made it all staged for a so called "documentary". This really was a no go experience, made to justify the "fan base" and waste our money on the glasses.</fullReview>

The girls that love this movie should know what it's rock really; why does the movie calls "camp rock" it don't have any kind of rock , the girls see that movies cause they are of Disney.

		<shortDescription>Modernized Marketed Music Of Today?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today in this world during hard times we began to explore the realms of amazing things yet nothing we see is amazing but generic in this time. Confusing as it may be but it is true. We wonder to our self how can we allow are self to be manipulated into things such as the Jonas Brothers. A untalented recycled band who is exceptionally good for marketing do to there looks and appeal. Most of us humans well female humans I supposed are hooked into this marketing scheme. Its proved to be successful in previous bands such as the New Kids On The Block, Backstreet Boys and N Sync. And today Jonas Brothers is one of those bands but modernized. Now lets take a look at the movie. This is an interesting take on trying to please there fans by showing it in 3D. So interesting that it makes you wonder whats the point? Showing a movie in 3D does not help improve a band. Music is more important then money. There was no reason to make a movie such as this except for Jonas Brothers to boost sales. I gave this so called movie a one do to the fact for a band trying to boost there sales by applying to marketing such as this movie and making it in 3D to appeal audience. I recommend this movie to teenage girls looking to get popular by liking a popular band that's been popularized by the individuals lured in. If you are one of those individuals of course you have to see this movie or you wont be as popular as the teenage girl next to you.In the future I hope we can evolve as race to be more intelligent and more creative. We may very well see this sometime soon as we are being challenge by a economic crisis that may change the world. For now lets embrace our music and are movies that have given us motivation to conquer are challenges ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D Better Than Expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonas Brothers 3-D Concert Experience (2009): Dir: Bruce Hendricks / Featuring: Joe Jonas, Kevin Jonas, Nick Jonas, Robert "Big Rob" Geggans, Taylor Swift: Although the outstanding 3-D effect gives the illusion of making viewers more involved, this film is hardly as detailed as the Beatles films. In the tradition of A Hard Day's Night but hardly equal to it, we are introduced to Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas who are a big sensation and perform for thousands of screaming fans in what would deem more appropriate for T.V. What works is its documentary style shot by director Bruce Hendricks who gives viewers a glimpse of life on tour with the Jonas brothers from tour bus to hotel before ultimately hitting the concert hall. The Jonas prove entertaining along with bodyguard Robert "Big Rob" Geggans. They give an energetic concert with a few notable guests but this is where the 3D elements shine. A drumstick is hurled out into the crowd whirling just past your head. A pair of sunglasses and tossed your way as well. "Big Rob" is their bodyguard who prepares them on schedule and even performs a song himself. Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato make appearances staging songs. More of the Jonas and their outside lives would have been more interesting as oppose to what seems like a promotional effort to sells merchandise but at least its 3D gives off a natural concert experience. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what? I may belong to a minority but I actually enjoyed watching this movie - and still do from time to time. I like their music and I listen to them a lot (I shockingly also like several of the "approved" bands/artist mentioned in many other reviews - who would have guessed?). I think its admirable how into their music the Jonas Brothers are, how they give everything from the beginning to the end of the show. They're doing a good job (...because that's what it is, their job; I'm well aware that they're not doing it out of the kindness of their hearts - just like any other artist isn't).As of their voices? They're no Michael Bublé or the likes but then again, a lot of artists aren't - so what? It's not like they're the worst singers ever. I've heard worse. At least you can clearly hear that they're performing live - as they've done per usual since they started out half a dozen years ago (quite some time before Disney came into the picture, mind you). Again, there are a lot of big names who use playbacks and are still considered good artists. About the fans: I don't mind the screaming girls - they, like me minus the screaming, had a good time. It's a concert movie so I didn't really expect a script like in a normal storytelling movie. Some of the anecdotes about their tour life or show life are interesting some not so much. I don't think it's bad that some of the scenes were staged. The Brothers explained more than once that they were retelling actual experiences from their past. What's bad about that?Finally I have to conclude that I accept the fact that a lot of people don't share my opinion. But the way people review/criticize saddens and angers me. Often it's derogatory and condescending not only to the artist but also to the fans. Not liking or even hating something doesn't give you the right to talk down and outright insult people - no matter who or how "bad" they are. You don't like it? Don't watch it! If you realize that only while watching: just stop watching! If you need to publish your opinion do it in a civil and factual way! Constructive criticism and general respect are the key. Any civilized person should bear that in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given it 0 out of 10 if this let me. If you thought hearing them constantly on TV and the radio was enough to make your ears bleed, think again. This time, they are at it full-throttle. I can understandwhy some CRAZY people would want to see this-I mean, they're nice and classy looking. But, do you really want to sit for 2 hours hearing them sing their gooey icky "rock" songs? I would sure hope not. I have a few shout-outs for them: Joe: you need to get bigger pants, Kevin: you need to quit because you are too old, and (poor guy) the only thing they let you do is play the guitar. An finally Nick: the cutest one by FAR, but please...his voice is the reason my ears were still ringing 5 hours later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SO basically i feel the need to make this to put some sense into people who are both in love with this movie and hate it with a passion. I gave it a 1/10 so u obviously know mine. But thats not the point, these are IMDb REVIEW BOARDS people, not expression of opinion boards where you can take your anger out on the Joe Bros or explain how you want to kill all of the haters.Now im going to say that i do NOT like the Jonas Brothers at all and let me give my opinion on why. Not because they have a fan base of crazy pre-teen girls, not because they are virgin Christian boys, and not because they are a Disney formed creation of a band (ok partially that) but what i do hate is the fact they somehow HAVE TO make a movie about their freken concert???? and in 3-D nonetheless???? If you are a Jonas Brothers fan sit down and think to yourself, they are making a movie.....about a band's concert.....in the big screens....in 3-D!!!!! Now doesn't that sound just a little retarded to you??? My favorite band is Metallica but if Metallica were to come out with a movie, about their Death Magnetic concert.....in 3-D i would say to myself what in the blue hell are they doing making a movie like this?!?!?!? Despite how much i love the band.If the Joe Bros are a band then there is no reason they should be making a movie on the big screens. Stick to the television sets on the Disney channel to please your fan base. I mean seriously people you're going to spend $10 on a movie thats 76 min. long that you could probably see the exact same material online OR Disney channel???? Oh, wait mom, its in 3- D!!!!! WE HAVE TO SEE IT CUZ OF THAT!!!!!Honestly, for those of you who are under the age of 16 and have an IMDb account, i suggest you delete it right away because lets face it, you have no respect by anyone on this site, you have no idea what an actual review of a movie should be and you're just inflating this site with users who don't know how to review a movie properly. All in all, this movie is horrible, for the fact it isn't a movie. It's the Disney channel on a big screen, in 3-D. Save your money, watch the Jonas series at home, and lets face it, when the Jonas Brothers turn 20, they'll disappear off the face of the earth and you'll be saying to yourself, Jonas who????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst 3D - Infinitely. Can you spell G-R-E-E-D-Y ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 75 min show was really, REALLY bad.Two young relatives appeared to enjoy it, as they haven't been to a concert yet. The anticipation and expectations were high. Even they didn't seem as enthused as when they first entered the theatre. They've seen some 3D shows before, and the drive back was, well - quiet.The biggest concern a niece beside me was: that a pair of adults stood, and variably sat behind us. As they let three kids run around, they recorded the Jonas 3D movie on their cameras. After letting an attendant know, we saw them talked to, and then they stayed to the end, to finish taking their photos and whatnot.There really isn't any need for "Spoiler Alerts." Seriously. It's that bad. If you were to think about all your definitions of a bad movie theatre experience, it'd be an alternate description of this movie.These are not spoilers, to say: the shots were heavily edited to the point of blandness. The scenarios were boring, it did not resemble anything interesting at all. It was a montage of uninspired ROTE that went nowhere. Besides, there are so many internet reviews that people have read already, there is nothing left to say. As for the promotion of the movie being a chance for the poor kid fans to see more of the band, nah. It's not worth the charge above what you pay for your internet connection to the same thing.Disney did quite possibly, the worst investment of monies in current 3D technology that is available to date. The 3D shots weren't that great. They were sparse in my opinion, and repetitive as far as having no imagination in this product. There was no premise. Anything this movie claimed to be is not true. The Directing was terrible, and the Editing was all that, Times Infinity.Greed. Greedy, greedy, greedy. The Disney money train is being re-directed to the next big thing they contract some teens to do. Next year's ten year olds may now join the lineup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK... I was told I needed to watch this just so I can say I've seen the worst movie of all time. And I still don't see what the fuss is about. This movie is exactly what it says it is; the Jonas Brothers, on stage, that's it. It's just Disney milking as much money out of a franchise before it pops (that's why the genre is called "Pop" by the way). For those who love it; fine enjoy your music, whatever makes you happy. Writing about the "haters" however, just proves they're getting to you. To those who thought this non-movie (or the band in general) is the worst thing to happen to culture since Uwe Boll; relax, don't worry, wait about four years. By then the short attention span of their fan-base will latch on to something new and these kids will go the way of "98 Degrees".Bottom Line: 3/10 Not a real movie, but points for honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Could this Possibly Be the Worst Movie Ever Made ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can the Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Experience possible be considered the worst movie ever? It accomplished exactly what is says it is going to in the title. it gives you the experience of being at one of their concerts, plus giving you fun backstage and hotel scenes. This movie was not intended to be a cinematic masterpiece, it was made for the fans to have if they were unable to attend a show or just wanted to see it again, plus more. I am a massive fan of the Jonas Brothers, so obviously in my eyes this one of the greatest movies, just because it gives me a full 75 minutes of my favourite band in 3D, however if you are not a fan and expected to see a an in depth plot line with Oscar worthy acting, then you were entering with false, foolish expectations. I just cannot comprehend how this can be the worst movie, or now the second worst movie, when The Love Guru and the Hottie and the Nottie exist. Anyways I just wanted to express my opinion of how ridiculous i thought this movies rating was. I am not saying everyone has to adore the Jonas Brothers and this movie as I do, obviously people have varying tastes. However the only reason this movie has such a low rating is because of a majority of peoples hate for this band due to their massive popularity and Disney connection. Rate the movie on what it was made to be--that would a concert experience--and trust me it more than delivered to the people is was intended to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must see not only for Jonas Brothers' fans but for non fans as well. It shows not only concert footage, it shows what they're all about. Talented, giving, caring, and loving people. It also showed that they do more for their fans than anyone. They are excellent role models for kids of any age. The movie is just great fun for the entire family. I also thought the 3-D affects were better than in other 3-D movies I have seen. It really does feel like you have a front row seat and they are reaching out to you. It is the perfect solution for people who could not get tickets to the actual concerts. I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages. I myself have seen it 3 times.</fullReview>

It is a MUSt for any Jonas fan or even if you are just a fan of good music. The Jonas Brothers worked really hard on this movie and deserve a great review! The movie starts out with a Jonas-Brtothers typical morning, and it shows how their day goes along. There are some very funny moments in this film, and it's exciting to fell like you are on stage with the Jonas Brothers. The 3D vision just makes the whole experience so much better and more interesting. Thank you to all of the supporters of the Jonas Brothers and for those of you who hate them for a living, please mind your own business because nobody needs that kind of negativity. Thank you for reading my review, and i hope it helps! (:</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Will it make you a better person to know, that you made 1,000,000 girls upset because the Jonas Brothers got so many bad stars that they can't do another movie? Come on, that's just rude. I know the Jonas Brothers can seem like "Just another Boy Band" and people will react like people will. But for the moment, if we fans want to be fans its not your choice weather or not we like them. We might grow out of them and we might not, but that's for us to decide. So please, stop rating this movie bad unless you paid to see it. I thought this movie was very cute, and what they showed i wish more artists WOULD show because it would be nice to know whats going on after the performances.Thank you =) ****************Megan</fullReview>

Yes, they are good looking, talented, funny and smart, but why are you guys jealous of that? They are the three most amazing boys on the planet and also my role models. I love them with all of my heart. So people that are voting 1 out of 10 and haven't even seen the movie, please stop. I would understand if you have seen the movie and you didn't like it, that's your opinion. But if you haven't seen the movie and you are saying 1 out of 10 just because you don't like them, then you should be ashamed of yourselves. Peace, Love, Jonas</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so I have not seen the movie. I did see the reviews from movie critics though and they all said that it was a great movies for fans to see and excellent for those that cannot afford to pay for a ticket for an actual concert. They also stated that they liked the fact that the movie showed a little something of the JB lives off stage.I understand that there are a lot of people who do not like the Jonas Brothers and I don't have anything against that. It's just sad to see that people won't admit it when somebody has talent. Anyways, I don't consider myself the Jonas Brothers biggest fan but I admit the fact that they are talented and that they have accomplished a lot in so little time.Back to the movie, from what I have seen on the previews the movie looks great. What I like the most is the fact that they show a little of their personal lives also, like what they do before a show or what they do on their free time. I am looking forward to seeing the movie soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you shouldn't listen to any of the "haters"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start this review off, I would first like to clear some things up: Whether you are a huge fan of the Jonas Brothers, or maybe just getting interested in them, you should not, by no means whatsoever, listen to any of the horrible reviews written on here. I went to the midnight showing of this movie, and it was excellent. Their live performances were just as good as their CD, along with the fact that the 3D effects of this movie were absolutely mind boggling. The reason on why you should not listen to the poor reviews is: 1. More than half of these haters have most likely not even seen the movie, therefore they do not have the right to sit there, and bash something that they cannot give fair judgment to. I have disliked many films in my life, and I still do not sit there and comment them, when I actually have a better right to, figuring I have actually SEEN those films. 2. They obviously have nothing better to do with their life, figuring they are sitting there thinking of ways to bash a band they supposedly "hate". If they hate the Jonas Brothers, that's just peachy, but sitting around, taking the time to write about how much they hate them is kind of ridiculous if you ask me. So, from a fans opinion, you should see this movie. You will not be disappointed. Its definitely worth your time, and I guarantee you will have a blast.</fullReview>

They are so extremely talented and don't deserve all of the negativity being thrown at them! I am very grateful to share a love of their talent with my sister (who is 15) and even more thankful to the boys for setting a good example for her!Honestly, to all the haters, if you dislike the boys/the movie so much why are you putting so much time into rating? Leave that to those of us who are going to offer a helpful opinion! Hope to see the boys this summer and a few more times at the movies!</fullReview>

The 3D effects were really good, and there were a lot effects in the movie unlike the Hannah Montana movie. I loved seeing behind-the-scenes of what the Jonas Brothers did when we didn't see them performing. One of my favorite scenes was the midnight release of A Little Bit Longer. With 20,000 + fans waiting for them, you could tell they were really happy. I felt like I was with them as excited as they were!! My other favorite part was the Love Is On Its Way music video. I got the soundtrack that previous Monday and I absolutely loved it. The music video was amazing, one the best one's they've done since SOS!

It was filled with excitement and gorgeous boys all throughout the movie. The song "Love is on it's way" was so beautiful. It's great how they can work Christian music into their movie. The fact that it was 3D was so awesome! It really was like I was on stage with them.And, when Nick plays the drums (in concert) you never get to see him up close doing that, so it was awesome how the cameras got him up-close with that. He was extremely hot when he was playing the drums. And, the boys are always super funny. Joe "Earthquake" ... "After shock" ha ha.</fullReview>

You get to see that they really are just normal teenagers that are living their dream. The Jonas Brothers touch my heart, and they should have a rating of 10 in this website. People that went to see it who hate the Jonas Brothers or people who haven't even seen the movie but are rating it one star, you really shouldn't. Why would you waste your money to go see a movie that you KNEW you were going to hate? It is totally pointless. I am not saying you have to love The Jonas Brothers, but go watch and spend you money and time on something you love instead of bashing what others like. Not everyone has to like the same things as you. The Jonas Brothers are inspiring and extremely talented and I don't know where I would be without them.**EDIT** To all of you pathetic haters, STOP WASTING YOUR TIME TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU HATE!!!!!!! Please stop wasting your time as well as ours, and go get a life. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic, it really deserves 1000 stars, even tho you cannot rate that much. You can see that JB and all the crew are really interested in doing this, and they work really payed off. I don't know why people keep putting like 1 star, because they simply do not deserve it. I wont say any detail, but I do think that this was incredibly done and you can notice all the effort that all the people put on this. This new experience in 3D is awesome, because you can feel like if you were on the concert. So if you are one of those persons who did not go to one of the concerts like me, if you watch this movie you feel them so close, you feel the excitement so close to you that it feels completely real. I recommend it 100%, you will really enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie in the theaters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with two of my best friends, and let me just say that this movie was the best movie i have ever seen in theaters, I'm thinking that all those haters have no common sense on a good movie vs. a horrible movies, but they need to get their facts straight. that movie was amazing and nobody else can top it. you've got 10 stars from me! EVERYONE SHOULD GO SEE IT. (: i have already gone three times to see this movie and it never gets old. The only problem with the movie is that it was REALLY SHORT and when it was over i wanted there to be so much more! The Jonas brothers were amazing in this movie, and this movie is good for all people, young and old. The 3D glasses really make you feel like you are at the concert and they are actually talking to you. this movie was a very good experience for me, but i also wish the tickets were cheaper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a nutshell: Fans couldn't ask for more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience" is everything a Jonas fan could want and more. The amount of concert footage is plentiful and the shots are astounding. Also, the 3D effects aren't cheesy and overly used. Sure a couple of guitar picks and drum sticks may fly your way, but the 3D is more often used to create a sense of depth that really puts you right up on stage with the brothers. The songs themselves are high energy and are all crowd-pleasers. Kevin does a fabulous job on guitar and always keeps the audience excited. Joe delivers great vocals and his stage tricks are never a let-down. Nick shows his versatility by going from guitar to drums and back, and his vocals fit beautifully with Joe's. The backstage footage is worth the $15 for a movie ticket because it's priceless to see all the madness that the Jonas Brothers live through everyday.As for people who aren't necessarily fans, AKA boyfriends and parents who get dragged along, the movie should be surprisingly enjoyable for them, for the simple reason being that the Jonas Brothers put on a great show. The lights and fire effects are very well done and visually appealing throughout the show, and the songs themselves, as mentioned above, are crowd-pleasers that could get anyone on their feet... even in a movie theater!That is why, I give this movie a 10/10 rating. It's fun, it's well-done, and it's for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, first I would like to start of by saying that shouldn't be rating or writing reviews on this movie if they haven't seen it. Go see it, and then you can write all the crap that you want. But not just because you think they 'suck' means the movie will. So first go watch it, k. thanks. Second, Jonas hate needs to stop. You have your own opinion but really, just batching them for no reason? You don't see what girls see. These guys are great. We love their music, their down-to-earth style, their smiles, their personalities, their love to their fans, and not to mention, their looks. So please, respect. Just like you make like...lets say..The Beatles.. and i don't. (I really do) doesn't mean im gonna go on in every single video on youtube, to their myspace, or write bad reviews on a "movie they made."Well, at last, this movie was great. I know it didn't get more than the Hannha Montana one, but the quality and the excitement was way better in the JB3D one. It had more effects and you really felt like you were right there on stage with them. It is so much fun to go watch with your friends. You can even stand up and dance to it! :D really! So, go watch it. Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato are in it too! I mean, really, can this movie get any better?! :P</fullReview>

The backstage scenes are funny and you get to know the real Jonas Brothers. You see from when they wake up to when they get ready for concerts. It is a great experience, please have fun watching this movie. I think Everyone will like this movie, children, teens, adults, even seniors! Its such a good movie with amazing 3D effects! Also, all the song are really catchy and fun! The Jonas Brothers are truly great role models to everyone! I recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I for one loved this movie...i am NOT a teeny bopper and i did love the movie. And i actually like this movie more than because of the great looks of the jonas brothers(which i could care less if u think otherwise) but i did like the movie because for one the guys wanted the fans to see how life for them really was, they wanted to show everyone that it wasn't all fun and games when you're in the music business. They actually want the fans to know everything they go through to put on a Great show! the movie shows that unlike most bands the jonas brothers actually care about their fans and want them to keep listening to their music! And don't get me started on how talented the jonas brothers are. Okay most guys for some reason hate the music...but is it because they are so jealous the couldn't sing as well as Joe, or because they could never master the guitar like nick or kevin! i believe thats one of the reasons why and because they are so jealous that most girls think the jonas brothers are hot! which they are but looks aren't everything to girls but guys for some reason think thats all we look at?? the guys play their own music they write their own music unlike the oldies bands that people love so much or even other bands today. jonas brothers write from their hearts and girls love that. these are the guys that most every girl wants! because they actually treat girls with respect! And how could anyone compare the jonas brothers to the beatles or acdc...the jonas brothers are ten times better than those bands!!! seriously though i like the beatles!! and acdc(alittle) but the jonas brothers music means something to them and it lets the fans relate to it as well! this concert showed ther music in a whole new way! and i love the movie!! srry if some of you don't agree but this is 2009 the beatles are done playing and acdc just cant make anymore good music srry to say... its the jonas brothers turn to show the world what music is so stop hating and get over it!</fullReview>

There music was amazing. &amp; so was there performance. Even the special guests were amazing. It was exciting to see them sing. About all the shows were sold out on Feb. 27th it was crazy and an amazing experience. Especiaally because it was in 3D.It made it so much more fun. Everyone would be clapping and singing along. It was really just a fun great time. Going with all your friends and smiling. It was truly amazing. I couldn't ask for a better movie.[: It really felt like you were in the audience at the concert. For the people who couldn't go it must have been even more exciting. &amp; the two new songs were awesome and very inspiring. So it was great to end up hearing new songs.I LOVED IT. They trulyy put on a good show. All the fans had their Jonas Brothers shirts on. &amp; there was even a line to get in. It was nice to see the movie. &amp; i would definetlyy go again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was, by far, the best 3D movie I have ever seen. The Jonas Brothers are three amazing young men who give their fans an experience of a lifetime. This movie was a thank you to the fans and it was for fans who could not attend their Burnin Up Tour. I myself am I a huge fan of them and I did attend the Jonas Brothers summer tour, so I got to experience it again. This movie got me and my friends on our feet, dancing to the music and singing along. It was a great experience. Just like being at the concert. This is definitely a must-see. Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas are excellent performers and three great role models for ever girl or guy out there that likes them. I myself have been a fan for two years and its been an amazing ride and this 3D concert is definitely something that would make any other fan proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonas Brothers Movie Helped me re-live my summer concert experience....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am almost 20 years old went to see this movie with two of my best friends who are 20 and 19. All three of us absolutely loved every minute of the movie. One of my friends is only a small fan of the Jonas Brothers, and yet she found herself singing and dancing along with the movie as much as I was. I saw them live this summer in Atlanta, GA and even though I was slightly disappointed that the entire set list from the concert wasn't included in the movie, I VERY HAPPY that it was EXACTLY how I remembered it. These boys are serious musicians who are very good at what they do, and anyone who can't see this contact me and I will give you the number of my optician. I loved how the back stage sections were completely real and, with the exception of the first 10 minutes and the music video mid movie, completely non-scripted. For those who comment on the fact that they are fake and talentless, I want to point out that these young men were recently nominated for a Grammy. These don't get handed out to just anyone FYI! And they certainly aren't given to those who lack musical ability and talent. And those of you who are commenting on this movie, yet haven't seen it, where are you basing your opinion? Just because you personally don't like the Jonas Brothers, doesn't mean that the movie sucks. It was everything that I expected from a concert film and more. (More meaning a nice view of Joe shirtless.....swoon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'd like to say that it is really funny that this movie gets either one star or ten stars, just to show that you either hate it or love it. I took mt friend who is tolerable of the Jonas Brothers to the midnight showing and, though I still have not won her over yet, really enjoyed the movie. Probably because she gave them a chance instead of automatically putting them down.So if you don't like them, please be a little more open-minded! No one is saying they are music legends already or are better than the classics, but they certainly have plenty of talent and work so hard, especially for their fans. They actually were there at the midnight showing and played an acoustic set for us, which was of course amazing, but also shows that they do way more for their fans than they have to. They love what they do and I hope they do this forever. As for the movie, and coming from a fan, we were all singing along, some people were dancing in the aisles, just having a really good time! There happens to be a lot the movie did not cover, but you can put every single detail of their lives in an hour and 15 minute movie. The movie gives you a taste of what it is like. But beyond that are the stories of each fan, sooo many more amazing songs, and all the hilarious things these boys do. So please give them a chance! There is soooo much more to them than meets the eye! And ears! So in conclusion, please be more open and realize that these boys have done so much for some people and bring so much joy to many others. I am including myself in that, and I am in college! GO Jonas Brothers! I am so proud of you!!!</fullReview>

Everyone has their own opinions, and I respect that. But, you don't have to trash the Jonas Brothers just because you don't like their music or clothes. Because face it, you could NEVER do what these boys do everyday, and you should respect that. In my opinion, I loved the movie and I plan on seeing it many more times before it leaves theaters. I skipped school to see it the first day it came out and it was amazing. Who cares if it didn't make #1. Most movies don't even make it to the top 3, but this movie did. And even if you don't like JB, that doesn't mean they deserve a horrible rating. Come on there are WAY WORSE movies out there to waste your time on than this one. Seriously, do you people who don't like them really see how stupid this is??? Wasting YOUR OWN TIME to try to get people not to like them. They already have MILLIONS of fans and some stupid website rating is NOT going to change that. IM A JONAS BROTHERS FAN AND PROUD OF IT AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN LEAVE US ALONE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it wasn't so pitiful, all these ridiculous comments would almost be funny. As it is, the real downfall of society seems to rooted in the pointless trashing of this movie. Why waste your time? I am quite certain very few of these horrendous comments were written by anyone who has actually seen the movie.Yes, of course this movie will not appeal to everyone. But if you know you hate the Jonas Brothers, you wouldn't go to see it.I did see the movie, 3 times so far. No, i'm not a 10 year old little girl, I'm 41. I've heard lots of music and seen lots of bands. I enjoy a wide variety of music....and i love the Jonas Brothers. Maybe not for the same reason I can listen to the original New York cast of Les Mis for hours on end, or the same reason i stop and listen to the 50's music my parents played while i was growing up. But really, these guys are great. I love their music, and more than that I love who they are and what they do.Yes, the 'behind the scenes' stuff was a little dorky. But from what i can tell, it's because these guys are a little dorky. And I like that. They travel with their family, they get excited about their fans. Their show on stage is eclectic...they sing, they play different instruments, they tumble and jump around. They designed their stage with a catwalk so they can interact with their fans.I've sat in the front row for one of their shows, and they do interact...and they sing live and they play their own instruments. When you are 5 ft away, you can tell.So back to the movie...this movie isn't a vehicle for amazing 3d effects...it's a nice addition that makes you 'feel closer' to the action. and I think it works.The movie is a concert. but much less expensive. JB's music makes you feel good...it's fun. And so was the movie. The wildly popular Jonas Brothers get on stage and sing a number of their wildly popular songs. The movie was, of course, recorded live during a few different shows during their last tour. Their energy on stage is amazing. Makes you want to get up and dance. The fact that the vocals and instrumentals are not cd perfect just makes it better. You get to see a live show, not see an artist lip sync to their cd. They introduce a new song--Love is on its Way--they play up the fact that thousands of girls would do just about anything to meet them. Sleep on the sidewalk, wait for hours in a crowded room or a sweltering street. Because these girls know, when you meet these guys, they make you feel amazingly special.So the movie rocks, if you have any interest in the Jonas Brothers. Or even if you are open minded enough to listen.But i guess the Jonas phenomenon is truly divisive...you love them or you hate them. But i still can't figure out why anyone would spend so much time spreading hate. Instead, go pick a band you do like and go support them. Spread the good word about their music and who they are and why you are passionate about them. how did they say it in the 60's? make love not war?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It completely baffles me the hate that this movie is receiving.First ? if you're not a fan of the Jonas Brothers then I doubt you'll like this movie at all.I am twenty years old and I took my younger sister to see the movie opening weekend. Before the movie even started the theater staff told us all that we should treat this like a "real" concert. He told us to feel free to scream, dance, laugh, cry, everything. So that's exactly what my younger sister and I did, and we had a BLAST. We had actually seen the Burnin' Up tour in Irvine, CA but we unfortunately had seats far away from the stage. The movie made us feel like we were reliving that experience and we felt exactly like the producers wanted us to: like we were in the front row.I am really glad I shelled out the extra few bucks to see the IMAX version. I had a great time with my little sister and I wouldn't trade that for anything! Kudos, Jonas Brothers.</fullReview>

I would also like to stay that this movie wasn't for you (people who dislike the Jonas brothers) it was for their fans, for people who enjoyed their burning up tour and wanted to see it again in movie form. I'm sorry you disliked it, but you have to realize they aren't actors, they are just trying to do a little something extra for the millions of girls who just can't get enough of them. So, all of your commenting on how it's a disgrace and an embarrassment to the music industry is unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the theater with my little sister not knowing exactly what to expect and not being entirely enthusiastic about the choice of film. Once it started, however, I found myself thoroughly enjoying both the music and the humor of the Jonas Brothers. It's funny that some of the reviews either criticize the music of the Brothers or claim that it's a good thing the music was pre-recorded. The music in the movie is most definitely live, and the songs are actually quite catchy. No one is claiming the musical and lyrical brilliance of the music by the Brothers Jonas; it is pure, catchy power pop, and taken as such, it is really good. It is also interesting that one reviewer, who criticized the music of the Jonas Brothers, claimed that during the opening sequence where the brothers were being chased, a Beatles song played in the background. This was not, however, a Beatles song, but rather one crafted by the three brothers themselves. Perhaps if people would forget their preconceived notions on what should be expected from this movie, they would find that they actually do enjoy the sounds of the Jonas Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought the movie was phenomenal! yes, it was aimed toward a younger crowd, so it doesn't need to impress all you stupid people. I'm 16 and i thought the movie was great! my favorite part was Joe's shirtless scene. ;) the crowd was pumped and it gave me chills when the movie began. it's worth every penny if you're a jonas fan. there wasn't in a time when i was bored with the movie. Usually, i get bored at some point and go get popcorn, but with this movie, i didn't want to move, and i had to pee soo bad;haha. it was so good in fact, that i'm going to see it again in about 4 hours. so, i believe you should definitely go see the movie if you're a fan..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to the jealous haters that haven't even seen the movie and have nothing better to do with their lives than post lies and give bad ratings and show their low class by posting profanity online about something they haven't bothered to see to good quality movies about a good band, with good morals...just what the world needs more of! I took my two daughters, age 15 &amp; 7 to see it opening day and was not disappointed. We've seen them in concert and know what a wonderful show they put on. This was just like being on stage with them.If you want to see a good quality movie that is family friendly and fun, GO SEE IT...if you want to see trash, profanity , immorality ,etc..this wont be the movie for you.Good Job Jonas Brothers! Keep up the good quality work!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I am a huge fan of the Jonas Brothers, and this movie delivered exactly what it was supposed to. It gives the audience the feel of being on stage with the three brothers as well as hilarious behind the scenes footage. The performance sequences were exiting and fun, and I was singing and dancing throughout the entire movie. The 3D scenes were flawless, and were truly amazing to watch. To me, this movie was a major success, and you can be sure that I will see this movie again, and buy it when it comes out on DVD. I would advise everyone to go see this movie, trust me, if you are in the mood for some good music, funny outtakes, and three amazingly good looking boys, then this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was completely amazing! I went to see it with my two best friends and we loved it! It was kinda pricey but worth it. It was amazing to almost be able to touch them ha ha. I want to see it again and I am gonna buy the CD and DVD. If you don't like the Jonas Brothers of course you are not gonna like the movie so please don't post things just to be mean. The Jonas Brothers kind of music may not appeal to you because you don't like their type of music and that's fine, everyone has their own opinion but please don't be mean. I loved the movie and the Jonas Brothers! I would've liked a little more behind the scenes and not have it scripted, but overall an excellent movie that all Jonas lovers should see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay that other person hasn't got a clue what there on about. As a huge Jonas Brothers fan i loved it. The concert experience gives you looks from backstage as well as seeing them perform many of their major hits. Follow Nick, Joe and Kevin as they continue to live their dream, the footage was filmed during the burning up tour and features special guests Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato who also sing brilliantly live just like the brothers. And it's not just fans who will enjoy it too. My little cousin (boy)sat through the whole of the movie only getting up to dance to some of the songs and he really enjoyed wearing the 3D glasses, and also my mum admitted at the end that she enjoyed the film very much! So an all round pleaser and a must buy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first 3D movie I have seen and I'm so glad I did! I love the Jonas Brothers! Okay, what I don't seem to understand is why so many people who hate them went to see the movie? Can any haters answer that PLEASE? If you don't like the Jonas Brothers, don't listen to them, don't even talk about them. They didn't ever do anything to you for you to hate them!Now, on to the movie...which was INDCREDIBLE! You really got to see what it was like at the concert for fans, like myself, who did not get to go to the concert last year. It really felt like a concert was going on! Their stage presence is fantastic! You get to see what happens backstage. Also, you see what goes on during an actual day in the Jonas Brothers lives. The movie captures that they really are, in the words of Joe Jonas, 'three brothers from Jersey'. If you haven't seen this movie and you are a Jonas fan, you really are missing out! Only one flaw: I wish it was longer! They took out their A Little Bit Longer, Lovebug, and Year 3000 performances, which I really wanted to see... but overall a 10/10 for sure!</fullReview>

It was amazing. It had me laughing from the beginning, and dancing and singing along the entire time. It was one of the funnest nights I've had at the movies with my family. My mom liked it, my little sister liked it, I liked it. It was a great movie, and it really deserves more than a star.

		<fullReview>the movie was amazing! The Jonas Brothers have worked so hard to make this movie for their fans and all of you people who are downing them and this movie just because they have associated with Disney are wrong. you may consider them a band only suitable for 'teeny-boppers' but that is not the case at all. these three have written music that have touched the hearts of so many people, including myself. their songs have great meanings and they help people get through hard times and go on with their lives, like the song 'Hold On' and 'A Little Bit Longer'. they are such talented musicians and they're sweethearts. these three are the most caring people ever. some of you are probably going to ask 'how do you know that? have you even met them?' well, i have not met them but in everything these three young men do, you can tell that they are genuine and that they have such kind hearts. they have wonderful personalities and they are the funniest brothers that i know. Kevin, Joe and Nick are have done an incredible job and i am so proud of them. i am very proud to say that i am a fan! thank you again for this wonderful movie, all of your fans love and appreciate you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People voted a 1 out of 10 simply because of hate? I can honestly say this movie was amazing. Not only am a BIG fan, I tell the truth. And if I didn't like it, I would say it. Hands down an amazing movie. This shows how mature some people are in this world that have to rate a movie that they probably haven't even bothered to see simply because they do not like the people in the movie. I'm not a fan of Beyonce, Did I go rate Dream Girls bad? No. I took my chances and watched the movie and I found it alright. That famous expression fit here, Don't judge a book by its cover. You never know, You may totally hate the Jonas Brothers, and maybe go watch the movie because you have nothing better to do. You might learn to like them, or find the movie somewhat pleasing. You never know unless you try, but those people who say they watched and hated it or disliked it have a good argument since they actually to the time to watch it. Thank you.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. (What it properly deserves.)</fullReview>

This movie comes out before then so it will be great to see, what a Jonas Brothers concert is like before i go to one can't wait to see the new song in the movie, it sounds awesome, its a song that always makes me smile. Will be awesome going to see the movie on opening weekend here in England with my friend and being able to sing along to all the songs it will be a really fun trip to the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atrocious. Horrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simply a mediocre made-for-TV movie, and how it got into theatres, I'm not entirely sure. I was dragged into seeing it with my girlfriend. I've never heard any JB songs, and I've generally heard mixed reviews about him, some either adoring them and others just stepping on them. Rarely have I seen any reviews in the median. After seeing this movie, and hearing their music for the first time, I wouldn't have bothered seeing it any other way. This was an absolutely ridiculous film.Not only was the concert itself horribly lame, so was the sluggish documentary. It's nothing that anybody with a true appreciation for music could ever enjoy. They didn't start out in the gutter, and Nick Always had a talent for singing, OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK. The songs were undeniably bad. It's crap like this that is destroying music. So what if tons of people like them? These idiots have insanely SMALL talent, especially compared to the likes of Boston, Chicago, the Doors, Lynryd Skynryd, Rush, Kansas, and pretty much every other band which played GOOD music. All I heard were sappy chords repeated over and over again, while the Jonas Brothers acted like little kids on stage, beaming and jumping all around, FRANTICALLY, and basically acting like boisterous little kids. I didn't hear a single solo, which made all of the songs relatively lacking. However, the singing voices were mostly okay, in the least bit.The 3D itself was incredibly sub-par. Instead of coming to life and popping out of the screen, inevitably making young fans scream in horror, the images remained relatively flat except for the occasional lump and had awkward multi-coloured outlines. It was better than many other movies I have seen though.This movie was mostly atrocious. It doesn't deserve more than a four or five. It's got less quality than a mediocre B-movie, but slightly more than a 50-hour-long experimental film.</fullReview>

And the fact that every single little pubescent girl was slowly aging my ear drums by 20 years per hour felt like heaven. I would recommend this to the deaf or mentally retarded because of its cinematic quality. People in general need to take a rusty ice pick and just grind it against their inner skull to gain the real concert experience of the Jonas Brothers. And... to whomever compared these little fucs to The Beatles needs to honestly die in a sinking car lit with flaming gasoline and motor oil. To EVER compare this sad excuse for talent to one of the single greatest bands ever forged is the single greatest mistake in human history. Furthermore...to make this a 3D movie just reinforces my point. Anyway...I laughed, I cried, and my penis exploded so I feel that if you want to have premature penis explosion/permanent blind + deafness i would strongly suggest this heaping,steamy,bloody,massive pile of animal feces.</fullReview>

I can't wait to see them do more great stuff in the future. I am so excited for their new Disney channel show that is premiering in May. The Jonas Brothers set great examples for the young generation of today in my opinion. It is not right for people to make fun of them for their purity rings or spread rumors about their sexuality. This gossip is no joke and it is in no way funny. I wish that everyone could just see past all of this judgement and realize that the Jonas Brothers are great guys with great musical abilities.It's okay if some people don't like them, but you don't have to purposely put down their movie. that's just rude.:) Darcy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to point out it's very rude for haters to bash these boys. They have done nothing but spread their love through music. It's rude and childish for people to be rating it poorly when they have not seen the movie. The movie, however, was very over advertised. It got annoying after a while but if I had a movie I would be telling everyone to go see it too. I think financially it didn't succeed because of the very bad economy and the high priced tickets. That wasn't very wise on their choice, but maybe that was the best deal they could get. I did enjoy the movie, though. I thought it was very cool (: And since they don't come to my area very often I got to experience the concert again for less money. But, let's face it nothing is the same as a live performance. The movie was just a very fun thing it wasn't really a film, but none the less I liked it. I will not bash on the 'haters' opinions because just like everyone else they are entitled to it. I do find it quite rude though when they start the name calling and what not.I wish them nothing but success on all future projects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie was pretty awesome. I bet more than 3/4's the people that rated this movie low are jelous of the jonas brothers, and or never even saw the movie. I personally am sick of all this anti-jonas crap. If you don't like the jonas brothers then why would you even bother to rate this movie at all? The haters that spend their time trash talking the jonas brothers have no lives and need to grow up BIG TIME. And the sad part is they are all probably like 39 years old and living in their mothers' basements. Other people, who think the jonas brothers have no talent, nobody said you had to love them, but they DO have talent, i know i CANT play multiple instruments and when i sing i kill the braincells of living things close to me. So i do idolize the jonas brothers and believe they have talent. I have been getting off track here... the movie was fun for people of all ages who enjoy the jonas brothers music, i made some friends and the 3d movie was a fun experience for me although i do prefer their concerts&lt;3. And the other day i read a comment on here, somebody starting a rumor, that the jonas brother fake-play their instruments and its all the back-up band... this person obviously never participated in a live chat the jonas brothers have, they play their instruments in these chats when the back-up band is nowhere to be found. thats all i have to say. goodbye.</fullReview>

The 3D movie beat out other movies and came in second that should say something. Yes they had less revenue than the Hannah Montana 3D movie, but she had a show. They didn't, and I think 2nd place is darn good for a not having a show. The movie was a great way for fans to see a Jonas Brothers concert without paying so much. It really made me feel like I was on stage with the guys. I sang the entire time and so was the rest of the audience. Since when did you ever hear a full theater of girls singing along to great songs, girls dancing in the aisles and just having a blast? Jonas Brothers Rock, no matter what you say. Get over it, they're here and they're living the dream!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it is a concert film aimed for preteen and teen girls. Was it Pride and Prejudice? No, but I really enjoyed it. I have been to a couple of their concerts, and didn't have the best seats. It was great too actually see what we were missing. My daughter couldn't stop talking about the little peeks into their lives behind the scenes. If you go expecting it to suck, then it probably will. If you go with an attitude of having fun then you will enjoy yourself. I am a mom of an OJB girl, and I would sit through the 3D concert again in a minute, before I had to sit and have the uncomfortable Watchmen boy bits experience. Take your Jonas fans to see this film. The smile on their face when you leave is totally worth it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was supper fantastic. It was like you were actually there and it was a great experience for people who haven't been to a concert. I thought the boys did a great job and they totally rocked. They are so cute, and I just love them. The rest of you are just hating on them. They sang a lot of good songs, and they also gave you back stage experience which every fan is dying to see. we all know that we would love to be backstage at a Jonas brothers concert! They also introduced their new song which I mean was flawless its become one of my favorites and I cant wait for the release of their new album. I would recommend this movie to anyone and I would go see it a thousand more times. I love it! And the Jonas Brothers :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it ah-mazing !! I have seen my share of 3-D movies , this one was the best so far !! I have seen it twice and will go see it again very soon !! For those trashing it , have you even seen it ? I love the fake Jonas Brothers , Zac Efron , Kelly Clarkson and Papa Jonas .. lol ! I was standing , screaming and singing along , and so was almost everybody else in the theater !! If you haven't seen it yet , I highly recommend it !! It's high energy , funny and musical ! I saw the Hannah Montana 3-D , JUST for Jonas BTW , &amp; I liked this movie better !! It showed a lot of behind the scenes and they preformed most of the songs from the Burnin' Up Tour ( which I went to ) if you didn't go to the Summer Tour , this movie is just as good , or even better because your so close ! It was sooooo AH-MAZING !! Totally worth the line up ! JB FORVER !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sure i might have a bias since i love the jonas brothers, but overall it is a great movie. although sorta short, it was great. for those who were unable to go to an actual concert, it isn't totally the same but it's good enough. you are up close and personal. all the behind the scene shots were great too. it was so funny and exciting. the music of course was soooo good. also, love is on it's way. can you say AMAAAAAZING? i loved it so much. for all of you that saw the movie, be sure to buy the soundtrack of the live songs on itunes or at a store. love is on it's way is on it! yessss! even jonas fans would like it. oh yeah and being 3D was awesome. you really felt like they were there. awesome job. can't wait for summer 2009 jonas brothers tour! rock it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely the best 3D movie I have ever seen!!!!! I believe it wasn't long enough. I would say this was even better than the Miley one. It was full of action and fun! Even if you weren't a Jonas fan you will definitely love this movie. I will most definitely buy the DVD when it comes out.It couldn't have been better. I will see it again. This movie shines true light on young children. If you don't know what to take the kids to see this is definitely on to see. This did not score high enough on the charts. I think the critics also have a harder understanding why teen fans love it so much. This movie does not only have cute guys for girls to love, but music they can enjoy. Why not let your child go see it? This movie should go down in the history books as one of the best movies of all times in children movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why so many people on here want to be haters! If you don't like the Jonas Brothers than why are you on this page that talks about them? It makes no sense. You think just because you don't like them that everyone else shouldn't too but you are oh so wrong! I am a 14 year old girl and the Jonas' truly have inspired me and brought my family closer together! They don't deserve the hate! Their music is wonderful and you may not like it but other people do and you should respect that. The Jonas Brothers could never bring society down. Would you rather have the children/teens of today listening to The Jonas Brothers who relate to them or other people who talk about sex and drugs in every song? I would chose the Jonas Brothers! Why do you hate on them? Is it because you are jealous of their fame or is it cause you don't like their purity rings or have you just never heard them? You may have never been to their concerts but if you were to go you would see that they almost sell out every seat. They are a whole-some family band that people of all ages can look up too. They are great! Everyone in your family can love this band and you NEVER will ever hear them talk about sex or drugs. I just think that if you are going to mess with someone you shouldn't mess with the page that the children and teens are reading because if they read all this negativity then they are going to stop listening to this family friendly band and go to bands/singers that are nothing but about sex and drugs! So LEAVE THE JONAS BROTHERS ALONE!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Experience was pretty much the best experience ever! It makes you feel like your at a real concert, up close &amp; personal with the Jonas Brothers. If you're a huge Jonas fan, this is one event you don't wanna miss out on. I went opening day to see it &amp; I couldn't ask for anything better. I'm definitely proud of Nick, Kevin &amp; Joe. They did such an amazing job. Demi Lovato &amp; Taylor Swift included. This movie should definitely be number one, without a doubt. Forget the Jonas haters. Us Jonas fans are gonna make the movie number. Lets make the Jonas Brothers proud, &amp; let them know that we thank them for everything they do, for making their 3D movie number one! I love the Jonas Brothers&lt;3! -Tori.</fullReview>

Those of you who are not Jonas brothers fans should not be seeing the movie in the first place and there for should not be voting against it. Only true Jonas brothers fans would enjoy this movie I am a true Jonas brothers fan. I loved it my friends loved it This movie made so many little girls happy. That's all that really matters I am 16 years old and I don't care that I am too old to love the Jonas brothers. Anyway, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone that has wanted to go to a Jonas brothers concert and has not had the chance to yet. It makes you feel like you are actually there and have really good seats. Plus, Joe takes his shirt off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As people would see it, the Jonas Brothers 'ruined' the 3-D experience with this movie. I see it completely differently. Even if you don't like the Jonas Brothers, this movie is only another way for their fans to see them living their dream. If you don't like them, stop looking them up, commenting their pages and being annoying, it only shows that you have a slight curiosity on how they are managing their careers. Being a girl of 16, I read a comment posted by a supposed 13 year old, and I am almost positive, that the words that that girl was using were words known only by a person clearly older than 13. People are so obsessed with putting down other people, they don't care how it happens.PS, I LOVE THE JONAS BROTHERS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are saying that this movie was horrible and one of the worst Disney movies ever. Probably half of the people that wrote that was probably a Jonas Brothers Hater! If that is true i think that its horrible to say that their movie sucked just because they don't like them. To my opinion the movie was ah-mazing because their fans such as myself got to see in to their free time and i the best part was when their CD came out and they were i believe Time Square and they were so happy and in disbelief about how much people actually showed up. So i LOVED the movie it was amazing and i have seen it 3 times! Im going to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD! I highly recommend people to see it! I LOVE THE JONAS BROTHERS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just clear up that I'm 19 years old, a sophomore in college, and I was absolutely impressed. Those Jonas Brothers never cease to amaze me. I did go see them on July 9th when they came near me. It was completely amazing. I was basically in the lawn area for most of the show, but I loved it. So, being able to see them up close (at least in 3D) I re-experienced a concert AND then more because of the behind the scenes and all the fan shots. haha, I loved that. The guests featured, Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift, were excellent, also. Demi has this mind-blowing voice. Taylor's part was not included in my concert, so I was really happy to see &amp; hear it. It was really sweet! Basically, whether you went to a show or a few this summer or you didn't, this is Definitely worth your money. I was singing and dancing in my seat! The Jonas Brothers are extremely dedicated to the music and their faith, which makes them superb role models for EVERYONE. They are gentlemen and any haters need to stop hating, step back and perhaps LEARN from them. + their back-up band (Bulldozer) are very cool people and talented as well.This is an incredible movie.. especially to be seen in 3D, where you can really feel as if you're there. There are some really cool effects that were used in filming and just for their concert. I went to see this with 2 of my friends who weren't really fans, but even they were impressed. :) ~Rianna aka *Hermione*</fullReview>

Plus, who doesn't love a little behind the scenes action?! And to show a never before seen song and video was just the icing on the cake. I had so much fun watching them on stage, and I really felt like I was at one of their concerts again! I've seen them live twice, and after watching the movie I can't wait for the next tour so I can see them again! This movie is an absolute must see for all Jonas Brothers fans! And if you aren't already a fan, you will be after watching this 3D movie! I would also recommend picking yourself up a copy of the soundtrack! These boys never cease to amaze me :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the Jonas Brothers ever since 2006 does not make me bias when it comes to any type of movie. I read the other comments given by other viewers and yes they do have their own opinions but once I read "... proof against the existence of God," I cracked. This movie is not the best but it is entertaining. From the fireworks and the orchestra to the screaming fans and the Jonas Brothers themselves, this movie definitely showed me how amazingly constructed the concert was. Sure, the movie was "too short" and it wasn't action packed, but it showed the Jonas Brothers from a whole different perspective. We got up close and personal to each of the young men and got a peak of how hectic their schedule is. Plus, it showed how their faith really is a foundation to their lives. It even showed how humble they are. Even when they're completely tired, they still give their fans everything they've got. I don't understand how watching a concert can show that God is real or not, but I do understand that it isn't the best movie in the world. It is worth watching, but come with an avid spirit. Don't be afraid to let go and dance! Disney made this concert into a movie to give the unfortunate fans, who weren't able to go to the real concert, a chance to watch it, and the 3D effects were to let the fans feel like they're really in the concert. I came in thinking the movie would be a waste of time and money because of the negative comments, but those comments didn't do the movie any justice. I thought it was great! I wanted to jump out of my seat and dance, but instead I danced in my seat and sang like no one was watching.</fullReview>

I love the new song Love is on it's way it is, and their cover of gonna getcha good is better than it's original version by Shania Twain!! these boys can do no wrong!! This is just the beginning, they just announced their world tour, and they have a new album, dropping later this year, and if that's not enough they also have TV show J.O.N.A.S coming out in may.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I took my 13 year old niece to the movie and we sang to the songs and danced in our chairs. It was so much fun! It was really like going to a concert, but with access to the Jonas Brothers on stage, as well. We had to go a second time, even though the cost was $18.00 a ticket, yep, $72.00 total plus snacks. The only thing I did not like is the fact that it was really short for the money I paid. I will buy at least two copies of this when it comes out on DVD. Please, do not rate this movie if you have not seen it. It is very immature and makes it receive a very biased rating. They deserve a fair an honest rating on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I understand a lot of older people on here didn't think it was a good movie but, it definitely doesn't deserve to be the worst movie at the moment. In my opinion it is my favourite movie and saying it is a "disgrace to humanity" is taking it to far. No one made you watch it, you could've left the theater but, everyone that was in the theater didn't give there tickets back. Some even stood up and danced. While I was at the theater last night 3 people came out of Watchman and wanted their money back. Now, that's an amazing movie but, I haven't seen anyone come out of the Jonas Brothers movie wanting their money back.This movie was amazing and brought us behind the scenes, they also performed amazing songs that made you feel like you were there. It was better than the front row (kind of because I mean.. you can't interact with them in a movie theater) I went to see this movie 3 times just to see the drum scene, the girls chasing them, earthquake, and of course the amazing songs in 3D. This may not seem like a big deal but, I like 2 hours away from the closest theater playing it. Every time I went I met so many new friends and even lost my voice from singing along.This movie is for people who like; 1. The Jonas Brothers. 2. Concerts. 3. Enjoying life. 4. Dancing and singing like a fool. :) 5. Not to be like everyone else.Because even though everyone on here is saying the movie sucks and you shouldn't go see it. What matters is if you want to see it! I guarantee these comments aren't going to affect if you watch the movie. So, to all the people writing "hate" comments.. you're just wasting your time because some people actually love the Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Experience.</fullReview>

It would be seen as a bad thing if us Jonas fans were to all vote badly on some other band which aren't 'our cups of tea'.I haven't seen this movie yet as its all in the US and what not but surely, the Jonas hate shouldn't bring this film down because I've seen videos of Jonas brothers live, they sing great songs, do it will, are grounded lads who do what they love and do it well... surely, if you want to give credit to a band.. what else can you give them credit for??Jonas and Taylor swift?!?! even better to be honestxxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that the movie was simply great. it was fun experience especially for those who cannot attend concerts for certain reasons. Yes of course a a movie is nothing compared to the energy and emotions you feel at a real concert but i enjoy it nonetheless. For the the most part I think that the Jonas Brothers are very talented especially Nick. Great vocals and all of them are great performers in general. Yes they are teens and into pop but they have talent. They also have incredible song writing ability that strengthen them and show their uniqueness and individuality. They deserve more credit than they are given, if you don't like them just ignore them. thanksss ~Gisell~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The jonas brothers movie was the best and if you don't think so then you don't know music or your going to a movie thats not for you. the jonas brothers movie is for fans so if your not a fan you shouldn't talk about the movie being bad because the movie was THE BEST MOVIE EVER. I love the jonas brothers and i hate all the comments and ratings this movie is getting because it isant a bad movie yes it costs a lot of money to go see but all four times i went i was up and dancing and clapping and singing so i know for a fact that this movie wasn't bad. This movie is also not just for kids or teens because my mom and my grandma went and they both said they enjoyed it so jonas brothers haters stop hating and open your ears to the amazing music these 3 boys make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This actually was a good movie. I bet you that everyone that posted a review of this hasn't even seen it. Which means the people that actually like this don't care that you 'hated' a movie you haven't even seen. This movie is for the FANS which means people who don't like them shouldn't see it or make false comments/ratings about it. The 3D effects were nice and they are overall pretty good singers. Also, all the behind the scenes parts of the movie were cool too, especially the first part. I know that everyone who actually likes the Jonas Brothers will have a pleasant experience at the movie. The boys really did a good job on this movie and it deserves a lot more credit than it has been given. If any parents decide to take their children to this movie they will be greatly surprised because it really is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw them in concert over the summer and this just brought back so many good memories. The Jonas Brothers are a great group. They do a lot of things that earn my respect. They don't deserve half the rep they get. Unfortunately Disney gives it to them. However they make themselves look good. This is one of the ways. They do as much as they can for they're fans. This is a good movie to see because they have great song writing talents and a good beat to match. I know people who don't really like them but still went to a concert and ended up dancing the whole night. It is a memorable experience and this movie shows it. It's an all ages kind of deal. Kids, teens, adults, heck grandparents could find this enjoyable. So I say go see it and your money wont be wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jonas Brothers are AWESOME! !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jonas Brothers play a big role in my life. Not because they are "hot" but because of their music, personalities, and Genuality. I've never met them but by watching them on television and YouTube they won me over. I have been a dedicated fan since around late 2005/early 2006 and I have been to 2 of their concerts! My first JB concert was on July 14th 2008 and my second was on November 30th 2008! Yes, you would probably see me camping out on the street for days just to see them or finding any impossible way to get closer to them! People often ask me "what if the Jonas brothers were here?" and my answer to them is I have no idea! and that is the truth, i would like to know the answer. People also tell me they are "gay" and ask me why i like them so much but there is no answer, if u don't understand then you probably never will. its a JB thing! I have Obsessive Jonas DIsorder OJD and there is no cure for it but I'm loving it! I am part of TEAM JONAS and i am loving it!! In the future people will talk about the Jonas Brothers. They'll talk about them like we talk about the Beatles, Hanson and N'SYNC. They'll talk about the records they made. They'll talk about the sold out concerts. They'll talk about their style and stand out hair. They'll talk about the adoring fans who waited hours for just a glimpse of our favorite boys. But they'll never talk about, and people will never understand how Nick's battle with diabetes inspired millions. How even though he's the one with diabetes, he did the most on stage. They won't understand his genuine love of music and how he was born to play. They'll never talk about how Joe could light up a room with his lame jokes. How his MIC tricks could pone anyone else's any day. They won't understand how he could get packed arenas and stadiums to move together as one. They won't talk about how Kevin's guitar skills made millions want to learn to play. How his S.O.S dance became a legend. They won't ever understand how his energy level never went down. They'll never know that when he did a super fast spin while still playing the whole crowd held their breaths. People will never understand that Jonas Brothers YouTube videos never got old, how you could be in the worst mood but they'll make you laugh. They won't get the joy you feel and the tears that fall when you go to your first concert. They won't understand that campfire is something every fan dreams of being a part of. They won't understand how the Jonas Brothers gave us something to believe in each and everyday. How they made us better people. They won't know that we love the Jonas Brothers, but we love Nick, Joe, and Kevin more, just as people. They'll never talk about how much the Jonas Brothers meant to us. But we do. The fans of today, we know it all!! i love the Jonas Brothers!!!! You say LoveSong, I say Love Bug You say Take a Bow, I say Take a Breath You say 4 Minutes, I say 6 Minutes You say 4:12, I say 7:05 You say Hey There Delilah, I say Hello Beautiful You say Move Along, I say Move On You say 'in a bit', I say A Little Bit Longer You say 'one sec', I say Hold On You say 'help', I say SOS You say 'BFF', I say Just Friends You say 'tomorrow', I say Tonight You say I'm stuck in the past, I say We're the Kids of the Future You say I'm obsessed, I say I'm in love You say JB suck, I say you're wrong You say I'm crazy, I say I am What I am! You ask me 'Why do you love the Jonas Brothers? Cause that's just the way I roll</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely incredible! I had more fun than I've had in a long time watching this movie as did every single other person in the theatre! Everyone was dancing and clapping and singing when, during the concert, the Jonas Brothers had asked the fans to sing along too! It was incredible! To all the people on here saying it's "The end of society" and all that crap about Jonas fans being little 12 year old girls..I'm 17. My friend I went with is 16. And her sister who also went with us is 20. We're not little tween girls who don't know what we're talking about and only love a band for their "pretty faces." When I listen to their CD, I don't see their face...so please explain to me how that would in any way influence my decision about liking a band. Honestly? I think "the downfall of society" is shown in that people who don't even take the time to check something out are tearing it and all it's fans down. You are acting more immature than the fans are. At least we spend our time building something up instead of tearing it down. It was a fun movie that made people smile..what is wrong with that? I like other bands, bands that would be considered "real" bands to all the haters. It's not like JB is the only band I like. And I dislike quite a few bands and people..but I don't tear them down and I don't insult people for liking them. These boys have morals and principles and I'd choose that over some guy singing about doing drugs and having sex and getting AIDS and getting girls drunk in order to sleep with them any day. I'd rather be happy then hear about all the crap in our world through my music any day. And if you don't like that, fine. But you're not going to change anybody's mind. So, all you're doing is wasting your time if you're here to tear them down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Loved The Jonas Brothers And Their Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this was just like the actual concert. I went on the Burnin Up tour and it love how the movie was exactly like the concert. I danced and sang along to every single song that was performed. The movie was awesome, the Jonas Brothers were sexy and ah i loved it. I don't know why anyone would go see it if they didn't like the Jonas brothers in the first place so they are stupid for watching something they knew they wouldn't like and then writing a bad review. I loved the Jonas Brothers so much that my friends and i even made shirts for this event. It was awesome, Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato couldn't do any better. I knew their songs too. ah I did not sit down once and I loved the entire thing! i came in the theater with cute curls and left with frizz crazy straight hair :) Go watch the Jonas Brothers: The 3D concert Experience. it even has behind the scene shots, also a new song! be excited too :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone can actually answer this question i'll be amazed. Why do that haters waste their time commenting on this movie? Why would the lady above tell her story to the world about losing her baby and her husband this has nothing to do with the ratings of this movie. The Jonas Brothers don't want to hear about all your negative commenting they want positive feedback so they can get better. Personally i thougth it was amazing and a perfect way to bring a concert to fans that weren't able to see them live. Fortunatly i got to see them live three times and nothing compares to them. The movie is good but the live concerts are amazing and unbelievable. The fans would rather not read the rude comments (boys) so just think before you do it because Jonas fans are capable of anything =)</fullReview>

If U don't like them, than don't comment or write mean reviews, besides i personal think that U even know it's a waste of Ur time and energy. So Save it !! The Movie was amazing, and it was even more incredible because it was in 3D, which is always a fun experience! The Jonas Brothers were hilarious and totally adorable as always ! I loved every minute of the movie !! Me and my two cousins, went to see it and we were yelling and screaming as if we were at a real concert !! I was almost Hyperventilating from how exited i was!! My cousins are 19 and 20, so that also shows that the Jonas brothers don't only have fans that are 10 and down! I'm 15 and I'm obsessed!! And so is my cousin Ruth ( 20 ) !! And my other cousin Sarah ( 19 ) isn't an obsessed fan and she LOVED it as well !! I think that even if U don't have OJD ( for those of U who don't know what that means, It's Obsessive Jonas Disorder ) U should go see it and take as many people with U as possible !! BUY 20 TICKETS !!!! Or as many as U can .... 20 would be nice though ... Please Support The Jonas Brothers !!!</fullReview>

I couldn't sit in my seat, I had to get up and sing and dance along, just like a real concert. I sometimes forgot it was a movie and reached out and tried to grab them, hehe. I didn't think the movie would be this good, but it was AMAZING! They play a mix of older songs and newer songs. They show you stuff that hasn't been seen before.Ps.Don't let other bad comments make you not want to go see this movie. t really is a good movie. For younger fans and older fans.

Then, the scene for he new song Love Is On It's Way was beautiful! Plus, the 3D effects were awesome! When the picks fly at you, that was cool, but when the pigeons fly at you, I ducked!

You could be planting a tree, studying, reading a book, working at a soup kitchen. It bothers me that so many people don't take free time to work on something good. So the Jonases may not be the most talented group in the world, but they are definitely more talented than some other boy bands that have been around. And plus, I can already tell that most of the people who have rated this movie are Men between the ages of 11 and 45. Just face it, the JBs are actually kind of cute, but there are other cute guys out there too. My question is why not attack Johnny Depp? Sorry, just kidding.</fullReview>

This movie was made for the fans- thats what i have been saying They are not saying hey we want the whole world to come see our movie- they are not counting the ticket sales- what they were doing was visiting fans across the country and making them happy.The boys love their fans a lot and they try to meet as many of us as they can. They have great hearts, Have you not seen that they donate money to charities, they meet fans- from the healthiest to the most ill.I have seen non-Jonas fans write nice things about the guys because that story of the 9 year old girl with weeks to live touched their hearts and gave them a different feeling towards the Jonas brothersStop rating this film so low if u haven't even seen it- if u are not a fan. I mean why are there 30+ year olds rating this movie- Have you even watched it???? I mean besides the parents of fans which i am sure approve of the boys and this movie.Why don't you get a life and stop wasting your time and ours.This movie is great.especially for us the fans which if u haven't seen the commercials and interviews for it- This movie is made for the fans. its not just some ordinary movie that is made for the general public- this one is designed for fans so we can see a glimpse of what their life is like- and so we can have a concert experience even those who don't have enough money to go to an actual Jonas concert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so awesome. It really makes you feel like you're at a concert. It pisses me off that people call the Jonas Brothers a 'boy band'. Backstreet Boys &amp; n*sync were all gay and didn't write their own music &amp; didn't even play dang instruments. That is the exact opposite with the Jonas Brothers. Wow, sweet if you don't like them how about you support the bands you like instead of acting like fools. Seriously, all you haters go find yourself a girlfriend and do something better with your lives. Kay? Thanks. If you were thinking about seeing this movie, do it. You will not regret it. My mom had a good time even. Also, it's not just the Jonas Brothers, it's Demi Lovato &amp; Taylor Swift!! If you're still not convinced, the 3D graphics are sweet!This movie rocks, no matter what the stupid haters say. It's not like they saw the movie, they're just writing bad reviews to make us mad. Oh &amp; a bonus...Joe &amp; Kevin take their shirts off, so beware for major hotness :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are Wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, YOU'RE forgetting a few things. The Jonas Brothers DO have great music. They write their own music, they sing great, and they play great instruments. And they're still only 16, 19, and 21! You can't expect them to be like Stevie Wonder at those ages. And the reason they're in Disney is because they love it there. They don't want to target the older audience because all the older audience cares about is (excuse my language) bad-ass rock-stars. They're trying to teach the younger audience to not be like that. Even then, they still get teenage and some adult fans. Everyone who thinks only kids who are 6-11 years old likes them, you're wrong. I'm almost 14 and most fans are around 16-19. Some fans are even in their mid-twenties or thirties (though not as much.) Those fans don't care about (excuse my language again) bad-ass rock-stars. They want real singers who are great people and role models to their kids, and that's what the Jonas Brothers are. So next time you think of hating people and giving them bad reviews just because they're nice and choose to be in Disney (which is almost prejudice) you might not want to let me see those comments (which is pretty much impossible because I eventually look at every website that mentions their names.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me say that if your a older parent or person you might not enjoy the movie like young teen girls. But seriously if you don't like the jonas brothers or listen to their music then don't bother seeing the movie. Thats why its a CONCERT experience. I hate jonas haters. They don't know anything about them. They don't take the time to listen to them or watch there videos. The Jonas Brothers are successful in what they do and evidently there doing something right according to how there album did.When you INTENTIONALLY rate this movie one star your not only stooping down to an immature level your showing that this is what you haters have to do because you know that if you didn't rate it 1 then it would be at the top. But its OK because at the end of the day the jonas brothers know they have true and real fans. In my whole life have i seen some really mean and rude people. People its JUST a movie. Get over it. But nonetheless, the movie was really amazing if your a fan of them. I lost my voice from screaming [:</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I went opening day along with four of my friends! We had a blast and met other teenagers there who we immediately clicked with! (Jonas Brothers have the nicest fans!) And yes, teenagers. I don't know why all you think that only little kids like them when I am considered a younger fan (16) amongst all the fans. Seriously, I know plenty of people in their 20s who are just as obsessed with them as I am. Well, almost as obsessed.. :DThe movie was awesome! Seeing it in 3D was certainly a treat! From the guitar picks and sunglasses being thrown at you to Kevin pointing and Joe smiling at you. Not to mention, a brief moment you see them shirtless. Are they buff! :D (Haters probably say they use steroids. ;) Nicest fans. Most hateful haters. I loved all the sequences where it showed them just hangin'! They are so funny and really a nice family it seems. The songs are even more fun to hear live! Everyone in the theater got up and danced! So many girls ran to the front during it and just jammed out! The room was echoing loudly. With every lyrics the Jonas brothers sang, the fans sang louder. (but not as well)The only thing I was disappointed about was that they didn't play Lovebug or A Little Bit Longer on it. Oh well. The still played so many other hits. When they started playing S.O.S was when the theater seemed most electrified! Screaming when ever they showed their faces, sang so sweetly, played their drums with all their heart, or did their acrobats. I am a proud Jonas fan. :) This movie gave me so much joy and I had so much fun! If you are even remotely interested in seeing it because you like them (not because you wanna make fun of it.) then go! :) You won't regret. Totally worth 15 bucks! Will see it again for sure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was seriously incredible!!! All of the haters out there need to just chill out, because everything about this movie was done so well. The boys were so energetic in it, the camera angles and views were amazing, the 3d really made you feel like you were right on stage, and the behind-the-scenes footage was really cool to see!! My friends and i had so much fun dancing, laughing, and singing along the whole time!! The new song "love is on its way" is beautiful, and you really get a glimpse as to who these three amazing boys really are. It truly was an experience!! Im going to see it again tomorrow...GO SEE JONAS BROTHERS 3D EXPERIENCE!!! You won't regret it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about three of the most talented gentlemen in pop culture today. Watching these boys from their very early days at small clubs... I cannot say how proud I am. I always knew that they were destined for stardom. It blows me away to see how much they have achieved within such a short time. Do not listen to anyone else. These boys have unfairly been given a bad reputation. Rolling Stone adores the boys. Who do you want to listen to? One of the most respected music magazines in the world...or some teenage boys jealous of the brother's popularity and ability of earning millions of girls affection?Go to a concert. Pick up an album. Watch this movie. LEARN about these gentlemen. Do not judge them by their fanbase, and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im a 16 year old girl and yes i love the Jonas Brothers.I am not an intensely hardcore fan but i really do love them very much. It really makes me sad that just because their movie only made 12.7 the first weekend people are making fun of them and calling them talentless. The movie was AMAZING!! The 3d alone made it awesome plus from a fan who hasn't seen them in concert i loved every minute of it! It really hurts me to think that they are being ridiculed and called talentless. These boys do have talent! They had fans before Disney found them and just because they are with Disney doesn't make them any less real artist. They were playing music way before Disney came into the picture so don't put them down and call them fake Disney produced music because they are REAL ARTIST. This movie showcases their talents and any true fan will agree with me. I saw the movie, i bought the soundtrack and i will by the the DVD. We love you Jonas boys, don't let the haters get you down. :)</fullReview>

I love the jonas brothers and i believe the jonas brothers will never fail i will always love them and be there number 1 fan forever. Lighten up people they are very good in the music industry and if you don't see it then something is wrong with you. since i am a teenager i can prove that its not just me that likes them. My Mom is a fan of them. My grandma is a fan of them. My step mom is a fan of them. So here you see adults can be fans of these boys as well and i just want to say i love the 3D movie i saw it four times and im not done it had great backstage scenes and the music/concert thing was awesome. I LOVE THE JONAS BROTHERS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why people are giving this so many bad reviews. what did you expect when you went to see the movie? some other band would show up on stage? its a concert, and it shows you what a Jonas brothers concert is like and what goes on back stage. if you don't like the Jonas brothers, why would you go see a movie all about them on tour? just like if you hate U2, why would you have watched their 3d concert movie.i liked how they showed you more than just the concert, you saw what their life is like, especially in new york with the fans. i loved how they had demi lovato and Taylor swift. even if you don't like the Jonas brothers you do have to give them respect for writing their own music.if you Don't like the Jonas brothers, then maybe this isn't the one for you but if you even think you enjoy them, after watching this, you will like them even more. they look and sound even better in 3D its worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all of you haters, just shut up! Gosh! It's really annoying! If you don't like The Jonas Brothers that is just fine! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion!! But please just stop going mad over this and wasting time on it!! God! Get a life and don't spend it going on websites just so you can talk more crap about The Jonas Brothers! No one ever said that you have to love them! And it's not like JB fans listen just to JB! I mean some do, but it's not all we listen to! We love other bands as well! Probably even some of the same bands you love! So don't talk down to people and try to make people feel bad about themselves because they enjoy and happen to really love The Jonas Brothers! Especially 12 year old girls! They already have enough self esteem issues without you making them feel small and dumb for thinking that The Jonas Brothers are cool! That's really just plain mean,immature and stupid! Honestly, calm the heck down and get a LIFE!! "All We Need Is Love"-The Beatles</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. Not only is the 3d amazing, but the concert makes you feel like you're really on stage with the Jonas Brothers. It is super high energy from beginning to end. It showcases the boy's humor and them as a family. They have tons of things fly at you in the film too because they filmed it knowing it was going to be in 3d. The behind the scenes stuff rocks and so does the new song. its the only 3d music video I've ever seen. I definitely recommend this movie. It is great for the entire family and for any fan of the Jonas Brothers &lt;3 this movie is awesome and you should go see it because it is an experience you will never forget, I promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's quite pathetic how people spend their lives, wanting to put others down. If you haven't noticed, there's currently no other fan base compared to the Jonas Brothers. You don't have to like them, but in all honesty. Is it necessary for you to complain what a waste it was? If you thought this movie was so "horrendous", it was absolutely, one-hundred percent your fault for "wasting" your fifteen dollars to see it. YOU didn't have to sit through it. That was YOUR decision.The reason America is failing ISN'T because of the Jonas Brothers, it's the cold-hearted critics in whose opinions DO NOT matter. Because remember, they are the somebody, and you, are the nobody.</fullReview>

Jonas Brothers, are very good influences for a lot of people, so what if the haters hate them thats their problem. JB has excellent lyrics and they have a lot of acceptable believe's. i honestly say i'm a big Jonas Brothers fan and i'm going to see them in concert June 20th. their a fantastic, young group. and this movie has a good vibe, i enjoyed it. =D. After Taylor Swift came out, and Sang "Should've Said No." with Joe Jonas, i was blew away! such a great song. And Demi Lovato, Her voice is very classy for her. I'm positive when Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience is out on DVD, For sure i'm gonna buy it! the movie is worth every cent it cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're a pathetic excuse for a hater.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, a lot of these hate comments have just gone too far. To criticize a movie is one thing, while just plain hating on it is another. This film was obviously made for Jonas Brothers' fans, so most Jonas fans would know things like they are brothers (refering to an earlier comment), so those little tidbits of basic facts would just be a waste of time and film. I understand everyone has their own opinion, but if you know you don't like their music, why would you purposely go see their CONCERT movie? I really doubt "3D" changes music tastes.Furthermore, the fact that some people are just plain bashing them is unjustifiable. Knowing most haters, they are usually bias and have no idea what the Jonas Brothers have done or where they came from. Just to elucidate a little: unlike most Disney acts, they did not become a band with Disney, they were performers and entertainers long before Disney came along. They were even on multiple Broadway shows; I highly doubt that talentless people could be on the ever prestigious Broadway. Not to mention, after reading a lot of the negative comments, I have found that most of them are truly disturbing, disgusting and superfluous. Many of them does not pertain to the movie at all! At the end of the day, your hate comments are futile; they will keep moving on and their fans will be fans. I wish them all the best.P.S. A LOT of their fans are actually older than 12 and didn't find out about them on the Disney channel. I, for one, do not even have the Disney channel and I am, clearly, over the age of 12.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to make it very clear that the Jonas Brothers 3D movie was about the best movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I have no idea how sales are so so so low? It was 10x better than the Hannah Montana movie and provided me with a very very concert like experience. The music was fabulous, the boy's acted well, and the crowd reaction was absolutely insane. I'm 16 years old and proud to say I am a Jonas fan. I have seen it 3 times and danced and sang all three times, not sitting for a second. I hope that people realize what great musicians JB are and that they are also great role model. Don't hate, we all know Disney sucks. But the Jonas Boys: No. They are amazing :) Please vote 10 stars. They are helping me fight depression better than anyone I know.</fullReview>

There were parts where Joe would just point out and it felt like he was right there and I could touch him! OH AND THEY ALL TAKE OFF THEIR SHIRTS BACKSTAGE! Its AMAZING! It was so good, for all you Jonas Brothers fans you need to go watch it. Seriously, its worth the money! I was singing to every song and I really wanted to dance in my seat.

I'm a huge fan of Demi and she rocked "This Is Me". I hope they do another one during their next tour! I drove two hours to go to a midnight showing and it was so worth it. These boys work so hard and they really try to put on an amazing show for their fans. Every single night. And it really shows in this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not just another Jonas Brothers fan, I actually truly do love them. I believe that if you don't like The Jonas Brothers, you shouldn't be going on leaving comments about them, here and anywhere. Nobody should rate this movie if you haven't watched it, especially if you don't like them. Your comments will do no harm to anyone it will just waste your time, like it or not there's true Jonas Brothers fans out there that feel the same way i do. Yes most of you are disagreeing with me right now, just like I'm disagreeing with your words and actions. You might see the Jonas Brothers as just another musical group, but a lot of teens including me, don't see it like that. We look up to them, they inspire us, and the're music is amazing. A lot of people don't like them because of their music, people have different taste. But your comments aren't changing anything, so stop wasting your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. I saw it twice opening weekend, and would have gone 100 more times if I could. It was just like being at a concert, and even showed us some behind the scenes. The Jonas Brothers are awesome guys with so much talent. Their parents have done a great job raising these three boys. They respect girls, their parents, and most importantly God. I only wish there were more guys like this in the world. Unfortunately I know that will not happen. But as the Jonas Brothers sing "where would we be if we couldn't dream?".I wish I could give them more than ten stars, but I guess ten stars will have to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST Movie I Have EVER Seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the haters need to chill out there! The Jonas Brothers are my idols and these haters need to get a life. If you seriously have nothing better to do than criticize some of the most respectable and talented gentleman of today, then here's an idea: Go comment on a movie you actually like. I'm here because I love these boys, they have great music in my opinion, and they do great things. Go watch their video of them with Jayla Cooper, the 9 year old girl who just had her wildest dreams come true. These boys are such inspirational people, and someone you could benefit from looking up to. You may see them as a rock group that attracts young girls into mindless obsessed zombies, but I see them as something totally different. I see them as perfect gentleman with a good background, great values, and amazing beliefs. Not once have they turned up for drugs, alcohol, abuse, or anything for that matter. Think of how many times your idol has gotten in trouble. Multiply that by zero and that is how many times these boys have been in trouble. They are the sweetest people on earth and deserve every bit of success they have earned in life. They will go far and go there with the love and support of all their fans behind them. I am one of those proud fans and will be there with them through everything. As said in the Barbara Walters interview, "Our fans are different, and they will be there with us for everything." (By the way, I now HATE Barbara Walters for what she did to them) This movie was a great and inexpensive (compared to concert tickets) way to get up close to the boys and feel like you were there. I know I was definitely singing along and dancing (I did Kevin's SOS dance for the whole theater!) and having a great time! I will definitely be purchasing this on DVD and watching it for a long time. These gentleman are my life, and I love them with all my heart. So please don't say mean things about them, or this movie, because it just makes you look horrible. Seriously. Peace, Love, and Jonas - Marissa</fullReview>

I really don't think that should go unrecognized.Every time i saw this movie, it got me and everyone i went with up dancing all around the theater, and singing along to all of the songs.And it's a good movie for people of all ages. They have fans from the age of five to ninety-five.

		<fullReview>This concert movie was awesome, and it doesn't deserve the insane reviews that it is getting. Of course if you hate JB you won't like it, so don't waste time writing unfair reviews.This movie was great for the target audience, for the mission it sent out, and it was all around a good movie. I would have preferred a little more behind the scenes about the tour, as in vein with the Hannah Montana film, but I loved the behind the scenes of their promo weeks and working all the same.Jonas Brothers sounded great, Demi Lovato was awesome, and Taylor Swift was as well. I don't think these young stars deserve the bad reputation for their careers or movie because people just don't like them.Dislike what you dislike, but this movie doesn't deserve to suffer because of someone's inability to keep in their bad thoughts in a constructive way. The Jonas Brothers movie included an awesome set list of their hits, and any Disney fan, Jonas Fan, or someone looking for a fun concert movie would love this movie. Yes it isn't movie of the year, it's just a concert movie, but it was awesome for what it set out to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just going to say that i love the Jonas brothers and i loved this movie... If you didn't like the movie fine, then why talk about it.. move on to something you DID like, i mean if you haven't even seen the movie and rate it, thats dumb. Or if you don't like them and did see their movie, thats even worse. Personally i'm sick of people who say they don't like them, then talk about them.. if you don't like them why are you wasting your own time talking about it ! MOVE ON AND GET OVER IT !!!! Maybe you would have more fun rating movies that you DO like and stop "hating" because your only wasting your own time. BYE HATERS, have fun !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of these people who are making fun of the Jonas Brothers 3D movie you are extremely pathetic. You are making fun of a movie that you probably have not even seen and are wasting your time criticizing it because you obviously have no lives and are obsessing over something you totally hate for no apparent reason. Why can't you just let people enjoy the movie and their music? Why do you care at all? Go see your own movies and listen to your own music an just leave us Jonas Brothers fans alone. Im sure you would be infuriated if someone was doing this about one of your beloved bands and if you do not have at least one band that you thoroughly enjoy and feel compassionate about I feel bad for you because if your not listening to music, especially music that you think is great then you are missing out on a lot of things in the world and probably have a very boring life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. I don't know why people are giving it a bad rating. Apparently haters have nothing better to do with their time. The movie made you feel like you were actually at the concert. The performances and backstage clips were really good. I think that the whole 3D aspect was really cool because stuff was flying at you the entire time almost everything was in 3D. Most people who are saying it isn't worth seeing and that it was terrible most likely didn't even see the movie; they just don't like the band and have nothing better to do. The new song, "Love Is On It's Way" is a really cute music video. It is a movie that people of all ages will enjoy. I recommend going to see this movie.</fullReview>

If you hate the Jonas Brothers so much, why;d you go and see it!?!?!? this movie is amazing. and the only reason you people don't appreciate it is cause you're not a fan.i think it was great that they made this movie cause there are so many people that either couldn't get tickets to the Burnin' Up Tour or had nosebleed seats and couldn't even see(me). Not everyone can be front row. So this movie makes you feel front row. Its awesome that you get to see some behind the scenes of the tour. and on top of that one of the most amazing concerts ever. The concert itself is and was truly spectacular. If i could give it a 10 billion i would. Look at the movie through the eyes of someone that dedicates their life to the Jonas Brothers and absolutely loves them. The Jonas Brothers are amazing people and don't deserve sites like this trashing their movie.so basically, what I'm trying to say is...stop hating on the Jonas brothers cause you have absolutely no reason to! and get lives. do other things with your lives than sitting here banding together to make the Jonas brothers movie rated the worst when it was really the best.i bet half of you didn't even see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, well, let me start out by saying that the majority of people on here giving this movie horrible reviews are definitely NOT fans of the Jonas Brothers. They are considered to be "haters" who assume that the Jonas Brothers are "just another boy band" and "don't deserve all this fame and fortune". I do believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so let me state mine.I'm 15 years old, and these three boys happen to be my world. To me, they are so much more than just a band. They're my role models, heroes, idols, and when I listen to their music, it feels as though everything is okay. If people would take a minute and listen to the lyrics of their songs, interviews that they were on, anything; I do believe that they would have a lot more respect for them. They are the sweetest boys I have ever seen. They are so incredibly humble, loving to their family and friends, caring towards women, and amazingly talented. This movie basically shows you how the boys possess these qualities towards one another and their fans.My favorite parts of the movie are when they show you a daily life in the shoes of the Jonas Brothers. It's absolutely amazing how dedicated they are to their careers, and how dedicated the fans are. It also gives you a look on how humorous the boys are. From waking up in their hotel room to the shirtless clip, all the behind the scene parts were incredible.These boys are SO talented, and I'm sorry that some people can't realize that. Joe's angelic voice, Nick's talent on the guitar and drums, and Kevin's dedication to his guitar really show on the concert part of this movie. It was amazing to see the boys show off their talent in 3D.Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift were also incredible in the movie. They are both such talented girls and they really shine through in this movie.Again, I don't have any problem with people stating their opinions. We all have one. But if you haven't even seen the movie or if you're pretending to be a 12 year old girl giving the movie bad reviews and writing words like "systematically" and "egotistical", which makes it slightly obvious that you are NOT 12, seriously, get a life.

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent! It is the best 3D movie I have seen in my life--actually it is the best movie I have ever seen! It is hard to think of a movie that tops this one. Every song is extremely well-performed by the Jonas Brothers, and their special guests in the film, Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift. The backstage scenes are great as well, truly leaving fans with a taste of the Jonas Brothers' lives. It is hilarious from start to finish. No matter what your age, I recommend seeing this movie. You will love every minute of it, and you will not be bored--not even for one second. And the new song is spectacular! The scene with the new song was one of my favorites from the entire movie. I can talk for days about every great aspect of the movie (all of it), so see it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now a lot of you think that the Jonas Brothers aren't good singers and didn't work hard to get to where they are. And thats a good reason to not like someone? Just because there fame might have came easier for them then others doesn't mean that they should be hated. The Jonas Brothers are good wholesome kids. They stick to there morals UNLIKE some of the bands that have worked "hard" to get where they are. If there so terrible why are they so popular? I do realize Disney stars become famous over night but is that there fault? For all you young aspiring singers and actors out there, if Disney came and said they would give you a record deal or your own show you would do it. Simply because your going to do what you LOVE. Which is what the Jonas Brothers are doing everyday of there amazing lives. So quit the hating. There wonderful boys and don't deserve the criticism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jonas Brothers put this movie out for the fans. They haven't been able to go out on tour, because they are experiencing amazing opportunities in their careers, which they should be experiencing. Since they couldn't go out on tour and visit everyone, they figured out a way in which they could, which was this movie. They brought a show to theaters all across the country.Tickets to any concert these days run from $30-$100+. The tickets to this show were $15 in most cases. This allowed the less fortunate people who have never been able to attend a show, the opportunity to.I saw the Burnin' Up Tour 3 times in person, and i have to say, that the movie was better than any of those shows. I actually got to enjoy myself rather than standing on my tippy toes just to see their head.People need to realize, that the Jonas Brothers are here for good. They're not going anywhere, so you might as well stop trying to make them.&lt;3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family, ages 65 to 5, loved this movie. In fact we saw it more than once. We liked the music. We liked the behind the scenes sequences as well. Of course it wasn't as good as seeing them live. But the movie sure let us see more details than when we saw them live. Yes a longer film would have been even better. We would have loved more songs. And, more behind the scenes would have been more satisfying as well. However what was presented showed how talented and entertaining they really are. The 3-D part of the film was great as well. It was sooo much better than the last concert movie we saw and weren't impressed with. I would think that any family who wants a clean, entertaining, fun movie would see this. And any fan who saw the concert live would want to see it again this way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>now i must say I'm a bit older then the guys typical fanbase(23 to be exact) and i get a lot of grief for being a fan of them but i loved this movie. i just recently( like a few months ago) became fans of the Jonas brothers and i must say i'm hooked. between their show on Disney, their acting in Camp Rock, and now this movie i think ill be a fan for a while. for these guys to start their music so young is an inspiration. i wish i could do what they do. for people who say they r not musicians i would like to see you play the way they do....at that age. Kevin, Joe, and Nick all play instruments and some more then one. they perform with so much energy u cant help but get up and dance or sing along to the songs. i have a foster brother who is about 20 months old and even he likes them. i just got this movie tonight and wanted to check out how the 3D graphics were seeing as i have never seen one before, and all i could see was him sitting in his high chair dancing and singing to the songs(well in his own baby talk i guess). i love the goofiness of Joe, the talent of Kevin and the drive of Nick. i have to say i'm glad i didn't see it in theaters cause i like my hearing a lot and watching it at home is much better. with the 3D you really get into it and i did feel like i was there(not just cause i have a 72 inch TV in my house). it was all in all a great experience for me and i will watch it often,i also have a lot of their songs on my ipod and have been listening to that non stop since i put the songs on. so to all the people bashing them or talking mean about them i would say you are their number one fans because you always have them on your mind. I LOVE YOU JONAS BROTHERS KEEP UP YOUR AMAZING TALENTS-"live life like your at the bottom even though your at the top"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most of the reviews about this movie on IMDb, I loved it. Of course, if you don't like the Jonas Brothers, you aren't going to appreciate the film. But fans of the boys will love it. It's like you are really there, experiencing the concert and feeling every emotion. When I saw the movie, I laughed, sung along and was overwhelmed by the amount of emotions I felt whilst watching it. The 3D element adds another level to the experience, with genuine shock moments that made me laugh and gasp at the same time. The movie is not worth the harsh reviews it has been getting, it is an insight into the boys lives. Even though some of it is scripted, it is a laugh-a-minute journey through their crazy lives. There is a lot of backstage footage which Jonas fans will love, and the on-stage footage proves just how good they are on the stage performing. I'm going to see them live in concert later in the year, and this has made me look forward to it even more. They truly are great musicians, writers and performers, and I couldn't praise them enough for the positive messages they send out to fans. The harsh reviews I have read about the film are not a true representation of just how exhilarating and fun-filled the film is. You need to watch the movie to fully experience the 3D Concert in all its amazing glory. I couldn't recommend seeing the film enough. Well done boys on all your hard work. Your true fans really appreciate it. 10/10.</fullReview>

Leave them alone and don't hate just cuz you'll never be like them and you probably don't have a job either. if you do, you probably make like $2-$3 an hour or sum crap like that and they make MILLIONS and they don't let it go to their heads at all.

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie! I am a big Jonas Brothers fan, and I went with two of my friends and we laughed and sang (and danced, however we got some strange looks). It does exactly what it promised - letting the fans get closer to the band, and see what life is like for them backstage and outside the concert. The 3D part was very realistic, and I found myself flinching at some parts when things were flying towards me. It really felt like you were in the concert with the brothers, and experiencing it, like the title suggests.And to finish, I would just like to speak out to all those who have done bad reviews and who are not Jonas Brothers fans. This movie was made for the FANS. It was not supposed to be the next award winning hit that everybody enjoyed. If you don't like the Jonas Brothers, then of course it is pretty likely you aren't going to like the movie because it is about them! This movie had exactly what it said it would, which was not, as some people seemed to be expecting, an amazing plot and storyline and to be enjoyed by everyone. If you don't like the band, don't see the movie for goodness sake, because you know you won't enjoy it! It was a movie purely for the fans to see the other side of the brothers' life and to experience one of they're amazing concerts.Was a brilliant movie, and it served its purpose. Good Job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For everyone who is thinking about going to see this movie, rent it when it comes out on DVD, or even buy it, please ignore all the comments where people have given this one star, and listen to someone who has actually seen it.We all know that if this movie truly deserved a one star then it would not have even made it to theaters. Everyone who is giving this movie a one star, I guarantee, has not even seen the Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Experience and is only giving it one star because its Jonas Brothers related. Most of these "haters" are also ignorant because the Jonas Brothers DO write their own music &amp; play their own instruments. When asked they probably couldn't even tell you one of the names of their songs. And no, not only children under the age of 10 like the Jonas Brothers, they have fans of ALL ages.It is one of the best 3D movies I've seen, the graphics were excellent and it actually feels like your at their concert. Not only feel like your at the concert but actually on stage with them. You also will get a glimpse of what life as a Jonas Brother is with behind the scenes footage. This movie also has an all new never before heard song.For parents who can't afford to buy tickets to their upcoming World Tour (they ARE good musicians otherwise they wouldn't be going on a World Tour now would they?) and your children have locked themselves in their rooms I recommend you go see the movie (or buy it.) It will definitely get your children to not hate you any longer.Please ignore all the haters :]</fullReview>

We all like different music and movies. But if you hate them SO much, then why spend money to go see the movie? If I see a preview for a movie that I think looks absolutely horrible, I'm not going to go waste my money watching it just so I can rip it to shreds on IMDb.com. Seriously, what's the point of that? I doubt all of you even saw the movie, but you just like to get the "teeny-bopper" girls riled up, because you don't have anything better to do apparently. I for one, I'm not a 12-year-old screaming fan. But I am a fan of them. And I honestly think they are very talented. I appreciate the fact that they are good role models in a world that is desperately in need of clean, wholesome people for kids (and even adults) to look up to. So all you haters, who seem to lack even a microscopic amount of a life: Quit seeing movies you KNOW you won't like. It's as simple as that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me start by saying that I'm disgusted by the haters comments. I feel like you shouldn't be judging only GOD should. If you guys have a heart you'll rate this a 10. As for the haters change your 1 rating to a 10. The movie felt incredible. I held Joe's hand. I really loved shelf and when they were coming out of z100. When Kevin throws himself at the crowd it feels awesome. I felt like I was on stage with my three favorite boys. Support them and go see the movie 32472837498327 times because you are going to have to. Joe, Kevin, and Nick sure know how to show a lady a good time. I can't wait for these rockstars to keep rocking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly people, what do you have to gain by bashing this movie because you hate the Jonas Brothers? Tell me, because I can't figure it out. You're just wasting your time.For anyone who is actually deciding whether to see this movie or not, here is my unbiased opinion: It was great! The movie was energetic and very entertaining, and the 3D effects were awesome. You can definitely see the passion these boys have for music, and you get a behind-the-scenes look of what they do in their downtime, how they prepare for shows, etc. Even though you might enjoy it more if you're a 14-year-old teenage girl, anyone can enjoy it if they give it a chance.That being said, why should you rate a movie so low if you've never even seen it? Are you really so immature that you would do that just because you hate them? If so, I feel truly sorry for you; if you hate them so much, why the hell are you here? Shouldn't you be doing something you like?! Really, people? Are you really that stupid?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Amazing Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OMJ! I went and saw the Jonas Brothers 3-D Concert Experience with so many expectations and it achieved all of them! I love it and I will see it over and over and over and over again! It is truly Amazing! It felt like I was front-row seat at one of their concerts and I could see inside their hotel rooms and everything! I felt like part of the Jonas Clan and I really do thank them for that! It was so incredibly amazing! I personally went into it just loving Joe Jonas but now that I got a chance to see all of them, I have crushes on all of them! They are all amazing guys and people and I feel blessed just to even be imaginably that close to their presence! I love you all! And now I can really say that I have developed a hopeless case of OJD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Of All Time! The Jonas Brothers Are So Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the best movie that I have ever watched. It was so amazing. Nothing can compare to seeing the beautiful smiles that are on the faces of Nick, Joe, and Kevin as they live life to its fullest, both on stage and off. Their music is wonderful and so refreshing. Their songs definitely captivate the audience and their voices keep the audience wanting more.Their friends, Demi and Taylor, also do fantastic in the movie. Demi is such a sweet girl and has an amazing voice. She is truly talented. Taylor also has a great voice.Mr. and Mrs. Jonas, Frankie, Maya, and Big Rob also make short appearances. They are so wonderful. Mr. and Mrs. Jonas are the best parents in the world and I am so glad that they are always around to support their sons and encourage their sons to live their dreams. Frankie knows that he is "the man." He is so special and is truly remarkable. Maya ("The Jonas Sister") is such an awesome girl. She is truly magnificent. Big Rob is not just a security guard. He is an incredible man who takes such great care of the Jonas Family. He truly loves the Family and I am so glad that he is always there for them. The Jonas Brothers' band is also so amazing. John, Jack, Ryan, and Garbo all work hard to make sure that they do fantastic during every performance. They are definitely talented and together they are one of the best bands of all time. They are so incredible.I strongly recommend the movie to anybody that likes music or having a great time. I have watched it with my brother, sister, mother, and grandmother and they all agree that this movie is the best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie surpassed my expectations... I was so impressed with the 3D imagery, and of course the Jonas Brothers put on an incredible live show!! The movie is enjoyable for parents and their children. Even though the movie is a bit more expensive than a non-3D movie, the experience is worth the extra $2 or @3. Kevin, Nick and Joe are wonderful role models for today's generation of "Sex drugs and rock and roll." They are a great example of what it means to be wholesome but have a blast and be successful. I recommend the movie to anyone and everyone! The songs are catchy, you can't help but sing along. You won't be sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have seen in a long while. And I am not just saying this because I am in love with the Jonas Brothers because I am not. It was refreshingly innocent, and overall a fun, enjoyable film. I do not understand why people wouldn't enjoy it. As for all the people saying this isn't real music, and they aren't as good as Elvis, etc: These are different times, Elvis and the Beatles and all of those classic rock icons were around for decades; the Jonas brothers have only been around several years, of course they aren't at that standard - yet. Kevin, Nick and Joe displayed outstanding talent in this 80 minute feature film, and showed us that even though they are young, they still have the talent, the ability, and the confidence to give a good show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about how all the haters got together and rated this movie 1star.How pathetic is that!? You can do all of us a favor and not watch,Sure say your little mean comments but taking time out of your life just try and ruin this is pathetic i never actually wanted to comment this but i am.And what i think is really stupid is that some people are trying to say "Metalica,and AC/DC are real music,this is gay and stupid,there not hardcore".Okay!There not Metalica there not AC/DC,There young men who just wanna sing.Sure they seem like they changed but to some of the teenage girls there hero's.We can relate to there music.Music is not all about head banging,Rocking out,Singing about getting high,getting drunk.It can be out positive things,The Jonas Brothers represent something.And its music.Don't even try to relate them to rock bands if you know there not rock bands!There Disney channel stars,There pure.There sweet they are just living the dream.And what kind of person would you be if you would ruin someones dream.How would you like it someone tried to tell you "You cant do this,You cant do that!"!? They told you that you can not live out your dream.These boys come a long way and I'm happy to say I'm a fan,because they are my hero's and it hurts and it sucks to have someone try to put them down,But i guess they ignore the haters and that is someone i wanna look up to.That they can wake up every morning and say"today is gonna be a good day"And forgot all the mean rude comments and enjoy life.Little kids under 10 listen to them and here they messages in songs.Do you really want little kids talk about sex,drugs,getting drunk rocking out and cussing!? So think about what these boys do to us.They are inspiration they make some girls smile because there just simply amazing.And all i got to say is.Haters,i don't see you getting a Grammy nomination!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all of you out there....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I notice that there are a great deal of people out there that obviously have a problem with this movie. Now, here's my question, for all of you that are complaining, how old are you? Did you want to go? No. Most of you went because you had someone else drag you along, not because you wanted to be there. That alone proves that you wouldn't have liked the movie whether it was good or not.I'll admit, it wasn't the best thing out there, but there was honest effort in it, and the whole point of this was NOT to sell their music. It was supposed to be a way for them to connect with their fans on a different level, which it accomplished very well.Now, I have to say this, because I notice that there are pages beyond pages of people saying how much they dislike the Jonas Brothers, how much they dislike the music, etc. People! Half of you are generally out of the Jonas Brothers' fan base age group, but you were the ones that were screaming sycophantically for 'NSync and The Backstreet Boys....The Jonas Brothers are the new hit. In fact, they're better. At least they write their music! And they do, for sure, write their music. They have had the same consistency in their writing from day one, and trust me, I've been a fan longer than they've been performing as a group. As for not having talent and being Disney media whores? They're doing a hell of a lot better in their life than you are! They have talent, always have, I've heard plenty of non-edited performances from these guys, without any kind of preparation. You want to argue that? Look on justin.TV/jonasbrothers and watch their archived live chats. They sang in both of them, and Nick even played the guitar in one. And honestly, if Disney handed you a contract with a 7-8 figure paycheck attached to it, would you turn it down? Come on! As for being media whores...That's Miley Cyrus. She steps out of her front door and practically poses for the paparazzi, but that's her! Big deal, she gets money out of it, a lot of people enjoy it, and you guys take time to actually care and not like it, so leave it alone!These guys try to stay out of the cameras eye as much as possible, I mean, how often do you see pictures from their daily life. Almost never. And when you do, it's generally when they have to go somewhere, like an airport, or they go to a movie premiere, but if it's the premiere case, everyone in Hollywood shows up to those.So, if you've read this, remember: If you didn't want to go in the first place, don't rate it. You're going to give it a rating it doesn't deserve out of being spiteful.Thanks a bunch, Cullen</fullReview>

It takes you behind the scenes and everything! I attended the burning up tour last summer, which is where this was filmed, and i loved that concert and the movie is just as good. The Jonas brothers are natural born performers and entertainers. This is a must see movie, people are giving it a bad review because they do not like the Jonas Brothers, they have not even seen the movie! People degrade the Jonas brothers because they think they are just some stupid Disney stars, but thats not true, they are so much more. They make awesome music and set great examples for kids. If you have never heard their music, then you must go see this movie, you will fall in love with them!So go see this movie, it is excellent, and you will love it, i promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great if you're a fan, lacking if you're not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the Jonas Brothers, but I am a huge fan of my niece, and she wanted to see this movie. That's the reason I went to see "The Best of Both Worlds," "High School Musical 3," and this Jonas Brothers' vehicle.Since I'm not a huge fan, I was hoping that this movie would be akin to the Miley Cyrus 3D movie with a backstage peak at their lives, thoughts, talent, and how they are dealing with their immense fame. I was disappointed that the only thing I learned from the movie is which one is which--and that I didn't learn until the end of next to last song.Instead, there were scripted moments at the beginning, and the unscripted moments were shots of the brothers in awe of their own fame and popularity. Its sole redeeming value is that the vocals were pre-taped, and the concert was a lip-syncing marvel.When I mentioned the lack of back-story to my niece she told me--with a straight face, "That's what the book you gave me for Christmas is for." It almost goes without saying that my niece loved the movie.I, on the other hand, say that if you want to see a decent 3D concert with the Jonas Brothers in it, rent the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus 3D concert. I guarantee you'll enjoy it much more even if you're not a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, It's like being at a show!~!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So going in to this film I really did expect the same format and Miley Cyrus's film. Behind the scenes and concert footage, but the boys did it differently by mostly giving you an inside look in to one of their shows. The behind the scenes stuff its mostly montage and there are a few scenes that are "behind the scenes". I think with this film it was more show though and that's what made it enjoyable, if you love the music and have not been able to attend one of the concerts you get a front row seat. It was just a lot fun to watch and the boy's are amazing and their career is well deserved and the haters exist because they are doing so well. This film shows that they are normal and like to have fun and put on one hell of a show. I can't really explain it but this film was just a treat and I came out thoroughly pleased and wanting to watch it again. If your a fan definitely go see this film and enjoy it, or if you kind of like their music then just go check it out to see them and what they are like live. If you don't like them, then why are you here? Recommended for OJD, The Fans, and anyone who realizes these guys are amazing!~!</fullReview>

The Jonas Brothers spray Fire Hoses filled with foam onto the faces and heads of the audience 99% of which are preteen girls. It was almost pornographic. Thankfully all of this seem to go over the heads of my two under 10 daughters. The movie starts in a tribute to The Beatles "Hard Days Night" with screaming fans chasing the Jonas Brothers around the streets of New York. But the director is no Richard Lester and you can't compare the films. I gave it a higher rating, it's probably a 5, but so many haters voted lower. On the plus side, the music is OK. At least it's a little bit Rock N Roll (a little bit country with Taylor Swift, and kind of mediocre with Demi Lovato (her outfit made it look like she has a penis? phallic phashion?) The 3D is incredible. It's come a long way from "Creature Of The Black Lagoon"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Re-review!Okay I'm going to champion the Jonas Brothers 3D Experience by saying what I did on my first review. In it I said that even though I gave the film 10 stars, as a documentary the film left me wanting more. Now that I've read some of the other legitimate remarks. (not the obvious haters) I realize that Disney did the brothers a disservice by not giving us, the parents and curious older crowed the complete back story. So many people have the misconception that the Jonas Brother are a product of Disney, snatched out of a cattle call and handed musical instruments. Not true. The youngest was writing songs at an earlier age, recorded a Christian album, the boy's have done commercials, two of them performed in hit shows on Broadway and then formed the band and had their first contract with Columbia. Disney saw a good deal then did what Disney does best. But with this project they've dropped the ball. They should have taken this showcase a bit more seriously. There are folks out there who don't even know they're real brothers! We have to be told these things people. Some of us parents and grandparents are still wondering if there's a Mr. and Mrs. Doobie? Anyway I still like the film. And to the haters..The Jonas Brother will not destroy music as we know it. If Disco couldn't, nothing in heaven or earth can.Original ReviewI felt completely left out in the cold! It seemed like I was the only person in my family that has not seen the Jonas Brothers up close and personal. My two older daughters and niece we're among the many chasing the brothers during the opening credits of their new film. My youngest daughters image, blurry as it is, can be seen on the CD soundtrack. Even my wife, an attraction host at Disney, seated them yesterday on her boat on It's A Small World and let them go around twice! (who would want to go around twice?) But I, after only seeing them in concert from the nose bleeds decided to catch the 12.01 showing at the local theater to see them up close. Man has 3D come a long way. Before I go on, why can't we see Elton John or David Bowie like this?.... Anyway the Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Experience is great entertainment from start to finish. Even the end credits are fun to watch! I have not seen such mayhem since the early Beatles and if you are not a fan I dare you to watch this film and not come away with at least some appreciation for the JoBros. Take away all the hype and you've got three young men who are the real deal. All three are charismatic and talented musicians/singers/performers. Yes you can fake a guitar rift or fake a vocal (not that I'm accusing them of this!) but you can't fake a 3d in your face shot of Nick going crazy on the drums with all the energy of a Keith Moon and the exuberance of a Ringo Starr, only Nick is better looking then Ringo, sings better and writes better songs! (sorry Richard we will always love you!) The 3D film, as beautiful and vibrant as it is, is a bit disappointing in that you don't get more behind the scenes looks at where they came from and who they are. I, as one who has not read the countless teen mags would have liked to know more about them personally. But I guess with the gimmick of 3D there is really no room for that. The concert is the main focus here. I'm sure there will be more serious documentaries in the future. As the brothers continue gaining an older crowed I want to be the first 50 year old music lover to predict that the Jonas Brothers will have a career the likes of Sir Elton John complete with movie soundtracks and Broadway scores. But that's some time away. The Jo Bro's will first have to shake the adoring teenyboppers and Camp Rocks so as to be taken more seriously in the music world. They deserve it! I can't wait to see what they can come up with when the hysteria subsides and they spend time experimenting in the Studios. But hey they're still young and as they say, They're living the dream. We're lucky to be able to sample a bit of it in this energetic 3D experience. As a documentary the Jonas Brothers 3D film left me wanting more. As an experience.... Well, Great songs, good fun equal 10 stars. One more thing. I just read the favorable review from Entertainment weekly. I felt it odd that the reviewer commented on the "sexual overtones" of the boy's spraying the adoring girls with foam? lol What kind of twisted world do we live in?... But wait this gives me an idea. Hmmm, maybe the next time Gallagher sledgehammers a banana into the 3rd row I should sue for sexual harassment!... Okay put on your 3D glasses, sit back and remember what it was like to be young and willing to throw yourself at the feet of your musical hero's. With or without foam!</fullReview>
