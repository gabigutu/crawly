		<fullReview>There has been no tougher or more formidable Western heavy than Richard Boone? He has occasionally depicted hard-bitten nobility, as his portrayal of General Sam Houston in "The Alamo" or the ageing cavalry officer in "A Thunder of Drums"?but more often his grim, craggy features have led him to villainy? He was Randolph Scott's intelligent, embittered adversary, smooth as a rattlesnake and twice as treacherous, in the Tall T; he wrapped non-conforming farmers in barbed wire in Man Without a Star; as mean, sadistic Major Salinas, he persecuted Rory Calhoun in Way of a Gaucho; and he gave Paul Newman a rough ride in Hombre. In "Big Jake," he was?as always?a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealer? George Sherman's "Big Jake" was the Duke fifth and final film played opposite the lovely redheaded Maureen O'Hara who plays, here, his wife Martha McCandles? The movie opens in 1909 where nine men crossing the Rio Bravo into Texas? Their leader?a sadistic gunrunner?John Fain (Richard Boone) is ready for his bloody McCandles' raid where ten people were slaughtered and Big Jakes's grandson, the 8-year-old Little Jacob (Ethan Wayne) is kidnapped, and a ransom note is left demanding one million dollars in $20 Bills for Jacob's safe return? Martha?quite sure that this job requires an extremely harsh and special kind of man to attend it? called back her husband, absent for many years, to pay the ransom, and take back home the little boy alive? Jacob McCandles (Wayne)?who has never seen his grandson?responds to his wife's call and organizes a hunting party to track down the dangerous and violent men? With his two sons, his faithful Indian scout (Bruce Cabot), his loyal dog, and with a large red strongbox packed to the back of a good mule, McCandles initiates his very daring hunt? There are some hard feelings among Wayne's resentful boys, and as the film progresses, Wayne's blue eyes were gentle and revealing a wonderful caring father but also his eyes turn to blue steel as he took that decision to get alive his grandson? The heart of the film is Wayne interacting with his wife and what he has in store for his sons next...Patrick Wayne plays Wayne's older son who is short on ears and long on mouth? Christopher Mitchum rides a 'crazy bicycle,' carries a Bergman 1911, and a rifle with one fancy new telescope...With great action scenes, great photography and with a terrific Elmer Bernstein musical score, "Big Jake" is one of Wayne best Westerns?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Jake and Dirty Harry: Same Writers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some comments here have mentioned how much the Western "Big Jake" reminds them of "Dirty Harry." Actually, both films were written by the same screenwriters -- Harry and Rita Fink -- though additional writers were brought in on "Dirty Harry." Both films were developed and shot around the same time. "Big Jake" came out in summer 1971, and "Dirty Harry" came out at Christmas 1971. John Wayne said he was offered "Dirty Harry" before Eastwood took it (but Dirty Harry was also supposedly offered to Paul Newman, Frank Sinatra, Bill Cosby and Walter Matthau before Eastwood, too!)The twice-repeated "do you feel lucky?" speech in "Dirty Harry" and the twice-repeated "your fault, my fault, nobody's fault" speech in "Big Jake" prove to me that the same writers worked on both scripts.Also, Richard Boone must be singled out. This powerful, amusing actor always made a great villain. Wayne had tried to get him as the villain for several films before "Big Jake" (he'd done a cameo in "The Alamo"). Boone finally said "yes" to "Big Jake" and the verbal showdowns between Big John and Big Boone in "Big Jake" are a wonder to behold.BTW, Boone turned down a lot of movie parts during the 70's (like the Robert Shaw part in "The Sting") but came to help out his old friend Wayne twice in that decade: "Big Jake" and "The Shootist" (1976.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Jake Holds His Own, Thank You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark this down as a very entertaining western with more realistic gunfight scenes than most films, meaning the good guys get shot as well as the villains. John Wayne's "The Searchers," a very similar movie story-wise, gets a lot better press than this film but "Big Jake" is just as good, if not better. To be fair, while the gunfights in here were well done, the fistfights were an insult. Whenever someone got slugged, such as Wayne belting his kids, it had no effect on them, except just to knock them down for a second or two. In real life, folks, chances are you will knocked unconscious if you are hit in the face, especially by a powerful man like Wayne. This has been a ludicrous fact-of-life, however, in all films for 100 years, not just here.Other than that, the film is a straight hard-nosed one with Wayne and adversary Richard Boone both fascinating. The dialog between the two was especially fun to hear. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Boone did not have enough lines in this film. Wayne's real-life sons in this film didn't impress me with their acting but they weren't horrible either.Bruce Cabot was a hoot as an old Indian friend of Wayne's. As with most westerns, there is some nice scenery so if you have the opportunity, watch this on widescreen DVD. It was nice-looking movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love the Duke!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to say that I am a huge JW fan. In this film JW is his classic Kick A** self. There is some sentimental stuff in here, about the old man's relationship with his grown sons. Basically it is good old John Wayne Action. When the bad guys get the drop on him, all you can think is "Big mistake" This film is set in the early 1900s. There is an interesting parallel between the passing of the baton from one generation to the next (Jake and his grown sons) and the passing of technology. We see new fangled weapons and a motor car. (Naturally Jake rejects these)Finally: You got to love the idea of Big Jake owning a dog named ..... DOG.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's one of my favorite lines from this picture and the way it's delivered, both times, is thrilling. Violent and bloody (and Bernstein's music makes one of the machete attacks even worse, his sense of drama is so good!) so don't let pre-teens or the impressionable see it! Boone is an awesome villain and Wayne and his "dog" make an odd hero combo. Big Jake is a big film, depicting the end of the cowboy era, without bemoaning the passing, and deftly incorporating new technology with the old. The tension between Wayne and his three boys is fine and there's some funny scenes, too. Highly recommended. PS: a Big Jake fan wrote into Entertainment Magazine in the 80s that this was one of his favorite Wayne films; the EM staff had never heard of it. I canceled my subscription.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He is not dead...NOT HARDLY!! This movie was great. I can't believe I had never seen it. I loved the way he put his kids in place every time they got out of line. Especially that guy with the mustache (Wayne's real life son). I have seldom seen movies where there is so much suspense. The mean man with the blanket was super good also at being a MEAN AND BAD GUY!!!! John Wayne is the best cowboy ever. He looked and acted tough and was apparently TOUGH in real life. I wish Maureen O'Hara would have been in this movie more. She is so good looking. John Wayne was so fearless. I loved the way he bled RED PAINT. Back then, the blood looked like RED PAINT.

		<shortDescription>My Personal Favorite of all Duke films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne is undeniably my favorite of all actors, and I'm happy that he was still around when I came into the world (He died when I was 5). Here's where the Duke does the stuff he's good at, dry humor, laying down the law, and pulling no punches. The whole "Your fault, my fault, nobody's fault..." exchange is Classic!! It's a great family reunion (John, Patrick, and Ethan). His oft costar Bruce Cabot does great in his supporting role. As well, the Duke and O'Hara show splendid chemistry in their final costarring. Not to mention the very intimidating performance by Richard Boone as the big villain. Gotta' love this one!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't call him "Daddy"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A later John Wayne western that contains a surprising amount of graphic violence. This is by no means another "Wild Bunch" but there are more bloody gunshot wounds than usual.The plot concerns the search and rescue of a kidnapped grandson that Wayne has never seen. The banter between Jacob McCandles(Wayne) and his estranged sons is the source of many of the film's great lines. When Patrick Wayne tries to provoke the Duke by calling him "Daddy", the retort by the old man is priceless.A good villan(Richard Boone), another pairing with Maureen O'Hara, some great one-liners and several references to older Wayne films make this a great choice from the westerns section at Blockbuster. Elmer Bernstein's music is wonderful too, sounding much like his "Magnificent Seven" score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That'll Be the Day"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Big Jake doesn't go down with the greatest of John Wayne's films I put it in the class of The Comancheros which I also found entertaining. This film is the right mixture of chemistry and action. No doubt helped by the fact that John Wayne was surrounded with family literally.John Wayne is the estranged patriarch of a family who owns a big cattle spread just as he did in McLintock. A gang of kidnappers came on the place while most everyone was on roundup and killed several people and kidnapped Wayne's grandson. Grandmother Maureen O'Hara sends for her estranged husband to deal with the kidnappers as he sees fit. Being this is a John Wayne movie, you already know how that is.Son Michael Wayne is the producer and sons Patrick and Ethan play Wayne's son and grandson. This is a bit of a change for Patrick Wayne. From back in the days of The Searchers, Pat Wayne always played callow youths in his father's and in other films. Here he's a grown man and quite bitter at his father. The conflict between them crackles on the screen. Christopher Mitchum, the son of another Hollywood icon, plays another Wayne offspring as does Bobby Vinton.The action flows pretty good here and the tension does not let up for a moment. There are some good comic moments, but they are well integrated into the plot of the story.Of the Duke's films post his Oscar from True Grit, Big Jake is one of his best and a personal favorite of mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another formula hit from the DUKE............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember an old Uncle of mine remarking back in the seventies that he never ever saw John Wayne in a bad movie. I disagree with that notion but I must admit that I understand why my Uncle felt that way-- Even in the latter part of his career "The Duke" was still nothing more or less than a remarkably charismatic figure who could always carry the formula movies tailored for him from scene to scene--- "Big Jake" is not as sophisticated as "True Grit" but it is better than most of Wayne's later films---O.K.--The plot is kinda goofy at times and Bobby Vinton's appearance at the onset is horrid--but as other user's have pointed out -Vinton is shot up at the beginning of the film during the attack on the ranch---and while he is unfortunately not killed outright--he is through for the rest of the picture---- I notice that Chris Mitchum takes some hits for giving an awful performance--but he is at least almost as good playing Wayne's son as Wayne's own son (Patrick) is... Richard Boone is superb as the leader of the kidnappers---the Indian and the dog do their jobs (all part of the formula)-----I have to note as others have that there are some memorable lines---The Duke enters the film by saving a sheepherder from a hanging--Big Jake is threatened by Jim Davis playing one of the lynchers-who asks him if the sight of blood bothers him---Big Jake answers..."Only my own." Davis wants to know who he is....When he tells them that he is Jacob McCandles--Davis tells him that he thought he was dead...."Not Hardly" says the Duke-------This line is also used marvelously at the end of the picture---- I like Boone and Wayne exchanging another threat several scene's apart..."Your fault -my fault - nobody's fault-I'm going to blow the boy's head off..." coming from Boone and then Wayne turning the tables on him later. I have to agree with the other users regarding the remarkable violence in the film--the ending is especially bloody---I notice that "Big Jake" and "True Grit" both have a scene near the end of the Picture where the action culminates in Wayne being wounded and trapped and about to be killed by a mounted Villian...only to be saved by the bad guy being killed by a far-far off "Hail Mary" shot (by Chris Mitchum in Big Jake and Glen Campbell in True Grit). I also (as others have mentioned) found the last scene of the movie rather incongrous as the grievously wounded Wayne and and his son (and supposed grandson but really younger son acting) go grinning away from a massacre that killed Big Jake's life-long friend (Sam- the Indian) and his dog---You would have thought they were leaving a wedding reception.........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violently Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset 'Big Jake' will always be a firm favourite of mine, it's the first John Wayne movie I can recall watching, and this is the movie that has made him my all-time favourite movie star and actor.The movie follows Dukes pursuit of seven kidnappers whom killed a large number of people at his former ranch (now run by his estranged wife) and kidnapped his grandson.Up until this point in John Wayne's career he had by in large refrained from using excessive violence in his movies. However it could be argued and with some basis that movies such as 'True Grit', 'The Green Berets' and 'The Alamo' to name but three were physically violent in their own right. Regardless of this however 'Big Jake' was to be a dramatic departure for John Wayne due to the fact that on numerous occasions it give an honest depiction of physical violence. The opening shootout at the Candles ranch is a prime example of this, the sequence is extremely well executed by the director and stunt co-coordinators and there are many examples gunshot wounds which add to the realism of the movie.The screenplay is rather slick with ample action included to satisfy audience expectations. The movie does contain many memorable scenes such as the opening and closing shootouts, Dukes casual killing of a would be assassin and some touching and at times volatile scenes involving Jake and his ex wife played eloquently by the great Maureen O'Hara.An interesting segment at the start involves a voice-over retelling the transformation of the west from the early 1800's to its relatively civilised state in 1909 (when the film is set). The voice-over also introduces the audience to nine bandits whom act as the heavies in the movie, its fascinating to hear a brief introduction of each bandit and what skill they bring to the group e.g. Fain is the leader, O'Brien the gunfighter and John Goodfellow is proficient with a machete etc etc.Duke in this movie is accompanied is his pursuit if the kidnappers by a trusted dog (who is very violent) an Indian friend played very well by Bruce Cabot, and his two on screen sons James (Patrick Wayne who is Dukes own son) and Michael (Chris Mitchum). The main protagonist in the movie is John Fain played superbly by Richard Boone and some of the scenes between him and John Wayne are very memorable containing both tension and style. John Wayne's youngest son John Ethan Wayne makes his debut in this movie playing the kidnapped grandson of Jake and acquits himself very impressively to the field of acting.Despite my fondness for this movie it is not however without its weaknesses, for one the acting by both Patrick Wayne and Chris Mitchum is horrendous and neither one manages to endear the audience to their respective characters. Some sloppy direction also resulted in the disappearance of one of the Fain gang early in the movie, despite being given an introduction at the start of the movie; young Billy simply disappears without any explanation right at the beginning of the raid on the McCandles ranch. Several campfire scenes that are set at night appear much too bright; the director should have masked the lens on the camera more in order to ensure the scenes effectiveness. Finally several stunts involving Mitchum and a motorcycle come across as tired, overblown and generally dull although the director rightly erased the motorcycle from the movie quite early on much to the relief of the audience.Critics were less than impressed with the movie stating that it was 'overly violent', these were the same critics who praised the Wild Bunch months earlier for being innovative and honest in its depiction of violence. Despite what he critics stated and some of the minor criticisms I have pointed out about this movie it remains a firm favourite and was a big box office hit when first released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Wayne's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with one of the preceding comments, that "Big Jake" is better than "The Searchers." In fact, I have watched "the Searchers" several times and cannot understand why many critics praise it as Wayne's best. "Big Jake," "Hondo" and "The Shootist" outrank Searchers, in my opinion... (except for the appearance of Vera Miles, my favorite Pratt, Kansas lovely). "She wore a Yellow Ribbon" is a good Wayne film. Very entertaining is "Rio Lobo." Jack Elam's switch from bad guy to comedy is super! The writers of Big Jake, Hondo, Rooster Cogburn and the Shootist composed the right words and actions to showcase the best John Wayne character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe my favorite John Wayne movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which isn't to say it's his best (it may not be better than TRUE GRIT and is nowhere near as moving as THE COWBOYS, just to name a couple) but it is a hell of a lot of fun. When he was a young man John Wayne once said he'd have to retire when he reached forty because after that you couldn't play a believable hero. Well, here he is at 63, still kicking ass with the best of them! BIG JAKE has a sense of self-referential humor about it that I find irresistible (the "I thought you wuz dead?" running gag, for example). Written by the screenwriters of DIRTY HARRY, this movie always struck me as their attempt to send up the larger than life image of The Duke in the most affectionate possible way. Wayne's introductory shot (and the line leading up to it) makes me laugh out loud every time I see it (it was cut from a TNT showing of the movie a few years ago, making me howl with such outrage that my kids cracked up!). The only thing I don't like about this movie is the callousness of much of the violence. I know Richard Boone and his gang are being set up as the baddest of the baddies, but women and children being hacked to bits with a machete is a bit much. Still, not enough to ruin BIG JAKE for me. "Not hardly."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Jake (1971) John Wayne, Richard Boone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was "vintage" John Wayne picture, this is it. Strong and determined to do the right thing, Jacob McCandles sets out to rescue his kidnapped grandson with the help of his two renegade sons, (Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum)and an Apache friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot). Maureen O'Hara as Martha begins the sequence of events that leads to the rescue, in what would be her fifth and final motion picture with Wayne. But there is danger front and back. As Wayne and his "posse" pursue the kidnappers, another band of no-goods are pursuing Wayne after learning of the million dollar ransom they are carrying. Everything we loved about John Wayne is epitomized in "Big Jake". His son Patrick stars with him in the movie, his other son Michael produced it and even John himself helped direct it when Director George Sherman became ill (yet Wayne would not allow Sherman's name to be taken off of the credits). One of the most poignant scenes is the look on Jacob McCandles face when he sees his grandson for the first time. It wouldn't be going overboard to say that all of John Wayne's western roles can be summed up in "Big Jake".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty gory for a John Wayne film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with the gore, I like this movie. Patrick Wayne is surprisingly fine actually playing his father's son. Chris Mitchum is not as good playing another of the Duke's sons, but he's adequate. At least they make sense; Bobby Vinton plays John's 3rd son, and he's really miscast! Luckily he gets shot early in his 2 minutes onscreen and spends the rest of the movie recuperating offscreen. Richard Boone plays the head kidnapper, and he's solid as always.John, Patrick and Chris go off to pay the ransom for his grandchild, Bobby's son (actually played by Ethan Wayne, the Duke's youngest son). Much is made of the passing of the old, rough and ready West, and the start of the civilized age throughout the entire movie; they show John riding on a reliable old horse, while the sheriff goes off to get the kidnappers in a car that overheats. Newfangled weapons and modern ideas are juxtaposed against the old time-tested ways. The guys follow the instructions, but the Duke never does anything easy. In the end there's a shootout at a crumbling hacienda, and if you've ever seen a John Wayne movie you know who's going to win.I first saw this movie unedited at the 1st John Wayne festival in Winterset, Iowa in the early 80's, and was surprised at the violence in it; one of the villains carries a huge machete. Very different from most other Wayne movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Don't Call Him Daddy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless about how one feels about his arch-conservative politics, there really isn't any secret as to why John Wayne personified what it meant to be a star in Hollywood for decades on end. And even though he seemed to settle into a routine of making films under his Batjac production banner in the last decade and a half of his life without the strong guiding hand of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway, he still put out what everyone had come to expect of the man. Case in point, BIG JAKE.Written by the same writers who gave Eastwood DIRTY HARRY, BIG JAKE stars Wayne as Jake McCandles, a Texas rancher whom everyone thought was dead because no one had seen him in eighteen years (as always, rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated). But he is called back into action by his estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara) after a gang of ruthless outlaws, led by Richard Boone, shoot up his ranch, kill much of the hired help, and kidnap his grandson (Ethan Wayne). Wayne, not surprisingly, takes up the challenge. But he also has to keep his sons (Glenn Corbett; Chris Mitchum) in line when they call him Daddy (obviously, this gets a burr up the Duke's backside). They all must venture across the Rio Grande to Boone's hideout on the Mexican side, helped out by Wayne's trusty Indian aide (Bruce Cabot). And it all comes down to an eminently satisfying and traditional showdown between Wayne and Boone.BIG JAKE is very much in the style of Wayne's other Batjac westerns (CHISUM; THE UNDEFEATED; THE WAR WAGON; CAHILL, U.S. MARSHAL) in its being somewhat predictable, but that predictability is precisely what makes it a success; people want Wayne to win, and who can blame them? Fortunately, he gets a vicious enough antagonist in Boone, who had had a minor role in the Duke's own 1960 directorial opus THE ALAMO and who does sagebrush villainy as well as anyone else. George Sherman, who had directed Wayne in several B-westerns prior to the Duke's ascension to stardom via Ford's STAGECOACH, shows he still has the directorial goods here despite the poor health he suffered during its making (Wayne reportedly directed significant sequences, but refused to take credit or have Sherman taken off). BIG JAKE also has superlative cinematography by William Clothier, no stranger to Westerns he, all of which was done on location in what had become the Duke's favorite Western locale--the landscape around Durango, Mexico. The only really serious disappointment with BIG JAKE is that Wayne and O'Hara barely have any screen time together, given how well they worked under Ford, particularly on 1952's THE QUIET MAN, and seeing as how this was their last joint appearance on screen (Wayne died in 1979, and O'Hara wouldn't make another feature film until ONLY THE LONELY in 1991).Still, just about everything else one expects from the Duke on screen happens here in BIG JAKE, including those little bits of humor revolving around being called "Daddy" and being thought dead. It's just a lesson to you: You don't mess with the Duke.And you definitely don't call him Daddy either!</fullReview>

They kidnap 'Little Jake McCandles' and only one man has the knowledge, the experience and the guts to try and get him back 'Big Jake McCandles' (John Wayne). With the help of his two sons and his indian friend Sam Sharpnose, he sets out to recover Little Jake. This movie shows the end of the old west and the start of the 20th century. New semi automatic guns Vs. old original six shooters. Some of the most memorable lines i have ever heard come from this film e.g. "anything goes wrong anything at all your fault, my fault nobody's fault i'm gonna blow your head off. No matter what happens no matter who gets killed, I'm gonna blow your head off". Its a very good movie if you copy buy it you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "Big Jake" in Bangkok, Thailand in 1971 and enjoyed it thoroughly. The story is classic John Wayne so there is nothing new here. Wayne is the quintessential loner/drifter who is estranged from his well to do family led by long time Wayne co-star Maureen O'hara. When his grandson is kidnapped, Jacob McCandles (Wayne) comes home and takes charge. Big Jake teams with his sons and Indian companion (Bruce Cabot) and goes off to rescue the grandson. The highlight of this film involves the interaction between Wayne and Richard Boone who plays the chief villain John Fain. The two times that McCandles and Fain cross paths is worth the price of admission alone. Look for other Wayne sidekicks in this movie like Harry Carey, Jr, Patrick Wayne and John Agar. If you like John Wayne westerns, you'll like "Big Jake". I bought the dvd.</fullReview>

This movie has something for everyone, but be warned it has plenty of violence and is definitely a PG/ PG13 type film.The supporting cast is excellent with Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum, Richard Boone,Bruce Cabot, Maureen O'Hara, Gregg Palmer and Dog turning in solid performances.While there are the formulaic elements such as horrendous acts perpetuated by bad men that give license to the good guys to do whatever is necessary to right the wrong, Big Jake also has other elements that make this film not just another Western:1) Takes place in transition period of the turn of the century which provides some interesting interaction between the old ways and new ways. 2) Fun relationships and interplay between an estranged father and his young adult sons. 3) Great mixture of fun and intense gritty action. (John Wayne movies are known for this)Consequently - If you like Westerns this is a classic that you will enjoy.If you are a fan of John Wayne at all this is a must see film.If you are just looking for a good gritty action film with a healthy dose of humor seamlessly woven in to the story you will not be disappointed.Ultimately, this is one of my favorite John Wayne films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of John Wayne's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aging Texas cattleman Jake McCandles(John Wayne)is looked upon by some of his peers as being too old to cut the mustard; but this man's man musters into action when ruthless cutthroats led by John Fain(Richard Boone) kidnap his grandson. Big Jake returns to join his estranged family in the search of the youngster called Little Jake. Once again The Duke is paired with the beautiful Maureen O'Hara as his wife; real life son Patrick plays sharpshooting son James. Robert Mitchum's son Christopher plays Big Jake's son Michael. Boone is the perfect villain. And his minions are faithful, but dumb enough to die for him. Plenty of gun play and violence to befit a Wayne western. Beautiful, but rugged scenery filmed entirely in Mexico. Other players include: Glenn Corbett, John Doucette, Jim Davis, Harry Carey, Jr., Bruce Cabot and Wayne's own son Ethan plays Little Jake. Maybe not a big money maker as some, but one of The Duke's most popular movies. I personally consider it one of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Jake is directed by George Sherman and written by Harry and Rita Fink. It stars John Wayne, Richard Boone, Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum and Maureen O'Hara. Elmer Berstein scores the music and William H. Clothier is the cinematographer. It's shot in Panavision and Technicolor with the principal location for the shoot being Durango in Mexico. Plot finds Duke Wayne as tough old rancher/gunfighter Jake McCandles, who is estranged from his family and spends his days roaming the west with his trusty dog. However, when the McCandles family ranch is raided by a gang of outlaws led by John Fain (Boone), and Jake's grandson Little Jake is kidnapped for ransom, Big Jake gets the call from his separated wife Martha (O'Hara) to go find the boy. Which he sets off to do, with two of his sons in tow.There were many critics who felt John Wayne should have stopped making movies before the 1970's arrived. Which is a bit ignorant considering he would bow out with the heartfelt and poignant The Shootist in 1976. It's undeniable that of the ten 1970's film's he made before his death, half of them are disposable at best, Big Jake isn't one of them. Yes, the formula is hardly new, only here the blood quota is considerably higher than previous Duke Wayne outings, and yes, tonally the film is a bit too up and down for its own good. But it's a film that finds old hands Wayne and Boone turning in good shows and the action and thematic camaraderie on show more than compensates for the looming cloud of same old same old.Of worth, too, is the time setting of the story, coming as it does towards the back end of the Old West, we get to see many examples of the Wild West being tamed. Be it the railroad, or motor driven vehicle's, our protagonist and antagonist are old school characters framed by a changing West. This is where it pays to have Wayne and Boone in the main roles, turning it in in an old school, knowing, style. The names Clothier and Bernstein are synonymous with the Western genre, and they don't disappoint here, both the photography and score treat the eyes and the ears. And although not in it for very long, O'Hara adds a touch of class in what was the last of the five times she appeared on film with her friend Duke Wayne. In amongst the violence there's also plenty of fun, some intended courtesy of banter between Duke and his estranged sons, some not intended; such as watching the dog out act the siblings of Duke and Robert Mitchum! But all told, if you don't expect The Searchers or Hondo et all, then this holds up as a good way to spend an afternoon. 7/10Footnote: I wonder if John Carpenter watched and enjoyed this film so much he cribbed a reoccurring joke from it for Escape from New York? Big Jake keeps coming up against people who say that they thought he was dead, same thing happens to Snake Plissken in Carpenter's picture. A homage I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."If anyone else says that I'm gonna shoot them.!"A truly outstanding film, though it is very much a product of it's time. The scenes are too bright, and the sets look like sets, too bright and cheery even when they're suppose to be old and run down. The movie looks as if it was shot at an old West Theme park.That being said, this should movie should be placed in the top ten of all John Wayne movies. It ranks up there with The Quiet Man, The Shootist, and The Sands of Iwo Jima. Outstanding action, and the chance to see John Wayne as he should be seen, riding a horse and carrying a six shooter. See this movie. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

I do think they could have somehow spared a thought for Sam and the dog in the last scene, but it might have messed up the Happy Ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Wayne western throughout. I first saw this on its initial theater run and several times since then. The subsequent screenings had been edited, removing some of the more graphic scenes.This film is Wayne at his best, strong and tough, yet you see the underlying tenderness when dealing with his family and wife. O'Hara is excellent as the matriarch, and Boone plays the villain to perfection.Set at the turn of the 19th century you see a passing of an age; the mechanical age is supplanting that of the horse driven age. You see this reflected in the struggle between the generations of the McCandles family. But, John Wayne shows there is plenty of worth in the old ways, and he isn't washed up just yet.A great movie. I liked it.</fullReview>

You get the impression that under different circumstances,these two tough and uncompromising men could have been friends.Maureen O'Hara makes her presence felt in what is little more than a cameo and all the other roles without exception are well handled. "THE SHOOTIST" is thought of as being Wayne's best film in his latter years.But his performance was that of an ill and dying man."BIG JAKE" is the better movie and has more action than you can shake a Colt 45 at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Lots action, great plot and acting. Big Jake is believed dead by almost everyone he runs into. Believe me he isn't!!! John Wayne is Big Jake and he is one tough mother. Richard Boone gets the lead bad guy role and he is very good. Maureen O'Hara is his wife and a very demanding shrew, yet they are still married. When his son is kidnapped by Boone and his gang that come to the McCandels ranch and kill a bunch of people and take the youngest and very effeminately dressed youngest son she calls for Big Jake. He shows up and with his sons he goes after the bad guys. I like that one of his sons are actually played by his real son. The bath scene is good and violent. Several of the amateurish bad men in the town are just sooo out classed and they die. Big Jake finally runs the kidnappers down and things come to a head. When things finally get to crunch time the dog gets killed by the fat ass, one son shoots the sniper and Richard Boone gets killed. The young son is safe and returned to mama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wayne Western with a touch of Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Jake is a traditional John Wayne Western with a strangely unacknowledged level of modern savagery. It's got all the adventure and comic relief you'd expect, but every so often the level and intensity of the violence exceeds anything you'd anticipate. Sometimes that contrast appears to be intentional. Sometimes it's just odd. What it does is give this film an edge that makes it stand out from the many other Wayne Westerns.Set in 1909 as 20th Century civilization has finally taken root on the East Coast, this story concerns the still largely untamed American Southwest along the border with Mexico. John Fain (Richard Boone) leads a crew of 8 other vicious killers on a raid of the McCandles ranch, massacring a number of people and kidnapping the grandson of ranch owner Martha McCandles (Maureen O'Hara). Confronted with a million dollar ransom demand for the boy's return, Martha summons her long absent husband Jacob (John Wayne) to deliver the money and get his grandson back. Joined by his faithful dog, his sons James and Michael (Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum) and his old Indian friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot), Big Jake McAndles heads out through the beautiful countryside to battle Fain's raiders, greedy cowboys and the bitter resentment of his son James.Amidst the shootouts, brawls, scenery, gags and other elements of the Wayne Western, an interesting theme is woven through Big Jake. This is a tale about how the folks who lived and prospered in the Wild West, both good and bad, weren't all that pleasant. Jacob McAndles is a hard man. His Indian friend is a hard man. His wife is a hard woman. Even his dog is a hard beast. These are people (and an animal) of unflinching will who will risk and inflict death without hesitation. Michael McAndles, whose nicer manners and love of the latest 1909 technology represents the new era, has trouble accepting his father's ruthless violence. Big Jake serves as both an ode to the uncompromising strength needed to tame the frontier, yet doesn't shy away from the rough and unappealing aspects of that strength.That bluntness explains some of the graphic violence in this movie. It's not quite at the level of Sam Peckinpah, but Big Jake is bloodier and more cold blooded than most other Westerns. Not all of the moments of barbarism fit that explanation. For example, two characters meet extremely brutal ends without them having any emotional impact on the other characters.The best parts of this movie are Wayne (unsurprisingly) and his interactions with Bruce Cabot and Richard Boone. Wayne and Cabot mine a lot of humor out of their age, while Wayne and Boone perfectly capture the idea of men who are so tough they don't feel any need to show off. Wayne's scenes with his younger co-stars don't come off as well, particularly when Big Jake has to deal with the obviously forced and exaggerated anger from James, though perhaps that generation gap was on purpose.Big Jake is about a legendary Wild West figure who's so legendary everybody knows him, but they all think he's already dead. But though the movie accepts that the time and place for someone like Big Jake may have been ending, it argues there's still a little more room for that sort of spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime - it changed colour........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1909 but Jake McCandles doesn't have to believe it if he doesn't want to.Spiritually he still belongs in the Post - Bellum West and he retains the values of that era.Whilst Velocipedes rumble across the prairie and through the streets,McCandles determinedly sits astride his four - legged - friend,a mode of transport that at least won't ignite and explode if hit by a rifle bullet. Mr J.Wayne despite the usually politically inspired sniping by intellectuals,remains perhaps the greatest of the mythic Hollywood stars. In "Big Jake" he visits one of his recurring themes,the absentee parent or father - figure/mentor who eventually comes good. When the grandson he never even knew he had gets kidnapped,Jake's long - suffering wife (the glowing Miss M.O'Hara) gets word to him and sets him off on an odyssey with his best (only?) friend Sam Sharpnose and a strange collie - type dog that exhibits chameleon - like qualities as it struts the stage in its brief moment of fame. Mr Sharpnose - a Native American - is played by the great Mr B.Cabot who once saved Mr Wayne's life in a Tijuana bar.A penchant for the ladies had led the Duke into harm's way and Cabot bravely interposed his body between him and his assailant,sustaining serious injury. And a penchant for the ladies has cost Jake McCandles his marriage,his children and his ranch. Generously,Mr Wayne allows Mr R.Boone as the head villain to match him in every scene they appear in together. Some old favourites from John Ford's repertory company give the film a firm foundation. Dismissed by most critics at the time as a typical John Wayne potboiler, "Big Jake" is,in fact a very enjoyable picture.Perhaps not so elegaic as the later "The Shootist" or as fashionable as its near - contemporary "The Wild Bunch",but visiting the same territory with absolutely no pretensions to significance or greatness,merely the wish to involve and entertain its audience.And that it surely does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Duke's last real hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the last movie of his that did all that well at the box office, he was rated the #1 male box office draw in '71 for the last time. The rest of his flicks--the Cowboys, Cahill, etc didn't do all that great. What made this one special? Well, nothing really-it's another in the line of those sixties/early 70's 'Superstar John Wayne' flicks ala the War Wagon or Sons of Katie Elder or Chisum, where he trots out the same old faces-Paul Fix, Bruce Cabot, a Mitchum, Hank Worden, beats on baddies, Indians and the younger folks, saves the day, and tosses in some broad humour to boot.This one adds: more violence, more blood-letting, a motorcycle, a plane, Richard Boone in a fine nasty villain role, and Maureen O'Hara back to the well one more time.Debits-there are bad continuity booboos galore-in terrain, in the color of the Dawg, in some of the stunts, etc. Both Mitchum and Pat Wayne are so-so at best. Wayne seems bent on beating the younger upstarts down at every turn. You know its made during the Vietnam War even if you didn't know it's release date.It's a good time though, familiarity in this case doesn't breed contempt. Worth checking out just because. You gotta be a fan of the Duke though.**1/2 outta ****Oh they save the kid and Boone is killed at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proper parenting, John Wayne style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This John Wayne western is set around the beginning of the Twentieth century. According to the film, the days of the wild West and rustling were now thought to be over, though they soon would learn that this is not necessarily the case. This is because a group of bandits attack the ranch that Wayne's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara--in a very familiar role) runs. Many are killed and the grandson is kidnapped for ransom. So, she sends out word for Wayne to come home. Once there, they organize a plan and a posse and head into Mexico to get the boy back--but the folks organizing it seem to ignore Wayne and his advice, so you can easily predict what will happen next! After many of them are killed in the process, Wayne takes on the job with the assistance of two of his grown sons.Now before I go on, let's talk about John Wayne's parenting style in this film. Needless to say, it's unconventional! Here are a few of his tidbits of his vast parenting knowledge: 1. If you have been absent from your sons' lives for most of their lives, when you are reunited, don't accept any anger or bitterness from your sons. If they don't immediately respect you and do what you say, slug 'em.2. If they are nearly killed, slug 'em--after all, you love them and don't want anything bad to happen to them.3. Don't allow for the fact that your sons have opinions or accomplishments--they will always be your inferiors.4. If your sons have any questions as to why their mom and dad split up, slug 'em. If they ask about why you "ran out" on Ma, ignore them and walk off--a real man NEVER has to be answerable to his children.5. If a son is hesitant about killing someone, belittle him. After all, killing other fellas is a sign of masculinity.6. Have a trusted sidekick who tells the kids "Keep your mouths shut and listen to him (Wayne)".7. To show your sons that fighting and manliness is important, take them to a bar and then pick a fight with the meanest guy there. You don't need to win, but a good show of manhood is important. After all, how else will your boys learn?! 8. Hug 'em? Nah...slug 'em! 9. After you and your sons kill off the bad guys in a big blood bath, understand it's a bonding experience. Time to let old wounds disappear. It's Miller time! Although I did come up with a dandy list of lessons I learned from the film (most of them terrible), I must say that the film was well done and satisfying--especially in a brainless sort of way. This is NOT meant as criticism--sometimes a brainless action/adventure film is just what the doctor ordered! By the way, though I am giving the movie a positive rating, I must point out that one scene in particular irritated me (other than all the father-son punching, of course). Glenn Corbet was barely noticed in the film. However, late in the movie, he has a gun drawn on Patrick Wayne. What happens next is the dumbest and most pointless scene from a Western I've seen in ages. Watch this scene and see what I mean.By the way, like many of Wayne's films of the 60s and 70s, the casting is quite odd. First, there is Bobby Vinton playing a son of John Wayne--polka-singing and permed Vinton! Second, Bruce Cabot (a common Wayne supporting actor) plays an American-Indian!</fullReview>

John Wayne played the role as Jacob McCandles who was looked up to as a man you did not mess with and respected. Maureen O'Hare, (Martha McCandles) seeks the help of her husband after years of being separated when their grandchild is kidnapped for a ransom for One Million Dollars. The gang of crooks is headed by Richard Boone, (John Fain) who will kill women and children in cold blood and think nothing of it. Patrick Waynes son has a role in this film along with the Polish Prince of Music and Song, Bobby Vinton. Maureen O'Hara had a very brief appearance only in the beginning and end of this film and this was also the last film that Wayne and O'Hara appeared together. Very entertaining film, you will not want to miss this great film Classic from 1971.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for Duke lovers and haters alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was made, the Duke already had the reputation for either being someone you love or hate. So the writers created a movie which was just all "Duke", that could make you love him or hate him, but still laugh your heart out and relish a perfect movie. There are too many big stars in this movie to mention. It starts almost like a commentary, which works well, and adds to the comic flavor of this movie. It isn't a comedy, but it has a very light hearted attitude, so you don't have to roll your eyes at ridiculous scenes that modern movies would try to make you take seriously. Nine outlaws raid a ranch, kill several people, and kidnap a boy. They give Maureen O'Hara a ransom note and head for the border. Easy money, right? Excuse me, that is the duke's grandson, buddy! Enough said about that. So the Duke embarks with his old companion and his two healthy sons (a third is shot up too bad), and clever writing, acting, and directing make this a romp anyone could enjoy. A lot of great lines. Patrick Wayne:...I'm really moved....Daddy! John Wayne: Daddy? Patrick: Daddy! John Wayne: Well, son, since you haven't learned to respect your elders, it's time you learned to respect your betters! (Whack! Thud!) Every family had fun with that line, just as I'm sure the Waynes did. Hard action. And the duke is mean and evil, or is he really good? Like I said, the movie was made so that whether you loved or hated him, you could love the movie. I neither loved or hated him, and even I love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Weird Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get this out of the way up front: I love John Wayne. Seeing him in a film as bad as this isn't just disappointing, it feels wrong.Jacob McCandles (Wayne) is a famous gunslinger whose estranged wife Martha calls upon him to return to his old ranch after desperadoes kidnap the grandson Jake didn't know he had. To get the boy back, Martha is told she must have a million dollars brought to the kidnappers in Mexico. Jake takes on the task of the boy's recovery.The film opens with carnage at the McCandles ranch, not at all realistic but certainly meant that way. There are a lot of blood splotches and random killing, of women and children as well as men. The bad guys in this movie may be likened to the James Gang, but they operate more like the Manson Family. No doubt this was an effort to reach numb and jaded audiences circa 1971.This proves a serious miscalculation as the film goes on and tries to develop a lighter, comic touch around the Big Jake character. He's established as an ornery cuss who punches out one of his own sons for calling him "Daddy," then punches him out again for cracking wise about his leaving Martha. (How these McCandleses eat solid food is a mystery.)Every once in a while, Jake's dander is riled when someone tells him: "I thought you were dead.""Next man says that to me I'm gonna shoot, so help me," Jake fumes.The tone issues are the worst of it for me, clumsily handled by credited director George Sherman with an uncredited assist from Wayne. But nearly as bad is the dodgy plot. Simply put, there is no way Big Jake could expect his plans for recovering the boy to work in a world anywhere other than Hollywood. He relies on two bad eyes, an Apache also with bad eyes, a dog, and two unproven boys to take on a gang of criminals who just wasted a bunch of ranchhands and three carloads of Arizona Rangers.Oddities abound. Bruce Cabot plays Jake's Apache friend with a lot of Man Tan on his face and an attempt at Tonto-speak he discards within a few minutes. Bobby Vinton plays one of Jake's sons with an anachronistic perm and gold necklace whose sole purpose is getting shot. Other sons are played by Patrick Wayne, Wayne's real-life son and a terrible actor, and Christopher Mitchum, even worse here with his shimmering blond Beatles haircut and his left-field Evel Knievel motorcycle stunts.The motorcycle is probably anachronistic, too, although the point is made right away that we are in 1909, where lawmen ride cars, not horses, and pistols can be fed ammunition automatically. Of course, the real time change behind "Big Jake" is the 1970s, and Wayne adjusting to a new decade and a different culture. In other 1970s films, Wayne's characters handle this with grace and self-aware humor. Here Big Jake grumbles a lot and punches people.There's a confrontation scene in a Mexican town between Big Jake's group and a secondary bandit gang that, while illogical and overly convenient in its execution, is almost exciting. The final battle is a mess, though. I won't get into spoilers, but when five men with pistols and rifles surround an injured old man and a boy behind a hayrick, you need more than a lot of cutaways and back-and-forth dialogue to explain how the latter can possibly survive, let alone prevail.Watching a great actor play down to his stereotype persona is frustrating. When he's as inanimate as Wayne so often is here, it's worse. "Big Jake" seems to operate under the notion that if it features Wayne, and serves up as many reminders as it does of better Wayne movies, it will be enough. It's not, and when combined with its ugly, disjointed tone and general strangeness, "Big Jake" makes for a singularly deflating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been more, but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not John Wayne's best film or his worst either, for me it leans towards the watchable but disappointing category. It is definitely watchable, especially for the handsome photography and scenery. Also the first five minutes was inspired I think, and the score was more than adequate. While past his prime, John Wayne is good here, I liked how Maureen O'Hara was so elegant and Richard Boone is very entertaining.Sadly, Big Jake is also quite lazily directed, and the plot is disappointingly meagre. The script is an uneven mix, one minute it flows well, the other it feels stilted, while the ending could have been better rounded off. Out of the cast, I liked Wayne, I liked Boone, I liked O'Hara, but I thought Chris Mitchum and Patrick Wayne were pretty awful.All in all, it is a watchable effort but doesn't quite work. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At this point in his career, John Wayne shows he can still make a John Wayne movie. He plays "Big Jake", a rancher estranged from his family. When grandson "Little Jake" is kidnapped, the elder Jake leads takes a crew (including sons) out to rescue the kid. The sons he takes are the uncles, by the way, of the boy. Bobby Vinton play's the kid's father, but he's left behind.There is some "generation gap" stuff going on between Mr. Wayne and his sons (one of whom is Robert Mitchum's son, actually). Maureen O'Hara appears briefly. It's very typical and predictable. Wayne has a hair raising shower scene, but his hair stays on (don't worry). The ending is exciting - predictably successful, with a touch of sadness.More bloody than other Waynes, with some questionable casting decisions. ***** Big Jake (1971) George Sherman ~ John Wayne, Richard Boone, Patrick Wayne</fullReview>

Wayne plays virtually the same character he's played in most of his films, the do gooder gunfighter who everyone knows and is afraid of. But no one plays that character better than Wayne. Some of the dialog is snappy and well written, while other scenes are so stupid and unbelievable (the convenient finding of two saddles, the sons hiding in the bushes while Wayne talks to Richard Boone for the first time, yet *not* noticing the two strangers hiding in the bushes too). It's still an entertaining film and I just loved the dog (reminiscent of the dog in Hondo). This is an example of a good western, probably at the end of the age of the great westerns. It's also one of the few films I remember seeing in a theater when I was a little kid. We saw this at a drive in with "Little Big Man."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent western from Duke's later years. In the early 1900s, Jacob McCandles (John Wayne) sets out to rescue his grandson from kidnappers led by John Fain (Richard Boone). On the journey he gets to know his two grown sons (Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum) he hasn't seen in nearly a decade. This one's lots of fun. Richard Boone makes for a great villain. One of the few villains Duke ever had in his films that seemed close to a match for him. Maureen O'Hara plays Duke's wife in their last movie together. Duke's longtime friend and frequent costar Bruce Cabot is very likable as Sam the Indian. This is one of those "death of the West/old vs new" stories that were all over the place in the '60s and '70s. Not surprisingly, Wayne made some of the best of those. It's a great western with some lighter moments, lots of action, and memorable tough guy lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bayshore NY drive-in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe it was the last film I saw in the old Bayshore 5th avenue drive-in (not the bayshore sunrise drive-in). Websites claim the drive-in's last season was 1964, but to those that remember it closed much later. I think during or after that summer (1971)when the screen was torn in half by a tree after a storm. Either way, this film was a good old-fashioned western that came out in a time when westerns became revisionist garbage ("Doc"), or had political undertones that paralleled the view of some on the Vietnam war (Ulzana's raid, soldier blue, pat garrett and billy the kid)- not to say these were bad films, but it was the direction many films were going at that time. "Big Jake" made a statement about the changing times and how certain old tried-and-true methods were tried-and-true for a reason. Wayne knew full well what he was doing; his popularity was so for many reasons, one of which was tried-and-true movie-making. Good was good, bad was bad and people just wanted to sit back and enjoy rooting for the hero. This is not to say he didn't make westerns with gray areas, but when he did it was more a case in character study than political statements for the purpose of revision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Jake (1971)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(6/10) Conflicting opinions on this western, although it is slightly above average than most western films in the early seventies. Movie started off strong, including a very entertaining opening montage that highlighted life in 1909. The final shootout was one of Wayne's best in his later westerns, and I appreciated the bloody and dark tones that were missing in many of Duke's pictures. Middle part of the film drug on with less than inspiring performances by Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum, although Boone played a nice villain. Lacked originality is comparison to other Wayne westerns: kidnap/rescue plot from The Searchers, dog as a partner like in Hondo, etc. Disappointed that O'Hara was in MIA after the first thirty minutes and the film ended too abruptly failing to resolve several issues such as the fate of Big Jake's son who was shot in the beginning. Highlight of the film was when Wayne's real life son playing Little Jake first met Big Jake and asked if he was his grandpa.</fullReview>

In the early scene with the sheepherder, Dog appears to be a solid black collie. In the end of the scene in which Christopher Mitchum plays dead and Wayne slugs him for it, Dog appears to be a bright brown color with a wide swatch of blue or blue merle around his neck and down into his ruff. At other times, Dog appears to be solid dark brown. I've seen blue merle collies before, but I've never seen one that blended blue and brown like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>needs to be darker and bloodier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1909. A gang of outlaws from various background led by John Fain (Richard Boone) attack the McCandles ranch. They kidnap little Jacob McCandles for ransom. Grandmother Martha (Maureen O'Hara) is offered help from the Army and the Texas Rangers but she decides to call on her estrange husband Big Jake (John Wayne). He is a legendary gunfighter and "an extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of man to see it through." Martha gives him a million dollar for the ransom. His son James doesn't like him not having seen him for almost ten years. His other son Michael rides up on a motorcycle with a visual sighting of Jacob. While everybody takes off to hunt down the bandits, Big Jake goes by himself with the money on horseback. An aging Apache friend Sam Sharpnose joins him. The mechanized group is ambushed and their cars are all out of commission. Big Jake finds the group stranded. Michael angrily joins Jake and they find James with his crashed motorcycle.This should be much darker and bloodier. It takes too many detours into comedy which never actually pays off. It's like the movie forgets about the kidnapped boy. This is a lower grade western which seems to be from another era. The formula is getting as old as John Wayne. When the action and the story twist comes, it's not half bad. It just needs to stay out of the comedy. There's nothing funny about the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Duke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big John Wayne had a normal screen persona by this time and he rarely tried for much else. He was the relaxed, authoritative, retrograde man of action -- slow to wrath but volcanic once aroused. It wasn't that he couldn't play any other roles. He was quite different in films like "Red River," "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," and "True Grit." In earlier works like "The Wake of the Red Witch," he could seem positively mean. He may have been incapable of playing, say, a coward or a child molester, but he could stretch when he wanted to.He just didn't want to. He was an icon of vernacular culture and felt that he would be providing the public with a poor role model if he played a weakling. (His lung cancer was at first concealed from the public.) And, secondly, he believed his audiences wanted to see his usual self on the screen, as we see it here in "Big Jake." So both moral and commercial considerations were involved. What's visible here is Duke's default setting. Richard Boone and his gang kidnap Wayne's grandson, Ethan Wayne, and Duke and a handful of companeros track them down to deliver the ransom and precipitate a final shootout. The shootout is the most exciting part of the movie, resembling that in "The Sand Pebbles," though not nearly as well done.It's 1909. Pavlova is famous. Caruso is singing at the Met. The Texas Rangers try to follow the kidnappers in motor cars and some carry new-fangled gas-operated semi-automatic repeating pistols. But Duke will have none of that. He rides a mule and trails two others, one carrying a million dollars in ransom. I mean, Wayne has a dog named "Dog," so what do you want? "Old Yeller"? "Blue"? You will never find THIS Duke with a dog named anything like "Agamemnon" or "Siwash." The script has some comic moment and some dramatic, but they aren't too well blended. By the climax, we don't know what to expect -- farce or tragedy. Actually, as it turns out, it's neither. The Indian and "Dog" are lost, but the bad guys are all gone and the principals survive. The last line is, "Let's go home." Award for Best Performance in a Routine Western goes to -- envelope please -- thank you -- Richard BOONE as the puffy-faced, squint-eyed villain and the single most expressive features on the screen! First Runner Up: An almost unrecognizably grizzled Harry Carey, Jr. Worst Performance -- no need for an envelope -- Patrick Wayne as Duke's son, which he was in real life. Not a line is believable. First Runner Up: Chris Mitchum. Come to think of it, "Dog" isn't bad either. Not for a dog, anyway. When he's wounded, he gives an extremely good impression of crawling along painfully on his belly -- extremely good for a dog, anyway. Maureen O'Hara has a few minutes of screen time at the beginning and she's good, as always, but make up has given her the beehive hair do that all the women in this movie wear, and it's unbecoming. We need those Titian curls cascading down her cheeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in this one. The movie moved at a good pace and the blending of technology and the west in 1909 was interesting but the acting by Mitchum stunk up the whole film. The motorcycle scene during the shootout and the soundtrack of the film was a rip off of The Great Escape. Also, while motorcycles may have been around in 1909, I doubt they were of caliber to make jumps across boulders and ravines.Also, Wayne's constant reference to his dog as "Dog" was suppose to provide a little comic relief I suppose but it grew old after a while.Also, when Richard Boone's ransom note demanded $1 million dollars, I immediately thought of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers. I doubt gangs in 1909 would demand that much. I could be wrong but I see a ransom request of $200k or $300k to be more believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I sit here thinking about the movie, the question that keeps popping up is 'who was Little Jake's father?'. At the shootout to end the story, he calls James (Patrick Wayne) 'Uncle Jim', and Michael (Christopher Mitchum) was obviously too young. Process of elimination would make the wounded McCandles brother Jeff (Bobby Vinton) his Dad, but that was never firmly established, and I don't recall Jeff ever reacting to the kidnapping like Jake was his own son. So what gives? If anyone can answer, we can start in on who was Little Jake's mother.I liked the way the story mixed in elements of humor to move the story forward. The buckshot butt scene was comical, and hearing John Wayne sing in Spanish in the shower was a bit offbeat for the film star. I don't think I've ever seen Wayne sing in a picture, so that was an interesting touch. Dog's (Dog?) role was a welcome addition to the story too, but it was a little distracting whenever his coloration seemed to change from time to time. Still, a dog that loyal comes highly recommended.I'm on record in some of my other reviews for preferring the old Paladin himself, Richard Boone as a Western villain. He seems more colorful as an outlaw and certainly has the craggy features to pull off the bad guy role. His 'thought you were dead' line to Big Jake at the finale was priceless; the film needed that closure to fulfill one of Big Jake's promises earlier in the story.All in all a decent John Wayne Western, establishing his character right up there with the likes of J.D. Cahill and Rooster Cogburn. Now if we can get the Little Jake mystery cleared up we'd be all set.</fullReview>

The story is simple,a person asked by his ex-wife to save her grandson from Bandits who have demanded ransom, but it was entertaining at the same time which was complimented well with acting. The role of was a tailor made for Duke. Hadn't he been in this movie then it wouldn't have been worth watching it. The supporting cast of Patrick Wayne,Christopher Mitchum and Bruce Cabot was excellent. The Richard Boone as the villain was also tremendous and was on par with Duke. The action scenes were first rate and funny. Along with The Shootist and Cowboys this movie can be ranked as one of the best film of Duke of his later career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal cattleman and gunslinger rediscovers his estranged sons and wife, and helps wipe out a murdering bandit gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne, now in his 60s, plays a crude version of Ben Cartwright(TV's Bonanza), in rediscovering his abandoned Texas cattle ranching family, after a 10year absence, and helps rescue his grandson from a very violent bandit gang. The latter, instead of merely rustling cattle, kill most of his wife's firearm-incompetent hands(her 2 sons conveniently escaping serious harm), and kidnap his grandson for a whopping(especially in those days) $1 million ransom. Seems his wife Martha(Maureen O'Hara) had been a very savvy ranch manager in his absence, and claims that losing $1 million will not set her back too much(hardly believable unless she is pumping lots of oil too). She sends for Jake to deliver the chest supposedly containing the greenbacks, trusting no one else to do the job right. Of course, there will be an attempt to do in the bandits instead, without getting their grandson killed. Martha OKs a plan to ambush the bandits, using Texas Rangers touring cars to get there fast. Jake doesn't like it. It turns into a disaster(as Jake presumably predicted), as the would be bushwhackers get wacked on the way, instead. The message is that modern mechanical technology is not always appropriate in this frontier environment... Be prepared to see a lot of red dye on shirts and pants. A lot of people get shot, often multiple times, sometimes dying, sometimes only wounded. In some respects, it reminds us of "McLintock", also produced by Wayne's company: Batjac, 8 years previously. However, this time it's Wayne's character, rather than Maureen's character, who returns to their ranch home after a long estrangement. Wayne's interactions with his sons and grandson, rather than with his wife and daughter(as in "McLintock'), is at the heart of the story. Although she dominates much of the first portion of the film, Maureen disappears after the men leave to try to recover the grandson. In contrast to "McLintock", there is a spirit of temporary cooperation, rather than emphasizing the personality clashes between Wayne's and Maureen's characters. However, unlike in "McLintock", there is no hint of an eventual romantic reconciliation. Also, the abundant gunplay, killings and woundings, is in marked contrast to "McLintock". Two of Wayne's actual sons play one of his sons or grandson, while one of Robert Mitchum's sons plays Jake's other son(the one who arrives on a motorcycle). The following year, Wayne again starred as a father figure, albeit quite different, in another coming of age film ; "The Cowboys". I prefer that film, despite its implausibility. Richard Boone plays his usual villainous role in the present film. Bruce Dern was much more interesting as the demented leader of the baddies in "The Cowboys" . "McClintock" and "The Cowboys" are much better and more original films than the present one.Wayne plays one of his most blustering and violent characters, ordering people around he doesn't know, slapping and punching his sons or others on occasion to show who's boss, and intimidating most just by his past reputation. Not the most appealing guy to have around, but he usually gets the job done. Some John Ford-type humor is included here and there. However, there is no romantic aspect involving Jake or his sons. This was the last non-TV film directing job by veteran George Sherman, who was sometimes too sick to perform his function, resulting in Wayne sometimes being the functional director. Sherman specialized in directing mostly 'second feature' films. However, two of them; "Against All Flags" and "Comanche Territory" are among my favorite film roles for Maureen. As in the present film, she is in a normally male role as a powerful leader or manager.As some others have pointed out, the dialog often comes across as stilted, and the acting generally is mediocre. The 'good guys' seem incapable of harming the bandits 'til the final showdown, when they all of sudden find their targets or find other ways to kill all the baddies, thus saving the justice system considerable trouble.We first encounter Jake muttering to his dog and horse, spying on a curious sight in an open field, with a single tree in the center. A man is about to be hanged on that tree by 3 men. Jake rides in to disturb the proceedings. He learns that the victim's crime is being a sheepherder in cattle country. He uses his reputation as a feared gunslinger and an attack by 'dog' to bully the cattlemen into releasing the shepherd and his young son, provided their sheep are moved elsewhere. This episode presumably functions to give us the idea, which Jake later claims, that his predilection for violence usually is for a good purpose. 'Dog' apparently is the collie 'Lassie', who has been dyed blackish to provide a sinister wolf-like impression. Soon after, a Mexican rider meets Jake riding alone on the range, giving him a brief written message request from Martha that he is needed at home, with no explanation why. He nods OK. Next thing we know, he arrives at their ranch by train. Unlikely for a man who hasn't communicated with his family for 10 years! Meanwhile, the bandits have been waiting for their ransom money, apparently without lawmen on their tail for their many recent murders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the grandson of beautiful Maureen O'Hara and her estranged husband John Wayne is kidnapped, Wayne re-appears after being believed by many people other than his wife to be dead. He joins his sons (Bobby Vinton, Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum) to find the nasty gang (lead by Richard Boone) who are holding him hostage out of vengeance. Wayne and sons fight the villains tooth and nail, and Wayne gets to show a sentimental side for both the wife he still loves and the grandson he never knew.The focus may be on the family, but the style is violence. Boone and his men are evil renegades, and Wayne and sons represent old-fashioned goodness. The conflict is there, the heroes all rugged and handsome, and the wasted O'Hara undeniably one of the most beautiful veteran actresses still working in the 1970's. You can't take your eyes off her for her fleeting time on screen, and wish she was there more. The final battle between the two groups goes on far too long, and the situation with Wayne and O'Hara is never resolved, leading the viewer to make their own conclusions. In spite of that, it is hard not to like the film, even if this is one of Wayne's bloodier westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the lesser latter-day Wayne Westerns, but still amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1971, "Big Jake" is a Western starring John Wayne in the titular role. His grandson is kidnapped by a ruthless band of cutthroats, led by Richard Boone, and taken to Mexico where they await the ransom money. Jake teams up with his estranged sons, whom he hasn't seen for ten years (Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum), to rescue the kid (Ethan Wayne). The magnificent Maureen O'Hara plays Jakes long-lost wife, but her role is limited to a glorified cameo in the opening reel.Some of The Duke's best Westerns were in his last decade, like "True Grit" (1969), "The Cowboys" (1972), "The Shootist" (1976), "Chisum" (1970) and even oaters like "El Dorado" (1966), but "Big Jake" isn't one of 'em. It's definitely likable, like most of Wayne's Westerns, and it has its highlights, like the almost shocking opening raid (marred by incredibly fake-looking blood). It's also unique in that it takes place in 1909 and there are quite a few sequences with old automobiles and a motorcycle, which isn't typical of Westerns. Unfortunately the mid-section fails to thoroughly captivate, but it is entertaining having John and the underrated Patrick working together; and Mitchum is charismatic as well.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in the Durango, Mexico area.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent But Above-Average Wayne Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several things about director George Sherman's last western shoot'em-up "Big Jake" are significant. First, this represented the last time John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara co-starred in a film. Earlier, Wayne and O'Hara made "Rio Grande" (1950), "The Quiet Man" (1952), "The Wings of Eagles" (1957), and "McLintock!" (1963). O'Hara has two scenes in "Big Jake," but she appears in only one with the Duke. Second, this was the tenth and last time Wayne and Sherman worked together. Sherman had called the shots on several strictly average "Three Mesquiteers" B-movie westerns with Wayne for Republic Studios back in the late 1930s. Reportedly, Wayne stepped in to helm some scenes when the ailing Sherman could not. Third, this oater also re-teamed Wayne with a poncho-clad Richard Boone as an unsavory main villain. Previously, they appeared together in "The Alamo" (1960) and ultimately confronted each other again in a bar room shoot-out in Wayne's final western "The Shootist" (1976). "Dirty Harry" scenarists Harry Julian Fink and Rita M. Fink penned the entertaining but formulaic screenplay about the kidnapping of a wealthy but aging cattleman's grandson. Indeed, the villains are a dastardly bunch, and they give our the heroes a difficult time. As "Big Jake," John Wayne spends most of his time riding around Mexico trying to keep himself and his two inexperienced sons alive. Although this is largely a traditional Wayne western, "Big Jake" pits the weapons and transportation of an old-fashioned western (horses, revolvers, and shotguns) against the new-fangled western where people ride in cars or on motorcycles and wield automatic weapons. Predictably, 'Big' Jake wins the day with his old-fashioned approach. Sherman does a solid job of establishing the setting of this sagebrusher and the time period with a lengthy prologue. John Fain (Richard Boone) leads a gang of murderous cutthroats who raid the McCandles ranch. This opening shoot-out qualifies as the bloodiest gunfight in a Wayne western. When bullets hit bodies, huge smears of red paint appear. Remember, the Duke objected to those exploding blood squibs in Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" and described them as "obscene." Since most of the ranch hands are away on a cattle round-up, Fain and his trigger-happy gunmen have little trouble when they start blasting away after some friendly conversation with the foreman. Without a qualm, they wound and/or kill ten men, women and children. They wound McCandles' eldest son Jeff (Bobby Vinton of "Surf Party") and kidnap his eight-year old grandson (Ethan Wayne) and then post a ransom of $1 million. 'Big' Jake McCandles' wife, Martha (Maureen O'Hara of "The Quiet Man"), summons her husband through some messengers. They meet at a railway station, and she hands him the ransom note. Jake and Martha have been estranged for almost a decade, but they both love little Jake, and 'Big Jake' vows to bring him back. Waiting for their father at the depot are sons James McCandles (real-life son Patrick Wayne of "The Alamo") and Michael (Christopher Mitchum of "Rio Lobo") and their reception is soured by James' sarcasm toward his father. James calls him "Daddy" in a snide voice, and Jake pulls him off his horse and hurls him into a mud puddle. Jake informs James in no uncertain terms: "You can call Dad, you can call me Father, you can call me Jacob and you can call me Jake. You can call me a dirty old son-of-a-bitch, but if you EVER call me Daddy again, I'll finish this fight." Jake takes custody of a huge red strongbox with a million dollars in it and rides off with his old friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot of "King Kong") while James and Michael follow Buck and the Texas Rangers.A conventional and often predictable oater, "Big Jake" springs no real surprises. The revelation about an hour into the action that our heroes have been guarding a strong box that contains nothing but paper clippings comes as no surprise. No sooner have Buck and the Texas Rangers entered Mexico than Fain's men ambush them, kill three of them, and riddle their cars with gunfire. Meanwhile, it appears that Michael has been shot because he crashes his motorcycle and lays sprawled in the dust. Jake is more surprised than we are when his son gets back up. Naturally, this calls for Wayne to punch Michael's lights out. Jake leaves the Texas Rangers to fend for themselves while he rides off to the rendezvous with Fain. At about a hour into the plot, Jake and Fain meet in Jake's camp. Fain instructs them to go to the nearby Mexican town of Escondero and await their orders. Later that evening, gunmen try to storm room number eight where our heroes are lying in wait for them. Jake, James, and Sam leave Michael alone in the room. Jake stages a distraction so Sam can slip back into the room, while James guns down to bullies in the saloon with his automatic pistol. Not long afterward, a suspicious Pop Dawson fetches Jake and company and they ride out to meet Fain and ransom the youngster. It is a classic stand-off again when Fain and Jake confront each other with Little Jake in plain sight. Michael has ascended to the top of water tower and uses his high-powered rifle to knock out a sniper in an adjacent belfry. What started as an interesting scene degenerates into a free-for-all shoot-out without a shred of suspense. The brute with a machete manages to slash poor old Sam to death and later kills the dog. Jake throws a lantern at Fain and lights him up before he perforates him with a bullet. No sooner has Little Jake been reunited with his family than the film freeze-frames them and comes to an end."Big Jake" qualifies as an above-average Wayne effort with more blood than usual, and the Duke makes a memorable entrance that overshadows everything that follows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is John Wayne at his best, late in his career. He plays a crusty old coot to perfection. His character is larger than life, as Wayne himself was. The cheesy music and inclusion of the stiff acting of his and Mitchum's kids are the only drawbacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor acting, poor production values, good script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It just amazes me that Hollywood could get away with the poor production values such as found in this movie.Guess the big names are what sold the movie.It looks like they did every scene in just one take!Bad acting pretty much all around. Chris Mitchum is especially bad. Goes to shows that getting work in the movies is all about who you know, not how good you are.Boone was good, real good.good script and dialogue. It is good that the "values" espoused by Wayne are no longer as much in vogue as they were when this movie was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked most about this movie is that I wound up rooting for the outlaws as much as for Rooster. I thought Jeremy Slate was very funny as Emmet Quincy, and Robert Duval was excellent as Ned Pepper. Pepper was one of the most likeable and fair villians i can remember in this type of western.Despite the fact that they were both killers, there was apart of me that hoped they'd get away, or at least die well. (Pepper definitley did). Hey we knew Rooster would be back in the sequel anyway.Along with his character in The Searchers and The Quiet Man, Rooster Cogburn is one of Wayne's best and most fleshed-out characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If John Wayne didn't seem like the lousiest, stiffest actor on Earth before, he sure proves he is here. And if that weren't enough, he drags his poor son into this corn ball fest and in the process proves the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Big Jake is one large blob of ham, cheese, hilarious stereotypes, amateur dialog, lousy acting and some of the worst sound dubbing this side of a high school review. I'm not sure what the need for this film was other than to illustrate how a whole movie set could be constructed out of balsa wood. But just try not to enjoy it. It's as guilty a pleasure as watching a Brady Bunch Musical.</fullReview>
