		<shortDescription>A gently comedic story of love and deceit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perpetuating little white lies is part of everyday life and keeps society ticking over. But to what point is it acceptable to massage an ego with a dirty black lie. A real whopper. And is such a lie perpetuated by love? Greed? Or the pursuit of personal glory? This is the rather subtle sub-text behind the story of Florence Foster Jenkins.Based on a true story, Florence Foster Jenkins tells the story of a truly awful singer (Meryl Streep), cossetted in her closed world of a 1944 New York hotel and pampered by her husband St Clair Mayfield (Hugh Grant), who is otherwise entwined with the sensuous Kathleen (Rebecca Ferguson). Together with ex-actor Mayfield, the wealthy Florence is the co-star of the show at her self-owned "Verdi Club" where she has a non-speaking role enacting various 'tableau' scenes. But in the interests of following her dreams she recruits the help of famous singing instructor Carlo Edwards (the marvellous David Haig) and an enthusiastic and personable young pianist Cosme McMoon (Simon Helberg, "The Big Bang Theory"). Carlo is aware of what he is in for (he wants to keep the arrangement 'on the quiet'); Cosme is not (to great comic effect).This classic re-telling of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' ultimately takes us on a journey to a packed concert at the Carnegie Hall, where many of the tickets have been given away to rowdy and drunk servicemen. It's impossible to describe a film as "delightful? just delightful" without hearing the velvety tones of Hugh Grant saying those words. But that's what it is. A treat of moving and at times wildly funny storytelling from director Stephen Frears ("Philomena", "The Queen") that just works from beginning to end.Meryl Streep is just glorious in the titular role, oozing charm. Those UK readers will probably fondly remember the piano playing 'skills' of the late, great comedian Les Dawson (google it for a youtube clip) who had to be an absolutely brilliant pianist to be able to deliberately play so badly. In a similar way, we know (from the likes of "Mamma Mia") that Streep knows how to belt out a good tune, so it requires some considerable skill to deliver Florence's songs as well (or as badly) as she does. Bravo Ms Streep, Bravo!And Hugh Grant is often quite unfairly criticized for playing Hugh Grant in every movie (as if Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford are much different?), but here he turns in a totally sterling performance. The drivers behind Mayfield's character are never totally clear (and I won't spoil that here), but in the final reel the motivating factor becomes crystal clear, and Grant has never been better. (Bravo Mr Grant, Bravo!).To round off the accolades for the lead performances, Simon Helberg turns in a genius comic performance as the goggle-eyed pianist, who lights up every scene he's in and delivers his lines (e.g. one about a naval encounter) with perfect comic timing. Shining again in a supporting role is Rebecca Ferguson ("Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation") who once again is dazzling. Among the bright young acting newcomers of the likes of Vikander and Rooney, Ferguson (who is approaching her mid-30s) brings a level of sophisticated glamour and maturity to the screen that is strongly reminiscent of the great starlets of the 1940's and 50's like Kathrine Hepburn or Lana Turner. She is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses. Also worthy of note is Nina Arianda as gold- digging starlet Agnes Stark ? effectively playing (at least at first) the "little boy in the crowd" in the Emperor's fable.Written by TV-writer Nicholas Martin in his big-screen debut, the story is slowly and subtly unwoven, only progressively revealing the plot points in an intelligent manner. Other screenwriters take note: this is how to do it.Cinematography is by the great Danny Cohen ("The Danish Girl"; "Room") and with the Production Design, Costuming and Special effects crew 1940's New York is vibrantly brought to life. While the film's leisurely pace might make the younger set fidgety, this is a treat particularly for older viewers looking for a great night out at the cinema. The film got a good old-fashioned round of applause at my showing when the credits came up. "Delightful? just delightful". Go see it.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review and to comment with your thoughts. Thanks).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic tale about mental illness told on an operatically grand scale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Genre labels shape your expectations of a movie but they are also manipulated by promoters to influence audience response. Both Marguerite (2016) and Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) are being sold as "hilarious comedies" whereas in reality they both tell a sad story of self-deception and mental frailty, albeit in funny ways. Marguerite is a comedy of manners, while Florence is a tragi- comedy, the genre that shows the sad truth behind the apparently ridiculous. Both films are bio- pics, with one satirising vanity the other telling a tragic tale about a mental illness that is displayed on an operatically grand scale.Unlike the fictitious Marguerite who is 'loosely based' on the real person, Florence is closely based on the wealthy and generous arts socialite Florence Foster Jenkins who came to public notoriety when she hired Carnegie Hall for her operatic recitals in 1944. Both films (and still available YouTube recordings) show the full force of how badly the real Florence sang, but that's where the similarity ends. Early in the film we learn that Florence (Meryl Streep) has defied medical science by living well beyond the usual lifespan of a syphilis victim, a disease she contracted on marrying when 18 years old. She endured decades of archaic mercury and arsenic medication with progressive loss of mental functions and chronic exhaustion. Her second marriage remained celibate by mutual agreement and her husband (Hugh Grant) was free to have affairs but was devotedly protective of Florence. The cinematic impact of these facts change the film from a satire to a study of pathos and tragedy as Florence is seriously unwell and singing is the only thing keeping her alive.While Marguerite amplifies the ridiculous as seen from the other side of the Atlantic, Florence is an American-owned story and any ridicule is tempered with compassion. The combined acting virtuosity of icons Streep and Grant will most likely earn the film Academy nominations as these timeless stars are superb in their parts and their chemistry together is wonderful. Top production values are evident in the period set and costumes, and the whole film has an elegant authenticity that underscores the seriousness of mental degeneration, whether its on the stage of Carnegie Hall or elsewhere. Audiences might leave cinemas still chuckling at the singing of Marguerite and Florence, but many will leave Florence with sympathy for her desperate desire to be something that nature made impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near career best performance from Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely only those with some knowledge of musical history and consequently at least some love of music, or perhaps a penchant for eccentricity like myself, will ever have heard of Florence Foster Jenkins, reputedly the world's worst singer, so without a ready-made audience why a biopic now, (two, if you count the new French film "Marguerite")? Maybe someone somewhere saw in this tale of a deluded grande dame a star vehicle for a talented actress of a certain age as well as an audience-pleasing combination of comedy and pathos and that's exactly what you get. No real knowledge of the subject is necessary to enjoy Stephen Frears' hugely enjoyable biopic "Florence Foster Jenkins" which combines comedy, pathos and a close to career best performance from Meryl Streep, (who else), to terrific effect and if you think Streep can play anything, in her sleep if necessary, pause a moment. On a technical level she may be the most versatile actress in the world but much too often she's been accused of failing to connect on an emotional level. I've always felt her Margaret Thatcher a great piece of mimicry but hardly worthy of a third Oscar and there are those who will claim that her Florence Foster Jenkins is nothing more than a shameless ploy for that elusive fourth Oscar. I will simply say that if she is to win that fourth Oscar surely it has to be for this great performance. Streep clicks on every level; this a tragic-comic performance of the first water in which Meryl never puts a foot wrong and yes, technically it's a marvel too with Streep doing her own appallingly off-key singing, (no mean feat for an actress with a superb voice). This isn't just the best thing she's done since "Doubt" but one of the best things she's ever done.Amazingly it isn't all a one-woman show; the big revelation here is Hugh Grant as Jenkins' husband, the man who loves her, you might say exploits her, and does his best to protect her. It's the least Hugh Grant-like performance of his career and he's never been better. Likewise "The Big Bang Theory's" Simon Helberg as Cosme McMoon, Jenkins' accompanist, is outstanding in a difficult role. It's also beautifully written by Nicholas Martin, looks great, (the period detail is spot on), and is very well directed by Frears. As we head into the silly season of superhero blockbusters and the kind of of films designed to keep the kids quiet in the summer months this splendid biography may be the last good movie we will see at our multiplexes for months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - moving and melancholic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, in my opinion, is mislabeled. The trailers would lead you to believe it's a hilarious comedy about an old crazy woman who dreams of being a singer despite being tone-deaf. There are elements of that, of course, but it has much more to it than just that.Don't get me wrong, there are a fair few funny moments, especially the first time we hear Jenkins screeching wildly, and watching McMoon desperately contain his laughter. These successes are partially due to Nicholas Martin's organic and genuine screenplay, but mostly down to great casting (apart from some of the terrible secondary characters!). Simon Helberg is fantastic as the competent and camp young pianist, and Hugh Grant gives his best performance in years as Jenkins' devoted husband. But the movie belongs to Meryl Streep, who once again proves that nothing is beyond her. Each word she smoothly speaks, or screechingly screams, feels like her own as she embodies "the world's worst singer".Technically, the movie is impressive too. The 1940s mis-en-scene is brilliant, from the outrageous outfits to the elegant decor and old-fashioned automobiles that inhabit wartime New York. Cohen's cinematography and Bonelli's editing keep the film moving (physically and emotionally), but Stephen Frears is the true genius, taking a story which could have been boring and turning it into something engaging.As with Philomena, Frears has taken a sad, gentle, tender story and made it surprisingly feel-good, fun and enjoyable without shying away from the melancholy.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing badly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something rather wonderful about people who manage to do things incredibly badly - William MacGonagall, the world's worst poet, and Eddie the Eagle Edwards, the world's worst ski-jumper, spring to mind; but Florence Foster Jenkins is in the pantheon as the world's worst singer. I have a CD of the few recordings she made, and not the least remarkable aspect of Meryl Streep's performance is that she superbly captures La Jenkin's extraordinary singing voice. This, however, is only one part of a beautiful performance, in which Streep gives us a touchingly vulnerable Jenkins. I saw this film expecting to laugh - and indeed there are some great comic moments. What I didn't expect, however, was to find myself sympathising with the title character so much, to the extent that I found myself rooting for her - not to give a magnificent recital, but at least to BELIEVE that she had. Hugh Grant plays Jenkins' sort-of husband (they never actually married in real life, though the film implies that they did) and manager. It's a fine performance, and he's lost none of his ease with comic scenes. He also has some heartwarmingly touching scenes in which he gives Jenkins the (platonic) love she is so desperate for, and when he tries to shield her from the truth. Even so, I was never quite sure how to reconcile this side of his character with the double-life he leads without Jenkins' knowledge. Simon Helberg is excellent as Jenkins' much put-upon accompanist, and Nina Arianda provides a good turn as a gold-digger who displays some unexpected heart. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 May 2016 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Florence Foster Jenkins. I was very much looking forward to this film, and it did not disappoint. It is the story of Florence, a woman devoted to music and passionate about singing. Unfortunately she cannot sing. Money however seems to buy you what you want and Florence hires the best teacher and along with a pianist (played by Howard from The Big Bang Theory, and quite wonderfully too) strives for her dreams in a very single minded fashion. Streep is the most versatile and accomplished actress of her generation and as we have seen many times before can turn her hand to practically anything. Hugh Grant who usually bumbles his way through a film with his Britishness and buffoonery came across as a tender and caring man who loved his wife deeply, and would do anything to prevent her from being hurt. Along with a simply spiffing score this film was a delight from start to finish, all the more poignant because it was based on a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and emotional drama with many laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins is a wealthy New Yorker who lives for music. Her husband StClair enthusiastically indulges her passion: she sings for the musical appreciation club she has created, and they all love her. The only thing is, well, she's not very good. But she's harmless and kind and tries her very best, so everyone (including her new pianist accompanist, Cosme McMoon) goes along with her. And she doesn't seem to be aware (or worried) about the fact that St Clair spends very night at another apartment with his mistress.Based on a real person, this film tells the story of a woman whose talent so woefully falls short of her ambition that the result is funny, yet she would be mortified if she realised that is what people actually thought. StClair cushions her from the unkindness which would otherwise come her way: this protects her, but also encourages her to push her (lack of) talent further, to the extent that she arranges a concert at Carnegie Hall which will inevitably expose her to press hostility. This is the dramatic heart of the film, the story of which is otherwise relatively slight. Having said that, there is a similarity between this film and Eddie The Eagle ? superficially they appear to celebrate mediocrity but they actually celebrate the indomitability of the human spirit (see also Ed Wood).We already knew Meryl Streep can sing: here we found out how brilliantly she can't sing, too: this is an hilarious portrait of someone who specialises in being half a tone out just when she needed not to be, who knows what technique ought to be but can't actually manage it (but thinks she can). This is Les Dawson piano playing, parlayed into operetta. She makes Florence wonderfully human. I also loved Simon Helberg, going from Beatle-wigged nerd in The Big Band Theory to brilliantined accompanist with a very funny line in reaction shots. Oh, and the lad is not bad on piano either. There are some nice turns in the supporting cast, especially Nina Arianda as common-as-muck nouveau riche Brooklyn wife Agnes Stark.But, for me, this film belonged to Hugh Grant. His quasi-aristocratic StClair, gracefully (for the most part) balancing his support for Florence with his parallel life with mistress Kathleen, it is a nuanced performance of humour, skill and kindness ? I was never in doubt about how truly he loved Florence.This was an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when serious music is turned upside down?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on the true story of the New York socialite Florence Foster Jenkins. In 1944 she hired Carnegie Hall to perform as a soprano soloist. With no musical ability whatsoever but a large inheritance to enable her to indulge her love of performing, Florence Foster Jenkins becomes an unwitting musical clown which sustains the comedy throughout the film. The character is played with gentle comic affection by Meryl Streep.Hugh Grant is well cast as Florence's doting and enabling husband St Clair Bayfield. It is to Grant's charisma and acting ability that he is able to portray an adulterous scoundrel who is milking his wife's inheritance and turn it into a devoted and loving husband. His brilliant charm offensive is one of the remarkable things about the movie.Hazel Finn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fat lady sings!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kind of 'companion piece' to THE KING'S SPEECH. After the monarch who couldn't speak publicly we are invited to meet the soprano who should never have sung to an audience. This is the more-or-less true story of the 1940s New York socialite who seemingly did not know how monumentally awful her singing was. Florence Foster Jenkins was a Woman of Substance in more than one sense: a mega-rich heiress, built like a leaking sandbag and possessed of an immense ego.It's a gift of a part, and Meryl Streep goes for it at full throttle, combining elements of Ethel Merman, Hyacinth Bucket and Nellie Melba to stupendous effect. The supporting cast are also given juicy roles to wallow in and, boy, do they wallow! Hugh Grant's lightweight shtick works perfectly for Florence's second husband, who openly keeps a mistress but dotes like a puppy-dog on his ailing wife, indulging her musical delusion with a passion that fully matches her own. David Haig plays Florence's vocal coach in the manner of a pantomime horse.Simon Helberg steals many a scene as her gay accompanist who finds it hard to keep a straight face but comes to be caught up in the typhoon of Florence's enormous self-belief. There are some delicious cameos among the members of the New York elite who support the fantasy with varying degrees of sincerity. The finale, Florence's sell-out concert at Carnegie Hall is a comedic if not exactly a musical triumph.This is a slight story, crisply scripted, elegantly photographed and stylishly directed (by Stephen Frears). Streep steams through it like an ocean liner ? there's more than a hint of Queen Mary the 'former first lady' as well as Queen Mary the excessively luxurious vessel. Yet another Oscar could easily come her way. In Dustin Hoffman's QUARTET I felt slightly cheated that the principals never actually sang. Here you look forward with a kind of awed dread to the moments when the fat lady sings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film for the Subject It Covers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this, for its subject, a perfect film - an absolute delight from every possible viewpoint - the story and screenplay, the acting of everyone down to the most minor player, the gorgeous A production, the hilarity so well balanced by the bittersweet sadness of the story and life of its protagonist, the obvious love with which the entire project seems to have been imbued, etc. A few anachronisms and time lines are not fully defined: All of the action takes place in 1944, and while we learn that Madame Jenkins has been part of the musical scene in New York City for a long time, one gets the impression that singing is only a recently-acquired mania on her part; in actuality, she'd been doing private concerts for better than a quarter-century. Perhaps in an effort to not confront the age of the main characters in the story, she tells her doctor that she acquired her ruinous syphilitic condition at 18 and has lived with it for almost fifty years, thus indicating she is now in her mid-60s, but she was 76 in 1944. She tells how she met her 'husband' in 1919, but she actually met him in 1909, so that they have been together for 35 years (Mr. Grant's relative youthfulness in comparison to Madame Jenkins's age is never really commented upon, but he certainly would not have been able to carry off the illusion of a 35-year relationship looking like he does). Cosme McMoon did not come upon the Jenkins scene in 1944, but almost 15 years earlier, and had worked with her for years. Arturo Toscanini did not conduct the NBC Symphony for a youthful Lily Pons in 1944 (Pons was then 46) and he certainly did not need a thousand dollars from Jenkins to make that concert a reality; the NBC Symphony/Toscanini broadcasts were totally paid for by NBC and/or any sponsor the programs might pick up. Richard Crooks was not a host of The Voice of Firestone, but its leading tenor for many years, and he did not act as any kind of disc jockey on weekends (we are told that his constant playing of Jenkins's first record on the radio "over the weekend" vastly entertained the listening audience of American servicemen). I point out these straying-from-facts incidents only for the sake of accuracy; they do not impinge in any way on the totally joyful experience that this film constitutes, and the compression of many years of events helps lead more easily into the one great Carnegie Hall concert that is the centerpiece of the film. One expects great acting at all times from Meryl Streep, but Hugh Grant fully equals her in effectiveness, if not in the difficulty of achieving it, in his role as her only somewhat younger 'husband' (the real Bayfield was 69 in 1944). The actual story revolves as much, if not more, around him than it does around Jenkins. It is a beautifully judged and rendered performance, by far his best work in film, and he has been away much too long. The third lead, Simon Helberg as Cosme McMoon, has some of the funniest moments in the film, but by the end, he has eschewed a certain kind of comic shtick to present us with a very real character who, in his own way, loves his employer almost as much as does her 'husband'. Much has been written about Rebecca Ferguson as Bayfield's girlfriend on the side, but the other outstanding performance in this film actually belongs to Nina Arianda as the peroxide blonde wife of a rich businessman, totally uncultured, uncouth, loud and vulgar. You start out by hating her, but by the end of the film, she has proved to be one gutsy and lovable lady - besides which, she has the single funniest moment in the entire film, one that had the packed-house audience with which I viewed it in loud paroxysms of laughter. What makes the movie so sad while simultaneously inducing such hilarity is the perfect realization (thanks to that screenplay and Streep's uncanny way with lines) of just how much Jenkins loves music - not her singing in certain areas of it, but music itself. Her left hand having been partially incapacitated years earlier, at one point in the film, in her sole visit to McMoon's apartment, she sits and plays the right-hand portion of a Chopin piece while McMoon stands to her left and provides the left-hand portion she cannot even attempt. Her love of what she is playing, what she is hearing, and what such culture means to Humanity is quite overwhelming. Streep does all her own singing, and it is a dead-on impersonation of what we can hear of Jenkins, except that, when the real Jenkins is heard at the start of the closing credits, you realize that Streep, off-pitch vocalization, screams and all, still has more natural voice than did that dear and deluded society lady. Near the end, we are exposed to something involving the utmost in film imagination - Jenkins lying in bed, and hearing herself singing in her mind, with her voice not heard as others hear it, but as she has always heard it for herself - pitch-perfect, non-screaming, a valid interpretation - and this to a lovely concert piece now forgotten by all but collectors of vintage recordings, "When I Have Sung My Songs", by Ernest Charles. And, in case we've forgotten or have never known it, we realize that Streep can really sing beautifully in a light lyric soprano voice. Given the amount of talent she already possesses (she is surely the dominant actress of her time), it is almost insulting to the rest of us that she should be able to sing so well, too. I loved every minute of this film and cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good time with a lot of laughs and strong performances by Streep and Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was umming and ahing for quite some time whether to see this or not after first hearing about it, and once I saw the first trailer. But as it was directed by Stephen Frears, I felt that was enough to give it a go. Also, anything starring Meryl Streep is worth thinking about seeing at least. Also, the trailers seemed to purposefully hide her voice as that is the main part of the story. That was good marketing as I feel it will attract to hear how bad her voice really is.Some of you may have already seen a film earlier this year with the same story called Marguerite. Sadly, I did not. But it is always a fascinating thing when two films are released pretty close to each other talking about the same thing. One recent example was when Snow White And The Hunstman, and Mirror Mirror: The Untold Adventures Of Snow White were released in 2012 a couple of months apart. I don't know how these things happen, but it always a nice topic to discuss.It is not often that I see a film at the cinema that gives me a lot of laughs as most straight-out comedies do not appeal to me. But I can now add this one to the small list. I have been fascinated by this true story since I heard about this and Marguerite being made. The film does explain that in parts. But I think it is comedy that was winning me over early on. For the rest of the film, I had a big smile of my face and was pretty satisfied with how everything ended in the end.I really liked the old fashioned feel to it and I can see it being a big winner with the elderly cinema-goers. Also, the production design of the time period was great to look at. It is set in 1940's New York and it felt great to look at with the steam flying off the street and the style of cars was a delight to witness.Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant are wonderful together and are the biggest draw out of the other performances. I appreciate Streep's performances more than love them. However, I really liked this particular leading role. It is probably because the performances reminded me so much of the character of Hyacinth Bucket from the sitcom, Keeping Up Appearances. Hugh Grant was great and made me forget how good an actor he is, especially in comedies. His posh British voice fitted into the time period perfectly and you can feel that Grant was born into the wrong era. Simon Helberg was a real crowd-pleaser as the main supporting role. I was really happy to see Rebecca Ferguson back on the big screen. She was brilliant in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, and I am glad to see she her getting noticed.The only negatives worth mentioning was probably some of the running gags in the film felt like they were running out of steam towards the end. Also, there was a small part to Streep's character that I did not like about. So there was a part of the film where I could not sympathise to root for the character.But all in all, I had a very good time. It was certainly a good decision to go and see it in the end. It was a lot funner then I thought it would be and the strong performances of Streep and Grant certainly helped that. It does have a sitcom style of approach to the story and I think that will please the audience and will do well in the box office. However, I still don't feel that they explained how the main character became so popular or why she is much loved. But I will still recommend this, especially if you are in the mood for a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreams are worth living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most surprising film ever. You know it is about a woman who can't sing for toffee but who hosts huge concerts to not exactly appreciative audiences. Why on earth would this make for a compelling film? The surprising thing is that cast, script and direction are perfectly in tune with this compassionate biographical treatment of a woman driven to be the musician she dreams she is. Knocked by paternal disapproval, marital failure and physical illness, Florence 'thinks positive' and takes action. She knows what it is to suffer and is ready, at the drop of a hat, to do what she can to be of service to others via her self declared life-passion 'music'. It is both a joy and heart breaking to live in this woman's world. Meryl Streep is absolutely perfect in this role and makes this difficult story heart-rending and laugh out loud all at once. Definite go see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating biopic about "the worst singer of all time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins, to put it mildly, was a notoriously inept singer, often screeching her way through songs (a prime example being Queen of the Night's "Der Halle Rache") with no ear for intonation, tone, meaning of song/text or rhythm.It must not have been easy making Foster Jenkins somebody interesting or relatable, but 'Florence Foster Jenkins' manages to do so brilliantly. 'Florence Foster Jenkins' also does a much better job than most biopics to sticking close to the facts, having regard for historical accuracy, not leaving things rose-tinted and not having characters that are basically come and go vignettes.Admittedly, some characters are more developed and interesting than others and some have little screen time. However, this didn't come over as a huge problem in 'Florence Foster Jenkins' because everything else was so successful. The 40s period detail is evocative, sumptuous and extremely beautiful to look at, and the film is exquisitely photographed and tightly edited.The music is magnificent, with a score from Alexandre Desplat that fits superbly and sounds great on its own, Desplat's distinctively hypnotic style immediately recognisable. Also striking was how 'Florence Foster Jenkins' combined humour and pathos, it does so perfectly and both elements are brilliantly executed. The comedy is genuinely hilarious and the pathos masterfully moving. The direction does really well in making a potentially dull story dramatically engaging, warm and uplifting, one also admires Foster Jenkins' determination.Best of all is the acting. Meryl Streep's performance in the title role is a triumph, making her a compellingly real character and succeeds in intentionally singing badly despite that in real life Streep is a far better singer (almost anybody is, well apart from the TV talent show rejects). Hugh Grant's performance here is one of his best, perhaps his best since 'About a Boy' and he has rarely been more nuanced or sympathetic in a role very much removed from his usual romantic-comedy roles. Simon Helberg's supporting turn is spot-on, instead of being annoying or too effeminate Helberg is hilarious, suitably camp and loyal.Rebecca Ferguson similarly excels, David Haig relishes his deliciously shady and not too pantomimic role and Nina Arianda brings charm to a potentially shallow and irritating character. These roles are difficult to pull off but they are pulled off quite adeptly.In summary, entirely captivating. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Be Oscar Winners Galore Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, in my estimation, is the best picture ever from Streep and from Hugh Grant. Especially from Hugh Grant. His character in this movie had depth and honesty, you felt for and with him. It was acted to perfection. I loved this movie. It made me laugh a lot and cry a little. A gentle romance with both hilarious and heartrending overtones. Can't ask for more than that. Simon Helberg who portrayed Cosme McMoon, the pianist, was adorable and, as with the other two, was extremely well performed. Meryl Streep ? what can you say about Meryl Streep? Every role she takes on is memorable and unique. But this one is going to stay in my mind for a long time. Longer than any other I believe. And as my 10 star rating indicated, there was not one misstep here for me. If there were minute historical errors, who cares? They had to be so tiny as to make absolutely no difference to the excellence of this picture. Based on a true story of probably the world's worst singer - and if you check, you can actually buy a copy of the record of her performance. This one you really don't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Florence Foster Jenkins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins, is the wonderfully unique story of a New York heiress whose great love in life is music. She has several groups and gatherings that she goes to which are all dedicated to music and her lifelong dream is to be an operatic singer herself one day. Florence having the money and with the support of her husband, Clair, not only sets up music and singing lessons for herself, but also enlists the work of a young pianist named Cosme, so that she can step ever further to reaching her dreams of performing in front of others. The only problem comes with the fact that Florence is no Maria Callas, and her singing leaves a lot to be desired and in other words, she really can't sing. Clair is too loyal and loving to break the news to her and everyone else seems to be avoiding the issue as best they can until the time finally comes where Florence's dream of performing may well come true. But with everyone knowing that this is not really a gift she truly possesses will they tell her the truth and crush her dreams and determined spirit of reaching this goal, or will they sit on the sidelines and allow what could be harsh criticism, or even public embarrassment to follow? People who are familiar with this story (and as bizarre as it may sound it is a true story) may well know the outcome, but for the sake of viewers such as myself who have never been acquainted with this story, it truly is a remarkable story and also one of the year's strongest films. Florence is played by the ever capable Meryl Streep, who seems to pull off every role she attempts to great perfection and playing Florence Foster Jenkins is no exception. There is a reason why Streep is considered one of the greatest living actresses and she not only allows us to have a chuckle, or two at Florence when we first hear her sing, but she also gives so much more depth and insight into this character than you may be expecting. The film could have easily been a nasty, or derogative look at Florence by criticizing her lack of musical skill, but instead the film is really more of an encouraging and triumphant film about a woman who has had setbacks in life, but does not allow that to hamper, or turn her back on her dreams no matter what the cost. Even though we hear Florence's singing and know that it is nothing great, after a short while we soon stop laughing at her and go the exact opposite route by cheering her on and truly and sincerely wanting her to achieve her goals and hoping to ourselves that the end outcome will be a pleasant one. Florence is a woman with passion, but also deep down has great love and ambition for music and her love of it as well as truly loving Clair, although their relationship is at times a little complicated, which you will learn while watching the film. Clair is a fascinating character and in his own way has also tried out for the arts in his life, but in some ways similar to Florence, he has never truly achieved his dreams, or the breakout success that he was hoping for. While his relationship with Florence, is a tad unusual (again see the film), he is still a completely loving and doted husband to her. He will also stop at nothing to see Florence's dreams come true and if anyone says otherwise he will kindly pay them off in hopes of them thinking differently. Their marriage and screen chemistry together is really quite heartwarming at times about a couple who would do anything for each other and you can see that their love is definitely genuine. Hugh Grant, who plays Clair, went out of semi retirement to play this role for the simple reason of being able to act alongside Meryl Streep, and he gives what I think is one of his best all time performances. What a wonderful role and performance to come out of retirement for and he truly shines as a well intentioned man who has even better intentions and well wishes for what is ultimately best for his life partner, Florence. This is a film where every single performance from Streep, Grant and Helberg to the various supporting players are all superb and everyone does a fantastic job. The film also makes us want to stand up and cheer and support Florence every step of the way and again instead of being a judgmental, or critical film of her, you can tell that the filmmakers are also with her every step of the way as are we the audience and this is truly a inspiring film of reaching out and daring to dream no matter what anyone else says, or tells you that you cannot do. The rest is history and this is truly a story that needs to be told and one of the year's best films and a true triumph in every step of the way. Tremendously entertaining, well acted, filmed and also a film of hope and encouraging us all to reach for our best every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I thought it would be, in fact a very moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew the Florence Foster Jenkins records from college back in the 1960s, and a very little of her story. I guess I imagined this would be a raucous comedy making fun of a foolish and egotistical society woman - though why would Meryl Streep bother with that? I was wrong. While this movie is often very funny, it is also very moving, a good script well acted by Hugh Grant and very beautifully acted by Ms. Streep, who creates a moving human being out of someone who has been a caricature for decades.I was also impressed by the historical work done on the era, such as Richard Crooks' Firestone program on the radio.In short, this is a very well made movie, and definitely not just a bad joke. I have no idea if the story it tells is true, but I don't much care, either. The story is very moving, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another triumph for Merryl Streep!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard some old recordings of FFJ, I thought she was a silly, rich old cow who could not only afford to rent Carnegie Hall for a gig but also make records although being devoid of musical talent. What surprised me after watching this movie was how wrong my preconceived judgements of this lady were. In fact it's been a long time since such nice, lovable characters have been played so well on the screen. Merryl Streep, Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg are fantastic in revealing the hearts of these people. Florence as portrayed by acting genius Ms Streep, is a delightful, sentimental old thing who by film's end earns our laughter, respect and affection. And through the eyes of her husband Bayfield and accompanist Cosme, we the audience learn to love this optimistic, deluded diva. Big congratulations must also go to these actors for their 'extra' talents: MS for singing, HG for dancing, and SH for piano-playing. Old New York looks great &amp; authentic, and the bit-players: Toscanini and the vocal coach accurately show the ass-licking side of show biz in the classical music scene of the 40's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slightly Uncomfortable Comedy About Mental Illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is 1944 New York. Based on a true story. A rich elderly woman (Streep) infected with Syphillis at the age of 18 by her first husband. Indulges her whims in acting soiree's for high society friends. She is protected and indulged in this by her 2nd husband and failed actor St Clair (Grant) However, when she takes it into her head she can sing (encouraged in the delusion by paid flunkies) and arranges to sing to the public Grant can no longer protect her delusion. What I liked : The acting is all good, Streep really nails it and Hugh Grant is actually surprisingly convincing as the loving husband who tries so hard to protect and indulge his sick wife. Helger also shows he has a lot of acting skill other than being Howard Wolowitz from the big bang. There is some genuine laughs and comedy, the film does keep you absorbed throughout. There was nothing I really disliked, however the film starts as a comedy but as you realise you are laughing at mental illness caused presumably by syphillis and/or senility/dementia it feels somewhat uncomfortable. Good film overall, well worth watching in my opinion 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Streep's Most Wonderful Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep has been giving us master work after master work. Her versatility defies reason, and her ability to reach inside a character and bring it to life has no match. There have been great actresses who gave us two or three remarkable performance. Streep has shown how she can use a foreign accent or two, her chameleon skills to turn herself into a marked woman, a ruthless entrepreneur, a life loving spirit, a lover across time, a victim from the horrors of one of the worst periods in History. She brings forth just about every emotion with utter believability. With "Florence" she once again demonstrates why she stands alone in the acting field."Florence" is an entertaining film because it manages to show a true story, walking a dangerous line when it shows how a socialite in the first half of the 20th century achieves fame. Florence has a dream and manages to keep it alive for decades with her passion for music and the help of a devoted husband who caters to her needs and sometimes manages the impossible sheltering her harm.Florence has built a following, with her fans attending carefully structured performances. She continues to "improve" with recruited musicians and coaches who are willing to look the other way because of different types of incentives. The chapter of Florence's life that we are lucky to see has her battling with an illness that might cost her life. Any type of emotional overload could prove to be life threatening.Because of her latest rehearsal practices and her realization that the end might be near, she decides it is time to preserve her talents and finally make her ultimate dream come true. So matters become complicated for her entourage because she somehow manages to connect with people who might not be aware of her sheltered existence. Soon, her dreams might be shattered in the cruelest of ways.Streep's virtuosity is apparent from the early scenes, with the help of make up and costumes that transform her into that famous singer. However, it's her complex and beautiful performance that makes everything real and touching. She is lucky and happy because her love of music continues to grow, but there is a layer of insecurity that keeps popping throughout the film, and there are heartbreaking moments when we realize how frail she's both physically and spiritually. You will be reaching for a napkin in scenes when we can almost feel the love she treasures and is aware can disappear at any moment. We wonder if she realizes what is going on and is grateful or scared that it might end at any minute. Some of the best scenes have both Grant and Streep playing off each other in perfect harmony. Their characters understand and love with no conditions. There are lies, but they are necessary to show what people are willing to do for love..The magic of the film is how it is able to show the funny situations, almost always in conjunction with a level of sadness that is its foundation. What really thrills the audience is to see depth and growth as the various characters show the hardships of trying to be happy and fighting for our dreams. There are scenes that have us gasping at the horrific singing that Streep is so good at recreating, particularly knowing she's a talented singer who hasn't really had a role to showcase how beautiful a performer she can be. It's ironic that her talents have her portraying one of the worst singers ever, but the magic is that she does with utter believability and soul.She bewitched me with her tour de force in "Sophie's Choice", a performance I never thought she would surpass, and here I am looking at a career high, a film that shows music of so many varied and special kinds can touch us. I seriously doubt there is anyone in the audience who won't be able to appreciate and enjoy the work of a very special performer and her very talented supporting team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lovely performances, a sweet story, and a godawful voice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins is a name long familiar to opera people, frankly as a joke. This movie purports to tell the story behind one of the worst voices ever heard.Meryl Streep plays Jenkins, a wealthy woman with many famous and wealthy friends, who was a sort of New York cult figure in the '30s and '40s, known for her musical chairmanship in many organizations and participating in tableau vivants, which we see at the beginning of the film. She became involved with a British Shakespearean actor named St. Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), who became her manager, and whom she refers to as her husband in the film. Jenkins' first husband, alas, gave her syphilis, and it is believed that in part, that is what gave her the delusion that she could sing. This is a difficult role to play because she is hilariously funny, having no idea that she can't sing, and tragic at the same time. I am not always Meryl Streep's biggest fan, but she does a beautiful job of playing this woman, just perfect. And Hugh Grant was funny, charming, loyal, and loving as Jenkins' companion and the one who protected her from the derision of critics. "The Big Bang's" Simon Helberg played her sometimes reluctant pianist, Cosmé McMoon, and he is excellent, with facial expressions that reflect his every thought. He played the piano himself. Christian McKay, who played Orson Welles in "Me and Orson Welles" portrays Earl Wilson, a unbribable critic determined to see her Carnegie Hall concert.A few things about this movie: If you're going to shorten "The Bell Song," why not start it in the middle and go to the end? Also, I doubt Toscanini had a friendship with Jenkins, but even if he did, he never conducted or recorded Lily Pons in "The Bell Song" because she worked with her husband, Andre Kostelanatz.Did Jenkins have any voice? Well, she had the old lady dried-out wobble, contributing to her somewhat hooty sound, and she insisted on singing coloratura repertoire, and she couldn't even approximate the notes. I doubt she would have agreed to anything else. But had I been her teacher, I would have concentrated on the lower range and some lighter music. Don't think she was interested.A very sweet movie, set in the 1940s New York, very well produced. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Woman's Dream, Her Husband's Deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films are a way for us, ordinary people, to experience love beyond the natural encounters of one lifetime. Most movies exploit this by providing a relatable fantasy. Vicariousness enabled by hyperbole. But good movies cheat the common standard. Florence Foster Jenkins is a narrative/comedic rift on the classic Emperor's New Clothes, but there are no ready comparisons for the relationship at its core.In the biographical account of the titular heiress' late years, Jenkins (Streep), amuses herself and guarantees her place in New York aristocracy by supporting the arts. Always by her side is former soliloquist, now husband, Bayfield (Grant). Jenkins satisfies her artistic longings by taking non-speaking roles in vignettes. However, this harmless hobby appears to be insufficient. Jenkins yearns to fulfill her dream of bringing music to the world personally. She has the funds for any venue and access to the best vocal coach in the city. What she lacks is a confidant willing to inform her that her voice is atrocious. Always loyal, Bayfield remains at her side, bouncing spectators and bribing journalist. Anything to maintain a deception that prevents his wife from confronting the embarrassing truth. As if the situation was not already sufficiently perilous, Jenkins is an infirm survivor of syphilis; her matrimony platonic out of necessity. Every night Bayfield returns to his own apartment and another women, all subsidized by his wife.The joy of FFJ is the slow reveal of the pair's essence. Each development in the tenuous sham forces the audience to reevaluate the nature of the couple. Is Jenkins a romantic whose dream has obliterated her awareness? Or is this an elderly women, suffering from syphilis induced insanity, leaving nothing but platitudes, vanity, and a preoccupation for potato salad. Equally vexing is Bayfield. He is the ideal highborn companion. Jenkins would clearly be a mess without him. However, this bond is marred by the presence of a mistress. The former actor could just be a charlatan. Trapped in a 20 year charade with a companion who, miraculously resilient to her disease, should not be alive. This is picture painted in the first act, and only grows more nuanced. There might be a correct interpretation, but the fun of guessing makes the drama.Conversely, the comedy might need help. Most egregious is Jenkins' performances. The horrendousness is intended. In fact, it is a dead on impersonation. The only problem is someone thought they struck comedic gold. There is a sold 15 minutes of Jenkins singing followed by a cut to an audience member's surprised reaction. One pair in my theater thought this was a riot, I and others were not amused. If you thought listening to an awful singer was painful I promise that listening to an awful singer presented as funny is excruciating. But in fairness, most audiences will come to FFJ for Streep and Streep they will get. This consistent greatness has somehow become mundane. A performance worthy of an Oscar nom, but not be career defining. Ridiculous. Grant is a worthy partner. His natural suave makes the casting obvious. Strong apart, together an irresistible force. This is a kind of couple you will rarely see on the silver screen. Florence Foster Jenkin is one of the superior tales of love in recent memory. A romantic dream, but not above the sour notes of deceit and narcissism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FLORENCE FOSTER JENKINS: It's just a given that every Meryl Streep performance is Oscar worthy, and FFJ is no exception. But the surprise here is the remarkable and equally brilliant performance turned in by Hugh Grant, in easily the best performance of his career, who plays Florence's loving and devoted second husband, who, while not being faithful, is never the less true to her and is her most loyal, ardent supporter and protector. Florence sees herself as an accomplished opera singer, which she is not. Above all, it's a love story and will appeal to us more mature individuals. I doubt anyone under 30 (and I'm being generous here) can or will appreciate the relationship between Florence and husband St Clair which comes across as profoundly deep and genuine. Their screen moments are poignant and tender guided by the sensitive hand of director Stephen Fears who never allows things to get soapy or schmaltzy. Another surprise is the performance of Simon Helberg as Florence's accompanist. The lengths to which those around her go to fulfill her fantasy, demonstrate their love and devotion to her. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the outstanding 1944 era production design, hair and costumes. This is easily the best movie I've seen so far this Oscar season and it couldn't have come at a better time as a much need change from the summer blockbuster tent pole schlock that is currently playing. Prediction: Oscar nominations across the board. Score: 10. GO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie! It was completely enjoyable ~ both heartwarming and hilarious. Meryl Streep as Florence Jenkins was endearing, and Simon Helberg as pianist, Cosmé McMoon, was fabulous! Meryl brought humanity and authenticity to the character of Florence Jenkins. Her character could easily have been portrayed as a spoiled, rich socialite who was being indulged by her husband. But Meryl brought out the soul of the character, and made her completely enchanting. Simon Helberg as pianist Cosmé McMoon was the icing on the cake -- if for nothing else, go see this movie just to enjoy his performance. His character brought the movie to a whole 'nuther level, in my opinion. Hugh Grant was completely believable as the "celibate" husband and staunch supporter of his wife's desire to sing and perform, regardless of her abilities (or lack thereof). I went on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm, and the theater was packed. Everyone left the theater smiling and giving "thumbs up" to the folks in line for the next showing. I give it a 10 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

Meryl Streep is quite delightful has Florence, a woman who's love for music, made her believe that she was a better singer than she thought. Her friends around did not have the heart to tell her. Hugh Grant is good has Florence's descent but flawed husband, he'll do what it takes to save her from any humiliation. Simon Helberg(The Big Bang Theory)is also has McMoon an pianist who also comes to Florence in her need.I liked this film, based on a true story, or loosely in spots. Never goes to overboard in neither drama or comedy. Everybody here gives quite a descent performance. Some characters may even surprise you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the perfect film for the times that we live in. Just when so often we hear news about the worst in people, this film is about the best that people can be. Whether you are a musician or vocal artist yourself or simply appreciate the beauty of music, you will undoubtedly find this film fascinating and endearing. Meryl Streep provides audiences with a command performance as Jenkins, and will have you rolling around in your seat. One part musical and one part dramedy, Florence Foster Jenkins is a crowd-pleasing work of cinematic excellence. From brilliant writing to phenomenal acting, this film is a must-see for music lovers. Who would have known that someone with such a unique voice would have sung herself into the heart of millions. This film has a little something for everyone, especially those who are in the creative fields. May this film be an inspiration to all those who have drive, passion, a love for, and are dedicated to the pursuit of the arts, and open up that world to those who may not otherwise be able to experience it. Not sure what's bigger?Jenkins' heart or her stage presence. Whatever the case, this film is definitely one to catch on the big screen!It's so hard to know where to begin. There is quite possibly no film that truly captures the love of music and our fellow man nearly as remarkably as this film. Truly inspirational. From the writing, to the acting, to the sound track, it is a flawless story that is definitely best experienced on the big screen for Jenkins was truly a larger than life talent herself. You'll laugh, laugh some more, and even cry a little. In many ways, this film fits the drawing room comedy subgenre of films. There are very few set changes, it is mostly dialog driven, and features various forms of comedy all working together to support a light-hearted film about the love of music. Instead of taking place in the drawing room of a home with a dynamic set of manners and social criticisms, this film takes place mostly in the homes of Jenkins, Bayfield, with a visit to the humble abode of McMoon. There is one common thread between all of them, there is either a piano or other device playing music that greatly affects the narrative. Paralleling real life, you have the grand piano in a magnificent Manhattan apartment belonging to someone who cannot play or sing very well?anymore, anyway. There is the basic, beat up upright piano in the home of a wonderfully talented pianist. And finally the home of the one without much talent at all who makes a better manager, there is a radio. Three different characters who seem to come together in the most brilliant of fashion. Each with a different part to play in the grand scheme of things. I greatly appreciate the film for keeping the focus on the love of music and not on the comedic flat, sharp, and howling notes of Jenkins' voice.As we are on the cusp of Oscar season (typically beginning in October), Streep's portrayal of the, say, Ed Wood of opera singers could very well give her an Oscar nom. Making it her 20th! I don't think there is anyone who could have played the roll as well as Streep. Yes, Strep is?no surprise? excellent at everything she does; still, there are roles that even surprise us. This is definitely one of the latter. When exploring the eccentric character of Jenkins, I am reminded of a character that is essentially a Norma Desmond of sorts. A faded star who refuses to admit her years and has extreme determination to return to the silver screen, or in this case, the stage at Carnegie Hall. Other than the inspirational message and creative storytelling based on actual events, I greatly appreciate the characters of the movie. Seems as though that Jenkins, Bayfield, and McMoon were made for each other. All unique in some form or fashion, depend on one another to achieve goals, and are more talented in their respective heads than in real life. Except. You cannot really say that about McMoon. He is definitely aware of his talent, but is so incredibly timid, shy, lacking confidence that he has extreme difficulty in allowing his talent to flourish. Much like Jenkins, Bayfield is a dedicated actor. Unfortunately, he too is much more talented in his mind than on the stage. Comedy is born out of conflict, and this beautiful film has plenty of conflict with which the characters to engage one another.This film also highlights how incredibly devastating one critic's review of a performance can be. Whether we are exploring film, theatre, music, or literature, a critic for a high profile outlet can make or break dreams. There are two kinds of critics, speaking as one myself. There is the critic who is so fixated on the technical components or surface level performance that he or she misses the soul of the performance or movie. Not that having a beautiful message overshadows poor production quality. However, there is a delicate balance that is important to strike to truly review or analyze a creative work. Did Florence Foster Jenkins' performance accomplish what it set out to do? Indeed it did. Was it effective for injecting laughter into the lives of the soldiers and Manhattan music patronage community? Absolutely. She was and is truly a legend of incredible talent. Maybe not in the conventional sense, but she left a lasting impression that has captured the imagination and attention of the world for decades. Director Stephen Frears successfully applies his vision of the story of Jenkins and translates it to the screen in a way that will inspire you to perhaps continue to pursue your own dreams no matter how much talent, or lack thereof, you have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streep on a high note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Stranger than fiction. No more fitting description can be provided for the true-to-life story of 1940's New York socialite Florence Foster Jenkins. How else to describe this "opera singer" who performed at Carnegie Hall? Not so unusual you say? Well how about if I add the not-so-minor detail(s) that the lady, simply put, was an atrocious singer ? couldn't carry a note ? was apparently tone deaf? Meryl Streep gamely takes on the titular role,and despite her own finely honed singing voice, manages to spot-on mimic the off-key, yet enthusiastic wailing of FFJ. Beyond that, Ms. Streep captures the spirit and passion and ego that inspired her real life counterpart to pursue her lofty dreams. At her core, FFJ was a tortured soul who overcame syphilis (from her first husband) and the central nervous system challenges brought on by the mercury and arsenic treatments of the era. On the outside, she was a bubbly, eccentric personality who supported the arts and lived life to the fullest.With inheritances from both her mother and father, Florence received full professional support (and emotional protection) from her common-law husband St Clair Bayfield ? played superbly by the seldom seen these days Hugh Grant. Accompanying Florence on stage, and even composing music with her, was her piano player Cosme McMoon, in a scene-stealing performance from Simon Helberg ("The Big Bang Theory"). Also in the mix is Rebecca Ferguson as Bayfield's mistress ? did I mention how strange this story is? Other support work is provided by David Haig as FFJ's singing coach, and Nina Arianda as ? well ? an interesting character.Other than the cast, those responsible for this delightful cinematic experience are director Stephen Frears (Oscar nominated for The Queen and The Grifters), writer Nicholas Martin, and cinematographer Danny Cohen (Room, The King's Speech). It's a confounding movie ? on the surface quite jovial and light-hearted, while also reaching emotional depths that touch on loyalty, greed, and self-delusion.The recordings made by Florence are rare collectibles today, and the film does touch on her time as child prodigy who played piano at The White House during the Rutherford B Hayes administration. There are many life lessons here, including pursuing your dreams with a passion, and having the tenacity to overcome obstacles. There is an undeniable underlying sadness to the story, but rather than feel sorry for her, Florence provided the guiding light quote, "People may say I can't sing, but no one can say I didn't sing."</fullReview>

She died in 1944 and this movie shows us the end of her life. She was a wealthy patron of the arts who loved music but could no longer sing well. The people surrounding her loved her so much, they ignored her failing abilities and never mentioned them. Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant are at the top of their game playing wife and husband in this close movie, and Simon Helberg (that's Howard Walowitz to "Big Bang Theory" lovers) plays the piano, well. A well-made, inspiring movie that delivers without the muscled superheroes, explosions, and galactic strife of a summer blockbuster. This one's for us grownups.We saw this movie as part of the Camera Cinema Club series in San Jose. Following the screening Metropolitan Opera vocal coach Arthur Levy (who worked with Streep to re-create Jenkin's "sound") discussed his contribution to the film via SKYPE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This musical farce about a wealthy New York heiress who attempts to become an opera singer, despite her horrible singing voice, from director Stephen Frears, delivers gentle laughs and classy star performances. Meryl Streep is, as always, flawless and her chemistry with Hugh Grant is amazing. Unlike Florence, Frears manages to hit most of the right notes. This moving true story about deception is a delightful melodrama, funny and charming, ready to entertain and amuse everyone that will decide to pass an evening with this strange, but totally crowd-pleaser, soprano. Definitely a must-see film, which is much more than about a woman who can't sing very well. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stranger than fiction, subtly nuanced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells a tragi-comic story, stranger than fiction. Well up to Stephen Frears's usual high standards, it is full of period scenery and atmosphere ? some interior scenes look sepia-tinted. The acting by Meryl Streep, Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg is superb.Grant plays an Englishman, St Clair Bayfield (1875-1967), but not a bumbling one, in fact quite dignified and 'correct'. As Florence's pianist, Cosmé McMoon (1901-1980), Helberg often steals the show with compelling charm. In a wonderful early scene, McMoon's face falls abruptly when he first hears Florence sing; then, on his way out of her grand New York block, he laughs uncontrollably in a lift.'Madame Florence' (1868-1944) evidently caused a great deal of uncontrolled laughter. Meryl Streep, however, nuances the character very subtly: apparently unaware that she's a figure of fun, sad that she can no longer play the piano (a bit like Miss Shepherd in 'The Lady in the Van' though for a different reason) and with bad memories of her first husband. Above all, she's patriotic and extremely generous in face of the war.These elements, I think, make the story tragi-comic. It seems especially sad, even shocking, that Florence was allowed to delude herself for so long; I didn't find myself laughing during the scene where she was supposedly at her funniest. Bayfield's motivation is left unclear: genuine devotion to his wife or financial exploitation (she had a huge fortune)? Her singing teacher, Carlo Edwards (David Haig), seems distinctly shady, but apparently she enjoyed support from the great maestro Arturo Toscanini (John Kavanagh) though he doesn't spend much time with her in the film.Perhaps inevitably, there are some liberties with the facts: Florence and Bayfield only had a 'common law' marriage, and she met McMoon not in 1944, when the film is set, but in the late 1920s. Streep, Grant and Helberg are all substantially younger than their characters were.This film invites comparison with 'Marguerite' (French, directed by Xavier Giannoli, 2016). As the title character, Catherine Frot is no less engaging than Meryl Streep as Florence, but I was irritated by the group of men around Marguerite and her husband, which seemed to serve no essential dramatic purpose. 'Florence Foster Jenkins' has a simpler and clearer structure (I'd give 'Marguerite' 7 out of 10).The sitcom character Hyacinth Bucket ('It's Bouquet') might be another of Florence's descendants: she fancies herself as a diva in stage musicals. With her multiple delusions of grandeur, she is rather tragi-comic too ? and she sings hopelessly out of tune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good film about bad singing but a strong heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly didn't think anyone could make a film about someone who couldn't sing, and operatics at that. But Stephen Frears is a man who actually can and that he did. He always manages to bring the seemingly 'boring' characters to life, granting them the greatest they deserve. Meryl Streep plays the title role of the flamboyant attempting soprano who, couldn't sing in tune, in time and mispronounced lyrics however, what she lacked in singing talent was made up with her ambitious and courageous attitude even if a little disillusioned. Streep does her expected best and it must be harder to sing out of key than to sing properly.It's painfully funny in parts, especially watching Big Bang's Wolowitz Simon Helberg's reactions to Florence's missed notes. He plays a different socially awkward but talented com-pianist Cosme McMoon and he does it so well, he quickly loses the Wolowitz persona many of us are use to. He's taken under Florence's angel wings and under the watchful eye of St. Clair Bayfield. Hugh Grant comes out of retirement and campaigning when Frears offered him the chance to work alongside Meryl Streep. And he does a splendid, charming part; like Helberg, it's a different kind of charming from his previous roles. His character, though suave isn't wholly likable but you can't help but forgive him as he is totally devoted to protecting Florence from the real world. Like most of Frears films, there's isn't any over-dramatics or cinematography and instead we get good classic film making. He allows the characters to constantly be the centre pieces. However, this does mean it's not necessarily cinema worthy and waiting for the small screen release wouldn't be a bad thing. I bit like Florence's voice, it's does fall flat in places but it's has some nice touching surprises towards the end that concludes the film and certainly makes it more of a drama than a comedy. It's a good film but isn't one I go out to buy. Not even for Meryl Streep's acting. I get the feeling Meryl Streep is the Eminem of Hollywood, everyone wants to work with her.

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Frears is a director with many good movies to his credit, The Hit (1984) and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) are just two of them. About Meryl Streep I can only say superlative things, she is an excellent actress, especially in The Bridges of Madison County (1995), Sophie's Choice (1982), Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), The Deer Hunter (1978). Simon Helberg is a good actor, Hugh Grant a decent one. Florence Foster Jenkins is worth seeing because of the previous merits of these artists, as well for the film in itself, it's a sensitive and humorous story, even makes you laugh. Ms. Streep can sing and not only play well. She can sing well (in Mamma Mia!) and hilarious bad in Florence Foster Jenkins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls Short on all counts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins (1868 ? 1944) is the true story of a New York Socialite who has gone down in history as possibly the worst classical singer of all times. She lived in her own fantasy world and did not lack the confidence needed to become the center of attention which was further fueled by the lie of her followers and entourage. It is too bad that this movie falls short on every level, I was expecting so much more. The actors portrayed her as a clown, the story focused on one point in her life, her quest to perform at Carnegie Hall. There was so much more to Florence (read her biography) and the movie omits it all so that in the end there was nothing worth watching. The story is Flat and Boring, you are left with a void and a sense of disappointment. Questions that are never answered being: Who was Florence Foster Jenkins? Where did she come from? Why did she have such a loyal following and what kept them magnetically attracted to her. If you want the answer to these questions you need to see the movie Marguerite (2015). It is an incredible movie about the life of Florence and it fills in most of the blanks. Florence Foster Jenkins on the other hand misses the boat and does not give credit where it is due. People who gave this movie a high rating must have been watching a different movie. I think that Florence would turn in her grave if she ever saw this movie. I gave it a three for effort and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep as Florence Foster Jenkins in the true story about a rich woman who had no idea she's the worst classical singer of all time. Like Ed Wood, she was full of confidence, but unlike him she lived in a lie, being fooled by everyone around her.Unfortunately, unlike the movie ED WOOD, the story is very thin. The characters have no depth and the movie doesn't tell you a lot more than the little that you may know before watching it, simply because there isn't much more than that. Like the real characters, the story is flat and predictable. Meryl Streep is OK in her role, but since the character has no depth, it's not that impressive.The only thing that is amazing about this whole story is how a person could be so delusional about her lack of talent. The singing in the movie may seem exaggerated for comical effect, but this is actually as bad as the real Florence sang and it was that awful, butchering one classical piece at a time.If you want to see a wonderful movie about a person who devoted his life for his passion, but unfortunately lacked any talent, watch Ed Wood instead.With Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best acting imaginable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always a pleasure to watch, and in this case especially, to listen to Meryl Streep. And, as much as I enjoy Hugh Grant, I never realized before what a talent he has when he is not being type-cast as the same character as always. Simon Helberg, as all have said, is able to keep up with both of them - not an easy feat. Streep's ability to sing as comically as she does and with so much power is phenomenal. It is hard to imagine another actress being able to achieve what she has done here. Hugh Grant is eloquent and moving in portraying Bayfield's love for this clearly amazing lady. And Simon Helberg's piano playing keeps up with Streep's remarkable singing every second. It is probably the best ensemble acting of any film I have ever seen. This is in no way a comedy, just as it is not a musical! The story as a whole has some remarkably funny parts - it is hard not to laugh at her singing and performing the way she does, and this is well presented during the Carnegie Hall performance. But the story in itself is more sad than funny, and the superb acting of the 3 principles lets us feel their emotions. You understand why FFJ was loved by the men in her life, as ridiculous as she was. The costumes and scenery enhance the film, as do the supporting actors, and there is nothing not worth seeing and hearing in the whole film. For me, the big problem with the film is the historical inaccuracy of the story which was totally unnecessary. It would have been better, I believe, to show the development of the relationship with McMoon, rather than making up a silly audition scene, for example, especially as he played such an important role in her life. I give the acting a 10 out of 10, but the script detracts from the whole, making it 9/10. Absolutely worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of socialite, arts patron, and would-be coloratura soprano Florence Foster Jenkins, this Stephen Frears movie is a perfect summer entertainment. Even though practically everyone other than her doting, doddering age-peers recognizes how truly awful her singing is and how bizarre are her costumes, the movie nevertheless is persistently upbeat and goodhearted. Florence is generous and kind and, while it's clear she'll never be the singer she thinks she is, in Meryl Streep's wonderful characterization, you don't hold her delusions against her. Streep is supported by Hugh Grant, in a wholly sympathetic portrayal of Florence's unfailingly supportive husband, St. Clair Bayfield, a handsome actor seven years younger than Florence in real life. I fell in love with her pianist, Cosmé McMoon, as played by Simon Helberg. McMoon starts his new gig as her accompanist with great enthusiasm and the promise of a much fatter wallet, and when he hears her sing, his growing shock and bewilderment is priceless. The only mean-spirited skunk in the whole film is New York Post gossip columnist Earl Wilson. His headline after Florence's 1944 Carnegie Hall appearance called her the world's worst singer. Nice opening credits, great classic cars, love her beads! As The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw says, "there are no wrong notes in this film."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of the lucky people who has managed to catch this gem at a special screening last night, and boy, it's good.Meryl Streep has transcendentally channeled the eponymous heroine, with whom we laughed, smiled, and cried. Hugh Grant, as her devoted and suave consort St. Clair Bayfield, has made me want to cheer for him at times when "mockers and scoffers" poked fun at poor Flo. And finally, Simon Helberg - I love you now Simon, I really do; his take on Cosme McMoon is considered one of the highlights in the movie, his reactions to FFJ's voice when he first heard her sing was a bellyache. Howard Wolowitz deserves an Oscar!My heartstrings were tugged at once when the final very painful scenes started to roll, and "When I Have Sung My Songs to You" plays; Florence and St. Clair's love story has finally come full circle.Streep will certainly land nominations, I'm hoping Hugh gets his overdue one, and Simon gets his first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Singing Badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that Meryl Streep studied hours the work of Florence Foster Jenkins. It was pointed out to me by someone steeped in vocal music, that reproducing bad singing is incredibly difficult. To do it with the skill Streep did (after listening to actual recordings of Foster-Jenkins) is amazing. While there is a degree so schmaltz in this film, overall, it never becomes maudlin and does not respect the featured character. While her impression of her own voice was without substance, she was admirable and kind and sincere. Of course, she was held up to ridicule at some point, but when she is hurt by the response of the soldiers invited to her concert, she forges on. There are issues that are kept hidden. I won't throw them out there. Hugh Grant performs decently but the supporting role that dominates is that of Simon Helberg from "The Big Bang Theory." His timing is impeccable. His character is put in a tenuous spot and he must make a decision to risk his career to show his love for Florence. There is one event that could stupidly destroy the movie, but it needs to be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Beautiful Streep Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's understandable if some people get tired of reading and hearing about what a wonderful actress Meryl Streep is, because that has been said so many times. But it's said often because it's true, and her sublime performance as Florence Foster Jenkins is still more evidence of her great talent. Streep effortlessly puts forth a touching sincerity in her latest screen role, a real-life awful (and awfully deluded) singer. Her singing is worse than abysmal, and people laugh at it, but Streep makes us feel affection and sympathy for her. This is comedy, yes, but it's gentle comedy with drama and heart thanks largely to the mighty Meryl.This 1940s-set dramedy will appeal especially to 'older' audiences (though I'm not young, I was probably the youngest person in the cinema), but anyone who just appreciates fine acting should at least consider it. Overall, this charming film is a bit slight, but the lead actress ... oh my.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A highly entertaining bio-pic with a star turn by Ms. Streep once again.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: The true story of an untalented singer and her 15 minutes of fame.JIM'S REVIEW: Flamboyance sometimes can mask the lack of talent. But not in the case of Florence Foster Jenkins (Meryl Streep), a soprano that can curdle any high C. And the new film about this musical thespian luckily has the marvelously gifted Meryl Streep, center stage, playing this marginally talented singer. &#xfffc;A wealthy heiress, Florence self-promoted her musical career with the help of her second husband, St. Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), a doting husband and astute businessman. (While Husband No. 2 proved to be loving and protective of Flo, all Husband No. 1 gave her was syphilis and a divorce.) Bayfield actually hired a music director and accompanist, Cosmé McMoon (Simon Helberg) to help his wife avoid scathing reviews. Cosmé tried valiantly to rectify a hopeless situation, but no matter how hard Mrs. Jenkins would practice, practice, practice, she was inept in every way. Still, she played Carnegie Hall and sold out her one engagement there. Based on a true story, this Flo sure ain't no nightingale! Watching her screech and sash-shay on stage is a real hoot. Beautifully portrayed by Ms. Streep, the lady on the stage certainly had no talent, but the actress on the big screen surely does. Ms. Streep plays up the self delusion of her character. She shows a funny yet vulnerable side as Florence becomes a public spectacle and world-wide curiosity. Ms. Streep wisely hits all the wrong right notes, going beyond total buffoon and more in the range of a deeply passionate performer gone amok. Her portrayal shows her character's childlike guile, a special sincerity above her foolish endeavors, and a gentle comic aura. &#xfffc;Adding solid support are Mr. Grant as the philandering spouse and Mr. Helberg as her loyal musical director. Both actors are very convincing in their parts as they show their ongoing love and affection to this most eccentric of singers. Nina Arianda plays a vulgar gold digger type and she delivers fine comic timing in an underwritten stock character. As diverting as the film is, the screenplay by Nicholas Martin never fleshes out its characters or their relationships clearly. It especially dancing around the issues of Florence's unconventional marriage and Bayfield's involvement with his loving mistress, well played by Rebecca Ferguson. It also misjudges its time-line with events partially addressed, causing some confusion and strains credibility. (In this retelling of Ms. Jenkins' life, the audiences gush repeatedly and were far too forgiving of her follies. Plus, Florence seems to die solely from a bad review.)&#xfffc;Stephen Frears does a fine job of direction and the production values showing the 40's era is spot-on. Kudos to costume designer Consolata Boyle for her period outfits which provide an added frumpiness and needed kitsch to the role. Special mention also to J. Roy Helland for his hair and make-up design of Ms. Streep and a lovely score by the reliable Alexandre Desplat.Overall, Florence Foster Jenkins is highly entertaining fare. The film presents an overall premise of spoofing a non-talented performer that is strictly one-note and the farcical elements could have been played more astutely. Yet what could have been a one note performance as well becomes pure coloratura in the subtle interpretation by one of Hollywood's finest screen actresses. That alone is worth the price of admission.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incomplete film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not one who likes films to be full of flashbacks. It's a technique that's way overdone in all too many films. But as I sat watching this film, I kept wishing for a few flashbacks that would have given us a bit more insight into the lives of all 3 main characters here. It would have given us a little bit of an insight into what they were all about, particularly the title character and her first marriage and contraction of syphilis.Aside from that, I still enjoyed the film. It's a biopic of a wealthy New York woman (Meryl Streep) who used her money to further her own singing career...despite not being able to sing. But, she loved music. Her second husband (Hugh Grant) (actually apparently a common law marriage) doted on her, while also having his own liaisons. Her pianist (Simon Helberg) is the third main character of the film.Meryl Streep is fantastic here...isn't she always? (Well actually, I hated the first film I ever saw here in -- "Sopie's Choice"). Hugh Grant is perfect, as well...and when I was watching the film I thought back at how often I've enjoyed his performances. The surprise was Simon Helberg, who plays the obviously gay pianist. A genuinely funny performance, that still managed to portray a great sensitivity. I doubt he'll ever be a leading man in films, but he certainly can be a fine character actor.I enjoyed it, but flashbacks would have made it perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sum of the parts here ARE NOT great than the whole.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stephen Frears (High Fidelity - 2000, The Queen - 2006, and Philomela - 2013) knows a thing or two about making successful films. Writer Nicholas Martin, London born and raised, knows his way around the British TV genre. Unfortunately, together they present a true story about the 1940's socialite Florence Foster Jenkins (Meryl Streep) and her off tune rise to musical fame, that might have been better left a proverb than a truth brought to the big screen. Streep is terrific in this quirky role, wearing her heart on her sleeve, singing off key like the best of them. However, with the singing being the primary focus of the film, it is the one element that grows old quickly. Hugh Grant, Florence's aloof husband St Clair Mayfield, and pianist Cosmé McMoon (Simon Helberg - The Big Bang Theory) both manage to keep roles they can do in their sleep fresh and entertaining, and Nina Arianda is terrific as the money and attention grabber Agnes Stark. Costumes by Consoata Boyle (The Queen, Philomela) are fun, and especially over the top for Florence, pushing yet again the realm of reality, even if Florence's outfits are spot on for the period. Cinematography by Danny Cohen captures the NY 1940's feel nicely, yet combined with some of Frears' direction, so much of the scenery/setup comes off contrived. While fans of Streep, Grant and Helberg (of which I am one of them), will find pleasure in this film, the sum of the parts here ARE NOT greater than the whole. So, don't expect a lot, and you'll have as much fun as the trailers say you should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, it's Meryl Streep's latest Oscar vehicle, but, if (when) she gets nominated, she kind of deserved it this time. However, Hugh Grant outshines her by far and gives the best performance of his career. I also really liked Simon Helberg as Florence's flamboyantly gay (but of course closeted, it being 1944) pianist, who worries that associating with the awful singer will ruin his possible career. Nina Arianda steals the movie every time she appears as the bimbo second wife of one of Jenkins' fans. The film is very funny, even if there is only one joke, but it shines in its beautifully drawn relationships. The marriage at the center of the film is one of the most beautiful in recent movie memory, and the friendship that develops between Helberg and Streep (as well as Helberg and Grant) is also lovely. If the film didn't falter a bit near its end, I would proclaim it great. It's pretty darn close, anyway, and, at least at his point of 2016, it's one of my favorites of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of socialite music patron turned flash-in-the-pan novelty, Florence Foster Jenkins is a tricky needle to thread. On the one hand her stranger than fiction life begs to be turned into a big screen adaptation. The world in which she inhibits certainly appeals to a certain, older crowd, while her reason for infamy slips neatly into the similarly shaggy-dog amiability of other biographical films of the last few years. Yet with stakes so low as to be non-existent, there runs a real risk of being just another fluffy confection unworthy of the full period-piece treatment. So what is one to do? Well hiring Meryl Streep would certainly hedge some bets.Florence Foster Jenkins takes place in the last year or so of the titular character's life. The Florence (Streep) of the film is a naive New York musical patron who's life long obsession with music brings her to the stage with delusions of singing as an operatic soprano. Her loving husband St. Clair (Grant) supports her musical "career" as best he can by planning performances only for friends, sycophants and members of their tight social circle. To keep her in a state of calm elation, St. Clair plants positive reviews in newspapers and promptly kicks out all "mockers and scoffers" who begin to giggle at the sound of her voice. Poor Florence can't sing, in fact a real review of her "Queen of the Night" aria, described her voice as "a cacophony of squeaks and screeches; great careering arc grasping vertiginously for high Ds, Es, and Fs, that come clucking wildly, frantically down again."As is custom, Meryl Streep is not just adequate in the title role but an absolute vision of the screen, giving poise, respect and very real human frailty to a woman once dubbed "The biggest mass joke in New York City." Through her, we admire Florence's pluck, can understand her sense of gusto and even kind of want to live in her world where everything in life is a song. She's the living embodiment of living life with a positive perspective.Granted much of that perspective is forged by Hugh Grant's St. Clair who fastidiously protects Florence from harsher truths. Those truths, by the way, also include his affair with seasoned actress Kathleen (Ferguson). As an act of casual roguishness, St. Clair could have easily been exacted from the same cloth as Joe Viterelli's character in Bullets Over Broadway (1994). Yet St. Clair's is a far different beast; one which hides most of his true feelings under layers of blue-blood British propriety.Doubling as accompanist and the audience's fill-in is Cosme McMoon (Helberg) a kind if timid young man whose ambitions reach beyond his humble beginnings in San Antonio. Much like James McAvoy in The Last Station (2009), Eddie Redmayne in My Week with Marilyn (2011) and pretty much every emotional proxy in these kinds of movies Cosme's character arc is the weak half-realized center of the film. Granted Simon Helberg is commendable as the only guy in the room with a bad poker face, but he's just so unnecessary. Yet the film insists that he is, so we're invited into his inner-life and are supposed to feel triumph when he giggles about playing Carnegie Hall.The film also has a serious third act problem that seems to almost contradict everything that came before it. Without giving too much away, the film seems to want to hammer home a theme similar to that of this year's Eddie the Eagle (2016), yet instead of feeling the buildup or the payoff of a job passably done, we get the feeling Florence is little more than an old bird whose just now stepped out of her cage. It's a shame to because the real Florence Foster Jenkins seemed winkingly aware of her contributions to public musical performance.Much like director Stephen Frears similar Mrs. Henderson Presents (2005), Florence Foster Jenkins is a charming character study about a charming woman, told during a charming time. It's got a lot a heart where it counts and performances across the board are brilliant even if they're not all necessary. Yet even with its high- bar pedigree, Florence Foster Jenkins can't help but feel a little to quaint and at times thematically dubious. Meryl Streep will no doubt be nominated for a few awards this year because of this film. But as the credits rolled I didn't thing where she will win but whether the winner of Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy will mention her in her acceptance speech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Florence Foster Jenkins" vs. Marguerite": and the winner is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Florence Foster Jenkins" (2016 release; 110 min.) bring the story "based on true events, New York 1944" we are reminded at the beginning of the film, of Madame Florence. As the movie opens, Florence's husband introduces her at the Verdi Club, where she plays the Angel of Inspiration for Stephen Foster (no relation), in a scene set in Alabama, 1950s. It's not long before Florence wants to return to the stage and sing, and her husband dutifully garners a new piano man, and her trusted vocal coach. At the first rehearsal, Florence sings, badly out of tune, to the shock of the new pianist. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the is the latest movie from British director Stephen Frears, best known for "The Queen" and "Philomena". Here he brings to the bid screen the strange happenings of New York socialite Florence Foster Jenkins, who generously supported the New York music scene, and fancied herself a darn good singer too. This movie is NOT a biopic, as we pick up the events in 1944, when she was already 76. As you are watching the movie, one keeps wondering, why doesn't anyone yell the equivalent of "the emperor wears no clothes"? Was Florence truly delusional into thinking herself being a great singer? or did she know all along, and simply played along (to bring some entertainment in dark times)? Watch as the movie unfolds! The production is helped immensely by the attention to details in the sets and costume department. A number of scenes take place in Carnegie Hall the US temple of classical music), and that too helps. But in the end the movie is powered forward by the outstanding performances of both Meryl Streep (yes, her again!) and Hugh Grant as her doting (?) husband. This can be considered a 'come-back' role for Hughes, as he's been mostly absent from the movies in the last 4-5 years. Clearly showing his age now, he still remains a joy to watch on the big screen.In case you weren't aware, this isn't the first movie about/inspired by these events. Last year, a French movie called "Marguerite" was released, in which French directed transposed Florence's life to France, circa 1920. The movie is quite good too, but in the end falls a bit short as compared to the new movie, as it lacks the New York setting, and of course Meryl Streep. But if you are intrigued about these strange happenings, I'd readily suggest you check out this French film. Bottom line" "Marguerite" is quite good, but "Florence Foster Jenkins" is just a little better."Florence Foster Jenkins" opened this past weekend, and did quite well for a niche film as this one. The Monday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended quite nicely, and heavily leaning towards seniors I might add. The audience roared with laughter at all the right times, and was equally silent in the more dramatic scenes. If you are curious how a socialite without signing skills can take it all the way to the top of the musical world, do not mist this film, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "Florence Foster Jenkins" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins is a sparkle of joy. Meryl Streep shines on screen once again as Florence Foster Jenkins. This film is full of laughs, tears, and some parts you wish those people back then never said. See Florence Foster Jenkins thought she was a great singer, but to everyone else she stink. Music kept her alive. There was one flaw about this movie and it was that at times it was hard to understand what they were saying, but besides that the movie was great. Parents this movie was set in 1944 so there is some profanity in it, but not a whole lot of it. There is a lot of great comedy in it and trust me it is wonderful comedy really widy. Florence Foster Jenkins will be remembered as a classic some day and everyone will fall in love with this movie.My score 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slight, Warm, Amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Florence Foster Jenkins" is a mildly amusing and warm-hearted movie about a real person, Florence Foster Jenkins, who sang very badly and yet used her inherited wealth and influence to sing one concert at Carnegie Hall, one of the premier venues for classic music. The one joke is stretched rather thin. Florence (Meryl Streep) pours her heart into singing an opera aria. Listeners look at her outlandish costume and see her working so very hard to crank out earsplitting sounds. The listeners look shocked and then they laugh ? "Oh! This is a joke! You almost had me there!" and then they realize that she's serious, not kidding, and then they suppress their laughter. This happens a few times too many in the film. Rubber-faced Simon Helberg, playing the part of Florence's piano accompanist, the excellently named Cosme McMoon, mimes this shock / laughter / pity routine several times. There's more to the movie than its one joke. There is also some pathos and insight. Florence Foster Jenkins contracted a serious illness from her first husband and her life was full of private pain she worked hard to conceal. The scenes where Florence's difficult private life are revealed cause the viewer to feel some admiration and sympathy for this otherwise ridiculous and manipulative figure. Also, Florence's so-called "marriage" to actor St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant) is touching. Bayfield and Florence never consummated their union. They never even wed. Bayfield had a mistress. But still it's clear that he feels affection for his "Bunny." There is also a gorgeous 1940s feel to the film. Everything has a golden glow. Costumes and era music and dances are faithfully recreated. The movie raises several questions that matter a lot to creative people. Can artists judge their own work? Florence was a real patroness of the arts. She loved music. How is it that someone who could recognize the value of a Verdi could not recognize her own vocal failures? Especially after it had been recorded and played back to her? Is it possible that her chronic illness affected her cognition later in life? What is the assignment of critics? Do critics benefit society by stating "This performer is very bad" even if such a review will break a harmless old woman's heart? What if someone produces bad art that gives joy to people? Some listeners, including some soldiers serving in the war, took pleasure in Florence's performances. What about Florence's relationship with Bayfield? Was he exploiting her by allowing her to live in her fantasy world? Or did he love her and was he being supportive? What about Florence herself? Would it have improved her life to confront her own limitations honestly? Again, building a movie around one joke is stretching things too far. I think this could have been a better film had it included scenes that touched on the above questions and potential answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Florence Foster Jenkins", starring Meryl Streep-Into the Woods, The Deer Hunter; Hugh Grant-The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Did You Hear About the Morgans?; Simon Helberg-The Big Bang Theory_tv, Old School and Rebecca Ferguson-Mission:Impossible Rogue Nation, Hercules_2014.This movie is based on a true story about a wealthy, elderly lady in 1940's New York that wanted to be an opera singer, despite the fact that she could not sing on key. She loved music and loved to sing but her husband/manager, who loved her dearly, was careful to keep any harsh criticism from her and also either bribed or blackmailed any reviewers into writing nothing but praise for her singing. Meryl plays the want- to-be singer that has her sites set on playing in Carnegie Hall-FYI: she does her own awful singing in the movie-and Hugh plays her husband/manager. Simon plays the pianist hired to accompany Meryl-and Simon does his own piano playing in the movie, too. Meryl contracted syphilis from her first husband when she was young and she is in failing health now, in her 60's. She takes medicine but gets weak after practicing or performing. Because of the medical problem, Meryl &amp; Hugh abstain from having sex with each other. Hugh is deeply in love with his wife but only human and has a girlfriend on the side. Rebecca plays the mistress and Meryl knows all about her-there are no secrets between them. The movie is a touching story of a person loving something so much, even though they are not very good at it, and persevering to accomplish her goals, in this case, playing Carnegie Hall. It's rated "PG-13" for suggestive material and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 50 minutes. It is an interesting story but not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing is enough. It would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other Grant would approve.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No mockers and no scoffers." St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant)Florence Foster Jenkins has an entertaining and instructive ambivalence informing it. Based on true events about the titular heiress who longed to be a singer, director Stephen Frears and writer Nicholas Martin deftly navigate around mockery and scoffing about her poor voice and offer admiration for someone who pursues her dream while she does good for all.Although the concept of a talentless singer is not new (just reverse the motif in Citizen Kane), here it is infused by the innocent and well-meaning patron, Florence, and played by the consummate actress, Meryl Streep, with a sense of the goodness of her character. Aiding and abetting her emergence as a "singer" is her second husband, Bayfield, who leads an ambivalent life as well, a husband with a lover.The film is overseen by two points of view: One has her being a fool laughed at by the public; the other is a charity maven admired by arts lovers and philanthropists who would never call her on her lack of talent. In between is her husband, who loves her beyond honesty about her voice. As brought to life by Hugh Grant, who has always played a top-drawer innocent in wolf's clothing, her husband carries the burden of the audience that both admires and denigrates her singing.The duality of this comedy drama is expressed in a variety of amusing ways such as the site of a bathtub full of potato salad (a fav food for Florence) to her pianist, McMoon (Simon Helberg), hilariously realizing she can't sing, while everyone around the room ignores the cacophony. The film reveres her while she in on the brink of collapse from pursuing her dream of stardom, a goal they all know is impossible.After four plays, one documentary, and two feature films, the subject of Florence Foster Jenkins' would seem to have run its course. Yet, this recent film shows the subject's ability to be fresh, perhaps because the innocent following an impossible dream (Quixote, anyone?) is eternally in the hearts of all romantics and those who seek more out of life despite the odds. On the other side of the argument, the subject does seem to be tired and clichéd at times.Although Meryl Streep may be Oscar nominated again (she holds the record), Hugh Grant deserves the nod for his first time. Cary Grant would approve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw "Florence Foster Jenkins" and it's one touching and emotional film of desire and will power with the determination on the ups and downs of work and life. Based on a true story set in 1940's New York city it's about the life and times of heiress and want to be stand up opera singer Florence Foster Jenkins(in another great performance from Meryl Streep). Only one big problem Foster has a terrible singing voice. Also baggage is present on the side with her male friend and manager Mr. St. Clair(Hugh Grant)who's good at keeping her talent problem hidden and lying to the media and her as Clair's having an affair with another woman. And in a good supporting turn Simon Helberg is piano man McMoon. Overall this film is good it's about determination, will power, desire, and living with life being up and down as it's important to prove to and please yourself despite what others think or see of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Summer's Flattest But Brightest Tune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting is New York right within the peak of World War II. A couple takes the stage together at the Verdi Club, one unknowingly bad at acting and one unknowingly bad at singing. St. Clair Bayfield has supported his operatic wife for years, doing what he can to help her follow her dreams of commanding the opera house. Florence Foster Jenkins has no idea that her singing voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard, so she commits her life to fulfilling the same emotion she feels whenever listening to the virtuous sounds of the opera. In particular though, she would rather start now rather than later in achieving her dream, as she's already fifty years into a delicate case of Syphilis, death always following her wherever she goes.Therefore, the couple hire a nervous yet eager new pianist to help make her grand entrance back to the stage, appealing to all the high- class music enthusiasts in New York. She still doesn't know the truth about her voice, as it's so wretched that everybody loves it.Meryl Streep takes the stage as the title role in what appears to be yet another Oscar nomination for the versatile actress. She is so joyfully giddy, so blissfully confident with her voice, so theatrical, and so comedic, that she appears made for the stage. What's even better about her role is the way she acutely matches the dying animal sounds which originally came out of the original Jenkins' mouth. Her singing is everywhere: up, down, left, right, sideways, upside-down, all directions that will easily generate the hardest laughs of the summer. She's truly the best bad singer you'll ever hear.It's amazing how this movie is not the typical mainstream feature expected to make much of any money over the summer, and yet it is so much more clean and relatable in its humor than that repulsively pointless Sausage Party.None of the comedy in Florence Foster Jenkins goes too far, it's all in the little subtle things such as a fast pianist or ways to store potato salad for an enormous number of guests. Then it all erupts as a vocal coach struggles in his lessons to help Florence sound her most angelic. Soon everyone reacts to her voice the same way the audience does: with laughs ranging from slight chuckling in the elevator to losing breath at a concert. The jokes are all in the humanity of the circumstances, which is precisely where comedy should naturally come from.The best part is, it pays off in the end. Florence makes a deal with the soldiers fighting in the war that she will use her concert at Carnegie Hall to make large donations to benefit their service. She believes that these soldiers need to feel joy, which can most tangibly be felt through music. Anticipation builds before she takes the stage, and anticipation builds even more as her husband later has to hide the NY Post from her, so that she won't be discouraged by their review.I love the drama within this humorous historical concept, but I have one complaint about it all: by the third act, we're supposed to feel bad for her that she's mocked for her singing voice, even though the first and second acts were filled with us specifically being manipulated to laugh at the same thing. Then in the end, we learn of her legacy because of her awful singing that brought laughter to generations. I wish that Oscar-nominated director Stephen Frears (The Grifters, The Queen) would make up his mind on how we're supposed to feel.But you know what? It doesn't matter all that much. This cinematic retelling of the worst opera singer in the world is guaranteed to bring joy and inspiration to everyone who feels lost in our miserable time. If Florence believed that music can enlighten the world, then maybe it can still do the same today.</fullReview>

She also dreamed of being a singer, and no one dared to tell her that her voice was awful. She wanted to spread the joy of music with people and yet she ended up being mocked by the audience and critics.Her husband also played a really important role, he displayed unconditional support to help Florence to fulfill her dreams. Although he had another girlfriend, he still stood by Florence's side when faced of difficulties, organizing the performances and hide those critics that might hurt her." People may say I couldn't sing, but no one can say I didn't sing." said Florence in the end of movie, after she was devastated by the vicious critics, she remained passionate about music, knowing that there were no regrets to pursue what she loved, this scene was very touching. The movie illustrated that there are two things that we must give: The unconditional love and support for the ones you love, and the never-ending devotion for the things you love.</fullReview>

The script has Real Life New York Post Columnist Earl "Earl's Pearls" Wilson accuse Frump of having Delusions of Grandeur, an accusation frequently lodged against Trump.

		<shortDescription>Streep is utterly smashing in more ways than one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lovely Meryl Streep is a woman whose legendary performances spread across all genres. Tonight I have the privilege of reviewing her latest film that spans insto historical biography drama. The name of the movie if Florence Foster Jenkins and the game is about uniting a city during troubling times. The trailers made this one look promising, but as always I'm here to see if they deliver on said promises. So let's get started shall we?LIKES: ? Acting ? Emotional Delivery ? Great writingFlorence Foster Jenkins is certainly a movie that is dependent on its actors to make it entertaining. Meryl Streep's performance certainly lives up to its legendary standards and brings the iconic character to life in spades. She once more balances all her emotions, covering a diverse spectrum that includes joy, sickness, and fear all brilliantly wrapped in courage. And to see her butcher the musical notes the way she does, only gains further applause from this reviewer. Hugh Laurie, while not my favorite actor, certainly got the supportive husband role down and had a reactive chemistry with not only Streep, but every character in the film. And as for Simon Helberg, he did a decent job. I don't know the character or the book, but Helberg's performance was like a creepier version of Wallowitz with more elegant piano work. I warmed up to the character eventually, and soon found the performance much more fitting. Outside of the acting though, the emotional drama certainly delivers on the promise of playing with your mood. The feelings of joy, pride, empathy, and anger all dance around in a chaotic waltz as the events unfold. While the actors are certainly the primary means of bringing everything to life, the camera work and accompanying orchestra work amplify the emotional turmoil you might feel. And the writing combined with the story certainly establishes a strong framework to guide everything. The dialogue in particular impressed me, so real and yet so clever that you can't help but feel dropped into the setting. Bottom line is that the production quality is top notch and certainly the best part of the movie for me. DISLIKES: ? The Pace ? Ear shrieking gets old after a whileWith all the great things about this movie, it is unfortunate for me that the pace of the movie was very slow. I've seen my share of documentaries, and many of them had some sort of plot point or engaging suspense to keep you hooked. In this movie I didn't have those aspects, which often left the movie dragging at points and stuck in repetitive sequences. This error/weakness is mostly on my part and I should have been prepared for some slower moments. However, the rest of the audience had no problems with the speed of the movie and relished in the drama. The second dislike comes from Florence's main theme of singing poorly to a number of crowds. At first the gimmick is fun and funny, as Mirren throws off key ballads under the pretense she sings well. However, she soon transitions into opera and the surround sound, high amplitude shrieking becomes quite an ear splitter that may give you a headache. That joke also grew stale for me too, but its relevance to the plot made up for it despite the decibels she reached. It might be a minor point, but it was something I didn't quite enjoy. In addition the movie itself wasn't revolutionary as well and therefore wasn't the masterpiece I thought it would be from the trailers. The VERDICTOverall Florence Foster Jenkins has high production quality and a five star cast that brings the movie to life in more ways than one. However, it probably could have had just a strong impact if it had premiered as a PBS original movie. For me there just wasn't much theater quality to it (e.g. no special effects, or unique enough story). Therefore I can't recommend this one is a must see in theaters. Who is the target audience for this movie. Well if my showing is a representative sample, it seems that women greater than the age of 50 are going to enjoy this most. My scores are: Biography/Comedy/Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) was directed by Stephen Frears. It stars Meryl Streep in the title role, and Hugh Grant as St Clair Bayfield, her common-law husband. Her accompanist was the pianist Cosmé McMoon played well by Simon Helberg.If you believe Wikipedia, the movie is extremely truthful in portraying the life and art of Florence Foster Jenkins. She was a wealthy woman, with almost no singing talent. Despite this, she gave society concerts to friends year after year.Even if the story is true, it doesn't have to be interesting. Streep and Grant are extraordinary actors, but, for me, nothing they did could make me care about the movie . There were scenes of tenderness and remorse, jealousy and passion, but, to my eyes, it looked like people moving from one scene to the next, just trying to get the job done. The sets, vehicles, and costumes were impressively authentic, but they couldn't save the film for me any more than the actors could.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, New York. It will work as well on the small screen. If you're on an airplane and it's one of the options, I'd watch it. Otherwise, I'd look for something more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But it's not for everyone. This is a high budget period piece about a woman whose delusions of grandeur (possibly fostered by a medical condition) bring her a kind of renown much in line with "the emperor's new clothes". It's a tale of deception on the grandest scale, but motivated by a kind of conditional love that is, in actuality, unconditional.It has the vernier of being a comedy, but is in point in fact a romantic drama.I don't have too much more to say about it other than Streep and Grant share a remarkable chemistry on screen that I think is a once in a life time occurrence for fans of actors.Lastly, I did find the character Streep plays both twee and annoying all at once, but also endearing, particularly towards the end of the film.It is yet another World War 2 film, but I shrug my shoulders at it. I think here a nazi reference or two might have actually helped the film's comedic angle and perhaps help buttress the romantic and dramatic angles as well.All in all a respectable watch.Check it out.</fullReview>

While the beginning might be a little slow for many (most simply aren't used to an old-timey, relaxing film), the movie turns out to be a surprisingly amusing comedy/drama (moreso than I was expecting). The cast is perfect for the movie. Meryl Streep and Simon Helberg have Oscar-worthy performances, capturing their character's emotion exquisitely. I have to say that the rowdy tramp played by Agnes Stark is my favorite character, though. Her New York accent is incredible!Overall, this is a great motion picture that will appeal to mature audiences everywhere that want their dose of history and comedy at the movies.

		<shortDescription>A socialite, whose passion is music has always wanted to sing opera, even as her husband tries to shield her from the fact that she is the worst singer ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jenkins is a classic socialite, and we get the impression that she is very involved as a patron of the arts. We're told her passion is music, and she's always wanted to sing opera. She even trains.She is of course, terrible, but still performs as her husband tries to shield her from the fact that she is the worst singer ever.I'm not sure how to take this. It could have easily been a comedy - but then again, you can only stretch that one gag for so long. The film doesn't shy away from it, we get the in the inspired reactions of Simon Helberg (playing a VERY different character that what we are used to seeing from him in the Big Bang Theory, timid and shocked rather than brash and overreacting) who looks like he's just happy to be sharing the screen with luminaries such as Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant. But make no mistake, this aspires to drama. You can see it reaching for an Oscar award when Florence declares "They can say I can't sing, but they can't say that I DIDN'T sing!"I spent twenty years in the theatre. There's a certain idealized high society of the 30's and 40's that it feels like 90% of all plays are set in. It's the place we go for Agatha Christie mysteries and social musicals. It's a comfortable place, that smells of tweed and sealing wax, and this movie brought me right back there instantly. It doesn't matter that the film is based on actual events, the BBC creates not just that period but the epitome of that period, then improves on it, and Meryl Streep seems to fit perfectly, as if she belonged there.It's an undignified role. Something that allows Streep to flex her muscles and show off her range, from being a batty old ditty to moments of quiet introspection. It works. I believe every moment of it.Hugh Grant doesn't fare quite as well. He's still playing the same character type he always has, though he's trying to play things off a little more straight, he continually falls back into the charmingly befuddled persona he's become so known for portraying. The problem is, what worked for him at 20, 30, even 40 comes off far less as charming and far more as creepy, possibly lecherous. He looks much older than his 55 years (don't let the promotional photo fool you, someone has gone nuts with an airbrush on that thing ), and it affects the performance. Robert Downey Jr. may have been a better choice for the role, while for Grant, it may be time to investigate different types of characters (I'd really like to see him take on Alfred in a Batman movie about ten years down the road).I watched the crowd as the the theater emptied. It was heavily female in demographic, and I heard a lot of complementary words about the film as they left. As the credits rolled I got a better impression of what I had just seen. This is a date movie for married people. It doesn't quite reach the "Triumph of the Human Spirit" levels for me but it's a cut above any Hallmark film out there, and a nice way to spend some time in that forgotten era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming curiosity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been an enormous fan of Meryl Sreep since the very beginning of her long and immensely distinguished career. She is unquestionably the finest actress of her generation and it has been wonderful to see how she had continued to secure decent roles as she has become older. So her performance as the eponymous American singer (1868-1944), with a passion for song but an inability to sing in tune, is characteristically accomplished. Hugh Grant has rarely been better as her devoted English husband and Simon Helberg is fine as her pianist. The work is played for laughs but there are real touches of humanity and pathos. Ultimately though this light-hearted film, directed by the British Stephen Frears, is not much more than the subject it portrays: a charming curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singing so wretched I almost retched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, the characters in this movie only laughed at each other and I found that pathetic. So I didn't laugh at all. It's a true story that need not have been told, at least not by this cast and crew. I would have adored the mid-century scenes had they been shot from a vantage point that was the least bit interesting. In fact, I found ALL of the shots missed their mark. Hallways and rooms, streets and staircases that were cluttered or better yet empty were photographed dead-on, as with a point and shoot camera. I knew going in that I was going to hear off key singing but had no clue there would be sooooo much of it. I felt, from viewing the previews, that I would once again love Hugh Grant but might feel him mismatched to Meryl Streep. And I believe he was. If there was a show to be stolen then Simon Helberg is the brilliant robber as pianist Cosmé McMoon. But even he made me cringe pronouncing pianist (he said PEE-uh-nist) in an accepted manner but not the one that sounds like piano (piANist). Wish I could un-hear and un-watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why don't I like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that I should like it more than I do. After all, it's made by Stephen Frears and has a first rate cast who perform well. And on the face of it the film is funny, and at times even touching. So why am I not loving it?I think the first thing that put me off was the tag line on the billboards advertising the film. "Every voice deserves to be heard." Well that's just rubbish. Everyone may have a right to exercise their voice, but that's a very different thing from every voice deserving to be heard. Jenkin's most definitely did not deserve to be heard. So there's a serious problem with the movie's sensibility before I even get to see it.The second problem is that the movie is funny, but mostly for the wrong reasons. We're never invited to laugh with any of the characters. Only at them. Especially, we are invited to laugh at Mrs. Jenkins, just like she was laughed at by her real life audiences. Except, if she didn't deserve to be heard, she really didn't deserve to be laughed at. Perhaps the fact that she's rich and self indulgent is supposed to make it okay, but if you don't feel guilty laughing at this movie, then there's something wrong with you. And if you understand that she was so oblivious to her own awfulness in part because of treatments for syphilis contracted from her first husband, then your guilt should be even greater. I don't much care to go to the movies to feel guilty about enjoying myself. Jenkin's was a pathetic figure, and somebody should have stopped her.Which brings me to my third problem. They didn't stop her because they were using her. Her friends, who lied to her about her talent (or lack thereof), most likely because she funded so much of their New York music scene. Her music coach and pianist who were getting a pay check for it. And her partner, who was riding the gravy train. Perhaps his showing of affection for her is supposed to make him understandable or complex, but is he likable for not being a complete fraud and a cad? And lastly and most important, Jenkin's seems to be used by the movie itself.The production values, especially costumes, are terrific. The performances are great. Still. Now I feel like I have to shower...again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>English version of Marguerite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shamelessly plagiaristic version of the 2015 French movie Marguerite. The story line is basically the same, with a few variations. In Marguerite, a wealthy woman, who has been mislead by her entourage into believing she could sing, decides to embark on a career as an opera singer. I would suggest you see the French version first, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4428788/ The Marguerite movie is done with that quirky French sensibility and sense of humor that defines French cinema. It won four (4) Cesar, the French equivalent of the Oscar, and was nominated for 6 more. Then if you want too, see its copycat with Meryl and Hugh. And compare. It was a nice change that they paired Meryl with a younger man. It's usually the other way around. I remember when she was considered too old to be the love interest of Clint Eastwood in the amazing Bridges of Madison County.Personally, I thought the English remake was not as good. No surprise. Remakes are rarely as good as their original inspiration, but you can't tell until you see both. I love dame Streep and she can do no wrong in my book, so this is not meant to put her down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh......Individual performances good, overall though the movie was not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that what I am saying may seem contradictory - but here is why -Spoiler AlertThe movie concerns a socialite singer - Meryl Streep - who due to disease is in declining health and talent. Her husband - Hugh Grant - lovers her but still manages to have a little side action, although the relationship falls apart when he tries to defend his wife. Finally, there is piano accompanist - Simon Helberg - who seems out of place in the entire weird situation.The problem is the script. Large chunks of the movie are concerned with showing one gag. The gag, albeit serious, is the Streep character - Florence Foster Jenkins - cannot sing. That is OK, but for some reason the movie spends a ton of screen time with Streep singing poorly. Indeed, probably a third of the movie is just Streep singing poorly. Yes, we get it - she cannot sing anymore, her husband is trying like mad to screen her from negative experiences in order to help her stay happy - but the movie spends so much time on this and other lengthy bits that don't add to the overall story that it feels almost like padding. There are some interesting bits in the film - for example Jenkins carries a briefcase constantly that contains her will - but the case is made a big deal early in the film and when the secret is revealed it is basically a 60 second sequence that falls flat - no explanation as to why she carried it constantly. The individual performances were fine - Helberg's especially - but they seem wasted in the movie overall. So a disappointment overall really - too bad, because I like Streep and Helberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressive - Yet Another AWFUL Streep Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of Meryl Streep. It has always amazed me that she is considered a "great actress". Streep never loses herself in her character. You never ever forget she is Meryl Streep playing a role. And, the older she gets, the stronger the aroma of HAM becomes.Meryl Streep has "coasted along on her reputation" for the past fifteen years. In this movie she gives yet another overly mannered performance. She becomes like as human black hole. This is an enjoyable movie - except for the scenes Streep is in.I wonder why Streep continues to accept roles in which she sings. The woman may be talented, but she cannot sing. And, yes, I realize she is NOT supposed to be a good singer in this film, - but she cannot even do that right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PG - audience limited to anyone over 70 years old and female</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the worst I have seen for a long time. It was suitable for only females aged over 70 years, if that. Meryl streep's (Florence)'s acting was good enough, it was not believable that Hugh was her husband (he seemed way too young) and he didn't pull the part off well. Leonard from the Big Bang (Cosme) played a sweet but pathetic role. You can't help but love Cosme. There are discrepancies between the movie and her life's story (whichever is true who will ever know). You feel sorry for Florence but at the same time you think "what the heck!!!!". Oh, if only we could all have endless amounts of money to make our dreams come true. I don't recommend this to movie to anyone who is not a "dreamer".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries hard, but ultimately over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not work for me. The set and costume design are impeccable and the structure and basic story are solid. But I just felt that the acting was over-blown, the chemistry between the actors was non existent, and the script did not zing or engage you. I felt the lead actors are not suited to their roles, particularly Simon Helberg as pianist Cosme Moon, but also Meryl Streep as would-be opera singer Florence Foster Jenkins. Helberg and Streep tend to mug and eye-roll through their scenes. Helberg is much more focused in the sitcom Big Bang Theory. In this movie, he's so nervy and jerky it's annoying. There were some interesting themes in the story, such as how people delude themselves, and how other people support their delusions. Also how people use and deceive others for their own ends -- Florence's husband St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant) comes across as a terrible cad, flagrantly keeping a mistress in an apartment Florence pays for, while pretending to adore Florence in exchange for a comfortable lifestyle. But he claims that Florence is aware of all this -- so is she also using him? Florence's role as an active patron of the Arts is mentioned, and also her tragic past contracting syphillis from her first husband. Mostly she is made fun of, which at time seems cruel. But is it her friends, or Florence herself who created the culture where no one was brave enough to tell the rich lady the truth? In many cases, it suited people financially to protect her delusions, and admittedly it created some absurd situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Costumes, Shame About The Rip-Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be both foolish and inaccurate to describe Meryl Streep as anything but a fine actress and nor do I begrudge Stephen Frears the right to earn a crust - with only a journeyman talent he needs all the help he can get - but I would probably have enjoyed this film more had I not already seen the superior Marguerite, released in 2015 and already awarded Four Cesars (the French 'Oscar') including Best Actress, Catherine Frot as the eponymous leading lady. Marguerite was a lightly fictionalised version of Florence Foster Jenkins with minimum effort to conceal the fact. Marguerite is based in Paris in the 1920s where Marguerite Dupont is a wealthy society hostess with a delusion that she is a gifted Opera singer and a husband and group of friends who go along with her lack of self-awareness and shield her from the ridicule of the rest of the world until she decides to give a concert at the Opera House in Paris. The real Florence Foster Jenkins did more or less exactly the same thing except that she hired Carnegie Hall in 1944. The biggest crime that the producers of Florence Foster Jenkins are guilty of is a cynical and ruthless attempt to erase Marguerite out of existence. The FFJ PR has been in full flow during the last few weeks with Streep working overtime on talk shows and in print to promote the film whilst Marguerite played a handful of unheralded performances at Cine Lumiere in March. When I caught Marguerite in Paris in December and reviewed it on this very site I predicted that FFJ would draw all the attention largely because of Streep and it seems I was correct. Catherine Frot does not need to take a back seat to Meryl Streep, she is equally accomplished, equally versatile and is also a fine stage actress. The same may be said of Isabelle Huppert who also fell victim to UK rip-off when Mike Leigh ripped-off the Claude Chabrol-Huppert movie Une affaire de femmes more or less in reverse fashion: Une affaire de femmes was based on the last woman to be guillotined in France, during World War Two. Her 'crime' was to help French women abort German foetuses. Mike Leigh's Vera Drake transplanted the action from France to England and moved the time forward to the 1950s otherwise he just replicated Chabrol- Huppert. Leaving no stone unturned FFJ even 'borrows' the idea of the risible/grotesque/weird accompanist portrayed by Victor Buono in Whatever Happened To Baby Jane, down to the initial horror when first he hears his 'boss', respectively Bette Davis and Meryl Streep 'sing' and a final nod by FFJ to the superior Marguerite comes at the end when Streep is shot from behind, standing centre stage wearing the huge 'angel' feathered wings. If this rip-off encourages punters to seek out Marguerite it will have served some purpose.</fullReview>
