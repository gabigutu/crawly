		<fullReview>As a HUGE fan of John Waters films, I have nothing but praise for this film. So fun, so campy, so enjoyable ( and you know...there IS a real plot inside the film. It's not just music and hair! ) The characters are at once silly and loveable, esp. Divine as Edna Turnblatt. And who can't love Ricki Lake as the voluptous teen sensation, Tracy Turnblatt!?! It's such a great movie. The one liners alone make me howl, as well as the great 60's look they were able to COAT the film with ( like hairspray? ) The clothes, the furniture, the makeup, EVERYTHING. Stellar pseudo B-movie casting ( Debbie Harry, Sonny Bono ). It's a favorite!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless teen satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily John Waters' best flick in terms of writing, direction, and mainstream appeal, it still has great little twisted touches like the rat Tracy kicks mid-makeout with her boyfriend, &amp; her witchy rival's inevitable barf scene at the amusement park her bigoted parents (played by rock stars Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry) own. There's a strong undercurrent about race relations in 1962 Baltimore where the story is set, highlighted by Mrs Pingleton (Joanne Havrila)'s moronic descent into a black neighborhood to 'rescue' her daughter Penny from the arms of her black boyfriend Seaweed &amp; be ridiculed by the residents. This is crosscut with the sheer exhilaration that Tracy &amp; Penny are having dancing with their beaus in a black record shop down the street. Divine is hilarious as both Tracy's mom and the racist owner of the television station which hosts the Corny Collins 'American Bandstand' clone. And the music is fabulous early rock'n'roll, all Brill Building &amp; pre-Motown soul stuff like Lesley Gore &amp; Chubby Checker, with wonderful choreography throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it when it first came out, I've seen it several times since, and my last viewing was just a few weeks ago. It never seems flat or old.It takes a look at an issue that doesn't necessarily seem to be a goldmine of laughs (racial difficulties in the early '60s) and turns it into just that without robbing it of any dignity or sense of importance. John Waters seems to have pulled out all the stops to insure this outcome, and it really paid off.The "pleasingly plump" pre-talk show Ricki Lake turns in a great performance in a role that's an inspiration to "chunky" girls everywhere.As always, Waters picks cameo and supporting actors that are dead-on perfect. His own turn as a psychologist is an absolute scream! Brimming with hysterical lines and set-ups, this is a comedy you need to see, if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be without a doubt my favourite movie. There are probably better but none that I have enjoyed as much. Its perfectly cast and well written. Ricki Lake, Divine, Vitamin C and of course Debbie Harry all shine. It deals with such a sensitive issue thats still relevant today (prejudice) in an easily digestable and engaging way. I love the dances and the whole feel of this movie. Its one you love or hate and I definatly love it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Free Tracy Turnblad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray both this version and the new 2007 one are a pair of great satirical films about teenage mores in the early Sixties of the Civil Rights Era. Sometimes our heroes and heroines for civil rights and human decency can be found where you least expect.Such a person is Tracy Turnblad played by later television host Rikki Lake who's a full figured gal in every sense of the word. Her biggest desire growing up in Baltimore of the Early Sixties is to get on the local teen hop show hosted by Corny Collins. The regulars who dance there have a celebrity status, but something a fat girl dare not hope to dream.Tracy doesn't hope, she lives the dream and actually gets picked to dance and be a regular to the distress of plastic teen princess Colleen Fitzpatrick. But it's a cause for celebration for Tracy's parents played by Divine and Jerry Stiller and her best friend Leslie Ann Powers.All this is against the background of the civil rights era and Baltimore had its problems also. The Corny Collins show is segregated with a prescribed Negro Day once a month. That seems as bogus to Tracy as baseball being segregated not too long ago and she joins the fight to integrate the show. She's even convinced her teen dream new boyfriend Michael St. Gerard to join in as well.A subplot is Powers finding love herself in the person of Clayton Prince who is black and that's upsetting to a lot of people, not the least is Powers's mother. It would be within that same decade that the Supreme Court did away with miscegenation laws, so these kids are running some real risks.Hairspray is a very funny film with a very serious message about live and live. In fact that's the main problem with the world today right now, certain people feeling they've got the right through religion or secular philosophy or plain out and out wealth who just feel they've the right to dictate the lives the rest of us are supposed to lead in conforming to how they see the world. In the remake of Hairspray, Queen Latifah who plays Ruth Brown's role of Motormouth Mabel says to the characters playing the Powers and Prince roles that as a racially mixed couple that those young people should be prepared for a whole lot of stupid in the world to deal with. One cast member of this version of Hairspray had occasion to deal with a whole lot of stupid back in 1994.In the cast he's listed as Keith Douglas, lead singer of the Lafayettes DooWop group, but he was Keith Douglas Pruitt, a talented musician, actor, and composer. He and his partner were attacked by a trio of suburban rednecks who were dismayed at seeing two members of the same sex holding hands on Waverly Place. Keith sustained a fractured skull and a hearing loss for a while looked to permanently impair his career in music.It was in my working days with New York State Crime Victims Board that I met Keith Pruitt. I did the claims for both he and his partner, giving them what my agency could provide for both of them. He did go back to work eventually to the applause of his friends and admirers of his work. Keith Pruitt died only a week ago at the age of 47. He left a legacy in art, but he also left a legacy in life as a genuine hero. One who certainly never started out to be one, but things are thrust upon us in life sometimes. He stood up to the homophobic bigots and bashers with dignity and pride. I'm really proud I knew him and was part of his story in a small way.And so this review of Hairspray is dedicated to Keith Pruitt, someone we can all emulate in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baltimore teens dance and battle segregation in the '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ricki Lake plays Tracy Turnblad, a short, chubby teen with big hair who loves to dance in "Hairspray," a 1988 John Waters film starring Divine, Deborah Harry, Sonny Bono, Ruth Brown, Jerry Stiller, and Mink Stole. "Hairspray" has now been immortalized on Broadway as an enormous, energetic, fabulously entertaining musical which kept the conceit of a man playing Tracy's mother, again with great success."Hairspray" is highly exaggerated in parts, which makes it extra funny, and Waters captures '60s Baltimore beautifully. Corny Collins, who is the Baltimore Dick Clark, would like nothing better than to integrate his television show, but blacks are only permitted to dance one night a week. The van Tussles are for segregation - that would be Sonny Bono, running for office, his wife Harry (on stage the former Miss Baltimore Crabs, in the film Miss Soft Crab). Harry's hairstyles are fantastic - HUGE - her last hairdo is in the form of an enormous loving cup.When Tracy's friend Penny takes up with the son of an outspoken black woman, Motormouth Mabel (Ruth Brown), her hysterical mother has her kidnapped and put in the hands of a psychiatrist (Divine as a man) who tries to torture her to stop liking black men. It's so outrageous it's funny, and that's where Waters shows his talent. When Tracy gets a contract modeling for a plus-sized woman's shop, the owner's live ad on Corny's show begins, "Tubby, tubby, 2 x 4, can't get through the kitchen door." It's this madcap treatment that keeps any of this from being remotely offensive.All the performances are delightful, and there's a nice turn by Pia Zadora as a black-haired beatnik chick."Hairspray" has a lot of warmth that emanates from Tracy and the Turnblad family, and the mood stays upbeat throughout the entire film as the characters dance through life, Tracy with an overlay of blonde hair over her dark flip. Great music, great fun. "Hairspray" in any version is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia gone askew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Waters reveals a somewhat more sentimental side with "Hairspray", a movie several people have told me they absolutely hated. I wondered what it was about Waters' style as a filmmaker that could provoke such anger? I think it's his affection for '60s movie-clichés transposed through nostalgia and Waters' own gross-out sensibilities (and his particular brand of humor, which can be quite wicked). I didn't much care for the film the first time I saw it, but I gave it a second chance and it grew on me. The reckless amateurishness is off-putting at first, but you have to meet "Hairspray" halfway. There is much to enjoy here, not the least of which is Divine as Ricki Lake's mom (and also as a bigoted network bigwig); wheeling and dealing after her daughter finds TV fame, Divine becomes a coiffed society queen, twisting away in front of the television and tossing off jaded quips like, "It's the times...they're a-changin'." The performances are all happily hammy, colorful and amusing, and the lightweight story comfortably shoehorns-in relevant political issues to counterbalance the slapstick. Ricki Lake is very appealing in her debut; also hilarious, Pia Zadora as a beatnik and Debbie Harry as the mother of Lake's main rival ("1-2-cha-cha-CHA, 1-2-cha-cha-CHA!"). It's not a seamless, polished picture, but it does have heart and charm and this sold me--but on the second time around. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waters' talent undeniable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an abomination like 'Pink Flamingos' it was a surprise for me to learn that this guy had talent. Like Spike Lee or Oliver Stone, you've got to admit that John Waters, like him or not, is a born moviemaker. Also like those two (and ultimately all great directors) he knows how to speak with his own voice and translate his vision to the screen.His writing is most impressive here as he manages to point up the evils of racism and segregation while not abandoning his wacked-out comedic style. And his eye for period detail is uncanny (as long as the period wasn't too long ago!) 'Hairspray' is great entertainment, fun to watch and edifying, too. Who would have thought that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is a John Waters film?!?!?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I was sure surprised by this film! If you've seen any of John Waters' earlier films, then this movie is a major shock because in so many ways this movie seems very,....normal and even uplifting!! This, coming from the same director was delighted in nauseating his audiences or shocking their sensibilities!! HAIRSPRAY, despite being funny and unusual in many ways, is actually a very family-friendly and endearing film! These are certainly NOT the sort of things I thought I'd say about a Waters film. I like his offensive and mondo-bizarro-type films, but after viewing HAIRSPRAY I realize that I like the direction this film took. Sure, it's extremely sentimental and "nice", but the film is so dog-done fun and has such a decent central message that it's something I highly recommend to the kids! Surely this CAN'T be the same John Waters who produced the X-Rated FEMALE TROUBLE!! Well, believe it or not, it is and Waters has actually gone "mainstream"! Wow,...next I'll see pigs fly! I initially avoided this movie because I had seen a few small glimpses of it and thought it looked too tame and a trifle boring. However, I am so glad I forced myself to try it again. The film has absolutely everything going for it--infectious music, a great style and love of the time period, a lot of great laughs, a strong socially-conscious message and a lot of characters you can't help but love.The most shocking thing about the film to me, though, was that Divine played a very wonderful and touching mother! Despite his/her great size, she loved her daughter, Tracy, and her husband and seemed like a pretty typical housewife--despite actually being a guy in drag. Divine also played a male role as an ultra-racist jerk and it was fun seeing him in dual roles (which he also did in FEMALE TROUBLE when he made love to the female version of himself, believe it or not).Ricki Lake played one of the more wonderful characters of a teen I have ever seen. Despite being very overweight, she was the type of kid I would love to have as a daughter--being very self-confident and decent through and through. It was also great seeing the plus-size Lake dancing very credibly in the film. In fact, I loved her dancing and the songs--you can't help but snap your fingers and enjoy them. What I particularly liked about her character was that Tracy knew she was fat but didn't care, and as a result, those around her accepted her. In particular, the cutest guy in the film fell for her and could look beyond her weight. I know this isn't exactly like real-life, but it's sure how I wish life was and it is so great to see a non-neurotic fat and happy girl on film. All too often, they are either ignored completely (such as the unwritten "no one above a size 6 allowed on the film" rule), or shown as pathetic or tortured (like in the excessively pointless and cruel French film, FAT GIRL).Since it really is a John Waters film, despite all the nice and wonderful things, there are also the usual strange supporting characters as well. The best examples are Ric Ocasek (lead singer from The Cars) and Pia Zadora as the drugged-out beatnik couple that have very little to do with the movie's plot. But there are also appearances by Debbie Harry (from Blondie), Jerry Stiller, Sonny Bono and a few others who bounce in and out of the film. Strange casting, by the way is THE one constant in all Waters films.Now for the plot, despite the whole emphasis on huge hair and doo-wop music, there is actually a deeper story that has substance. Ricki Lake (Tracy) has just become a regular on a local dance show (similar to American Bandstand, but set in Baltimore). She's an instant local celebrity and adored, but despite this, she cannot ignore that Black people are never allowed on the show with White kids--even though the music all has roots in the African-American culture. When her dippy friend (Penny) begins dating a nice Black man, Tracy cannot just ignore the segregation even though it would have been the safest thing for her to do in the early 60s where the movie is to have taken place.This leads to perhaps the funniest portion of the movie. Although there is a strong message of tolerance and racial togetherness, it is handled in a very funny tongue-in-cheek manner. When Penny and the gang go to a Black neighborhood in Baltimore to learn more about the local dance scene, her mom assumes Penny is going to be murdered! When this hysterical woman chases them into the "ghetto" and then behaves like she is going to die, it is a laugh riot!!! Every time a Black person comes near her, she assumes she's going to die. When a hobo asks for a quarter, she gives him her purse and begs him not to kill her!!! It's so over-the-top, it's a great way to attack racism caused by ignorance. It gets even better when Waters himself plays a quack psychiatrist that tries to hypnotize and torture Penny into giving up dating a Black man! Despite how it sounds, this is not offensive but subversively funny! Overall, it's rare that I enjoy a movie as much as I liked this one. And when it was over, I felt great--and that makes this a truly special movie.UPDATE: I just saw the movie again and, begrudgingly, I must admit that I actually like the remake better. It did seem to have an energy level and polish that made it just a 'hair' better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of this film this week. It is even harder to believe that just one week after it opened Divine left the world's stage forever.But, the star of the show was Ricki Lake in her first year as a film actress. She camped up John Water's script and delivered an enjoyable musical movie with a message that is just as important today as it was 20 years ago.It was really interesting seeing people like Sonny Bono, Blondie, Jerry Stiller, Pia Zadora, and, of course, writer/director John Waters himself.A goofy satire that is just as good today as it was then.</fullReview>

I love the storyline because it has to do with very realistic themes that were happening in those times. It's sad to know that this was Divine's last movie but he went all out in it. Obviously, this movie was good enough to have a musical made out of it. Of all the musical type films out there, Hairspray remains one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than the awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film that is so much better than the awful remake they did with John Travolta. The remake lacks all the things that males this version so brilliant. The humour, the great music and dancing and the underlying message about race and segregation in the 50's and 60's in the USA. There are so many good performances that it is hard to single out any. The script and direction are both brilliant and this is a rare combination of a feel good film with a serious message. it is comedy and drama, it is one of the only musical films I like and is one of those films I would happily watch over and over again. I am surprised that the remake was in fact so bad, missing all the elements that made this a great film, so in my opinion, give the remake a miss and buy this version on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "is" your Grandma's "Hairspray".....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And she's busy doing "The Madison!" The Broadway musical and film version of that long-running show have overshadowed this non-PC John Waters movie that brought him into the mainstream after years of underground movies such as "Female Trouble" and "Pink Flamingos". It also defused the impact of the original film, made not to please the general public, but make an important statement through comedy and music about racism, segregation and more subtly, bullying. It also introduced Rikki Lake to audiences as teenager Tracy Turnblad, a "Hair Hopper" who danced like Gene Kelly and had a lovable, spunky personality that attracted the handsome hero (Link Larkin). It didn't matter that she was chunky-pretty much everybody liked her with the exception "A" group leader Amber Von Tussle, whose snobbish parents (Sonny Bono and Deborah Harry) owned the local amusement park. When Tracy gets chosen for the teenage council of a local dance show ("The Corny Collins Show"), Amber is furious, and vows revenge, especially when Tracy wins Link's heart. It all comes together at a showdown where the two opposites compete for Queen of the Auto Show. In the meantime, Tracy's best friend, geeky Penny Pingleton, wins the heart of Seaweed, the teenage son of black music store owner and local TV hostess Motor Mouth Mabel (Ruth Brown) who vows to make the Corny Collins Show interracial.The top-billed Divine steals the show as Tracy's out-of-touch mother Edna whom Tracy brings into the 60's by giving her a beehive and changing her frumpy house frau dresses into more stylish couture. From the moment Divine snarls, "Keep that racket down, I'm trying to iron in here!", you know you're in camp heaven. Add on Jerry Stiller as her easy going as pie husband, Wilbur (who owns a local novelty shop), Mink Stole (as Corny Collins' assistant) and "Guiding Light" veteran Shawn Thompson as Corny, and you've got the perfect mix of eccentrics and bigots for what many people rank as John Waters' finest film. While not as racy as previous John Waters films, there are moments of non-PC humour that rank up there with Waters' funnest tasteless moments. The title song that opens the film sets the stage for everything to follow. It's a shame it wasn't kept in the Broadway version that sanitized the humour. The major difference between the two film versions was the defusing of the character of Edna; Divine's matron was obviously a volcano ready to explode, while Harvey Fierstein played the part as a butterfly with a sting. By the time John Travolta got to it, all spark was gone, and Edna seemed like a shell of her former self. As for the original version, everybody is letter perfect. Michael St. Gerard delightfully makes what could have been a pompous conceited character extremely likable, while Colleen Fitzpatrick is everybody's teenage nightmare as Amber. Clayton Prince is charming as Seaweed, and Leslie Ann Powers exudes innocence as Penny. As her frantic mother, Jo Ann Havrilla is extremely funny. "Get away from me, you voodoo woman!", she screams at Ruth Brown ("Ooh Papa Tooney, We Got a Looney!), who is simply delightful as she brings black and white teens together as if a Den Mother for "Checkerboard Chicks". Pia Zadora and Ric Ocasak offer amusing cameos as a pair of beatniks. The ending is delightful, although the plight of the Von Tussles is somewhat off-putting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divine's swansong, and John Waters' commercial peak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the high point of John Waters' career, HAIRSPRAY is a fun, energetic and infectious movie with a top-notch soundtrack and earnest performances from everyone involved. The story centers around Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake), a "pleasantly plump" teenager who spends her afternoons watching the Corny Collins Show, where teenagers dance the most popular dances to the latest tunes. She manages to get on the show, and from there hopes to bring integration to Baltimore, Maryland (this takes place in 1962). While still maintaining some of the weirdness which made John Waters (in)famous, this film rises above campiness because of the social ideas it embraces, e.g., racial equality. There's also hints of commentary on fame and child stars, akin to themes explored in more explicit ways in his previous films, but the focus here is on bringing people together. And what better way than through music and dancing? Just about everything in the movie works, from the retro fashion which has been lovingly recreated/exaggerated to the choreography and music. It's so catchy that you just want to get up and dance yourself. Still, the movie isn't without its negatives. The narrative is a bit thin, and the conflict is resolved a little too easily, but this can be mostly forgiven because of the strength of everything else around it. Recommended for moviegoers of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Hairspray by John Waters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks for the opportunity to say, Hairspray, the John Waters version shows the most accurate portrayal of 60's life anywhere, let alone Baltimore. Racism and how John Waters handled it with such humor makes him a King in my book. The Stephen King of comedy. Meanwhile much of the cast has went on to stardom and recognition in other venues. Right Riki Lake? One of my favorite cast members from the show Holter Graham, Mr. "two out of sight years" is currently staying busy appearances on soap operas, detective series etc. You know how you could just swear that your seeing someone familiar on a show but access to the cast? Well there you go, because I always thought I was seeing him here and there.I'm glad to have just found out, thanks to todays modern technology (you tube)! Keep rocking!

		<shortDescription>Divines cheerful farewell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a joyful and heartfelt movie this is, and totally different from many other US productions, thanks to John Waters ability to dare to stand out. First of all, this is the final movie from the late (great) Divine, who sadly passed away a short while after the film was released. He is really good in this film, and plays one of the lead characters with humour, passion and with a heart. The film has, as John Waters other films too, many funny, and strange cameo appearances, who are amusing and entertaining. Debbie Harry shows her acting talent in this film too. The story is light and cheerful, but underneath it has a message who deals with a more serious matter, racism. John Waters brings back a world of 50-music and Dance in this film, and it's very well done. This is so much better than the remake and no one can play Edna better better than Divine although John Travolta did his best. Ricky Lake does a good job here, but is not the films biggest asset. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray directed by John Waters is one of the first movies that he directed that was mainstream and less obscure/ extreme to cinema goers in 1988.I decided to give the original version of this movie a go before watching the 2007 remake I have seen this movie at least five times and is one of those movies that never gets old or flat after watching it multiple times.My favorite character was Edna Turnblad played by drag queen Divine.I thought this movie was more cruder than the 2007 remake but it was still acceptable to mainstream cinema.I really liked the songs in this movie.This movie was very funny and had some fantastic quotes.This is one of the few musicals I liked.Rating : 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and surprisingly watchable John Waters film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/12/2008- (Dir-John Waters): Fun and surprisingly watchable John Waters film about an overweight teen trying to make it on a 50's dance show. Rikki Lake is great in the lead and Divine does a good job as her understanding mother. Despite the filmmakers reputation there are very few gross-out scenes and a good anti-racial theme protecting both overweight people and blacks. The movie has a silly premise and approach but actually does a good job of showing how stupid some of the laws against African-Americans were in the fifties and the sixties. The movie also just flat out entertains and doesn't try to take itself too seriously. I'm actually now looking forward to watching other John Water's films because of this one although I'm sure most of them are not as tame as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And by that I don't mean the colour of someone's skin, but in the manner of The League of Gentlemen etc but rather than using gross or weird out comedy it parodies one of the most disgusting periods of humanity's history, when someone could be looked down on, legally, with the full backing of the law and the public unwillingness to integrate when it was finally legislated against.This really was a more than decent watch if you let yourself suspend your incredulity a little. The dancing show was a hilarious parody of a 60s show, the performance by the parents and the 3 presenters outside of the show environment especially stand out as works of comedy genius with the children just there as a plot device to move the story on.7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1960s Baltimore. Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake) and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Leslie Ann Powers) are obsessed with The Corny Collins Show and audition for the all-white local TV show. Blacks are relegated to Negro Day. Tracy becomes a hit infuriating queen bee Amber Von Tussle (Colleen Fitzpatrick) and her stage mom Velma (Debbie Harry). Amber's father Franklin Von Tussle (Sonny Bono) owns Tilted Acres amusement park. Tracy befriends the black students in school and record store owner Motormouth Maybelle. She starts dating Maybelle's son Seaweed and joins an effort to integrate the show.It's campy fun. John Waters keeps his weird indie extravagances in check to bring something a little more mainstream. He dives into issues that are near and dear to his heart. The deliberate corn is endearing although it could use more outright laughs. This is a really sincere and touching movie. The actors led by Ricki Lake are mostly good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray (1988) *** (out of 4) An overweight teen (Ricky Lake) must battle a skinny teen to win a local TV dance show as well as teach people that integration is a good thing. I've been wanting to see this film for quite some time now and while I found the film to be entertaining I think Waters scored better with Cry-Baby when it comes to his throwbacks to the 60s. There's a lot of great stuff here including Waters ability to make the film feel like the 1960s and the performances are all very good. I'm not a fan of Lake but she steals the show as the teen with a heart to do whatever she wants. Sonny Bono is also good in his role as is Divine as Lake's mother. All the stuff dealing with integration is handled very well, although I think it takes away from Lake's story so I think it should have been cut back some or it should have played a part in the film from the very start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, some parts of this movie have left me laughing to death. And these weren't the "meant to be funny" parts. This version of Hairspray is definitely cheesy. However, it was alright. When I saw this movie for the first time on ABC Family, I was really excited. Then, as it began, I was getting the feeling the whole movie would be filled with cheesy jokes and corny acting. ***Spoilers begin here***The scene where Penny and Tracy are watching the "Cory Collins Show" to the time where Penny said "I'm always punished," was where the worst acting took place. The rest of the movie was pretty good, except for the parts where Tracy and her classmates where playing dodge ball, and when the riot broke out at Tilted Acres.All in all, I gave Hairspray a 6/10 for alright acting, good dancing, good laughs and corny (so to speak) moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray is a wonderful John Waters quirk fest about racial equality, music, fat vs skinny and weird inhabitants in Baltimore!*******SPOILERS******Ricky Lake pre "go Ricky, go Ricky" plays Tracy Turnblad a fat...OK pleasantly plump teenager who wants to be a featured dancer on the COrny Collins show. Tracy the outgoing sweetheart and heroine to fat girls everywhere is mocked for her girth and her big hair. In school after her hair causes a commotion in class she is sent to special ed where we learn the racist piece of garbage principal puts "the black kids he wants to hold back." Here is where Tracy meets Seaweed the smooth black kid who sets Tracy's shy blond sidekick Penny Pingletons (Leslie ann Powers) heart a flutter! Seaweed is also son to the awesome Motormouh Maybelle((love all the names of the characters!). Motormouth Maybelle0(Ruth Brown) hosts the oh so politically incorrect "Negro day" dance show (This film is set in the racial tension of the 60's), and wishes to have equality in the dance show. I always liked the friendship between Tracy and Penny. Penny is blond, skinny and way to overprotected by her looney of a mother. Tracy in turn falls for the super dreamy Link Larkin. Michael St. Gerard plays Link who looks so much like a very young Elvis Presley. Link is dating the resident rich, skinny, bitch Amber Von Tussle(ColleenFitzpatrick). Amber and Tracy have an ongoing feud as Amber does not want the popular Tracy to steal her thunder after all, she is "too fat" as Amber puts it to be on Corny Collins. Now the parents of heroine Tracy are Edna and Wlbur Turnblad. Edna is played by the wonderful Divine who is critical of Tracy's weight, even though Edna herself is no thin pin. Sensitive Wilbur is played by Jerry Stiller (Bens dad) who thinks his daughter is beautiful. Amber also has equally kooky parents Debra Harry plays Velma Von Tussle like every stereotypical trophy wife who spoils her daughter. Sonny Bono plays the equally idiotic Franklin von Tussell.My favorite think about this movie are all the quirky characters. I hear it is being remade into a musical, but i'm sorry it cannot top this JOhn Waters gem. A hilarious movie worth every moment.</fullReview>

The hope of this film is to be a timepiece, not a continued commentary on society. Excellent casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Waters does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this one came out everyone couldn't believe John Waters was releasing a PG rated movie. After "Pink Flamingoes", the hysterical "Female Trouble", and "Polyester", we were expecting more shock. He ended up delivering his most satisfying film to date. Ricki Lake is unabashed and completely perfect in the role of Tracy Turnblad, a chunky 60's teen who's dream to be a dancer on the "Corny Collins Show" comes true. Her dancing makes this movie, and her scenes with Divine, who plays Mrs. Turnblad, are a riot. It is such a shame Divine died soon after filming, this close to achieving the fame he deserved. Waters' casting was brilliant, including Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry as manipulative parents, Ric Ocasek and Pia Zadora as beatniks, and "Seinfeld"'s Jerry Stiller as Tracy's dad. My favorite Waters regular Mink Stole also has a part, it is still my dream to see Mink Stole make it big (She had a more memorable role as Dottie Hinkle, the neighbor Kathleen Turner cusses out on the phone in Waters' film "Serial Mom"). If you want to laugh, see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good intro to John Waters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing that John Waters likes to make outrageous movies, "Hairspray" is an easy introduction to his movies. It portrays chubby teenager Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake) trying to help bring about integration in 1962 Baltimore, all in the context of hairstyles. Watching the movie, one gets the feeling that Waters long had a thing for beehive hairdos - I mean, look at Velma Von Tussle's (Deborah Harry). But overall, it's the sort of movie that you really wish that you could experience, especially when Penny's mother gets freaked out in the ghetto.Anyway, you gotta love John Waters (who appears briefly as the psychiatrist) for making these kinds of flicks. Also starring Divine, Sonny Bono, Jerry Stiller and Mink Stole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was wonderful! There is not one thing about this movie that I don't like. I think it has to be the best John Water's film I've ever seen.. There are very few movies I can watch over and over again without getting tired of, and this movie is one of them. I can watch it at least ten times a day and just find myself wanting to watch it again and again.The main reason I liked this movie is because it's good, clean entertainment. No matter what age, you can watch it without having to hide little ones' eyes. I also like the fact that it didn't have the perfect rich girl as the big attention getter. Even though Tracy wasn't a size 2, she got the cutest boyfriend in the movie.. That is a great message to send to everyone;That you can be a little less than perfect and still receive the attention of the resident hunk. Altogether a great movie with great music and dancing, a great message,and a fun time to be had for everyone in the family!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is a hoot, and if anything I like it much better now than I did years ago. It is such a joy to see folks like Divine and the younger, heavier Ricki Lake strutting their stuff so hilariously. It makes you feel GOOD.It has a nice message, but don't expect any real depth here. It is a light-hearted romp from start to finish. It just HAPPENS to also have a nice moral to it. Instead of Ricki Lake giving us a speech on how blacks and whites should live and love together, expect something more like "Let's DANCE!" The fact that "Let's dance!" means blacks and whites are dancing TOGETHER (a new concept in 1962) is implied, not preached.The big hairdos and "mean girl" tricks against the heavy girl are all actually quite timeless, making this a film that never gets old. But thanks to the wonderful John Waters, in THIS movie we finally get to bask in the glory of the heavy girl being the winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by claiming Sonny Bono can't act. But who cares, this was so much fun I even forgot Cher wasn't around. Judging from most of the bilge I've seen her in it was most likely a Godsend. I thought the dance floor sets looked realistic as did the costumes, but especially appreciated those beehive hair-dos. Corny Collins slicked back ducktail was a good laugh and he reminded me of when I used to watch Larry Kane and Dick Clark on Houston television after school. You know, back when kids actually completed dance steps instead of standing in one spot and quivering. Pia was way cool as the ahead of her time hippie chick. When the fat girl gasped, "drugs!", I almost fell out. One touching scene in the production was the polite drunk singing the song of lost love as he tottered down the walkway. Delightful little piece of nothing with lots of zany, obnoxious characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray is a satire of 60's life for a lower middle class overweight girl in Baltimore, USA. It's supposed to be tacky and pro-America. It does have some deeper moments and some points to make about discrimination. But essentially it's a warm hearted, campy, funny flick. You only have to see who the director is to know that you aren't going to get another run-of-the-mill Hollywood story of overcoming adversity. It's a trashy take on pop culture of the 60's and the performances are great. Debbie Harry is especially good as Velma Von Tusle. The dancing is great, the script is excellent and the whole movie is just a masterpiece. I feel the movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The soundtrack is also spot on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tracy Turnblad is a 'hair-hopper'. She feathers and dyes it, and wears it so high that it blocks the other teens' heads who sit behind her in geometry class. But, she has a dream. To be 'the baddest' white dancer on The Corny Collins Show. So one night, during the local Record Hop, she struts her stuff on the dancefloor during "Madison Time" and blows away the competition. She gets an invitation to try out for the counsel, and wins. But she faces opposition from senior member Amber Von Tussle and her high class family, who own the segregated Tilted Acres amusement park. Tracy vows to end segregation on the show, and falls in love with Amber's boyfriend- gorgeous Elvis-esque actor Michael St. Gerard (a boy who really knows how to do the Waddle!).John Waters successfully makes his transition to mainstream fluff, with this outrageous tale of how dance-pop TV became integrated. For some, the fact that it's extremely dated will bring it down. But the radical costumes, sets, and production design will no doubt be a real kick to the rest of us. Ricki Lake- who only got a talk show, and two measly one-line roles in Working Girl and Buffy the Vampire Slayer out of the deal- makes her film debut here. She went on to work with Mr. Waters three more times. Classic soundtrack! I can't get enough of "Shake a Tail Feather", it's my favorite in the movie. Hairspray is a lot of fun. Because it's "way beyond Grease"! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice style but that's about it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray marks something of a departure for director John Waters; a man best known for his 'bad taste' pictures such as Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble. The film still features Waters' style, but the bad taste is massively toned down and the whole feel of the movie could be described as 'John Waters Lite'. The film is set in 1962 Baltimore and music is the major focus of the film. Waters obviously realised that the style of it would be the major attraction; and as such has taken time to lay it on as thick as possible, and this blends well with the music and storyline. The plot focuses on a corny music show enjoyed by the teens in Baltimore. 'Pleasantly plump' Tracy Turnblad is one of the many obsessed by this show and sets out to get a role as one of the dancers. She achieves her goal and soon becomes a local hero, but she loses some friends when she decides to use her success in order to speak out for what she believes in - namely social integration.While John Waters' style is one of the best things about the movie, in another way it's one of the worst. In his earlier films, the content is generally distracting enough for the audience not to really notice the rather boring directorial style; but this film doesn't have that, and while the style is a big enough distraction at first; it soon becomes clear that the plot is rather lacking and the film becomes dull before we even reach the halfway point. Hairspray stars Ricki Lake in the lead role, and she does a rather good job with it. The role doesn't require any great acting talents, but she is at least bright and breezy for the duration. The rest of the cast is filled out nicely by an eclectic list of names, which includes Debbie Harry, Divine, Pia Zadora and even the director himself in an amusing role as a psychologist. The message regarding segregation may well be a good one; but really it's not all that interesting and isn't put forward particularly well, and that's where the film falls down. Overall, I do like the style of the film and appreciate the ideas behind it; but it's not well executed and I don't rate it among Waters' best efforts.</fullReview>

Any movie where the fat girl steals the dreamy heart throb from the "perfect" skinny girl is a favorite of mine. This movie is empowering to big girls everywhere, even if they do have to shop at the "Hefty Hideaway." And personally, I think Rikki Lake was much more entertaining before she lost all the weight. When was the last time you saw her talk show or saw her in a movie? The musical version of Hairspray is one of my favorite shows and I would LOVE to play Tracy onstage.

		<shortDescription>Hairspray may not have been the best film I ever saw, but it is a very good social commentary set in the exaggerated fantasy world of the early 1960s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the library yesterday and ran across the John Waters movie "Hairspray." I had heard about this movie and I have heard John Waters interviewed a few times, so I thought it would be interesting to see the movie. Based on what I had heard I was prepared for some outrageous bizarre movie, or maybe a bit of schlock. I wasn't quite sure, because I never seen a John Waters movie. But he was strange in his interviews, so I thought that his work should reflect that.I put the movie into the DVD player and I heard the "Hairspray" theme song, which didn't sound too very odd. So, I started out being surprised that the movie wasn't as bizarre as I had expected. In knew that the movie featured a strange array of actors, so I waited to see how these people came across on my TV screen. Divine, Sonny Bono, and Debbie Harry were a strange collection to start with. I had seen Divine in some other strange movie that I don't remember now. Sonny Bono is a strange character beginning with his career with Cher then moving into his conservative legislature experience. And, Debbie Harry has a small place in my heart, because she is a fellow Ohio native that I respect.The plot of the movie is actually a typical hero triumph over evil plot. But, the rest of the movie is far from typical.The hero of the movie is an overweight, female teen. The setting of the movie is early 1960s Baltimore. The villains in the movie are several, society in general.But, the movie is a strange concoction of fantasy and reality. The fantasy part is that an overweight female teen is so wise to know how good should be able to put and end to racism by enabling black kids to come dance to black music on TV. She is wise enough to know that overweight couch potatoes want to watch her dance on TV so they can live their fantasy through her. She is wise enough to know that the owner of hefty women's wear store would want advertising on a teen dance show. All of these things could only be realized in a fantasy world. But the world is also exaggerated in a way that racism can be understood as fear of the unknown where the cure is clearly enlightenment. The movie frames racism as a black and white issue with an obvious solution. This is clearly a nice alternative to modern movies that embrace the reality of the gray world. I am not saying that all movies need to frame problems as black and white issues, but this is a refreshing change of pace movie.But, the final breakthrough in this movie is the realism. Realism in a fantasy movie seems to be a contradiction, but the realism is the realism of the characters. Hairspray gives us very real characters that live in a very non-real world. Of course we have the overweight heroin. We also have the nasty habit of the heroin's sidekick who continuously takes a piece of candy out of her mouth and replaces it over and over again. The red dye of the candy has stained her fingers. We have the realism of the heroin's rival puking from riding an amusement park ride.Hairspray may not have been the best film I ever saw, but it is a very good social commentary set in the exaggerated fantasy world of the early 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mega-Trash goes Mainstream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that I was a teenager in the early-1980's, for some reason I can easily sit through 1960's movies, including this one. For the first time, the undeclared prince of puke is allowed to direct a movie that isn't shown to a fringe audience. This was the final movie of Divine, the debut of Ricki Lake, and the only time Lake ever looked good -- and she looked fabulous, even with her hair ironed. John Waters made the right decision when he turned down Divine's request for a dual role as Tracy and Edna Turnblad. Somehow, Corny Collins' assistant Tammy(Dreamland veteran Mink Stole) seemed like a pre-cursor to Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob." Also, the fact that Amber Von Tussle(Colleen Fitzpatrick) was willing to dance to a song like "Shake a Tailfeather," against her mother's wishes gives me a sense that her character might not be as much of a bitch if it weren't for her parents.As Motormouth Maybelle, Ruth Brown kicks a$$ as a soul DJ with a hidden(?) agenda -- Wiping out segregation in Metropolitan Baltimore. When she introduced Gene Pitney's "Town Without Pity," you knew she was directing it at those who still insist on the false policy of "separate but equal."One of the most hilarious moments was the cartoon-like segment where Prudy Pingleton (Joanne Havrila) enters a black neighborhood to 'rescue' her daughter Penny from the arms of her black boyfriend Seaweed, foolishly thinking she was "snatched" by those "natives." A much more subtle aspect is that one of the reporters interviewing the Governor of Maryland was Buddy Deane, the real-life inspiration for Corny Collins.As mainstream as it was, looking back on it you'd never think anyone else but John Waters could make a movie like this. It's unfortunate that the real-life incidents Waters based portions of it upon didn't turn out as happily as they did here, but like all storytellers, he can make things better than they really are. I did get a sense though during one of the dance sequences that Penny Pingleton(Leslie Ann Powers) didn't exactly like dancing with Seaweed, and was actually more interested in Link. Maybe that was why she was only in one movie, but I suppose we'll never know unless Powers tells us herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a little bit about Hairspray, kinda like maybe it was an underground classic, some have heard of it, some haven't, but I just watched it over the weekend to find to surprise that it was directed by John Waters and starred Divine, I just recently viewed ...sigh... Pink Flamingos, so I had no idea as to what to expect from this movie. But I'd have to say it was a real pleasure to watch, as silly of a story as it was, it worked. In today's world, big girls are not really as well excepted, Ricki Lake took on that role as Tracy and made it OK to be big and beautiful.She plays Tracy Turnbird, a plump teenage girl who is a huge fan of a dance show called the Corny Collins show, she and her friend go onto the show and Tracy quickly jumps in to become one of the favorite dancers, in fact even more popular than her thinner rivals. But Tracy wins everyone's heart including her family and the love of the public as she goes to prove that big girls don't cry... that and you can never have hair that doesn't stand up high enough... you'll get that when you see the movie.Hairspray is a good movie, it had decent acting and a cute story that I'm sure that anyone could enjoy. So please do give it a look, I'm sure I'll see it again down the road, I told my friends about it and they are actually interested in seeing it, so goes to show you that the film might be still remembered for a few more decades to come, especially since it's being remade I just noticed, oi, Hollywood, can't you come up with something original?8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall I love this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I swear I really thought it was going to be bad. Even though I am young I truly believe that I was mean to be born in the 50's or the 60's. The way they portray the clothing and attitude and wild hairstyles I think they did a very good job and the dance show was awesome. I really wish I could have been there and It felt like I did the movie was so colorful and bright that it feels real.I love this movie!This movie reminds me a lot of Grease the attitude was very much the same but there hairstyles were not I guess thats why they call it Hairspray they use it so much like a bottle a day and there hair is so tall and big and wild it looks so hard to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Waters: His name is mostly associated with the notorious'Pink Flamingos'. A film that featured people having sex withchickens for real, a 375 pound drag queen eating dog feces forreal, a man opening and closing his, well, his hole where the sundon't shine, for real and even more perverted stuff happens in thatNC-17 film. After three more brilliant films and a seven yearabsence, John smashed on to the scene again with a film thatwas, believe it or not, rated PG. A first (And so far a last, Cry Babywas PG-13) for John and his films.Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake, in her first performance) and her friendPenny Pingleton (Leslie Ann Powers) want to do nothing but watch'The Corny Collins Show' based on a real TV show John used towatch when he was a kid in Baltimore (It was called 'The BuddyDeane Show'). They watch this every day after school much to thedisagreement of Tracy's mother, Edna (Divine, known for eatingdog feces for real in 'Pink Flamingos). One day, Tracy auditions forthe show and is soon appearing on it daily and is a favorite of thepublic, and a role model for fat girls everywhere.Of course, this is barely a plot, the real plot is about Tracy's attemptto integrate the show. You see, back in those days, adultseverywhere were racists. They may have listened to black musicon 'Corny Collins' and in real life with 'Buddy DEane', but any blackand white people together was considered disgusting. It's kind ofsad to think that was how it really was in 1962.Of course, this film is not 'Pink Flamingos' at all, this is a little girl'smovie, but a good one at that. John Waters does some excellentstuff with the talent he's got and everything in this film is nearperfect making it an excellent film to watch alone or with yourfamily. Give it a shot, it's fun!9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the heazy will they be airing this movie again???***SPOILERS ALL THE WAAAAAY--sort of.***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, seriously, is on my "favorties" section. I click on the 'Hairspray' link everytime hoping that it will air, but when I clcik on the schedule listings, it's always on the Comedy Channel, I don't have the Comedy Channel! It's not fair! :( When will they ever show this on TNT or TBS again? Damn it!? This movie's fabolous. Set in Baltimore in the early 1960's, it features a fat @ss named Tracy Turnblad. The last name Turnblad ALONE sounds like a fat @ss name. She is friendly, warm, with a big heart, big hair, and a big belly. She's in high-school, and she luvs to boogie. Her best friend is Penny Pingleton, she's smaller than Tracy is. At the football field, I think, Tracy introduces the 'black boy' Seaweed to to Tracy, saying that she's the son of the famous Motormouth Mabel (whoever that is). Penny think's he's gorgeous. She even says so."He' georgous!" Penny exclaims about Seaweed.To continue, Penny's parents are very racist. They believe in segregation, her mother is especially racist, I think. While she is around looking for Penny, she gets terrified of every black person she sees. When she pulls up to a police car, she asks for help, only to find out a black man is in the car! She screams her top off! When she reaches the store, she finds out her daughtor is 'dirty dancing' with a bunch of 'coloreds'.In that store she even tells Motormouth Mabel, Seaweed's mother, "Don't try any of your voodoo on me you NATIVE WOMAN!" That was one of the memorable quotes, I think.In the meantime, fat @ss Tracy tries out for the dance. But she has to compete with the equally as good and way more skinnier Amber Van Tussle and her snooty parents. Who will ever win the competition?In the meantine, Tracy, her boyfriend who's an an Elvis Lookalike, Penny, Seaweed 'n friends all form a demonstration in front of a segregated TV dance show, all for this black girl friend, and for every black kid who ever dreamed of being on the Corny Collins show. They want to integrate it. Obviously. The Corny Collins show is a show where all- white children dance to black songs. "Segregation Never! Intergration now!" They're chanting this over and over and over again. Till the cops come, of course.Who will ever win the dance contest between Tracy and Amber? Will Tracy win? Or will Amber's snooty parents somehow rig the dance contest so that Amber can win? Will the Corny Collins show EVER be integrated? What will happen to Penny if her racist-@ss parents ever find out she's seeing a black boy? Will Tracy lose weight in the end? What will become of Penny and Seaweed? I know all the answers already. All except the last two questions are answered in this movie.I hope they play it on basic cable again, NOT on Comedy Central, BASIC CABLE. I'm talkin' bout TBS or TNT, or something, damn it!Four stars!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful, silly &amp; retarded. But great fun anyway!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until now, I had only seen two John Waters movies. SERIAL MOM which I liked a lot and had an excellent performance by Kathleen Turner. The other one was PECKER, a more subtle and stylish Waters film. Now, I must say that I found both movies to be better than HAIRSPRAY. But that doesn't mean I didn't like HAIRSPRAY. It's a funny movie about a fat girl, Tracy Turnblad, who gets to be in a popular TV-dancing-show and becomes the local hero. This causes a lot of envy from Amber von Tussle, the local skinny blonde beauty.I must say there is a lot of dancing in the movie and I feel John Waters could have cut down on it a bit. Because you almost have the feeling that this movie is only about dancing and hairdo's. But, though the story is minimal, it is about more things than you'd expect. It took me a while to figure out whether the whole racism-theme throughout the movie was actually meant to criticize racism, or just to laugh with it. I think Waters was just laughing with it, since it was too present throughout the whole movie. And he laughs with everything else too, doesn't he? It was also nice to see that Tracy (good performance by Ricki Lake) never feels down or has a problem with her weight. She just doesn't mind that she's a bit fat; she's happy all the time. I think that Waters maybe was trying to say something by making her a role-model. Something about what's inside that counts and not just the looks.Divine playing Tracy's mum and Arvine Hodgepile was indeed rather funny. And so was Deborah Harry with her over-sized wig. But to me the real laughs came from seeing John Waters as that crazy psychiatrist. And Pia Zadora as that Beatnik Chick was one of the best things of the movie. Also, mum Pingleton with her Negro-phobia was hilarious too.So, you see, this flick is just very silly, funny and at times even a bit retarded. It might not be the best comedy out there, but who cares? And you don't even have to do an effort to follow a complex story. So sit back and laugh with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who said old farts can't change; well this reviewer saw this film for the first time today and I was thoroughly entertained. Wow, rock and roll music was good in those days 1963, and the twist was all the rage. So Ricki Lane who plays Tracy and her friends are out to change things for integration in Baltimore, MD; things get roughed up a bit, but the stars of the show Sunny Buono, Divine, who plays her Mom; Jerry Stiller who plays her brother all end up at the annual auto show for the big blowout, so watch out for the funniest scene at the end; the big blowout. Too bad they don't play music like that anymore! Today's music is outrageously loud and discordant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waters 80s fare lacks bite, but has some good bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie, but sort of a disappointment given all the possibilities of this cast and director. Waters goes for pat sentiment and feel-good nostalgia at the same time delighting his audience with cute and funny Leslie Ann Powers (whatever happened to her?) in love with her black honey played by Clayton Prince. Nice photography, great soundtrack. I wish the last part of the movie wasn't so pat in its treatment of civil rights disputes. It feels like a commercial for the Great American Way sometimes. Divine is fun (in 2 or 3 roles) and Ricki Lake is gorgeous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Junky, Clunky Movie That at Least Left the Door Open for a Good Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Waters acolytes will hate me for this, but I saw the recent movie musical version of "Hairspray" before I saw Waters' original, and I couldn't get over the feeling that the original fails in comparison.Ricki Lake does not have what it takes to play Tracy Turnblad, the chubby girl with the big hair who lands a spot on a teen dance show and becomes a Baltimore sensation. Tracy should be so engaging and lovable that no one can help but root for her, and Lake is definitely not that girl. It doesn't help that the rest of the cast acts like they're reading their lines off of cue cards, or that Waters lost all ability (or interest) in bringing his movie to a coherent conclusion. It's like Waters sets out to make his film too weird for the mainstream, but the directing and acting are too pedestrian to elevate it to the level of camp. So by the end it's just sort of boring.I'm vaguely turned off by John Waters movies. They're always so cheap looking and lazily directed, like no one, not Waters, the actors or the film artists, could be bothered to take anything very seriously. My question is: why should I expend the energy in watching this movie if the people who made it weren't even interested in the project to begin with? Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anyone who thinks the remake of this movie is better is stoooopid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading a user comment on here and someone actually said that Divine does not even compare to John Travolta as Edna. I can't even believe it! Anyone with even half a brain knows that Divine is so much better. Ricki Lake is so winning, and why isn't Leslie Ann Powers in anything else? ever? I think it's very rare to find a mainstream movie actress on IMDb.com with only one credit! I love John Waters and wished he used Mink Stole more in this movie, since she is amazing. Divine's Edna is such a fabulous mother--"I'm trying to iiiiiiiiiiiiron.." and "it's the times--they're a-changin'". Love it. The remake I would rate a 2/10. This one is so much better in every single way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Name 'Corny Collins' Says It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fast-moving film had a number of good and bad things going for or against it....at least with me.It was very corny, but that was the idea. In fact, one of the characters is named "Corny Collins." It was pretty charming film, too, with the put-ons about the old American Bandstand-type dance shows that were television for years. "Hairspray" features some good 1960s music, too.The first half of this movie is about local teens of that period and the dance and petty jealousies in the group while the second half theme is all about racism. When I saw this movie in the mid '90s, I was shocked to see talk show host Ricki Lake in here, and looking so young and fat. She was way overweight, but was a good dancer. (Some of the dances in here are hilarious.) Her mother in the film was played by transvestite "Divine." Yes, this is a another movie by the sick director John Waters who loved to feature Divine in his films, this being probably the most tame story he put on screen.The film takes place in Baltimore, and whether racism in that city was a bad as Waters portrays it here, I don't know, but I wouldn't be happy if I lived in that city and saw this movie. However, this film is like "Leave It To Beaver" combined to some of the other stuff Waters has produced over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't age well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film back in 1988...13 years later I don't. John Waters first PG rated film was considered fresh, innovative and funny back then. It was...back then. It just doesn't hold up well. The plot is (to put it mildly) thin, all the characters are skin-deep and the jokes are either forced and/or unfunny. The small roles filled by various stars are sometimes good (Debbie Harry is wonderful) but, most of the time, are really off (Sonny Bono??? Pia Zadora???!!!??). Also Waters isn't such a great director--some of the sequences are horribly staged and he does NOT know how the shoot dances. Remember, his films are well-known for their content not their cinematic quality.What keeps this film going is a great soundtrack (all from the early 60s when the movie takes place), fun hairstyles &amp; costumes and some very good acting. Divine (in, sadly, his last role) is fun as Edna Turnblad, Tracey's harried mother. As Tracey herself, Ricki Lake is perfect. She's plump, pretty and absolutely adorable. Colleen Fitzpatrick is also good as Amber, a rich witch. Ruth Brown is having a whale of a time playing Motormouth Maybell (interesting clothes Ruth!). The only real bad performance is by Michael St. Gerard (notice his career went nowhere after this). He's handsome and a dead ringer for Elvis (who he played in a 1990 TV mini) but bland. Of course, the script doesn't give him much to do.Considered to be Waters' most accessible (I agree) and best (I disagree) film. Give me "Pink Flamingoes" or "Serial Mom" anyday over this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>encouraged new stereotypes while trying to break others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this movie I was amazed at the fact that this movie attempts to break racial barriers and stereotypes, but the stereotypes regarding psychiatry (as well as beatniks in the 1960's) are over the top and I guess some call it "campy" but as a therapist who works in psychiatry I found it difficult to digest. My 11 year old had a much harder time watching this 1988 version. It was definitely groundbreaking at the time, but I am amazed at the attitudes that are reflected in this version--we've come such a long way in the past 20 years!We love the newer version--more energy, more fun, more comedy! The scene with John Travolta and Chris Walken dancing in the newer version is priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until now i have wrote decent wright ups on films, but Hairspray has got to be one of the most pretentious, over rated load of crap to date, if your Americans you will love it, but any where else your just left thinking, NO, NO WE DON'T LOVE YOU AMERICA, WE REALLY DON'T LOVE YOU AMERICA, don't get me wrong American films are the best, but once in a while you see this kind of tripe, me and my friend had just been out to have a lovely meal, and were really looking foward to watching this film, we thought a poor girl growing up in 60s America with loads of really good deep storylines with a bit of dancing thrown in, but we were left irratated by the constant YEA, YEA YEA WE LOVE YOU AMERICA COME DANCE WITH US WE ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD, CLAP OURSELFS, PAT ON THE BACK YEA YEA. Oh please the truth is, no storyline, acting was atrocious, (putting aside Rickie Lake, and Divine) there was just nothing in this movie for me to be interested in, Right thats my lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MPAA Rating: PGMy Rating: 10 and up with supervision.My * Rating: 5.5Hairspray was an enjoyable movie, but with no point. It often goes for the gag, which makes any comedy, stage, television, movie, or anything else so predictable and bomb. The concept was excellent, but I can't figure out what the point was, or what message it tried to convey. If they could think of one, why couldn't they actually imply it with the film? That was, in my opinion, it's biggest fault.Tracy Turnblad is a 'plesently plump' teen who is on a Baltimore "American Bandstand" dancing compititon. There by chance, she becomes the most popular teen dancer on the show, and only has one major rival, who continually is obnoxious in hopes to lower Tracy's popularity rating.Ricki Lake was excellent, but I thought Jerry Stiller was wonderful in this film, although Divine stole the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Overrated Movie that Does Have a few Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie a lot, I really did. After seeing the fantastic 2007 version of Hairspray and hearing a lot of buzz about the 1988 original, I just knew I had to see it. So that's precisely what I did. I went right to Blockbuster and I bought it, expecting to like the movie for my recent obsession over all things Hairspray (I listen to the music from the movie more times than you can imagine). I really didn't like it very much at all. I loved a couple things (Penny getting shock treatment was HYSTERICAL and they definitely should have kept the subplot in with Prudy following them to Motor Mouth Records and being scared of all the black people. That was so funny when she went to the officer and she realized he was black and went screaming down the street!) but it was mostly really boring. Divine was good, but he was nothing compared to John Travolta, I'm sorry to say. I also felt that the movie was too short. I also really didn't like the woman who played Motor Mouth Maybelle, but some of the other choices were just perfect. I really liked Tracy (the always-amazing Ricki Lake). The thing that really annoyed me would be that there was always a line that they made into the songs! "Hey Mama, welcome to the 60s!" Link was pretty funny, and that riot where both his legs were broken was ridiculous, but pretty funny. The dynamite thing in the hair was a bit much. I just don't see how so many people could like the original! I expected much more from it, I have to say.So don't look here for lots of fun, although the laughs often surprise you out of nowhere. This original version was very cheesy, and while I know that was its intention, I just didn't altogether buy it. As much as I like John Waters, this movie really did not impress me. The script was fantastic and the acting was comedic genius, especially from the legendary Divine. I have to say, though, that without all of the music and the insane energy, Hairspray just doesn't feel the same or have that same magic spark about it. Check it out, but don't expect more than a disposable comedy with great performances. The 2007 version of Hairspray is superior in almost every way imaginable.</fullReview>
