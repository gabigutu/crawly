		<shortDescription>Completely blew me away - the most fun I've had at the theatre so far this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring the amazing and very pretty Emma Roberts, and the always charismatic Dave Franco, "Nerve" is a new thriller about a high school senior named Venus (Emma) who joins an online community, called Nerve, of adrenaline-junkies where anonymous watchers can dare players to do, well, whatever they want to see someone do. From start to finish, this film is a non-stop white-knuckle thrill ride that is exciting, intense, romantic, and most importantly, a lot of fun. Trust me, you will have a smile on your face the entire runtime of this movie, and you'll also be on the edge of your seat. Now, I'm going to be honest, maybe my low expectations made this movie better to me than it really is, but I can't help that I had an absolute blast watching this film.One thing that was great about this movie was that the dares were realistic, and didn't feel ridiculous. All of the things that Venus is dared to do are things that you know actually could happen in real life. The dares range from her getting a tattoo, to her having to go 60 miles per hour on a motorcycle while the driver, Ian (Dave Franco), is blindfolded, and while the dares get more and more intense as the film goes on, nothing felt overly unbelievable or too exaggerated just for the sake of putting it in the film.And watching Venus and Ian complete their dares and gain money was so much fun to watch. Their chemistry was fantastic, and I bought their friendship throughout the film. What can I say? They made a cute on-screen couple. It was also satisfying to see Venus go from a shy and timid girl to an adrenaline junky, but hey, I'd do the same thing if someone was offering me thousands of dollars. The world building in this film was very believable as well. The game of Nerve felt like a phenomenon, and it actually felt like something that could happen in real life. There were shots of the city that showed the different usernames of all of the different people who were logged into the game, and this was an effective way of conveying just how popular Nerve was in the films universe.The color palette was also hypnotizing. Bright, vibrant, neon reds, blues, and purples are a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack, which is comprised of light techno music, accompanies and mixes with the colors very well and fits the overall tone of the film."Nerve" is a fantastically fun and incredibly intense movie that has great chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, great visuals to go with an awesome soundtrack, and cool action sequences in the form of the dares that the characters have to complete. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who just wants to spend an hour and a half gripping their seat with a smile on their face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Unexpected Thoughts and Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking viewers for a glamorous ride, Nerve brings a harmonious medley entertainment and thought-provoking contemplation. A multifaceted movie, Nerve doesn't fail to give the comedic, thrilling, edge-of- your seat entertainment that moviegoers crave on a night out. The chemistry between Franco and Roberts, the intense visuals, and memorable soundtrack readily draws watchers (get it?) into the movie. These features complement each other so well that the hearts of viewers still race hours after the end. For those who want a deep, discussion starting movie, the door is there for those who want to open it. There's no overt pressure from the movie to draw a certain conclusion, or for watchers to take a certain stance on social media. Rather, it presents an unbiased entry into the thrilling world of social media with its upsides and downsides. Franco and Roberts display superb acting in the way they manifest of their characters history and unique motives through the course of the adrenaline-filled night. Nerve provides a stunning look at the different personalities and impulses that draw people to social media without explicitly labeling motives as wrong or right. Nerve comes at an especially relevant time with the increasing concern over social media and its consequences, and the directors produced a wonderful spark to incite discussion and awareness on this important topic. However, there's no force on audiences to answer to the social media dilemma. Viewers draw their own conclusions as their personalities and thoughts guide them through the movie. Nerve is quite the package. There's enough nerve-racking displays to keep your hearts thumping throughout the night, but there's also the second layer of radical questioning to plague your minds as the night goes on. All in all, Nerve is a great option for those who want to experience an alluring night filled with fun and great music, and for those who want a movie that draws out that reserved, subtle, philosophical parts in ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last, a summer film with some originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With great internet power comes great irresponsibility. This is the premise behind "Nerve", a film whose producers must have wet themselves with excitement that the Pokemon Go craze aligned so nicely with the release of their film. I was delighted that at last this summer there is a film with a modicum of originality I can enthuse about. 'Vee', short for Venus (Emma Roberts, niece of Julia Roberts) is an NYC teen living in the shadow of a family tragedy and the claustrophobic presence of her over-protective mother (Juliette Lewis, "Cape Fear"). Always timidly in the shadow of her best friend ? the extrovert Sydney (Emily Meade) ? Vee pooh-poohs Sydney's compulsion with the new viral internet game 'Nerve': a social media 'Truth or Dare' ("but without the truth") challenge game where you can either be a "Player" or a "Watcher". In real time, Watchers set Players with challenges they have to complete for ever-escalating financial rewards? but "Bail" or "Fail" and you lose all. And "snitches get stitches".With their friendship at breaking point, Vee is provoked into playing the game by Sydney and teams with fellow gamer Ian (Dave Franco, younger brother of James Franco) ? someone with a history that could bring Vee into great danger. However, Vee's geeky wannabe boyfriend Tommy (Miles Heizer) is on the case?.What is so impressive about this film is that the screenplay by Jessica Sharzer (based on a novel by Jeanne Ryan) is genuinely original and is delivered with style and good humor. Sure, you can draw parallels for any film with many other sources: in here there are traces of Hunger Games/Allegiance; the "Simon Says" portion of Die Hard 3; perhaps a soupçon of "Gladiator" and Schwartznegger's "Running Man" in the mix. But this is a novel approach to a teen flick, bang on the topical money in bringing in the frenetically viral nature of social media and aspects of the 'dark web', cyber security and open source programming.The film manages to generate significant credibility about the impact that a game like this would have among a teen audience. And there is a telling message in the finale: that it is easy to be a troll without responsibility hiding behind an internet ident, but when the masks come off and the message back becomes personal then your responsibilities as an individual human can come home to roost. The film is delivered with style and verve as well, with innovative graphics (a great title and end title design) and an 'augmented reality' overlay of the action showing Players and Watchers across the city. Many of the challenges are executed really well, with a few seat-clenchingly tense moments, particularly if you have a poor head for heights.But with all this potential it unfortunately fails to be a 10* classic, smelling at times of 'B' movie. Which is a great shame. Emma Roberts is fine at what she does, but at times I longed for the dramatic depth of a Shailene Woodley or Chloe Grace Moretz, with the scenes with the under-used but excellent Juliette Lewis rather highlighting this differential.The otherwise excellent script is ? for me ? let down by a scene of male-on-female violence which I found both distasteful and unnecessary. And a coding 'geeks shall inherit the earth' moment towards the end is a little too glib for my liking. But overall the directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman ("Paranormal Activity 3" and "4") have done a fine job with a $20M budget. Regular readers of my blog (bob-the-movie-man.com) may recall my use of the "BvS quotient" ? the number of films that could be made from the budget of "Batman vs Superman": this one has a BvS quotient of 8% meaning you could make over 12 of these instead of the superhero dud. Yes please! Although if they had doubled the budget and rounded off some of the sharp corners, this could have been a true classic. It's still recommended for a memorable movie experience though, and probably makes it into my draft movies of the year list so far.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Solid movie with a good message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie comes at the perfect time with the craze of Pokemon Go; a time when you literally see millions of people obsessed with an app - where you can find videos of hordes of people in NYC all running after a particular Pokemon.This is essentially the premise of the movie: a new app (game) comes out that takes teens in a particular city by storm, except the consequences can be much graver.As to not give anything away, I try to be brief:The acting was great; the pacing was great, the color pallet and tone of the movie were all top notch. That being said, the plot - as it developed - felt "obvious", I wasn't surprised by anything and I wasn't ever emotionally "moved." The movie knows what it is, and it does it pretty well - it's a teen thriller. What the movie explores is far more important: the way people interact with each other when they are hidden behind a wall of anonymity. The movie has a good message. The BOTTOM LINE: I rate movies on whether it is worth spending the $$$ to see at a theater, in my opinion this one is worth seeing at a matinée showing ($5), but probably not dolling out $12 - $15. I hope that helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nerve: Good Concept, Poor Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie that I thought had a very cool premise, but at the same time, its trailer appeared to leave no surprises to be discovered.The Good This film's premise is definitely a fun one, and at the least, this movie was almost constantly entertaining. The dares that these people are forced to do as well as the reasons for why people are playing this game are things I found very fun and interesting.Emma Roberts and Dave Franco both give solid performances in this film, and they each work well off of each other. Roberts as Vee accurately depicts a high school senior struggling with social problems as well as college, even if Roberts herself looks like she graduated from high school six years ago. Franco's character was also an intriguing one, and he grew on me the more the film progressed.I enjoyed nearly every moment when a legitimate dare was being done, as they were handled very well and created tension excellently. The style of this movie is also a reason as to why this film feels original, as the sleek visuals create some very cool scenes.The Bad Nerve can be very fun when it wants to be, but the problem is that it also takes itself way too seriously in many scenes. This movie tries to get serious towards the end and become dramatic and have important themes, but it all comes across as incredibly dull and tedious.Speaking of the ending, no matter how serious the movie thinks it is, it is absolutely stupid. The whole plan doesn't make much sense at all, and there are way too many unanswerable questions to just let go how convoluted it is.While I did like Roberts and Franco, I had a massive problem with Emily Meade.Whether it is the design of her character or the performance, Meade is completely unlikable and lacks any sense at all, and that would be okay if we are supposed to be against her. Instead, the movie expects us to feel sorry for her, which I found impossible to do.My biggest fear coming in was that the trailer gave away too much of the main plot.I wouldn't say the trailer gave away too much, I would say the trailer gave away everything. Every single scene, besides two, in particular, I saw coming a mile away because of one individual trailer, and I think it completely ruined my film going experience. Nearly every dare, every important conflict, and even the plot twist can be found within this movie's official trailer, and I highly recommend avoiding that trailer like the plague if you have any interest in seeing this movie.Conclusion Nerve has good performances from its two leads and a unique visual style, and it certainly has its fair share of entertainment. However, though it might not be fair, the trailer absolutely ruined my experience by giving away the vast majority of the plot. Even besides that, there are issues in the film's storytelling, and whenever the movie tries to be taken seriously, it falls flat on its face. Nerve has its moments but falls apart towards its conclusion.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but there were some mistakes in the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was waiting for the movie for quite long time. I was really excited when I got to see it and it made me feel like I want to have an adventure. The movie has a great message and the actors were absolutely amazing in showing this. Spoiler alert: But after I saw the movie and I thought a lot about it, I noticed a mistake in the plot. Maybe I am wrong and I didn't understand it right and if I am, please everyone is free to correct me and explain to me what was going on. Near the end of the movie, Vee met her friends in something like a parking, she changed and she told them about her plan. Then she went where the watchers sent her and found a gun and then she went to the arena where she understood that one of them should die. So what I don't understand is: how did she tell them what the plan is even before she knew what the last dare was. If the plan was only to shut the game OK, I would understand. But Sydney called TY and he went to the arena with a gun so they had to know what the last dare was and they couldn't know if Vee didn't tell them, but she told them about the plan even before she saw the gun. This is the only thing that is really bugging me about the movie and I think that it is not something little. However, I really enjoyed the movie and I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great editing, soundtrack and acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very terrifying idea that isn't so far from reality. Nerve hits home to how people like to hide behind their anonymity online while, for example, giving hateful comments. While this concept seemed pretty dark in the trailer, it really is a young adult/teen film. The acting cast did well with their characters, and their emotions were clearly expressed. As the protagonist, Roberts did well in displaying her character's conflicting and transitioning state of mind as the story progressed. Franco does well as the male lead, but I felt that his character was a little more superficial than Roberts'. While background information on his character is provided, it feels like something is lacking. As well, I was pleasantly surprised to see both Kimiko Glenn, and Samira Wiley in the film. Both of them are more popularly known for their characters in Orange is the New Black, and it was nice to see them in roles outside of that. While I feel that Wiley wasn't in a completely different persona, Glenn certainly was. They both did great nonetheless. In terms of the soundtrack, I was very into the music played. I feel like most of them belong to the Indie genre, and I have, for the past half year or so, gotten into Indie music. I especially liked it when 'Electric Love' by B?rns came on. I'm hooked on that song. Furthermore, the crew did well in the visual effects and editing of the movie. Although I did not care for the fast cuts whenever the game, 'Nerve' is introduced, the rest of the film is edited well. Also, there are quite a few montages, and they give the audience a sense danger as the dares get more and more ridiculous. The montages, along with the dark color palette, added to and helped maintain, the thrilling tone of the movie. Overall, a pretty thrilling young adult movie, with great acting, editing, and an appreciative soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Daringly Relevant It Scares You Pantless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a game of truth or dare, minus the truth. You have a choice to be either a watcher or a player. Over the brief period of twenty- four hours, a phone app puts teens everywhere in danger through dares that are played for cash payments. In the meantime, a fan base sends in that money to watch certain players take on requested dares, specific to information picked up from their social media profiles. It is a nationwide phenomenon that is the subject of Nerve, based on the Jeanne Ryan novel, a timely piece of summer entertainment that gives teenagers what they want simultaneously with what they need.Thank goodness this type of mobile game doesn't exist, but thank even greater goodness that directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish, Paranormal Activity 3 and 4) made it feel as close to real as we could probably grasp it. The camera takes on a DSLR feel with its Steadicam effects and shifting in and out of focus, all made the more heart-pounding to watch with the intense, stylistic colors that make every image pop. The Rob Simonsen score compels with a pulsing synthesizer, adding to the imprisoning effect of the city skyline illuminated at night by the usernames of the game players. But the directing team's most creative narrative technique is the unsettling effect of putting us behind the point of view of the phone screens, as if we're the watchers communicating with the players.Joost and Schulman similarly draw us in at the start of the movie with a wonderfully stylistic opening hook, where a teenage girl's PC fills up the entire screen as if we were the ones running the show. The teenage girl of this story is Venus Delmonico (or Vee for short), played by Emma Roberts. She always has more social media tabs open than she can keep track of, which matches her cluttered mind that is set on leaving her mother's home for college. The problem? She doesn't have money to afford the dorms.But Vee does not consider herself a risk taker?she can't even ask a boy out on a date without her best friend volunteering to do it for her. Here is where the game "Nerve" steps into her life, offering a possibility to win hundreds upon thousands of dollars for each dare she achieves.Her first dare: kiss a stranger. Her second dare: take him into the city. Her third dare: try on a sparkly jade dress that costs four- grand. You can figure out the pattern from here.As the night goes on, the money is deposited into her unsuspecting mother's checking account, a romance sparks between her and the stranger she meets from the dare, and she becomes one of the top 10 worldwide players, helping her to at last feel free and respected through her rebellion. It's worth respecting the challenge Emma Roberts and her male co-lead, Dave Franco, went through to complete these dares. They work rather well together, better than most teen couples on screen, although I have to wonder, was adding a predictable love story necessary?I would not say that the screenplay turned out one-hundred-percent bullet-proof. With a story as big as this one, half of the unnecessary subplots had either little resolution or none at all. When Vee gets a tattoo for one of her dares, she tells her newly found boyfriend about the time her brother died. It could have been a meaningful moment, except it's never mentioned again, nor did it add anything to the story. Along with all the loose-ends and time- wasters, I also have one blaring question to ask: how did the police not know that any of this was going on? With a phenomenon as big as Nerve ruling teen culture, I feel like the police would have some involvement, but they didn't. I don't know how you just miss something like that.Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I did not enjoy Nerve, because it delivered exactly what it promised: on-edge terror that never stops and splendidly pays off in the end. I am sure that if you are a boy or girl also obsessed with the juvenile culture of mobile gaming, then this should just as well please you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth theater matinée, but worth the $1 Redbox price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The age of internet fame and fortune is upon us, and "Nerve" gives us the over-dramatized Hollywood version of what some people are willing to do for this type of life. Emma Roberts plays Vee, your typical high school outsider who feels the need to prove herself to her peers and the rest of the world. Her partner in crime, Ian, who is portrayed by Dave Franco is that cool, edgy, and hard counteract to Vee's soft, afraid, and timid character. Together the two have quite good chemistry, but apart neither of their characters thrived.Emma Roberts had some good scenes, some bad scenes, and one absolutely ugly scene. It's almost hard to blame the actress though, because her character's reactions to life's problems were so over-dramatized. It's understandable that in a movie that's appealing to the younger generation, cheesy high school drama between friends or love interests is bound to happen, but this movie exceeded that acceptable level of drama. What started out as a great plot with some legitimately unexpected plot twists eventually came crashing down with an absurd finale riddled with plot holes This movie did however have its strong points. The acting by those with smaller roles, such as Miles Heizer, was great and actually smoothed out some scenes that may have been rough without it. The concept of online gaming mixed with real life consequences was very interesting and could open the door to a major future theme in Hollywood. The fast pace tempo that this concept requires keeps you intrigued and engaged. The moral messages centered around peer pressure and the harsh reality of internet fame and fortune were both very clear. So overall, despite the sub-par acting jobs, plot holes, and weak finale, this movie still accomplished what it set out to do. It puts you on the edge of your seat at times, makes you feel for the characters, and gets its messages across. It may not be a movie you see twice, but it might be on you recommend for a movie night at home with some friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultra cool city slicker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directing duo Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who brought us the last most recent Paranormal Activities and probably most famed for Catfish, give us a rather illuminating adventure across New York City following participants taking part in a viral game which is sweeping across the city's hipster community where players take on dares to win money and watchers pay to spectate their favourite contestants. It's a radical idea but not so unbelievable like a purge. Emma Roberts plays Vee, short for Venus who's having typical teenage parental issues and having a high-school crush on the popular boy. She's surprisingly introverted who falls out of her shell when peer pressure from all angles gets to breaking point which leads her on a daring and dangerous path of discovery and Ian... It's the third time this year we see the charming, charismatic Dave Franco after Now You See Me and Bad Neighbours sequels, but can we trust his daring nature and out-going personality. Romance blossoms in the most unlikely places and expensive branded changing rooms is one of them. The two team up and share the night of dicey dares, but there's a limit and they certainly reach it, and are dared if not forced to cross it. Can't really hear Rob Simonson's score who did amazing work for Age of Adeline and 500 Days of Summer, as it's pushed to one side by an encompassing soundtrack with songs from Holy Ghost!, M?, Melaine Martinez, B?RNS and Halsey whilst introducing other tracks from up and coming artists like Sweetmates, Jess Kent, Hal Williams and Crystal Stilts. It's a mega soundtrack boasting nearly thirty tracks which certainly helps complete the film, however there's surprisingly nothing from Colson Baker (better known as Machine Gun Kelly) on the track-list who plays the punk-darer and main contender/competitor to the game. The film makes the city look ultra cool and stylish with plenty of clever camera work which almost gives it an anime gloss with plenty of fruity product placement. It's very slick and neon- coated as the poster suggests, very well paced for 96mins but I don't think it could go any longer. It's didn't feel like a movie and I'm unsure why, if it was the way it was shot or edited but it felt more like one of these viral TV series pilots which isn't meant disrespectful to either mediums. It does get nerve-wrecking at points but falls a little flat towards the end, becoming anticlimactic and me thinking this should end here, not being so keen on a sequel or worse still another Final Destination franchise. It's still good, worth the watch.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for the being ultra-cool whilst keeping it real. 76% 8/10</fullReview>

I hope that the movie message will go on and inside peoples minds, because it is important. You really can see here how low people can go in the time of need for LIKES and VIEWS and REPUTATION from doing 'crazy' stuffs that product nothing but shame and danger.

		<shortDescription>"Nerve" is what adrenaline junkies, like myself, thrive for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily one of the rare movies that had me on the edge of my seat at the theater. The incredible mix of teen flick, social media and intense thriller was astonishing.The title was intriguing to me and when I looked up the trailer, I came up with the conclusion that the fictional online game was called "Nerve" as to see how much "nerve" you got to complete some random challenge given to you by strangers.The story line itself is quite sloppy, but the rush of adrenaline certainly overlooks the negative qualities. The visual effect and the soundtrack help a lot too.Though I have to admit, the scene where Dave Franco is blindfolded and guided by Emma Roberts on the motorcycle, it had me accidentally screeching out of surprise and excitement.I personally think the movie is a combination of "Vine" and "Pokémon Go". Now the ending is what bummed me a bit, it was horribly predictable and cliché.All in all, it's not one of those movies I'd watch again, but some clips make up for amazingly.</fullReview>

It has good camera angles (especially Emma Roberts changing dress scene) and the soundtrack in this film was quite good. It doesn't have boring moments and the point of view camera shots on some dares really get on your wildest fears. I understand the fact that people need to have a background on social media to really appreciate this film but I think it is very timely with society today. It was a bit cheezy to add friendship issues on this movie but otherwise, it doesn't bother much with the pacing. Dare to watch this if you are curious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep your nerve - keep watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teen/YA movie, Nerve is about what could be expected: BFF relationship difficulties, new hot guy, geeky nerd, high school jocks, etc. So we know where we stand. Where Nerve differs is that, eventually, it becomes darker and much more interesting. The world of teens is hard for adults to understand as so much of their lives are spent on mobile phones. While adults use the Internet, teens rule the mobile world. And for this reason Nerve is quite believable. As an adult I am blasé and disinterested in many things, but for teens Nerve sets up a world of unpredictable excitement. It's just that the film took a long time to get there. The acting between the two main protagonists is well done, with Franco giving a far more nuanced and in-depth performance than in the Now-You-See-Me's, and Roberts moves well from ingenue to smart survivor. Naturally, the film is rapidly cut, with hardly a shot longer than three seconds, and especially at the beginning, this pace jars. Still, as the film develops the editing is appropriate and the outcome satisfying. Worth a rainy weekend evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The NERVE of some people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The internet, where would we be without it? The internet has become an ever expanding necessity in our lives, but it has also proved itself many times to be a dangerous and seriously f*cked up place. Nerve is an example of some of the many dangers that come with the social networks and internet fame, as well as the incredibly idiotic and life threatening things teenagers can be peer pressured into doing.What makes Nerve so fascinating to me is that it could actually happen someday. This film has come out at a time where apps like Pokemon Go has been the cause of many road accidents and other such crimes making the films release perfect. This idiotically-scary-in-a-real-way film has some rather tense moments whose impact is further amplified by the films scary realism. The films theme and timing couldn't have been any better and the film itself really brings the tension when it comes to what some teenagers would do for fame and money.Another great moment of this film was its build up to the ending. The film does a good job of highlighting when people using the world wide web go too far and delivering a rather powerful message on human beings desensitisation to matters such as violence. I especially liked the message sent to every Nerve users phone by the hackers. But... The film chickens out. Spoiler Alert everything goes happily ever after. The end. This annoyed me a lot as it took away a lot of the power they had if they had ended with an actual death. It felt to me that the filmmakers lost confidence in their own ending and so conformed to and everything-works-out-in-the-end ending. This was really disappointing to witness and I can't help but feel like the film copped out last minute.One thing I didn't really understand was the relevance of the backstory about Venus' brother. It comes up on occasion but overall I'm not too sure why, like maybe he was Vee's role model and so she plays Nerve to be like him... But no she plays Nerve because her friend was a b*tch to her. I guess it brings some more depth to Vee but still I'm unsure of its inclusion and impact on the film overall.Overall Nerve is a tense thrill ride that is scary in a realistic way. This film couldn't come at a better time and for the most part the messages it delivers are pretty powerful (except the final 3 minutes or so of the film). Its a fun film and I dare you to watch it. So the question is, are you a watcher or a player?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nerve is a tense, well-performed and directed original and interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With social media at the very heart of the world we live in, the film takes these elements to demonstrate the wide-spreading nature of this technology, as well as the hidden danger through its incredibly intriguing premise. Captivating and brilliantly performed by Roberts and Franco, Nerve exceeded my expectations to become one of the most tense, adrenaline-packed films of the summer. In a blockbuster season that lacked originality, Nerve brought it in abundance, dressing it up in a visually-spectacular package that is well acted, well directed, well edited, thought-provoking and intriguing. With Lionsgate wrapping up their insanely successful Hunger Games franchise with Mockingjay (Part Two) last year and stepping on egg shells with the Divergent series, this is exactly the sort of film that they should pursue as they attempt to craft their new wave of cinema.Summary: Nerve takes an intriguing premise and selection of themes, two charming leads, solid direction and beautiful visuals to deliver an adrenaline-packed, original film, that may just be one of the strongest of the summer. I dare you to watch.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/08/nerve-2016-review.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . of NERVE's close, during which many if not most "Watchers" vote for "Vee" to be shot is the unnerving chant of the U.S. Rich People Party's "Dittoheads" as they yelp "Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!" These privileged Neo-Fascists also have begun voicing their Bloodlust this week--egged on by Trumpenstein himself--with cries of "Just shoot her! Just shoot her! Just shoot her!" As these Trumpster Fires cast a coast-to-coast pall over America, not unlike Germany's Nuremberg Rallies of the 1930s, it's impossible not to see Hillary Clinton as being in the exact same position as NERVE's Vee_99: she must win her game in order NOT to be shot! Otherwise, America will experience PURGE: ELECTION YEAR For Reals, as all People of Color are "neutralized" by the Blue Lives Matter Crowd and their infamous Bomb Wielding Robots of Death. Russia's Manchurian Candidate--Trumplestiltskin--already has launched his Disinformation Campaign, and no doubt plans to steal the page from Der Fuhrer's playbook in which Adolph's henchmen burned down Germany's Capitol Building, using this as an excuse to execute six million Jews. What will Beezelatrump's October Surprise be? Stay tuned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aimed At Teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Nerve", starring Emma Roberts-Scream Queens_tv, Hotel For Dogs; Dave Franco-The Now You See Me movies, Milk; Emily Meade-Money Monster, That Awkward Moment; Richard Colson Baker-Aka Machine Gun Kelly, a YouTube rapper, Roadies_tv, Beyond the Lights and Juliette Lewis- August:Osage County, Natural Born Killers.This is a movie that hits theaters just as the Pokeman/Go craze is big. I'm sure it is just a coincidence. The movie is about an internet game that is played by teenagers using their cell phones. The game is called Nerve, meaning, do you have the nerve to play it? It's like truth or dare, without the truth part. You can either play or watch, and you have to pay to watch but you get paid, if you play and succeed, within a certain length of time. They even use drones on occasion to keep track of a player. Emma and Emily are high school friends, with Emily a regular player of Nerve. Emma is more shy and is eventually goaded into playing by Emily. Dave is another player that teams up with Emma after Emma really gets into playing the game-I'm sure the money helps her motivation. They will start a dare at $100 and later, get up into the 10's of thousands of dollars so it can be very tempting. Richard plays a competitive player that has won in earlier games and wants to continue winning-I'm sure it's the fame part that motivates him. They keep track of how many viewers a player has, too. Juliette plays Emma's mother. The movie appears to be aimed at teenagers; always short on cash &amp; common sense and would love nothing better than to get fast cash for doing reckless stunts. Now, a player can quit a dare-if they think it is to risky-but if they do, they lose all earned money they have accumulated. They would also lose their money if they squealed to anyone, such as a cop. It's rated "PG-13" for dangerous &amp; risky behavior, language, drug &amp; alcohol content and sexual content-including partial nudity-all of which involves teens and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 36 minutes. It was enjoyable enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nerve stars Emma Roberts and Dave Franco as two people who play a game nerve. The game is truth or dare minus the truth. Emma Roberts is some one who doesn't take risks and then she gets pushed into playing the game. She then teams up with Dave Franco. Is it good? It was better than expected. It is full of colors and shot beautifully. The actors are decent and the plot is interesting. The problem I had with the movie was how predictable it was. You see it coming a mile away. I really did not like the soundtrack at all. But this movie is very enjoyable. It seems like the hunger games on the internet. Some characters were not needed in the movie and some subplots don't work. Over all it was a fun ride that is very enjoyable for most of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I miss movies that have real twists. But this was a great movie nonetheless, it had your average tropes. (Good is Boring, unrequited love, dead family member, hot mystery guy, evil internet, sad rich party girl, blah blah blah). But even so, if you want to watch a new take on something old, go or it! I'm not mad that I watched this movie despite the average acting and predictability. It had great funny moments as well, I liked the part where they had to run through the store. I also enjoyed the fact that it had some truth in it. When people think they are anon, they do things they normally wouldn't do. Do I think crowd mentality would agree to kill someone? Actually, that's not far off either. Honestly, though watch the movie! It's a fun watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great beginning, good acting performances but ending fails to deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Roberts and Dave Franco performances were enjoyable and fun. This movie definitely started out great and has a lot of potential. An introvert has had enough of her extrovert best friend being the centre of attention as well as calling her out for her personality; decides to prove to her peers that she can be badass. The game Nerve is quite unique and if used correctly, could be a set up to something greater than what the movie perceives. Here comes the spoilers; everything went great until Venus decides to snitch out after learning that Ian was dared to set her to fight with Sydney. In my personal opinion, it's a rather weak reason because she barely knew Ian and after just showing up her BF, Syd, it's hard to believe she'll snitch. I rather the movie takes a darker turn whereas a death or serious injury from Sydney makes Venus snitch therefore it's more possible as well as empathize their friendship. Sydney and Mad Max has a weird connection; do they know each other??? Their interaction was weird in the movie. Venus' mom was poorly used in the movie, she just accepts everything in the end. Here is my main problem with the movie, Nerve, what are the rules!? I know it's all dare but up until two instances (guy trying to grab an officer's gun and final: Venus and Ian stand off) the dare hasn't been any criminal or physical assault acts. Sure, some dares are life threatening as well as boardline illegal but not quite criminal. So what I'm trying to say is that Nerve is inconsistent therefore ruining it's potential for greatness. Lastly is the ending. Yep, just a bunch of hackers able to break down Nerve; simple as that. And we never know who created or controls Nerve. My personal rating is 5.5 to 6.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.5 Stars. Not a perfect movie but a fun ride in the theater with an audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vee is a young woman who has taken all the right steps to advance into adulthood but is too stuck in her comfort zone to make the necessary leap. Her friend Sydney is exactly the opposite; her devil may care attitude may take her far in life or may send her into a life of mediocrity. A new mobile game, NERVE, puts both their philosophies to the test. People who log into NERVE are either Watchers or Players. It pits the Players against each other as they compete to finish ever more challenging dares, which they must stream live on their smartphone to the Watchers. Players win increasing prize money for each dare they finish. Sydney plays NERVE because she craves the attention it brings and she eventually bullies Vee into becoming a Player in an attempt to crack her out of her shy shell. The audience become the Watchers as Vee is thrown face first, literally, out of her comfort zone. The challenges begin harmless enough but spiral inevitably to complete chaos as Vee does things she never have thought of on her own. Along the way we meet a few of the other Players, who are struggling with their own reasons for playing the game and one in particular who may know more than he is telling.The movie, based on a novel by Jeanne Ryan and directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who brought us the last few Paranormal Activity films, is very entertaining. I saw it with a half filled theater on opening night and they were truly invested in the story as they cheered, clapped and gasped throughout the progressing challenges. I definitely recommend you see it in the theater with some crowd participation and I expect the good word of mouth will bring in a bigger audience through the next few weeks. As fun as the movie was though, I couldn't help but feel that, in the hands of more visionary film-makers, it could have been a cult classic. It may in fact actually reach that status based on the concept alone, and a deep theme of who is more corrupt... a person that does wrong or a person that encourages it. But Stanley Kubrick could have slayed this script with his atmospheric tension. David Cronenberg might have been more effective if he had given some of the players his patented creepy characterization. David Fincher already knocked it out of the park with 'The Game', which this movie shares some similarity with. Wishful thinking of course, but I have a tendency to nitpick in that manner as I watch 'high concept' stories like this.As fun as it is, it is not a perfect movie, its biggest flaw being the rushed third act. The rules and atmosphere created so well in the first act and mined so well throughout the challenges in the second act just don't seem to matter in the third.7.5 stars. Not a perfect movie, but a fun ride nonetheless.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW*** There is a subplot that hints at the necessity of finding out who created the game, but that is never answered. The story instead chooses to blame the watchers, and although they are certainly part of the problem and a worthwhile substitute, imagine if a Bond movie ended after he killed the henchman and the mastermind walked free. I also felt there was slight overuse of special effects, having the mobile phone buttons and text superimposed over the camera lens and having the story told through the phone, a la found footage. Those devices were used very well in the first act and it wasn't necessary to continue their use throughout the entire story to tell the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I struggled staying until the end of that movie, probably because I am not within the right demographic,so I'd say, if you are shaving already, this movie is probably not for you! (But if you are not shaving yet I am not sure I would like you to see that movie) I usually enjoy college silly movies or even some high school centered movies, but this was too much for me. Only good reason to see this movie might be for a drinking game: take a shot every time they say "OMG!" This movie is surfing big time the Pokémon Go wave, it is an ode to so many things that as an adult,are bothering me: the social media addiction(Vine,FB, Instagram), it puts ego-centrism, greed, instant gratification, instant fame into the spotlight. It encourages people to break the rules for fame, it makes attention seekers, extreme thrill seekers looks cool. But at the end there is a nice little twist and a lame moralizing lesson, which tells us do not go too far, friendship and life is more important, awwww so true, soooo nice, but...too late, the movie just spent 90 min showing people that all this crap was cool, pretty much being an enabler, validating addictive, dangerous behaviors, in front of a young susceptible audience! (or an older audience wondering why the hell I am here) We all read stories of selfie takers who fell from a crane or roof or cliff because they were trying to score a cool shot for their social media profiles... The movie is rather fast paced, but it is just watching a succession of dares: steal this, be naked, get a tattoo, risk your life...it is actually not funny nor entertaining to watch this. The main actors are likable, but it is was not enough to make me forget how idiotic this movie was. I was fooled by the 7 average, but then I realized 80% of the people watching this movie were below 25, so like I said in my opening statement, this is for a younger audience (who might pause their Pokémon Go hunt or their posting on FB, VIne, Insta... for the duration of this movie, and get their nose back into their phone screen as soon as the movie is over)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you a Watcher or a Player? My wife and I had a chance to see a pre-release screening of Nerve at the Alamo Drafthouse, followed by a live-streamed Q&amp;A with Dave Franco.The premise of the movie revolves around an online game called Nerve. The game website describes it like Truth or Dare?without the truth. I would say it's more like Fear Factor and Amazing Race, combined with Periscope live streaming and a splash of 4Chan. Basically, you can join the game as either a "Watcher" or a "Player". The Watchers pay money and propose dares for the Players. The Players have to complete the assigned dares in order to win the money. Simple enough.As we have witnessed with things like Taylor Hicks winning American Idol, or "Boaty McBoatface" winning an online contest to name a polar research ship?the anonymous masses on the Internet have a sadistic sense of humor when given enough latitude. You can just imagine what sorts of dares you might be challenged with if you opened it up for the whole Internet to crowdsource a dare for you.Nerve was pretty awesome. I don't get off in the weeds much about cinematography, lighting, or other things like that. I base my reviews and recommendations on one thing and one thing only?"Was I entertained, and do I feel like the movie was a worth my time and money." With Nerve, the answer is an emphatic "Yes".Granted, the movie isn't without its plot holes, and events that defy belief. Suffice it to say that I don't feel like those things take away from the experience of the movie. I mean?it's fiction. The story and events are almost supposed to defy belief by definition. I still highly recommend that you go see Nerve. If you want to talk about issues with the plot after you've seen it, drop me an email and we can have that conversation.The live-streamed Q&amp;A after the movie was pretty cool, too. Dave Franco seems to be very likable and funny, but also a bit quiet?possibly even shy. He definitely portrayed his personal life as something that is both a tad boring and mundane compared to what you might imagine for a Hollywood star, as well as private. Ironically, given the premise of the movie, Franco says he essentially does not engage online or in social networks.It was interesting to listen to Franco talk about making the movie and some of the things that challenged him. I don't want to give anything away, but you can see in the trailer that Franco's character rides a motorcycle. Franco said he did not previously know how to ride one, so the directors gave him a motorcycle and a couple weeks to learn before letting him loose on the streets of New York and trusting him to drive co-star Emma Roberts around.Someone also asked whether or not there is any concern that someone will now try to create a similar game in real life. Franco described the movie as being "five minutes into the future"?meaning that it's feasible something like Nerve could exist. Again?we already have shows like Big Brother and Fear Factor, and people live streaming their own exploits and adventures on Periscope, Facebook, YouTube and more. It's not a huge stretch to imagine tying all of those things together into some sort of crowdsourced daredevil online game.Franco replied, "I hope that more good comes from this than bad?like I really hope a game like this never exists," adding, "But, if it does?don't blame us." I like to think I'd be a Player. After watching the movie, though, I may think twice about that and just kick back and watch some more crazy YouTube videos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nerve (2016): Dir: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman / Cast: Emma Roberts, Dave Franco, Miles Heizer, Emily Meade, Juliette Lewis: The title not just references one's emotional heights, but it is the name of a sickening online game where people can either watch or participate in dares for which cash is deposited into their bank accounts if they succeed. This becomes dangerous as dares aim to riskier heights. Emma Roberts plays Venus, or Vee as her nickname says. She accepts based on the taunting of one of her friends who is popular as a result. Based on a kissing a stranger dare she ends up hooking up with Dave Franco. Together they end up running near nude through a department store. Franco drives blindfolded on a motorcycle while Vee plays his eyes and directions. They are appealing leads but much of their antics boarder on being corny and extreme. In supporting roles are Miles Heizer as Vee's male friend who is not impressed with her new daring relationship. He is a computer nerd concerned for the safety of his friend. Emily Meade plays her popular friend who feels her popularity fading when Vee's dare takes attention. This forces her into an extreme situation. Juliette Lewis is unfortunately underused as Vee's mother who works at the hospital. We learn that her brother died two years prior and that Lewis wants her to accepts a college near by. Two directors manage to sift through the lame stunts by presenting style and location work that carries a personality of its own. It takes aim at social media and everyone's obsession with everything wrong with society. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was sitting in the theater watching Nerve, all I could think about were things that I thought could have improved the movie going experience. I don't particularly see this film as bad, in fact I believe that it is above average, the only thing is, is that I thought with the material the filmmakers were going for it had the chance to be something really special and entirely unique. However this is no where near being a bad film, in fact I recommend that you go see it because it is good and it does have interesting ideas to offer, even if they are just plainly ideas that are never explored within their fullest capacity. The social commentary about the way we use social media and where we are headed was quite engaging and entertaining. There were just some things that I thought could have helped the film stand out and be GREAT instead of just good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the dawn of the internet and smart phones, films have tried to relate to the generation that's so engulfed in the technology. From the guy in his 30s trading on Wall Street to the teenage girl who can't seem to separate herself from Snapchat or Instagram. Many have tried, and few have succeeded. Most are done in a way that comes off as a little too pushy or polemic. Others use it as a devise to make the film look more attractive to a younger demographic. Either way, it's always seemed as though it was the technology that was propelling the stories--almost forcing them upon us.Right off the bat, the concept of Nerve may have you thinking the same thing, but its premise is much more relaxed. And where it isn't, it's more subtle than its contemporaries. Nerve is, all around, more mature with its subject matter.It stars Emma Roberts as Vee, an artistic high school senior who's best friend, Sydney (Emily Meade), thinks she doesn't live uninhibitedly enough. Then there's this secret game/app which the user can choose to be either a watcher or a player. As a player, you have to complete tasks, or "dares", for money. The two who last the longest without giving up go to the finals.The rules of the game take much of the film to get a grasp on, but it makes sense when it needs to.Along the way, Vee meets Ian (Dave Franco)--another player. The watchers like the two of them together and keep giving them tasks to complete with each other.The audience should also like them together, since they have a natural chemistry, which helps us see past some of the streaky performances.The film bounces around between different characters in the story seamlessly without losing us, or its energy, in the process.At no point do you look down at your watch wondering when the film will be over. It keeps you in its grasp the whole time. And afterward, you'll be talking with others about hypotheticals if the app actually existed in real life.You will definitely be surprised by this film, despite any preconceived notions. It's one of the best we've seen in this "techno" subgenre. Maybe by now we've gotten over the newness of our devices and can finally get a real film that actually takes control of the technology within it, rather than the other way around.Twizard Rating: 91</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new film, Nerve could not have come out at a better time in my opinion. The film overall is a social and cautionary tale about the dangers and risks that we take everyday using technology and social media. Take the new Pokemon Go game as a perfect example. I remember when the original Pokemon games came out back in the mid to late 90's and I remember playing them on my Nintendo Gameboy, which like many other technical products from back in the day as since been discontinued. The game was enjoyable back then and all the other kids at school were playing it, but it was nothing like what is currently going on with the hand-held devices people are playing Pokemon Go on and also the game itself. I have heard of professional people who have quit their jobs and given up their careers just so they can play this game. One person was so immersed in the game on their mobile tablet that they did not bother to watch where they were going and ended up walking off of a cliff. Also people around the world are showing up at stranger's houses just so they can catch the much desired Pokemon characters and be the winner of this game that will bring you no real fame, or fortune, but instead just bragging rights that will soon fade away as soon as the next technological craze, or game comes along. Also look at how voyeuristic our culture and society has become. I hear of people going to websites to watch real acts of violence, torture, terrorism and other hideous things for the simple reason that they were curious and these horrific videos and images have not been taken off of the web because of so called "free speech" and "freedom of expression". There is certainly a limit to everything and our current culture has certainly exceeded it. Now when I write these things, I am not against people themselves enjoying a video game here, or there (although I think there are a lot better things you could be doing with your time), or saying that I am against all technology and social media at all (even though I choose not to really use any of it myself). I think that people should just be aware of what they are doing and know the dangers of it. Even the other night it was broadcast on the news that people who post pictures of themselves on social media are actually creating more danger for themselves than they think because cyber and other criminals can and are using other software and websites that can now track where your photos were taken and trace you to where you live, work and otherwise which is now a cause of crimes including breaking and entering and robbery. Again this is not to say that people can not communicate with their friends online, but people should just be very careful with what they are doing. The new film, Nerve shows us these cautions as the characters in the movie are engrossed in a mobile device game of more, or less Truth or Dare. Characters are dared to do embarrassing, risky and sometimes death defying things, all watched by people from around the world in order to make a name for themselves and make some extra cash. Everything seems to be fine at first and to many of the characters it seems like an adrenaline rush that they constantly want more of, but as the film goes on, they soon start to see the dangers in this and how it could consume them, or possibly threaten to end their lives. Nerve was a film that was a lot better than it had any right to be and I mean that completely sincerely. The film will win no awards come Oscar season, but in it's own way it has a lot of merit for it's unique visual style of a very neon lit downtown New York and some of this cinematography and visuals was certainly pleasing to the eye and looked incredible at times. The film's story itself was captivating enough and had plenty to keep me both thrilled and on the edge of my seat at times. The character development was thin and the acting was average, but a film of this kind doesn't need any more than that and it was fine just the way it was. Also it delivers home a thought provoking message and one that our generation is badly in need of discovering and that is also one of the film's strongest points and I thank the filmmakers for pointing it out and also entertaining me while doing so. A better than average film of it's kind that is certainly food for thought and an entertaining watch all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though the game and idea doesn't progress far, Nerve is still a fun teen cyber thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you know that were only using ten percent of what's on the World Wide Web? You may think that sites like YouTube, Wikipedia, and even most of the social media platforms have already made the internet huge, but it turns out that we know next to nothing. There is a section of the web called the dark web that is home to the other ninety percent. This area supposedly contains illegal pornography, weapon shops, salve shops, and pretty much everything that were not allowed to see in real life. It's said that the only ones that see this are highly experience hackers, top tier government officials, or radical groups that can crack those complicated firewalls.There have been some instances where the dark web has crept over to the side of humanity, but given how well guarded the regular pages already are, it's incredibly rare and they never last long. What makes it hard to go over anything on the dark web is that the people who created these things have covered their tracks so well, that the FBI and homeland security can barley locate their perpetrator let alone who they are. The game in Nerve comes from a dark source, but has been making it's way around teenagers.Around the Statin Island area of New York, high school yearbook photographer Venus Delmonico (played by Emma Roberts) is in the mist of finishing her last few months and is ready to accept an admission to Cal Arts, but is afraid to tell her mother (played by Juliette Lewis) who is still grieving over the death of her son. Her friend Sydney (played by Emily Meade) is a big player of the online game Nerve, which is a dangerous "Truth or Dare" challenge where watchers pay to watch and players play to earn money.After a humiliating rejection from a guy she likes, Venus signs into Nerve as a player, where it collects everything about her (bank statements, I.D., social media pages, etc.?). After her first challenge to kiss a stranger for five seconds, she starts to team up with that kisser Ian (played by Dave Franco) for bigger money. As the cash becomes bigger and her following grows, the game starts to tread into illegal territory, causing Venus to want out. When she tries to alert the authorities (which was one rule not to do), she finds that the game has more control over her life then she realized. Now she has to continue playing while her friends try to get the game shut down.I've made complaints before that movies set now rarely know how to use modern technology in a way that will hold up later. Nerve understands that teens are obsessed with the web and often get lost in they're own pleasure against the common moral of right and wrong. Nerve manages to carry an interesting premise, even if it's afraid to go further with what could have made it more psychological. It at least makes a lot of the dares interesting.Both Emma Roberts and Dave Franco have good chemistry and are fun to watch. The writing for them seems to work with the personalities of the actors rather then their characters. That kind of screen writing is old fashioned, ironically in a movie that's supposed to be "hip" and "with it". I'm okay with it here as they are still interesting to follow as the game gets more dangerous. One major issue I had involves the ending which I wont spoil, but it will make you feel unfulfilled. A lot of that comes from that we don't get much behind the game and who made it. Perhaps a television spin off would explain everything.I'll give this seven game over screens out of five. Though you know this movie could have done a lot more with it's idea, it still manages to entertain and even have some smart ideas. Nerve probably won't gain any major players, but should have no problem finding watchers. So are you a player or a watcher?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Ride! Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful acting across the board. Really enjoyed the feel and hit a nail on the head of a classic teen in today's society. I especially enjoyed Franco's character. He was very fun loving and easy to grasp. A little mysterious at fist but who doesn't love a secret? No spoiler lol though. It had a little depth even though it was a pretty short movie. The simplicity of the film encompasses the big message that the film is trying to portray. Great comedy, action, romance, everything! I'm live with this movie!!! One of my favorite movies of the summer... Heck of the year hands down! Nothing bad at all to say, even had a great sound track! Enjoyed each character even the ones you love to hate! 10 STARS!!! If you haven't seen it ...why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, I thought it was one of those bad ass romantic films ( not to say that I am a hopeless romantic myself ) It was a fast pace film that kept my adrenaline moving. The more I understood the plot story the more excitement would travel through my throughts. Like when Dory foundher parents, it gave me that excitement of thrill. Its an obsessive technology teen movie with a hint of a novel. One of the main reasons I also watched it was because Dave Franco was the main character. I feel like they could have not chosen a better actor then himself to play this role, he fits in the perfect category of that "Bad boy" who risk everything in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An alarming adventure that could potentially happen in real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a high school girl who takes up an online challenge, where she has to do a series of dares for money. Through peer pressure, she steps into a world of unknown, exposing herself to dangers she could not imagine.The plot of "Nerve" is strangely realistic, because I can really that happening in the real world. People do all sorts of unusual things online that they would otherwise not do in real life, and this makes the film work. The story appeals to teens and is thrilling enough for adults too. Though I actually guessed the ending correctly right from the first challenge Vee accepted, the film still engaged me and make my palms sweat. I enjoyed watching it. It serves as an alarm for people out there - be very careful on the internet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would be lying if I said I didn't cry like a baby at the end of this movie, and I din't cry at ALL during movies. I never cried during TFIOS, the Titanic... You name it, I probably never cried. I absolutely loved this movie and I would most definitely add this as one of my top 5 favorite movies. It invokes feelings in the watchers, and it makes your heart race as if you were actually in the movie. I felt like I was actually able to feel the same feelings as the characters. I was squealing and laughing and -mostly- crying. I absolutely loved this movie and I would totally watch this again, given the chance. All in all, this movie on a scale of 1-10, this movie was BMS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the fact that the main character evolves over the course of the movie. First, she is shy and not taking any risks. By the end she is addressing big crowds and taking life-changing risks. The movie teaches us that everybody needs a little push to unlock their true self, and although this push shouldn't be as extreme as in "Nerve", it is what friends are fore to give us the push to start living our lives!Surely if you've reading this you've also read tons of other posts on the screenplay, so I'll just say that it's fine. The actors play quite well too, but it is the message I outline above that I took from the movie and why I'm giving it such an unusually high rating :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Action Packed Thrill Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage girl begins playing a game called Nerve where players are payed to complete life risking dares and are watched by anonymous people known as Watchers.Once again another film this summer that seemed to be mis-sold. The trailers that were released for Nerve made it look like a film that would be hanging on the very edge of lukewarm only by its weak hand. But it actually turned out to be a very tense and entertaining film. As the dares get more life risking for the characters the intensity goes up but so does the entertainment factor. Emma Roberts ,in the lead role of Venus, gives a very good performance and Dave Franco ,who let us not forget gave one of the worst actual attempts at acting ever seen in last years Unfinished Business and wasn't the best in Bad Neighbours 2 but was alright in the chronic disaster that was Now You See Me 2, actually delivers what is a surprisingly decent performance and his character is one that adds to the films twists and turns and intensity. There are many different themes in this film and lots going on but instead of creating one great big, confusing mess it all goes towards making one of those rare film that target a teenage audience but also succeed in entertaining adults just as well. Summer 2016 has once again delivered another surprise. Nerve is a fast paced, entertaining, action packed thrill ride. **** &lt;-- Four Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Nerve' is an entertaining thriller with an interesting premise that is marred only by several plot-holes, some larger plot issues and the fact that it is pretty generic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nerve' is a thriller directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, one which focuses upon a fictional yet plausible social media 'game' that involves an audience providing people with escalating dares in exchange for cash prizes. It is an interesting premise that feels suitably modern, as well as being incredibly timely as internet 'challenges' and games such as 'Pokémon GO' have increased in popularity - bringing many tales of injury, criminality and other misfortunes with them. The conceivable premise is easy to get invested in, as the film often evokes contemplation about ourselves and our society in general; it isn't all that deep though, with the greater ideas never fully explored. On top of that, the narrative itself is actually paper thin with a number of prevalent plot holes. The significance of some elements is never explained or fully examined, leading to a series of plot-points that actually seem rather inconsequential.The movie starts off on a weak note, coming across as generic and generally false. The opening uses a number of gimmicks that feel invasive and unnecessary, which end up feeling stylised simply for the sake of creating the pretense of individuality. However, these aspects are reeled back to the point where they help tell the story and aren't obtrusive, and once it settles into the second act the flick really comes into its own. This act is the best one, featuring a sense of adventure as well as a few moments of genuine tension. These moments are when the film is at its best, examining the dangerous and ill- advised nature of the dares themselves, but unfortunately don't come often enough. For the most part, the 'Nerve' game is somewhat glamourised and a lot of the risk is glossed over. An extended sequence featuring a motorcycle isn't as tense as it should be, partly due to the lack of tangible danger or consequences and partly due to the sense of invigoration - rather than fear - felt by the main characters. There are a few moments towards the end of the picture that actually chastise the anonymous nature of the internet, particularly when it is used to bully or harm, which don't come across as too overbearing and by that point in the narrative feel earned. The final act is pretty fragile in comparison the the one before it, easily breaking under scrutiny and coming across as quite contrived. The movie as a whole was devoid of surprises, meandered a little in places and had several fundamental issues which damage its credibility. The central mystery is set up as if it is going to have a big pay-off, but it actually falls rather flat and doesn't warrant the suspense given to it. It could've been dropped entirely, along with some other side-plots that didn't add anything. The plot-holes and missteps, as well as the failures of the base premise itself, aren't all that noticeable in the moment though; it is only upon reflection that they become obvious. Despite all of the problems, I did enjoy watching the picture and found honest entertainment in some of the set-pieces.The characters themselves are decently realised, coming across as somewhat rounded and given just the right amount of characterisation. There is little development but all of it enhances the connection between the audience and the on-screen actors. The two leads are given the most time and are therefore the most complex and relatable; Emma Roberts and Dave Franco do a great job leading the picture. They have a good chemistry, even though Franco is in his thirties and Roberts is supposedly in high-school. Their interactions feel genuine at times, and they don't simply slot into a preset archetype - at least not always. There is some artifice used to make the characters seem real though, as well as some revelations that don't come across as well as they should. The other roles are all fairly minor, though the protagonist's best friend is more complex than she is initially presented. The cast do a good job of making each on-screen presence feel relevant and honest, they easily demonstrate the qualities of an admittedly stereotyped demographic. The writing is good here, a screenplay - based on the novel by Jeanne Ryan - by Jessica Sharzer manages to capture the modern premise and plot elements whilst still retaining a focus on character. There are no overtly cheesy lines and no obvious oddities or clearly 'written' snippets of dialogue, though initially there is a lot of exposition and most of what's said isn't particularly new; nothing really stands out, for better or worse.In terms of the technical stuff, the majority of it is to a high standard. The cinematography is clean, if a little bland, and the editing is satisfyingly unnoticeable - as it should be. The direction itself is evidently favourable, with little 'shaky-cam' and clean framing. Nothing is especially different or quirky, but the shots are easy-to-read and the flick as a whole does a good job of bringing you into the story. I found the set-pieces to be well filmed and tightly edited, making use of practical stunt-work and wide angles to make them believable. The film in general has a tight pace, meaning that there is no time for boredom and no fat that could be trimmed. It tells its story in as little time as it needs, but this does mean that the ending appears quite abrupt.Overall, 'Nerve' is a tightly paced thriller that's competently made and well acted; it is enjoyable to watch and has a few moments of genuine tension, even if there are several plot-holes and nonsensical aspects. I had disposable fun with this despite its issues, though it is a little unmemorable and generic: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - pretty fun but kinda stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where currently everyone seems to be playing Pokemon Go, it's hardly beyond belief that a smartphone game like Nerve could take over people's lives. Take over the world, though? That needs a little more convincing...Nerve starts off about a humble, cute and shy girl (Roberts), who enters a game to make her a little more outgoing - pretty fun and pretty harmless. She soon meets a slightly more daring guy (Franco), who persuades her to head to the Big Apple for an adventure (and a little cash). This section of the movie works really well - Roberts and Franco click perfectly, both a little awkward around the other, but then they seem to have a genuine connection. And that's the reason it works, they're brilliantly cast (Roberts is lovable as the down-to-earth and innocent teen, and Franco is about as good as I've seen him in anything!) and have great on-screen chemistry.About halfway through the film starts to crack. The best friend (Meade) suddenly and unconvincingly becomes her biggest rival in an attempt to get more viewers, and the inclusion of the movie's sort of antagonist (Kelly) brought an unnecessary and uncompelling dark turn to the second and third act. A few plot twists and preposterous technology manipulations later and we become less thrilled and more frustrated at them flipping a fun film into something too dark and vaguely sinister. Their attempt to make it smarter actually just backfired.But, for all its moodiness near the end, it's still an enjoyable experience. Good use of visual flares, like the merging of life and screen within the frame, and up-beat synthetic music underlying the soundtrack keep the energy high even when believability plummets (you never *really* feel the characters are ever in danger). Joost and Schulman do well at the helm, but I suppose Ryan's novel is the source of the plot problem - why spoil a perfectly fun movie to make it edgy and mysterious?! Still, Nerve is worth a watch just for Roberts and Franco's spark, in spite of its stupidity.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be fun but far from a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Roberts and Dave Franco played two strangers that teamed up to play a game of truth or dare minus the truth by traveling all over the city doing crazy things. It is an original idea set in the 21st century by having the theme as technology.It was a fun ride and there were some parts where I did felt tense or excited. But overall I think that there is a lot of substance missing from what makes this a good movie. They overdid the technology theme by showing way too much scenes being viewed from the phone. I really feel that they can tame it down. The directing is not the strongest either and the dialogue sounded pretty silly. Franco and Roberts was decent in the movie but I really wanted a stronger chemistry between. On top of all that I really wish the ending would be stronger but instead it just fell flat and gave you the exclamation of "THAT'S IT!". So in other words its just a fun movie made for teenagers that doesn't have any Oscar materials but may still be worth a watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon with the entire family. Entertaining? HECK YES! Quality movie? No Way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i have not seen this so i cannot say its bad or good but this concept was already mad in 2014. "13 Sins" this was a nice little low budget thriller where mysterious watchers get a down on his luck Average joe, to do 13 dare/challenges, that start out simple but as they go on get more dangerous and illegal.I will give this a five for now and will update after i see it. I don't like to see films get released with an exact concept as previous ones but with no mention (looking at you James Cameron, Avatar= Fern Gully).i do , for some reason like Emma Roberts, even if she hasn't been in anything great yet. Hopefully with a bigger budget this movie will surpass a good idea put forth by the original film. I recommend checking out 13 Sins of it is still on Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you a Watcher or a Player?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nerve follows Vee, a shy and timid high school photographer who holds a crush on the jock football captain (yeah, sounds pretty cliché at this point). Her best friend is an extrovert who makes it her life goal to have the most fun possible at all opportunities, and has signed up for a city-wide internet dare game called Nerve. In Nerve, you are either a Watcher or a Player. Players go around the city doing the dares the Watchers dare them to do and film it live on their phone. Watchers follow them around videoing everything. The dares start out innocent enough, like kissing a stranger, but they then evolve into more dangerous and illegal activities, like hanging from a crane atop a skyscraper. Vee eventually signs up for the game as a Player, bumps into a fellow charming Player, and follows the game through to it's potentially tragic end.The plot holds a few surprises every now and then, for example Ian's true motivations for playing the game are slowly revealed and quite surprising, and some of the dares become super risky later on and you're left not sure of the outcome. In all though, Nerve definitely comes off as a teen movie, with most of it's cast elder teens, and littered with the High School dramas that angle inherently comes with. All the typical archetypes are there as well; the shy main character who proves she's not all she's cracked up to be, the handsome but slightly jerky jock, the computer nerd who has an unrealistic knowledge of hacking, the slutty best friend with underlying personal issues, the mystery charmer who sweeps the main character off her feet, the punky antagonist etc. etc. Take away the Nerve concept, and it's just another teen high school movie like any other, hitting all the same beats.But this is 2016, and a hip teen movie wouldn't be hip without opening itself up to massive dating in the coming years. The movie opens with Vee browsing the internet, but from her point of view looking at the computer screen. While it's a pretty accurate representation of online life today, it will absolutely act as a time capsule in a decade or so when technology has advanced. There's everything in this one scene, from tagging and liking on Facebook, to Skype calls and even the Huffpost. Not to mention, but Nerve has a real hard-on for Apple. Every computer is a Mac and every phone an iPhone, but I don't think there's any technology developer who advances quite as fast and as drastically as Apple. These products won't exist in a few years.With this massive online angle, it takes the usual approach to subtext that all these kinds of movies approach; the pitfalls of social media and the internet, a lack of privacy, and the irresponsibility of anonymous trolls. The first thing Nerve does when you sign up as a Player is it strips every detail it can from your Facebook profile, from your favourite books to your friends, from your photos to (somehow) your bank details. The game controls every facet of your life thanks to privacy T&amp;Cs in place on social media sites.Visually the movie definitely holds it's mark. There's a lot of neon hues mirroring the Nerve interface throughout, from Ian's neon-lit motorbike, to natural city lights and the constant mirror images from phone and computer screens looking up at character's faces. The introductory Nerve montage also deserves mentioning for incorporating a vast number of clips from TV shows and movies, from modern to classic, giving it that Anonymous-type feel to the whole extravaganza.Then there's the soundtrack which is comprised of an eclectic mix of slightly obscure pop acts, be they dance pop, indie pop, or straight-up hip hop, from the likes of Basenji, Melanie Martinez, and even Wu-Tang Clan. I can't really say it's my kind of music, even remotely, but it all served the movie quite well, obviously appealing to it's target demographic. Unfortunately the selection, as 'hip' and modern as it sounds will also go a long way to dating the movie. Pop music unfortunately changes just as much Apple, and I haven't heard of most these acts so I'm not entirely convinced it'll stick in people memories for very long (although I might be a little biased; most pop music sounds exactly the same to me).I enjoyed Nerve, I'll admit. Despite it's thinly-veiled teen movie foundations, the Nerve concept goes a long way to help you forget it all. The criticisms it holds for the troll-breeding of social media is legit, and the concept of Nerve itself is frighteningly possible in today's current climate; preying on people's need for fame, but ultimately showing the depravity of mob mentality. It's not exactly subtle with it's messages, but they serve well. It'll start showing it's age in no time at all, which is unfortunate, but also an unavoidable symptom of it's concept. I give Nerve an enjoyable if not slightly cliché 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Concept, Inadequate Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie was moderately entertaining, most of the film was highly unfeasible and not likely to happen. From a technological standpoint, there were many inaccuracies and blemishes. The film's story had very little character development, which, in turn, made the story hard to follow. Story aside, thrilling and suspenseful scenes kept the crowd engaged and entertained throughout the film's entirety. This however, brings a false sense of realism to the movie. If audiences fear for the character, audiences feel as if they must fear for themselves. The film connects to the audience's biggest fears including heights, public embarrassment, and lack of control. The greatest parts of this movie were, by far, the concept and the overall anxious mood throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emma Roberts and Dave Franco play an updated version of "Simon Says"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon Says (or Simple Simon Says) is a child's game issuing simple instructions. Harmless and fun at first, but as the game progresses one player might dare you to do the unthinkable and of course the choice would be up to you to accept or decline it. Life was simple then when we had games like this or board games children enjoyed wanting to play. Now in this day and age technology is our newest friend. This and much more are the overall themes behind "Nerve." High school senior Venus Delmonico "Vee" feels withdrawn and cautious about her choices in life. It doesn't help that she got accepted to go to CalArts but after the unexpected death of her older brother she has become her mother's (Juliette Lewis, offering little to the story) top priority, afraid of her venturing out. Once dared by her best friend Sydney (Emily Meade of "Money Monster") to try Nerve: an online reality video game of objective-focused "truth or dare" where people either enlist online as "players" or pay to watch as "watchers". Vee along with fellow player Ian (Dave Franco of "Now You See Me 2"), are caught into deadly objectives, with their identity taken and victory being the escape. Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman ("Catfish") "Nerve" paints a picture of the world we live in now, from the film's opening montage showing Vee's daily schedule from "Spotify to Facebook", Joost and Schulman raise questions on Privacy concerns, Illegal downloading, Unnecessary apps and more. But sadly that's all it manages to achieve; questions we are ourselves already have answers to or want answers to. Especially during the third act where the hidden agenda is revealed. Screenwriter Jessica Sharzer ("American Horror Story", adapting from a novel written by Jeanne Ryan) weaves together an interesting story with two likable leads. The chemistry between Roberts and Franco really carry the movie for its runtime, as Roberts fragile and cautious nature sub comes to Franco's alluring and charismatic appeal. Cinematographer Michael Simmonds illuminates the city with vibrant and lush neon lights taking a chapter from "The Neon Demon". A scene in particular in which Vee has to help be Ian's eyes as he drives at 60 Mbps blindfolded is frightening and yet beautiful thanks in addition to music by Rob Simonsen. "Nerve" might not be the best example of how the technology we use influences our daily lives, but it certainly will entertain with each dare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should teens see this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, should you let your twixt-ten-and-twenty kids see this? Superb story line and execution with little to no use of formulaic plot devices or simplistic teen music--which makes it easier for adults to watch. It's basically a Pokeyman Go game with money and FAME as the rewards, only with increasingly dangerous dares. It's right into the wheelhouse of its "I'm bulletproof" target teen audience. It shows exactly how addicting something like this would most likely be, as well where this out of control path to daredevil thrill/fame seeking so often takes us.I see plenty of movies for younger kids since they usually have material adults can appreciate mixed in. But as a rule, I avoid movies directed straight at teens, especially horror. This, however, is about as good as I can remember a movie for this particularly audience being. In fact, when I saw all the teens, mostly girls, coming into the theater, for a 1 PM showing, and then several teen slasher previews, I almost walked out. But the premise made me stick it out, and I'm glad I did.As for the opening question, I recommend a very hearty but advised, yes. Adulation derived adrenaline could well be the new drug of the future, and it's always better to face something head on than to ignore it. With caring parents and relatives, this can actually be a good source for a life lesson discussion--and to its credit, the movie is on your side. But you really need to see it too (separately?) so you can help them think through what really happens, so they don't just conclude, "well I would do it better". The message for the "watchers" at the end is the real point, in tandem with the insanity of excessive physical risk taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nerve is about a shy girl who doesn't take risks. Once she is called out on it; she wants to prove them wrong. She then meets a boy that pushes her to continue playing.There are quite a few adrenaline fueled moments during the film and little drop off from the action. Obviously this is a movie marketed to younger audiences as it is centered on social media and the ever increasing use of text bubbles on screen...but I managed to look past it (I personally stay away from all that). So if you hate that and the found footage kind of shots be warned as that will be heavily featured.The plot is pretty thin, but this is a movie that is not worried about that. Instead this is just a fun movie that leaves the viewer as a watcher of the two popular contestants played by Dave Franco and Emma Roberts. The two had very good chemistry with one another and kept me wanting more of their shenanigans.This movie is by no means bad and anyone that is looking for a fun intense movie, look no further. That being said I don't think I could sit through it a second time. It is one of the those one off movies that you wait awhile before you watch it again. Final 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a bit like Kids or Hackers. It actually does a good job in displaying the kids of this generation, and it reflects what this generation likes and what its about.Nerve is a game played on the internet. The people who play are dared to do all sorts of crazy things for cash, and there is no limit to the craziness. Vee, played by Emma Roberts, is a kid who needs to come out of her shell, plays the game and becomes way too engulf in it.Dave Franco is in the game too as Ian. First thing you noticed is that he's trying to be as hot as his older brother, James. thought he gives us a lot of sex appeal, big bro still has more personality.The game starts out really talking to the young crowd about what they are into. Just playing the game over social media and how everyone participates, with no one controlling the game and everyone able to put in their two cents towards the game.Although, it does get to the place were it goes to big and gets less and less real to me, and overall, it's about sending a metaphoric message to the kids about living your life on the web, and how it can desensitize you.The vibe and the tone of the movie is great. love the electric music score and the art direction. The movie really does feel cool without going too overboard with it, very subtle.I got a feeling that the movie is going to have a cult classic vibe, like Fight Club or something.Check it out.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=83</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about now in neon,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have the nerve to see Nerve, do not apply systems of cultural and cinematic logic to a thriller that mostly is concerned with the number of hits on the titular Internet game. However if you like seeing how popular you can get on Instagram and Snapchat and the dollars to be made from hits, then this is the film for you.If you came to this teen crime thriller cum fantasy gaming expecting a literate take on the evils of the Smart Phone, you will be disappointed. Not that the possibilities for shrewd commentary on the dangers of covert cyber surveillance are not manifold; it's just that the heroine, Venus (Emma Roberts), is too clueless about the ramifications of playing Truth or Dare on a phone with millions of watchers zeroing in on you as Player.The thriller first becomes absurd when Ian (Dave Franco) drives his motorcycle blindfolded with Venus guiding him. More fantastical incidents/dares come forth with the last two being doozies of improbability. The dares culminate in a crescendo of righteousness as the world has a moment of seeming sanity in a film that has been anything but.Young adult fiction has lasting possibilities (I thought Twilight would never end), but Nerve is not one of those with a senior future. It's all about now in neon and instant gratification.The best that can be said is it has moments of authentic terror (hanging from a construction crane made me nervous, no less walking a ladder between buildings ), yet it squanders the possibilities of meaningful characterizations and themes in favor of outlandish dares, none of which should pass the first security test for cybercrime. The dares, however, are mostly scary if not realistic. Nerve should appeal to teens who like both modes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters are walking stereotypes. We have your shy and timid protagonist played by Emma Roberts, the hot guy who Emma Roberts will inevitably fall for,the cool- girl-who-is- actually-insecure and the computer geek. And the characters are really shallow. I found many of the motivations for their actions pretty stupid and shallow.I sometimes wonder why Hollywood cannot think of any other teenage character traits. It ,sure, is getting boring using the same formula over and over again.But, I am not saying that Nerve was entirely bad. The movie is actually much better than what the trailers make it out to be.Despite the fact that the movie has plenty of plot-holes and an over-the-top ending that gets a pretty easy resolution, the movie was fun to watch. It is the kind of movie that you can only enjoy by turning your brain off.The soundtrack is pretty cool at some points. A particular scene involving Emily Meades and a ladder was intense and had me at the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, that was one of the only really intense scenes of the movie. The chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco is fine.Overall, it was an average teen movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but not exactly a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a lot of fun to watch- the soundtrack was absolutely killer, Dave Franco and Emma Roberts execute their parts well, and it touched on the issue of social media in a way that is very current. It's not, however, an Oscar winner as I'm sure no one expects it to be. The graphics are at times exceedingly cool and at other times flare towards the corny. I feel like the underlying message of the whole film, that being that the current state of fame seeking draws people to do irrational things and people, in the safety of a crowd, are a less than compassionate audience, was a little ham handed at times (especially at the end) and all in all, if this movie really wanted to get across its message, could have been executed a little better in terms of the writing and direction. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and if you're looking for a light thriller for the social media age, I would check it out. p.s. I am not kidding about the soundtrack, it's nice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although enjoyable to watch this movie had quite a few flaws that drag it down. Firstly, the character development for many of the characters is undeveloped and illogical. Sydney's 180 to help Vee at the end of the movie was pretty unbelievable after the fight they had at the party. The game itself was quite unbelievable at times but despite this was enjoyable to watch most of the time. The ending scene in which 100's of masked teens egg teenagers on to kill each other, without a single person notifying authorities seems rather unlikely. The movies soundtrack, as well as lighting was done very well. The neon lights made film a pretty one to watch in some scenes. Besides its flaws Nerve is still an enjoyable watch if you can get past the unlikeliness of the game itself</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Have The Nerve?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Internet, it was a revolutionary idea that was designed to connect people and share information to expand our knowledge. And then comes the modern era, where information is second nature in response to entertainment, trolling, and occasionally a uniting purpose. In fact, most of us know how the most popular thing on the internet (past pornography) are vines, memes, and other ranting media. Tonight's film decides to highlight current Internet trends and makes a story that looks dangerous, thrilling, and fun at the same time. My review is on Nerve starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. Let's get startedThe GOOD ? Fun Adventure ? Great Acting ? Decent Story When I saw the trailer, I though the movie was going to be more of a serious thriller. Thankfully, I'm very pleased to report Nerve is a very fun movie filled with excitement, energy, and adventure. Our two heroes start their night out performing tasks and stunts that we only dream of performing (for the most part). The dares from the anonymous Watchers are diverse, but mostly remain grounded in the realistic zone. While certainly stupid, and often quite dangerous, our actors looked liked they were enjoying themselves as they became lost in the moment. As a result, I couldn't help but get reeled into the moments with them and enjoyed the fun atmosphere it painted. But then like any good movie, the tone switches and soon the fun evening out develops into something much tenser. Multiple tiers begin to form as the mystery unfolds as to what our couple has fallen into. The story takes multiple turns that leads to some decent character development that fits in well with the overall plot. As more secrets are uncovered, the intensity only builds up until it hits a cheesy, overdramatic fight that is both eye rolling and well done at the same time. Nevertheless, the tale takes a few good twists and plays out in a very morale heavy ending. Pay attention and you can see most of the twists coming. Pay really good attention and the audience may learn something that might save the Internet. Again the story is fun, but the twists help save it from becoming another teenage dramedy filled with thrills, chills, and laughs on the way. And to play out this story is none other than two talented actors who truly brought what looked to be simple characters to life. Emma Roberts portrayal of Venus (yeah interesting name) was fantastic, developing over the course of the film alongside her character. She brought both beauty and emotion to the role and was certainly a fantastic protagonist to follow on this ninety minute journey. Dave Franco as "Ian" was a wonderful counter character who had poise, pizazz, and a sense of suave that was very welcoming. It's amazing what you can see actors do when they don't act like idiots (aka Neighbors). Franco's dynamic acting helped keep his character fun, but also stays in the dark, brooding side that reels you in. The supporting cast was wonderful too, but we need to move onto the limiting factors of this movie. The BAD ? Not as suspenseful/thrilling as portrayed ? A few character building moments are rushed ? A plot point that was kind of worthlessYes I had fun, and the plot did grow darker, but the suspense was much more dilute than the trailers promised. The Watchers certainly were powerful (we are talking well versed in the art of hacking), but their power wasn't used to its full potential. This mass media entertainment was a bit underwhelming though, whose bark was worse than their bite. I was expecting such expert computer users to lob more threats at the duo, or perhaps pursue them in some Purge like manner. Instead, they chose to use phones as their weapons and film everything that was happening. Sure the phone angle provided some interesting shots and allowed for integration of famous accidents. In addition, there were some character development moments that also were a bit underdone. Ian himself has a traumatic past, and you would think facing his fears would have a bit more I don't know struggle to it. Instead, his challenges were a bit blown over, washed away in a fast pace that could have been more. Fortunately Venus's drama has more gusto behind it and her obstacles require more bravado to overcome. Unfortunately, she has some plot points that were practically worthless despite the setup at the beginning of the movie. There were few explanations to some of the family dynamics, the struggle for choosing a school wasn't as big an issue, and her introverted nature disappeared rather quickly. Oh well, at least we got plenty of fun thrills and a good morale lesson right?The VERDICTDespite the shortcoming, Nerve is definitely one of the more fun and thrilling adventures I have seen in a long time. The dynamic duo of Roberts and Franco are the shining factor for this reviewer, who really brought the energetic fun vibe to the screen. In addition the multiple levels of the plot also made for some engaging moments, and some rather suspenseful moments. Sure there are some missing/blown over moments, but for the most part this adventure gets a seal of approval for unique fun. Worth a trip to theater? I'm going to have to say yes it is. My scores: Adventure/Crime/Mystery: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Saw the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the climax of Nerve; a masked mass of sycophants dimly lit by the light of their phones, I saw what Siegfried Kracauer might have seen in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920); a denial of tradition mixed with "...faith in man's power to shape society and nature." I saw the prurient fecklessness of reality TV being weaponized, the desensitized and fragmented youth culture being co- opted and the fears of technology being fiendishly well justified. In other words, I saw the end.The film has a deceptively clever little setup; Vee (Roberts) a goody-goody living on Staten Island is coaxed into an online truth or dare game, only without the truth. Those involved are either Watchers or Players. The much larger Watcher community decides which dare/stunt the Player group is to accomplish and each accomplished dare wins you money. Those who "bail" or "fail" lose all their winnings and lose a chance at the finals. There's a third group which is strongly implied in the trailer but I won't spoil for the sake of those who actually want to watch this harbinger of the end of the republic. After all, snitches apparently get stitches.Objectively speaking this film is okay. The story from a structural point of view is serviceable and the characterizations are bullet- pointed but never fully fleshed out. There are some neat visuals made real by luscious primary colors then sabotaged by ugly staging and distracting ADHD inspired graphics. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman may have been channeling Nicolas Winding Refn or Rick Famuyiwa's work in Dope (2015) but they really only succeed in reaching the sophistication of Untraceable (2008) drenched in warm neon.Our leads Vee and kinda-sorta Nerve teammate Ian (Franco) don't really feel believable within the context of the film not to mention believable as teenagers. Vee especially takes far too long to suspect something is amiss. If she were truly as brainy as her friends Sydney (Meade) and Tommy (Heizer) thinks she is, she would have bailed right after Ian explains someone just showed up and handed him her favorite book guaranteeing she would meet him. Ian's backstory remains murky until near the end but upon closer scrutiny post-credits his "too-cool-for-school" act feels more like a story contrivance than honest characterization.What separates Nerve from other YA screen adaptations, and truly makes this film beyond loathsome is its rather cavalier and quite frankly disgusting attitude towards privacy, technology, social media, democratization and human nature. Nerve has an unabashedly negative view of humanity, taking great relish in exposing the dark side of living in an open forum world with open forum expression and open forum consumption. And yes there is something to be said about advancements like the internet, meant to share knowledge and culture, being used as a means to indulge our baser impulses. Yet by being both broad and ordinary, Nerve spits on the nobility of democracy while simultaneously dooming even the smartest among us to a future of celebrity chasing, easy money and permanent distraction. A future entirely based on up or down votes and culpability is but a word that grownups use.Not since Dirty Harry (1971) have I seen a film so morally backwards and utterly contemptible. While gushing at the excess of it's own high-concept, Nerve burrows into the viewers skull, smuggling in unscrupulous ideas made effective by the film's ordinariness. While watching Nerve I was reminded of Plato's "The Republic"; specifically his passages on late-stage democracy. In it, Plato discusses the risks of a fractured polity, a society where "too much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery" and thus becomes ripe for tyranny. I much rather believe as Thomas Jefferson once did that "An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people." Nerve puts that idea into doubt forcing me to fall back on the tired refrain of it's just a movie.And it is just a movie; the walls of Jericho are not going to be tumbling down just because Emma Roberts made out with Dave Franco at a diner. Yet as a harbinger of what's to come let's hope this film is an out-layer and not the eventual rule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your nerve will taste the acting.....not the suspense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the name of this movie I had some interest and thought this will be a good movie. I saw the casting and read the synopsis. But that is not the feature of the movie. The plot is "A high school senior finds herself immersed in an online game of truth or dare, where her every move starts to become manipulated by an anonymous community of watchers." The sad thing is, this is not the story and when you will watch the movie you will get confused that, what is the synopsis and what is the actual story. Maybe the director (or director duo) also confused about the plot and the story line. If you want to make a thriller movie you have to maintain the suspense and have to create the thrill but in this movie the director used a very common formula and monotonous plot. Here I want to say, the acting and some humor are good in this movie but these are not enough to save the movie. Plot wise the movie could have been better a lot. But the director missed the opportunity to execute the thrilling content and failed to maintain the pace of this movie. Unnecessary subplot and some enigmatic incidents surely make you confuse. I like the theme and young people's story like high school story is always enjoyable for me but there is no execution of the teenager's emotion and sometimes the director put some exaggerated emotion on that. When you deal with a story that has a virtual game and social networking concept you have to put proper suspense and thrill among the characters because the game is not usual and that is the main character of this movie. There are a lot of cliché points in this thriller movie and I am sure you already have been seen this story 50 times before watching this movie. Save your money and if you want to watch, go with your own risk.</fullReview>
