		<shortDescription>Absolutely astounding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film should be mandatory for every man, woman, and child in the world.I would leave it at that but IMDb has a minimum of 10 lines of text to prove you "mean business" with your review. This film was utterly astounding in every sense, most importantly in the way it just lets a strange, inexplicable, simple truth emerge on its own. It is not a film that makes you feel better about the world or yourself, but rather one that makes you remember, oh yes, all this is real, and it really matters. Without providing a spoiler, the final scene also underscores why documentaries are made, and the very real, very important things that utterly cannot be faked with all the acting, special effects, and make up in the world. That life is real.--I wanted to make one other note to my initial impression, since this film remains my favorite film of the year and possible of a several- year. It is worth highlighting the fact that Mr Oppenheimer spent a good eight or ten years of his life making this film, spending his life in Indonesia with a camcorder and progressively greater levels of logistical and technical help (from what has been made public about the film). Films like this don't get made in a year. Not at all. It is worth reflecting on the connection between the time you invest in something, and what you get out of it. You get the same impression when you read, for example, one of the major novels of a couple centuries ago, but it is rare to see artistic works this big made anymore. War and Peace wasn't made in a year either. I somewhat feel for Mr Oppenheimer and the expectations that will precede his next work, whatever it is. Nothing like this will get made in the next two or three years, and that makes me the more grateful for this work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems almost trivial to "rate" a movie that is this important but like some of the tothers i have given it a 10 because people need to see it.I have never been as completely chilled by a film in my life, and I have seen plenty of brutal documentaries. The atrocities committed by the Indonesian death squads, and so vividly re-enacted, are not easy to watch and I expect that many people would rather just turn away and ignore them, but you owe it to yourselves to sit through them.I have just finished reading Steven Pinker's excellent book The Better Angels of Our Nature in which he argues that humanity is far less violent now than we have ever been. That may be so, but if you are looking for a compelling counter-argument you can start with this film. I can assure that that you will never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Film that Has to be Seen to be Believed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After over one-hundred years of cinema, it's pretty rare to come across a film unlike anything you've seen before, let alone one that begs the question: how the hell did they pull that off? Even though blockbuster films like Gravity try to do this by taking us to great heights (no pun intended) through technological / cinematographic advancements, we somehow end up bored with the result. Who really cares how long and complicated your opening take is if it feels like it lives inside the brain of a computer? Perhaps fiction has been done to death, perhaps we've advanced the tech behind fictional filmmaking so far that it's completely lost touch with reality. This is probably why, today, documentaries have never been more relevant and more capable of blowing your mind. The advantage documentaries have over fiction is that they can show us things so unbelievable they could only exist in the real world. Truth is truly stranger than fiction.Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing is a very special documentary. What begins as a glimpse into the lives of a handful of former death squad leaders, Oppenheimer then invites them to help produce fictional recreations of their killings, recreations mimicking the style of the murderers' favourite Hollywood movies. As the fiction overtakes the lives of its subjects, The Act of Killing becomes what Oppenheimer has described as "a documentary of the imagination." Never before has such nightmarish and surreal terrain been excavated, revealing a chilling indifference to nothing less than unpunished crimes against humanity.If you've ever tried to imagine what a Nazi conquered world would be like, this documentary might be closest thing we'll ever have to actually knowing. What we discover is that when history is written by the victors, we see something very frightening emerge: acceptance of brutality as not only necessary, but heroic. Aware of how it's so much easier to see the contents of a fishbowl when staring at it from a distance, The Act of Killing positions its viewers in a way that forces us to question our own perspective on how and why things really are in the world, not in the way we've been brainwashed to believe. The murderous thugs Oppenheimer immortalizes are not behind bars, or on trial for war crimes, or any of their crimes; these men are heroes in their native Indonesia, on parade to be adored by their hero-worshipping countrymen and women.Considering Oppenheimer cast his subjects inside a surreal, hyper-stylized world of fictional recreations, it's impossible to argue The Act of Killing isn't manipulative. But it's the lengths Oppenheimer goes to -- the soaring heights of absurdity these staged recreations go to -- that confirm, whatever moral compass exists, it is not being directed by someone with a hidden agenda. Ultimately, the fictitious pageantry calls attention to how difficult it is for someone to have perspective when they're lost within a concrete belief system cemented by victory, history, and the applause of an entire nation. If you think you wouldn't have been swept away by the mass-hysteria/nationalism excited by the Nazis pre-WW2, then you're lying to yourself as much as you may have been for having bought into Obama's movement for 'Change.' I know I'm guilty of the latter.Damning as it is, Oppenheimer's surreal world also acts as an arena for 'art' therapy, treatment both logical and plausible for men who've been playing roles their whole lives. Decades ago these gangsters were young, ego-driven, power hungry men who performed the most horrible acts imaginable...and now as old men, they've perfected their roles as heroic cowboys proud of having defended the homestead. But once the act is over and the veil lifted, these men are revealed to be victims of their own acts, sickened by what they've done, who they are, and the 'act' they've clung to in order to preserve their own sanity. To gain access to the minds of characters so repulsive and sinister is something even the best screenwriters couldn't fathom pulling off; to be able to humanize them, and make them sympathetic is a feat of filmmaking unlike anything I've ever watched before.Something else I've never seen before is a film with one "anonymous" credit, let alone dozens of them, including one given to a co-director. The gravity of this reminds us the killings proudly re-enacted by the film's subjects are not just nostalgic, but very much a part of the today's way of doing business. By the time the credits scroll we realize the real culprit here, the one we cannot pardon, is Capitalism.The Act of Killing depicts capitalism at its darkest hour, in a special place where brutality and savagery are necessary and applauded. Immersing us in such a dark place, The Act of Killing shows us how difficult it is to identify the outlines of our own faces once the definitions of "truth" and "justice" are mutated beyond recognition. History asks us: How far removed are we from these crimes? Was it not our governments who supported these atrocities? Whether we knew it or not, we collectively turned blind eyes, condoning a genocide that took the lives of over one million people. These are the realizations we should be most sickened and disturbed by, but are we? We enabled these men to kill so who are we to judge, and if the results coincide with our politics, do we even care?www.eattheblinds.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Auteur Review - The Act of Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By omitting the historical context behind the 1965?1966 Indonesian killings and letting the Indonesian death squad leaders tell their own story, watching The Act of Killing evokes the Nietschean idea of 'gazing into the abyss'. That if one were to 'gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.' The Act of Killing is a deep ocean of ideas, constantly reflecting the human condition. Every scene was like a wave, with an entirely different idea, crashing over the previous scene and provoked a new thought in me. My thought train spiraled and branched off into different directions.At first, I thought about the brutality of man. Then it went to how history is written by the victor.And then I thought about the nature of cinema and storytelling. That in the act of telling their own story, the death squad leaders became conscious of their past actions through the task of having to present it to an audience. The aesthetic distance, interestingly enough, ends up being the distance these death squad leaders needed to truly examine what they have done.And then I arrived at the nature of how extreme ideas in society prevail, despite of how illogical or inhuman they may be. That logic is relative, anyone can easily manipulate logic to justify any action. One can make anything sound logical to do whatever they desired in a given moment.And like that, the film kept on giving infinitely and its themes continually deepened. The Werner Herzog brand of the 'ecstatic truth' is at play here. Each audience member will have their own individual experience of the film's ideas and themes, because the film allows it so. Director Joseph Oppenheimer never puts these men on trial and instead of burrows for something deeper to reflect humanity at its core. These men, like anybody, are just human. And I cared and became invested into their emotional journey through how Oppenheimer displays their humanity, which was perplexing at points. I had to remind myself that they were still mass murderers.At a two and a half hour running time, the film is too long. It's hard to sit with such heavy material. There is a 115-minute theatrical cut that exists, which is 45 minutes shorter than this director's cut. Joshua Oppenheimer seemingly wants to cover more ground than needed and less definitely would have been more. I stuck with it alright because I was fascinated by the film's subjects, but it may test the patience of general audiences. That said, The Act of Killing is a great story told through subjects that I never ever want to meet in real life. It is an unsettling and powerful experience and is one of the best films of 2013, if not the most important.For more reviews, please subscribe to my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful documentary with a brilliant approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Act of Killing (Jagal) is awesome: a documentary film showing real algojos (assassins) who killed many PKI (communist party members/supporters), in their own words. It's unique story telling has successfully made important people, including current parliament members, admitting brutality, killing and on-going premanism (thuggery) that's clearly supported by the government, also in their own words, to the camera. Director Joshua Oppenheimer approached the ex-algojo, Anwar Congo and his buddies, to play in a silly movie, even in woman's dress, without knowing that the real movie is actually the everyday conversation where he was proudly telling n showing what he has done in 65. The government assigned military and preman to support the coup-de-tat, raping and killing many innocents in the name of anti-PKI. The movie's honest, satire and unprovocative documentation has ironically made us laugh and cry at the same time. Reality does bite: people do what they think is right, and make it right for them, no matter how wrong it is. Why? Because history is written by the winners. All Indonesian production team remain anonymous and the movie is not publicly distributed in Indonesia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror! The horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd be hard-pressed to name any film I've watched that is as strange and disturbing as 'The Act of Killing' (brought to you by executive producers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris).When Indonesian president Sukarno allied himself with communists in 1965, he was toppled by a military coup and a bloody, anti-communist purge followed. Ethnic Chinese, deemed disproportionately wealthy and corrupt by other Indonesians, were targeted as well ? or at least this is how some pretended to justify the genocide of so many innocents. A million people were killed. The same paramilitary death squads that carried out the assassinations are politically strong today and count with government ministers among their members. They proclaim themselves national heroes and boast loudly about their "achievements". Director Joshua Oppenheimer interviews some of these gangsters and invites them to reenact the murder scenes by adapting them to their favorite movie genres (Westerns, musicals, etc.) I initially wondered whether such a bizarre concept wasn't disrespectful to the victims of the massacre, but I realized that it was precisely this format that enabled the director to revisit history and unearth its truth. Oppenheimer had to stroke the gangsters' egos or he would have never been allowed to film. Some of them, including the main character, Anway, started their criminal careers by scalping tickets at a local cinema and were big fans of Hollywood films. In an article from The Australian newspaper, Oppenheimer explains the documentary's theatrical approach this way: "Killing always involves some kind of distancing from what you are doing. Maybe that always means a kind of performance and acting, some kind of storytelling. Maybe it can just mean drinking first. But for Anwar, in part, it comes from the stories that he would imbibe in the cinema, the images and roles, the process of cinematic identification. The act of killing, for Anwar, was always some kind of act." The result is both chilling and surreal. It is shocking to see these men proudly celebrating their monstrous crimes, including rape. Have they no empathy? How ignorant, demented and evil can humans be? This reminds me of the BBC documentary mini-series 'The Nazis: A Warning Story', in which former Nazi members speak coldly about their ideology, indifferent to the suffering they have caused. These Indonesian gangsters, however, are still in power and are applauded on national TV, their insanity still shared decades later by a significant portion of the population.There seems to be a disconnect between these people and their feelings, as if all the violence had somehow rendered them numb. This is most evident in Anwar. While a few of the thugs express some awareness of the harm they have done, Anwar is in a state of denial. He blocks his emotions and appears to bury any remorse for his acts under a fabricated storyline that absolves him. Yet, toxic memories stubbornly surface every night in the form of nightmares. As the film goes on, he slowly wakes up from the cloud of illusion that he has created around him and realizes the horror that he's participated in. This is one of the film's big successes.It's frightening to picture this kind of cruelty emerge from a marginal, uneducated, third-world environment. But we have to ask ourselves how different we are from them. Don't we turn a blind eye on the killing of civilians carried out by drones in other countries, for example? Don't we also glorify national heroes who wiped out entire populations? As a Venezuelan, I think of the revered Independence leader Bolivar, who ordered the systematic murder of all Spanish civilians with his decree of 'War to the Death'. Every country has its stories. We seem to rationalize these inconvenient facts by telling ourselves that the war was merciless on both sides or that the end somehow justifies the means. Like gangster Adi suggests, history is written by the victors and war crimes are defined by the winners.At two and a half hours long, the film could use a little more editing, in my opinion. I feel like it would be even more effective if it were stripped down further, removing any hints of sensationalism. I'm confused, for example, as to why Herman, the obese gangster, is dressed in drag during each reenactment. Did he find it comical? Was he aiming for the grotesque? Did he do it out of his own initiative or did the filmmakers encourage this? It gives the impression that someone was trying hard to make things look even weirder, which is completely unnecessary. Maybe there's a good explanation for this. And then again, everything in this film is so bizarre that it often resembles a work of pitch-black satire. Its terrifying strangeness, however, is no joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is a documentary based on the Indonesian genocide in 1965. It challenges former Indonesian death squad leaders to reenact their real-life mass-killings in whichever cinematic genres they wish. The killings resulted in one of the most brutal genocide in history, with nearly a million people slaughtered within a year. It's obvious some of the scenes they re-enacted are inspired by Hollywood films, as the perpetrators of the killings themselves admitted that they're big fans of violent Brando and Pacino movies. No doubt this is one of the most bizarre and frightening films I've ever seen, but also one of the most inventive. Most documentaries I've seen usually have talking heads or footage of the subject matter, but in this case, we not only get the first-hand account of the event, but the perpetrators themselves willingly re-enact the brutal events on camera. The documentary is so well-crafted as it really transported me to another realm. Director Joshua Oppenheimer spent nearly a decade working on this film, which grew out of another project he was working on in Indonesia in 2001. The Texas-born filmmaker (who currently resides in Copenhagen) had been fluent in Indonesian whilst filming this, and it's apparent that he cares very deeply about the story. I'm amazed at how candid the former death squad leaders were in revealing the acts of killings they did four decades ago, down to the most gruesome details, both in words and in the form of the various re-enactments. It's interesting that in some of the scenes they're playing the 'victim' of the torture and execution. At one point Anwar said to Joshua that perhaps he could feel what his victims felt when they were subjected to such horrifying terror, but the director wisely but politely rebuked him. Obviously he could never felt what his victims felt, given that what Anwar took part in was only fiction, not the real deal. The word 'amusing' perhaps isn't what you'd expect in a documentary about mass killings... yet the re-enactments that were inspired by various Hollywood genres ranging from Cowboy movies, crime drama, and bizarre musical numbers where a member of Indonesian paramilitary Pemuda Pancasila was dressed in an ornate drag costume. Though some of the scenes are quite amusing, it's truly revolting that these guys are in such good spirits and joking around whilst filming such horrific acts. It's one thing when an actor has to act out a fictional violent film, but every scenes they depicted here are based on true acts of killing that they themselves performed to hundreds of thousand innocent victims. The film focuses mainly on two of the most notorious death squad leaders in North Sumatra, Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry. It's interesting to note the different reactions between the two in how they cope with their past sins. Anwar seems somewhat remorseful and honest about being haunted by his past, in the form of nightmares and psychological torment, whilst Adi is more defiant and in denial about how his past doesn't really affect him. There's an absurd conversation between the two when they're talking about seeing a shrink to help alleviate their psychological issues. One of the most intriguing character in the film is Herman, who's dressed in drag for a good part of the film. He wasn't actually involved in the massacre at the time as he was only about 10 years old then, but he played a prominent part in this film. His evolution throughout the film is striking as he starts out as someone who greatly admires his friend Anwar. As the film progresses, it's as if his eyes were opened to the reality of evil that he's somehow being shielded from all his life. Despite all the grisly depictions, the most affecting scenes to me are surprisingly those when no words are spoken. Whether it's a scene of Herman playing drums while wailing and screaming uncontrollably, or the deafeningly quiet moment when Anwar simply stops at the stairway as he's going down from the rooftop where a lot of the killings happened. Both scenes rendered me speechless. But really, there are too many breathtaking moments to mention in this film. It's truly a film one must experience, I don't think my review does it justice as it barely scratch the surface of the depth of what's being depicted on screen. Harrowing, shocking, and at times unbearable to watch... but it's also surprisingly poetic and beautiful. There are few films out there that I'd call essential viewing, but I think this documentary is one of them.This incident isn't just about Indonesia, but it speaks volumes about our humanity and what we humans are capable of. I hope you'd check it out when it's out in your area or available to rent. Be sure to seek out the 159-min director cut whenever possible. I'm sincerely hoping that 'The Act of Killing' would get a nod for Best Documentary at the Oscars, as well as other kudos come award season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindblowing In A Million Ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have *never* seen anything like The Act of Killing. It is a documentary of sorts about the Indonesian death squads who killed millions of 'communists' in the 60s. Director Josh Oppenheimer worked with the squad leaders to make a 'film' about their involvement any way they wanted to make it. The result is staggeringly, devastatingly honest. I watched almost the entire the film with my jaw on the floor and my heart in my throat.The massacres are so impinged upon the collective consciousness of Indonesia, even today, that it appears to permeate every aspect of every person's life. These squad leaders are still feared and celebrated, and their actions are institutionally supported, so, as a result, they get to run around patting themselves and each other on the back for their atrocities. It's bizarre on the highest order, and, though I wouldn't have thought of it, there probably isn't a better way to treat the subject matter than the way this film does.There are some scenes that are actually hard to watch, too real, even when they're not. Watching Chinese immigrant shop owners getting shaken down by gangsters for money was particularly sad, as was seeing confused, scared children cry ceaselessly after participating in hyper- realistic reenactments of massacres.Too often, when it comes to documentaries, people implore, "you have to see this one," citing its social, economic, personal, governmental, or scientific importance. Well this film is one everyone should see. It's really hard to believe sometimes that people like these death squad leaders really exist and travesties like this really have and continue to happen.This film absolutely blew my mind. It is unquestionably one of the very best documentaries I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike anything you have ever seen..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..and I am assuming you've seen a lot here.It's telling that Errol Morris, the man who can sniff truth out from behind the image like it's a prized truffle, was left confounded after watching this. This is not an easy movie to watch. Some people may find the subject matter overwhelming. Some may be troubled by the obvious "what if they won?" comparison with the Nazis. Two and a half million people died at the hands of the death squads the men you will be watching on screen belonged to. They razed entire villages, raped and tortured, committed ethnic cleansing (the "crush the Chinese" campaign is remembered fondly while the protagonists drive around town in their old gangster car). Now they get to make cinematic re-enactments of their days torturing and killing communists, which range from absolutely bizarre to harrowing (yet still bizarre, once full awareness of the context seeps in). The nation encourages their efforts!(In itself, allowing the protagonists of a documentary to make their own movie about the subject of the documentary is kind of a weird gambit on any project, but downright insane when the protagonists happen to be government-sanctioned mass murderers. This took serious courage - which is why half the names are "anonymous".)But this history - and more importantly, its effect on contemporary Indonesian society (the talk show segment is especially chilling) - are only the potent brew that affords us a window into such depths of the human soul. Here, the handful of subjects - the gangster murderers and national heroes - do most of the storytelling and provide unforgettable imagery, although they are shepherded along on this deranged journey by the deft hand of the filmmaker, who also does a masterful job of presenting this material to the audience. This is also the ultimate film within a film, because it essentially lights the fire under the brew, which activates its potency and makes it go to its protagonists' heads. Then the portal for us is open. Did I mention that much of the film has the potential to elicit laughter? However, as it nears its conclusion, it will stupefy and seize even the most cynical, disconnected viewer into silence (provided they read the subtitles).So yeah, easily one of the most important documentaries to come out this decade, if not this century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like a country where the SS actually won.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I recommend you see "The Act of Killing", the context for the film is missing. I think the filmmakers felt that it wasn't necessary but I am pretty sure younger audiences will feel a bit confused by what has happened. So, the retired history teacher in me will briefly give an overview that I wish had come when the film began: President Sukarno was the first president of Indonesia He was a strong nationalist who worked to gain independence from the Dutch. As the years passed, his administration forged closer and closer alliances with the left--particularly the communists. However, when Suharto deposed Sukarno in a coup, he ushered in an era of fascist-like repression. Suddenly, murder squads sprung up throughout the country and communists and the Chinese minority were targeted for extermination. During this period (mostly from 1965-7), approximately a million people were murdered--often very brutally.Now, decades later, filmmakers have come to Indonesia to interview folks who were responsible for some of these murders. And, surprisingly, they find that not only are these folks rather unrepentant, but that the culture of murdering the opposition still thrives. For example, Pancasila Youth is a paramilitary organization much like the Nazi SS and SA. They were the folks behind the murders and today STILL are several million member strong--and they are proud of this. What's worse, the government is strongly aligned with them and the film shows the nation's Vice President talking to them and giving his assent for their violence. While the filmmakers did not get interviews with these higher ups, they did get others responsible for the murders to be interviewed and even recreate the killings for the audience! Oddly, they seemed very cooperative and smiled throughout--as if they were very proud of being mass murderers.As far as the film goes, it is an amazing portrait of evil--especially since many of these folks look very ordinary. Monsters can have families, friends and even be pillars of society...but they are monsters. This is the great message of the film. And, because of this it is invaluable and worthy of receiving the Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature. It is worth seeing.While I strongly recommend the film as it is brave and outstanding in what it achieved, it also is overlong. And, sadly, while the film shows evil up close, after a while it all becomes rather boring. Shortening it a bit here and there would have made it more poignant. Still, it is a must-see film. With a slight editing, I would have scored this film a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Twain said "Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't." and in this film you are hit a raw and unbelievable impossible truth. You are left wondering how the hell the film makers got such confessions from such mass murderers who now seem more eccentric then evil." If we don't learn from history we are bound to repeat it" and I begin this paragraph with another famous but empty quote. But when you see this film you understand what that means. You may have read about political death squads, as I have, but I confess I never knew exactly what that meant. I thought they consisted of disciplined military units who targeted activists in a clinical way, and I thought that appalling. But death squads are unleashed thugs and these targeted communities, ethnic groups, communists and anyone else they wanted, to a tune of 2,5 million dead. This was another 20th century genocide and in the film the criminals still talk about "extermination" as if it was a good thing. In such an ethnically diverse place like Indonesia politicians should not talk or hold in respect war criminals who participated in genocide and in this film they openly do. Do they realise they are sending a message out, that this behaviour is acceptable in certain circumstance, which generally means it will happen again. Also, the international community should insist these men are taken to account and brought to the court of human rights in The Hague, as "we" should also insist this is always unacceptable. I urge all to watch this film, it is disturbing, jaw dropping, and something you will never forget. After the last scene of the film and thinking about what I just seen I let the credits run and even there, a poignant message, the amount of "anonymous" from makeup artists, producers and even one of the 2 directors shout volumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine if Germany had forgiven the Nazis &amp; left them in charge post-Holocaust amidst widespread acceptance for their actions. That's the world we see in 'The Act of Killing'.As a view into the simplicity of power structures in the developing world, this film is unparallelled. We visit an Indonesia where gangsters, paramilitary groups, politicians and businessmen openly integrate to form an overarching power group. Secrecy is not paramount to the main players here. This is vivid depiction of societal acceptance for genocide as a tool for political &amp; ethnic cleansing. The main characters are open about their crimes, venerated by their soldiers and public, rich men that have reaped the spoils of their war.And then a Western documentary maker asks them to recreate their murderous histories via the medium of film. Only too pleased, their vanity suitably piqued, their conceptualisation of their film is nothing short of bizarre. Songs and dance, many, many costumes, multiple roles for each hoodlum, a refreshing acceptance of cross-dressing, violence, colour, a dream sequence, interrogations, death.The reality of their history is blended with this haphazard project creating a unique and powerful tale. The film straddles the line of presenting it's protagonists as charming &amp; intriguing, Anwar Congo &amp; his sidekick have a definite chemistry &amp; at times it's hard to imagine their true brutality. However when we are confronted with a Lieutenant extolling his approval of child rape, one is quickly brought back to sobriety.This film is like nothing you've seen before, it's moral intent is clear and when you are presented with such stark and often beautiful art it's difficult to deny it's worthiness. Credit the bravery of the filmmaker and his many assistants who have anonymised their names in the credits. Hopefully the light shone here will be widely enlightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. To some: a national hero. To others: a monster or war criminal. Co-director Joshua Oppenheimer's concept was either to re-examine history or study the dark side of human nature. Either way, this is one of the most disturbing, difficult to watch documentaries I've ever seen.The film begins with this quote from Voltaire: "It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets". We then read text that provides the only historical background provided by the film ... the Indonesian coup in 1965 that led to a year long slaughter of anyone deemed to be a communist. In reality, the definition was quite broad and basically included anyone who wasn't totally onboard with the new power structure.To carry out the massacre, a death squad of gangsters was employed and Oppenheimer recruits one of the most brutal of these gangsters to an "art" project: recreate your most heinous kills in whatever film genre you prefer. Anwar Congo agrees and even arranges for his accomplices to join in. The result is the most bizarre mixture of classic Hollywood crime thrillers and even a surreal musical number with bold colors and a giant metal fish.That's the best description I can provide. While I found myself unable to look away, this is not one that can really be recommended as a form of entertainment. There are some stunning moments here, but it's nauseating to recall. An Indonesian TV talk show host is giddy to have these "heroic" gangsters on her show. Congo gathers his grandchildren to watch a brutal re-enactment of one of his missions. Their discussions of how important movies were to their murderous activities could lead to further analysis of the role of art in violence, but instead it points out why Congo agreed to this project in the first place - his ego is such that he seems himself as a Bogart type hero.Renowned documentary filmmakers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris are both listed as producers, but some of the crew is listed as "anonymous" and who can blame them? While there seems to be no regret and no guilt for previous actions, there is an odd, extended scene where Congo's guttural bellows and dry-heaving leave us wondering if maybe there is a crack in his facade ... or is he just caught up in his performance. I'm not sure and I hope to never watch this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'War crimes are defined by the winners'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then a documentary comes along that's very very special indeed. The Act of Killing is one of these films.This film is concerned with the Indonesian military coup of 1965, in the aftermath of which over 1 million civilians were murdered. These horrific purges were enacted upon those accused of communism and also the ethnic Chinese. The narrative probes into the motivations, minds and hearts of the executioners, criminals, gangsters and paramilitaries sanctioned by the government to carry out genocide. Joshua Oppenheimer handles the material of his documentary with masterful deftness and it becomes clear from the outset that he has a deep understanding of the Indonesian people as well as genuine love and respect for them. This comes loudly and clearly through the camera. Many other things also come out of this particular Pandora 's Box, and most of them are excruciatingly difficult to watch. These are men who are both a product of their environment and who are also undoubtedly pure monsters in their own right too. They give the usual excuses and the usual answers to the burning questions- no different to any other war criminal has throughout history. In this sense they are mundane. What is different about this film is the sense of arrogant entitlement, impunity and infallibility displayed by evil men and captured by Oppenheimer. This impunity is all consuming, almost tangible and about as ghastly a thing as any human being will ever witness. If you do choose to witness it however, you will gain something valuable from the experience. This film was made to give voice to victims and it does this in spades. It was made to right wrongs, and as a testament. For this reason, it is worth your time to watch it and to learn from it.I don't want to talk too much about any specific content, as it really speaks for itself. Suffice it to say that in terms of content this is NOT entertainment and is NOT suitable for everybody as upsetting scenes are thematically unavoidable, if you don't find The Act of Killing disturbing then you're probably not a human being. It is certainly NOT a documentary for children or younger teenagers- the content will be lost on them and it may be too graphic and disturbing for them.To put it into perspective, I honestly think that Oppenheimer's work can be held up on a par with Claude Lanzmann's Shoah both in it's vivid depiction of true human evil and the lending of voice to the dead. The Act of Killing may also be compared to Shoah in as much as it is an important historical document which just happens to be forged in the medium of film.Rating The Act of Killing seems inappropriate and largely irrelevant but I suppose it has to receive a 10 if anything at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indonesia is stinking of vomit today.I'm not sure it's possible to write a coherent review after seeing this film. Actually, no. I'm sure that is isn't possible. So here's this.The film is about the mass murders of 1-2 million Chinese, communists, intellectuals, and farmers in Indonesia in 1965-66, as re-enacted and retold by some of the people who actually did it. Incredibly, Indonesia celebrates this past.I saw the theatrical (i.e. shorter 2-hour) version of the film, with a one-minute recorded introduction by the director. The director asked us to stay to see a scene through the credits, but while the credits began over a scene, there was nothing additional that stood out to me, so I have no idea what he meant. Perhaps he was drawing our attention to the seemingly endless credits for "anonymous" (individuals, not the internet mob).The fact that this movie exists at all simply blows my mind. If you made it up, you couldn't come up with anything more strange, more disturbing. That many of the actions of these criminals were inspired directly by John Wayne cowboy movies and Hollywood gangster movies makes it unsurprising that references to a film from another Hollywood genre, Apocalypse Now, come so easily. They could not have yet (or perhaps ever) seen the Italian film Sal? o le 120 giornate di Sodoma, but it seemed they lived in a similar way, with near-complete disdain for human life. It is as if the society depicted in the Star Trek episode A Piece of the Action actually existed, but a million times worse. Yes, it seems you have to go to science fiction to find a story like this one.Did I mention one of the thugs is a cross-dresser? I guess anyone could be, but it puts a really, really strange spin on this. The same US right wing that cheered these guys on in the 1960s will now point to this as a sign of their moral depravity.I want these mass murderers and child rapers, still celebrated in Indonesia, held accountable for their crimes, admitted on film, before they die of old age. Regret and self-loathing is not accountability. I would be furious about this, but this film hits so hard ... I am numb.Only briefly alluded to in the film, the so-called "religion of peace" also has much to answer for, given its complicity and silence regarding the atrocities committed in securing its power.Utterly horrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The images create the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to this since first hearing about it. The subject would be deep and strange. It had involvement by Herzog in a project that seemed worthy of him. So I made a point to see the authorial version of close to three hours, hoping to land in a broader swim that goes out in search.Kierkegaard said, "life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forward". He means that life can only be made apparent in reflection but as you live it in the here and now it will be opaque. Conversely however, it means that if we hope to understand history in a significant way, so as to be able to recognize the forces at play in the here and now and not have to wait until later, we should try placing ourselves in it as something that was lived going forward.So by way of history that we can understand backward we learn little here. A military coup in Indonesia resulted in the persecution and death of perhaps up to a million people - that was with Vietnam already underway the same year and driven by the same strategy of containing communism and shady American involvement. But that's another story to tell.So how to begin to make sense in the here and now of a tragedy of unfathomable proportions? The filmmaker could have plainly presented a tapestry of facts and sought historians to explain larger swathes of context. It's not because he thinks the events will be fairly well known that he omits these, rather the whole point here is different.The film is not a historic record that only finds its impetus in the murderers; it's an examination of delusion and ignorance now in this life. Not the fact of murder so much as how individuals carry it with them. They are asked to re enact events, the re enactments played back to them so they're both makers and viewers. How do they see themselves in what they see of themselves? What form does the memory take and what does it mean to live through it after the fact?So these re enactments would be our focal point of entry into the self who lived through them, memory brought alive. Some of them are more fantastical than others. Some are just brutish and senseless, hemmed in by the brutish imagination of their makers. The most chilling thing however is that even the enactments of violent interrogation, in particular those, afford no realer apprehension; they look as banal as movie scenes.Which is to say that there's a certain kind of artifice here that stands in our way and the actual filmmaker can't shed away. Some will say he achieves this in the finale and perhaps he does. But there's another nagging sense for me. See, we follow two or three people, head executioners in their day, picked among dozens of others for the purpose of the film. It quickly becomes obvious why; they're each photogenic in their way, flamboyant and unabashed. It also becomes obvious that they think they're making a different sort of film, one that chronicles their exploits in a favored light. Not surprisingly; they have lived all their life within a state- sponsored narrative that sees events of that day as brave.Now one of them has managed to build around himself something akin to a worldview that lets him escape any guilt. Is any other country innocent of much the same? Another is just a Jack Black looking dufus probably as capable of the same now. But the third one looks like he might be awakening to a more vital realization, the one we would perhaps like him to.See, this is the whole thing. The film becomes about this man making the breakthrough to the kind of story we would like to see told, it's why the climax is reserved for him and not the one who is unrepentant. But this way have we penetrated artifice to get to the real stuff in a deep way? The scene where he retches in the same veranda where he garroted thousands, does it offer the realization we're after?Suddenly it feels as contrived as a dramatized version. See, the whole thing can't be bogged down to whether this man is feeling pangs of regret now, it can't be a concern that he is, unless you're willing to buy the notion that ignorance and delusion have been chased away from him and he's now cleansed. This simply isn't how I'm prepared to leave this behind. Truth, or ecstatic truth like Herzog's kind, is always something you sculpt and this isn't particularly well sculpted truth.What we learn about present day Indonesia was more chilling truth in its way. It becomes obvious that the political caste in power comes from much the same apparatus that exterminated people. A deputy minister openly hailing paramilitaries in a speech while wearing their jacket. A surreal TV talk show that would probably reach tens of millions of homes interviewing the murderers while the whole audience in attendance are paramilitaries. Everything here shows a deeply disturbing mentality that still gleams in the eyes of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Act of Not Buying into the Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to comprehend the majority of praise this documentary has received. Yes it is different and at times uncomfortable to watch, but that doesn't mean it's great or even good.For a film that is about actual political murders detailed by the murderers themselves, you wouldn't think it could be boring, but it was. I could barely get through the first 30 minutes and it never compelled my interest - I had to force myself to keep watching it. When you have a bunch of ignorant and ill-informed men self psycho-analyzing, using incorrect culture references and base human non-emotion to smugly explain or rationalize how and why they killed, and then to reenact the interrogations and murders in a cheapo Bollywood style, well it's ludicrous, not revolutionary. I mean if the message is that even morons can kill and in time film cheesy reenactments about it, then I guess I understood the message and then I asked, so what did that prove? The end scene, where one of the killers becomes ill for an extended period of time, might be looked at as redemptive, but even if perceived in that way it's out of place, message-wise, with the rest of the film.From the reviews I read I thought there were going to be elaborate and amazingly bizarre and unique recreations of various crimes against humanity and from that I might learn something about the most terrible crimes against humanity. But the film's scope is not that historically vast and only a couple scenes have elaborately stylized the atrocities. Generally the recreations are mostly small scale, cheesy and repetitive. What is almost more distasteful than the actual historical killings themselves is the filmmaker's concept, asking the killers to recreate their crimes with such callous disrespect to the lives taken. Yes it may have been therapeutic for the participants (as if killers deserve therapy?) and all this is supposed to pass for brilliance? Brent Chastain - Top3Films.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot help the urge not to write something that I could say I truly know and familiar with. I was born in the exact city where this youth organization stronghold (Pemuda Pancasila) is based now and where all the killing had taken place in the past. I am no stranger to all the crimes they did back then or do now.Back to where it all started on the 30th of September 1965, which marked the rebellion by the Communist Party. Seven of the highly ranked military generals were kidnapped, tortured and murdered then piled in an old well by what the history said to be the communist starting coup d tat. (No evidences of torturing as accused, only military style execution resulted from the autopsies of the remains and also no evidence it was done by the communist party member till now).The name Pemuda Pancasila (Youth of Pancasila) was then known since youth started to march on the street yelling Pancasila (our nation's philosophy) resisting and seeking for revenge by annihilating communism to its root. Both government and military gave full support resulted in uncontrolled anarchy mob led to man slaughter and in present day, an organized crime.My Mother was 13 and witnessed their brutalities would tell me the horror with fears still could be seen in her eyes. Her brothers would run and hide for their lives in a rice field when Pemuda Pancasila arrived with machetes in military trucks yelling "Pancasila" as their slogan to find and execute anyone who was involved in communist. But all the communist excuses were biased and used only to do what they wanted and to kill whoever they think was communist mostly with no evidence at all.She witnessed her neighbour accused as one of the member of "Gerwani", woman communist organization, being raped, then dragged to the street and beaten to death as an example for others who resist. They looted, ate, drank, and destroyed what they could not take in my mom's store. One word or eye contact showing disrespect would find her ended up beaten to death. Dead bodies and body parts scattered everywhere on the street was a normal view. Not one day went by without anyone getting killed at night. Many were victims of the unproven accusation, poor farmers who received fertilizer or farming tools from the communist party would be considered communist while they did not even know anything about what communism is.I felt really sick watching this movie yet at the same time I was very thankful finally the whole truth about how this crime organization started and is hiding behind a youth organization now be told. It disgusted me how they could live with such unbelievable crimes and told the story so proudly with no regrets and believed in their lies and excuses they made up only to justify their brutality in the past (except Anwar Congo). Some even considered themselves as heroes. Yet I pitied them for being very uneducated and shallow. Imitating what they saw in the western cowboy and Mafia's movies thinking they could be meaner and more brutal like it was just some scene in a movie. Are they qualified as human beings?Ps. If you are interested in finding more about their brutalities and violence, you can find videos in youtube recently, they are involved in a riot with other organization and Police.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most unique and intriguing documentary ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intriguing, shocking and terrifying at once, "The Act of Kiliing" is a unique documentary that shows ugly truth about mass and sadistic murders from Indonesian government which was dominated by military and gangsters at that time. The film just twisted people's this whole time perspective blaming communist (who was believed responsible for some dissipation and death of many Indonesian important figure) turns into sympathy because what military of the government did was way more cruel and immoral. It's revealed how they hunt and killed thousands or even millions of innocent people who they assumed communist. "The Act of Killing" isn't a comfortable film to see for sure because of it's theme about killing and stuff but it is undeniably an important asset of documentary and the history itself. Credits should be given to Joshua Oppenheimer and his crew who bravely convinced Anwar Congo and his executioner's colleagues to make confessions by re-telling of what really happened and allowed them to improvise with their acts and creativity. The result, this movie becomes not only thrills audiences with it's fact but also entertains them with musical and comedy. Even though, perhaps "The Act of Killing" wouldn't change anything from it's documentary filmmaking and troubles with some poor editing and uncleared sound effects, it's still simply powerful and could be the best ever possibly used documentary on storytelling that would leave audiences unspoken and the one that isn't easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest documentaries ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960's saw great political upheaval in Indonesia, with then- President Sukarno being overthrown by Suharto, and the Indonesian Communist Party finding themselves the subject of a widespread propaganda smear campaign. Death squads were created to systematically wipe out the Communist party and anyone suspecting of sympathising with the organisation. Between 1965 and 1966, it is estimated somewhere in between of 500,000 and 1 million Indonesians were murdered in a massacre widely ignored by Western countries. Shockingly, the heads of the death squads still hold power and influence in their country, with many now employed as high-ranking military officers.A straight-forward documentary covering the topic would have no doubt been a powerful and upsetting experience, but director Joshua Oppenheimer, along with co-directors Christine Cynn and somebody listed as 'Anonymous', have rejected this approach and, with The Act of Killing, have subverted the genre entirely. Obviously appalled at the countries failure to highlight the atrocity and punish those responsible for the crimes committed, Oppenheimer has instead opted to give the killers the opportunity to tell their own story. Yet rather than talking-heads juxtaposed with archive footage, Oppenheimer gave them a film crew and the freedom to depict their acts in a movie of their own making. The results, quite frankly, are utterly astonishing.Portraying their war crimes in a variety of genres that range from musical numbers and film noir to westerns and bizarre dream-like sequences, their cinematic vision is naturally cheesy and poorly handled, complete with bad acting and stodgy dialogue, with one gangster over-eager to dress in drag in an effort to lighten the tone (and succeeding in the process). However, Oppenheimer isn't interested in the final product (which we don't get to see), but how the film-making process affects those involved. At first, these killers, rapists and torturers are utterly loathsome, demonstrating absolutely no remorse whatsoever about their actions. One, Anwar Congo, gleefully displays his efficient method of murder, which involves strangulation by wire, while another boasts to his friends about the delights of raping a 14-year old girl.Yet Congo, who is viewed as a sort of celebrity in his country, starts to reflects on the pain and suffering he has caused. In one scene, he plays a victim being interrogated while tied to a chair. When the wire is tied around his neck, the experience has a profound affect on him, sitting motionless in silence as his friends look concerned and baffled. He later watches it back, transfixed, and starts to break down. The Act of Killing is careful not to sympathise with its subjects (Oppenheimer quickly points out to Congo that his victims' experience would have been far worse), but at least tries to understand them. It's less about the atrocities Indonesia experienced than the act of killing itself, and what could possibly drive anybody to such cold-blooded barbarity. It's a powerful and moving experience like no other movie I've ever seen, and it is no overstatement to hail this as one of the greatest documentaries ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Act of Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many viewers of the documentary I had zero knowledge of the events that are remembered here, and on a fundamental level it has already succeeded by bringing its topic into the public sphere. It is of course political; on a secondary level Oppenheimer seeks to reveal it to the American public and their deeply hidden involvement in the mass killings. But I am struck by how little this agenda exists on a surface level; Oppenheimer seems to be not immediately concerned with the objective of unearthing deep-seated remorse from these subjects, if there is any. Filming took reportedly 8 years - there is patience behind the camera, as if the filming is guided by the killers themselves. This is our chance to show ourselves for who we are, they say. And yet they are so freely depicted discussing what to omit from the film, and their greed and corruption, and how they are revered in the public sphere. Such a confidence and reputation is baffling to the western viewer. So Oppenheimer follows them and their pursuit; from their journey as low tier ticket scalpers all the way to death squad leaders. Their history has influenced them, and they re-enact their past in the vein of their adored movie stars. One scene has them dressed in traditional gangster outfit, torturing a victim while an eerie green light bathes the background. Another has the killings symbolically via a grotesque tribal sacrifice/meal. In the most vivid of their stories, victims, perpetrators and dancers alike are dressed in the most lurid costumes, the sunlight is deliberately overexposed to give the scene a heavenly aura, and Anwar Congo himself wears a glimmering gold medal and is praised for his past actions. Oppenheimer freely props these glorified dramatisations up; or rather he allows the killers to rewrite their own history. More disturbing is the freedom with which they boast and tell their stories with pride. There is still a deep running sentiment of anti-communism and political corruption everywhere they go. They casually talk of their killings while playing golf and drinking, recreate their brutal methods with pride, and even gain the approval of political party members. One story Oppenheimer relays is the reality in which Herman would shake up the Chinese shopkeepers without fear and keep the film rolling, and then secretly he would go back and compensate the owners for their money lost. There is a powerful sense of complicity and responsibility that is owed to Oppenheimer for capturing this act. Does it veer into artifice? Perhaps once, as he captures the fiery re-enactment of a takeover of a village where the camera hovers nervously and close-in and the sound is cut to heighten the brutality of the images. And then they shout Cut! and it cuts back to a wide shot and everyone is all smiles. Well not everyone - the children don't quite understand, and even the director admits it is not a good look. The most talked about scene is the last one - a revisit to the rooftop by Anwar where he carried out so many of his reported 1000 kills. It has been paradoxically deemed both horrific and upsetting as well as artificial. But the beauty of documentary is that both interpretations are equally valid. We see throughout that Anwar is increasingly struck by his past actions. He attempts to shield himself from this realisation: he imagines his victims thanking him for killing them, he props up his young grandchildren and is happy to see them denounce the video as 'boring', and offers up a cheap confession as if he has now fully learned exactly how his victims felt before the death blow. And he tears up, and retches repeatedly, uncontrollably - whether genuine, or played fake to appear remorseful, it is ultimately shallow. Oppenheimer feels no need to comfort him because the full experience can never be recreated - not with talking heads, not with dramatic re-enactment, not with feigned acceptance. Those blindly grabbing for catharsis or redemption need to realise this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Act of Killing' is a chilling film, one that you won't soon forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never quite seen anything like Joshua Oppenheimer's documentary 'The Act of Killing'. With its horrific subject matter, the film is extremely difficult to watch. Oppenheimer was born in my native state, Texas, but now resides mostly in London. Eight years ago, he embarked on a mission to Indonesia to document the victims of the government sponsored genocide of Communists following the 1965 military takeover.After interviewing some of the victims, the director met a few of the perpetrators who actually carried out the brutal killings. Eventually, his entire film focused on the killers, with no time given to the victims. In an original take on the documentary genre, Oppenheimer allowed these mass murderers not only to laugh and talk fondly about their murders, but even to re-enact them in the form of their favorite types of films, which include old-school gangster movies, horror, and even a musical comedy. These criminals are completely unapologetic about what they did.The documentary mostly follows Anwar Congo, now an elderly man who looks strikingly similar to Nelson Mandela. Congo was one of the lead gangsters that carried out the government sanctioned murders of Indonesian Communists in the '60s. He has killed over one thousand people. Yes, you read that right ? one thousand. The government formed paramilitary death squads and hired local street thugs to carry out the killings. Before his mass murders, Congo was a movie ticket scalper. He happily describes how he killed his victims, and explains that his favorite method was strangling them with metal wire, because it was fast and easy to clean up.Congo wasn't alone in the murders. He was joined by another man who now has a family, seems to be well off, has no remorse and is quite enthusiastic about his murderous past. He even gloats about killing his girlfriend's father because he thought the man was a Communist. We also get a glimpse of some of the paramilitary soldiers, one of whom brags about raping 14-year-old girls and killing them. The camera follows a few of the state's leaders and military officials as they travel from local business to local business, shaking down the shop owners for money and threatening violence if they don't pay enough.At a certain point, everything comes back to Anwar Congo, who finally starts to show a hint of remorse for his past evil deeds. He's still haunted in his nightmares by the ghosts of his victims and sometimes wakes up scared. In particular, he's terrified of a guy he beheaded with a machete in the middle of a forest, but didn't close his eyes after killing him. In another pivotal moment, he decides to play the victim in the film, and one of his friends will play a version of himself. As he gets heavily bloodied in makeup, his favorite method of killing is performed on him, which causes him to break down in disbelief that he's done it to so many people.Not only do we see these evil men still alive today ? happy, unapologetic and still thinking the same way ? we see parts of Indonesia that are solely run by the paramilitary and gangsters, without any hope. It's truly frightening. These evil men are protected by their country and will never receive a single ounce of punishment for what they did.'The Act of Killing' is extremely difficult to watch. At times, you'll want to get out of your seat and demand these men be brought to justice. It's sad, powerful, important, and must be seen. There is a reason that iconic filmmakers Errol Morris and Werner Herzog signed on as executive producers on this. 'The Act of Killing' is a chilling film, one that you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shocking and disturbing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a good family movie; plenty of humor; a great story; Wonderful scenery. It really show what's special about our country even though it's a film about death."In 2013, Joshua Oppenheimer's documentary The Act of Killing managed to make almost every film critic's list for the top ten films of the year and rightfully so because it's a disturbing and challenging portrayal of Indonesian death squad leaders who share their unique point of view of the events that took place during 1965 when the military overthrew the Indonesian government. These thugs were promoted by the army to become death squad leaders and they each confess to having killed nearly a thousand alleged communists during that year. So you'd expect this to be their opportunity to confess their crimes and seek redemption, but since these men have no regrets for their actions and simply believe they were doing their government a favor, Joshua Oppenheimer convinced them to re enact some of their executions in the way they wanted to. Most of these men were heavily influenced by gangster movies and they share their love for some of these movies while they compare themselves and their actions to some of those characters, so it was a brilliant opportunity for Oppenheimer to have these men open up and share their experience through staging these scenes. The result is quite astonishing as you listen to these men talk about how they killed these people as if they were heroes and even mention how fun it was to rape the young communist girls. At the same time, it also seems to take a toll on some of them who begin to realize that their actions weren't very humane. In one of the many shocking scenes, one of these leaders, Anwar Congo, decided to play one of the victims and in a way it became the first time that he actually put himself in the other person's mind and the result was quite profound for him. The greatest thing about this documentary is that it truly gets inside the minds of these murderers. There is no doubt that this film makes for an interesting study on human behavior and how small group mentality can help shape and justify such behaviors. These men are actually considered heroes and many of them are in high positions in the government (which happens to be extremely corrupt and isn't interested in hiding that fact either). At one point these men even justify their triumph comparing it to how the native Americans were exterminated during the colonization era. The culture that is portrayed in The Act of Killing is shocking, especially during those scenes where the gangsters joke about their crimes. Their involvement in this film isn't so that they can share their testimony in documentary form, they want to become the stars that they grew up idolizing in movies and have shaped their behavior after them so they are persuaded to re enact their executions. Some chose to film their scenes in dark film noir style, others did it as if it were a war movie, and some even chose a surreal style where for example you have dancers singing with a gorgeous waterfall in the background as the spirits of the murdered men thank their executioners for sending them to Heaven and setting them free. More than an entertaining documentary, The Act of Killing is an enlightening one and for that reason it's difficult to watch. There are moments where the pacing does get a bit tiresome and the scenes repetitive, but it remains deeply effective. At times, I was so shocked by the way these men proudly told tales of how they executed their victims that I was convinced the subtitles were off and that the directors were simply changing the lines because there was no way that they could be so gleeful about their accomplishments. Oppenheimer manages to put a face on the evil we can't even begin to comprehend and the result is quite shocking and disturbing, and he does so without ever being judgmental. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man is the cruelest animal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To witness suffering does one good, to inflict it even more so---that is a harsh proposition, but a fundamental one, an old, powerful human all-too-human proposition, one to which perhaps even the apes would subscribe: it is said that in devising bizarre cruelties they already to a large extent anticipate and at the same time 'rehearse' man. No festivity without cruelty: such is the lesson of the earliest, longest period in the history of mankind---and even in punishment there is so much that is festive!"'The Act of Killing' is a supreme and an ber-complex inquiry into the human nature through looking at the events and people associated with the Indonesian killings of 1965?66. It's a deep psychological and socio-political study of killers, a society with rampant malevolence and its effect. At the same time it's an experiment, the themes emerge naturally through observation - the director, Joshua Oppenheimer meets several gangsters/paramilitary-men, who latter (together) decide to make a film, which will reenact the murders committed; while Oppenheimer, Cynn &amp; Anonymous document the progress of the creation, the stories associated with it and the men themselves - their reactions on what they do and have done, their opinions and lifestyles.It is hard to discern the film - the viewer takes a subjective point of view, as the content is highly multi-interpretational, even though this is a documentary about reality. That's what makes the film powerful and important. Without knowing a lot about the matter, we suddenly delve into complex perspectives that are filmed through a cold yet natural lens. But at the same time, the director does engage into the lives of the people - it's as if the fact that a documentary is made, provokes these men to think about what they do and did, to then tell that to the director.This matter, of a film within a film and the conflict of letting the men speak for themselves, yet being influenced by biases, is only a primal thing. The viewer is directly affected by doubt as he has to discern for himself what is true, false and neither. Epistemological problems overlook the whole of the film and that emphasizes the complexity of the content we are about to watch, and that's precisely why this is a wise observation, to which we have to relate with a point of view in one way or another, or yet another.As the film follows the men, we discover it's about many universal themes. First of all there are moral questions to pose - and for me this is the absolute best film about atrocities, like mass murder - the acts of killings. Ethical problems are the core of the film and another powerful aspect of this masterpiece, is how our actions (here we need to look and decide, if they were "good", "bad" or "neither") affect our lifestyles and the long, different, contradictory and transcending ranges of human emotions. States that are seen and dealt with here are enjoyment, suffering, guilt, shame, anger, delusion, courage, contempt, trust and different ways of achieving happiness and freedom. What the film also deals with is the lack of all that, which is what should puzzle the viewer and make him think. The viewer is also affected by how he has to feel about the people and stories here - which moral decisions he should make and what empathy he should give to the content - either consciously or unconsciously.Other themes this film excellently looks at are different socio-cultural systems (the government, military, paramilitary, gangsters, class struggles, wealth, elections, consumerism, differences now and then, propaganda, organization), the pettiness of big ideas which are simply delusions, the emerge of those systems; filmmaking and the process of recreation/creation; the causes, proceedings, festivity of performing cruelty (the act of killing) and simply all the stories and people involved.Moreover, like I said, over all this film deals with, the viewer is asked, what is true, false and neither in what we see here; are the speeches and dialogues honest, dishonest or neither. (Spoilers:) Apparently Oppenheimer himself controversially said that the infamous gaging/vomiting scene by Anwar Congo is faked, only acted. And we need to look for ourselves, in the expressions of the actors and the information they communicate, for clues, to establish what is true, fake or neither in everything we see. Perhaps there is no answer?This is what I mean by that the film is complex and deals with universal themes. It is a compulsive viewing and certainly holds up on rewatches. It's subversive, daring, wise and beautiful in its own way. I recommend viewing the Extended/Director's Cut. I would also mention that this works as a companion piece to 'Heart of Darkness' and 'Apocalypse Now'.Highly Recommended 9++/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealistic portrait of mass murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some years ago I met a view relatives of victims of the killings in 65 in Indonesia and I was amazed by the fact that so many people never heard of this genocide that took place. Especially here in the Netherlands where we are still talking about the struggle against the Dutch in the 50s while in 65 one of the largest mass murder took place! This film is not just a documentary but it's a very original way of letting the murderers talk about what they did in those years and how they were caught in participating in these horrific killings. It's like if letting old SS men talk about about their acts in the concentration camps without restrictions or condemnations. Mr Oppenheimer made a brilliant live doc through which people can learn what happened in those years and how this affects contemporary Indonesia. Although the movie depicts a heavy subject, it's quite light to watch even funny sometimes and it gives a very realistic idea seen from the eyes of the killers themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few of my thoughts on The Act of Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished the extended version of the documentary and felt i had to come straight here and give my thoughts on the film, only to find myself completely speechless. I wanted to talk about whether or not Anwar was sincere in his seemingly growing remorse in the second half of the film. His frequent mentioning of his love for the violent western films his cinema was showing and open admittance that some of his methods of killing were directly influenced by them, gave him an almost child-like quality.That final dry-heaving scene was powerful and tough to watch, but was it really sincere? Was he just as much a victim as the people he killed? One of the most shocking things is that the people that gave him the orders are still in power today. What's even more shocking is the extent of the western world's political influence. Where is the line? This film affected me very deeply and despite it's grimness, I will be watching it again, but not for a long time. This one is not an easy watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful documentary that evolves with the subject and wakes people up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always interested in documentary but this one is different. Instead of straightly recording what happened and offering insights/analysis, it asks interviewees to redo something they have done almost 50 years ago. In 1965, a million Indonesians were (mass) slaughtered by paramilitary in the name of being communists or being Chinese after the military took power. These more than 10,000 murderers are still around and hold prominent positions all over the country, with the survivors living close to them. This movie concentrates on a few killers in the form of making a movie of what they did half a century ago. It is quite disturbing when you see the murderers laughing and bragging about what they did and as I watched it, I kept relating the lies and twists these people told and the lies some Hong Kong people are telling in view of the occupation for democracy here in Hong Kong.As director Joshua Oppenheimer shot this documentary, he made sure his subjects know that he is making a documentary on how they star themselves in a movie that depicts the history that they are so proud of. Or are they? Seven and a half years in the making, the director built a lot of trust with these people and we see how they, or at least Anwar Congo, have evolved from being boastful to being confused, or reflecting and for the first time in a few decades, tried to step into the shoes of their victims and feel how they have felt. In some ways it was like the Stanford Prison Experiment by Dr Philip Zimbardo, except the role playing this time is either replaying the killers own roles or change sides. As I was watching the violent scene I was really worried that it may get out of hand. On the other hand, for some brief moments it was almost like a therapy sessions too, through role playing. But mind you, all the descriptions and reenactment of torture scenes are quite disturbing to watch, even though they are told in a light hearted way (maybe that's why it is even more revolting) and we know that it is only an act. As the film goes along, you really wonder why some people would do such things to others, and they can still live with it now! For movie fan Anwar, his rationalization is that he believes himself to be some sort of movie hero. That ways he can shake off some of the guilt. But perhaps it is not easy living with impunity ? that's why Anwar always has nightmares and has to dance or take drugs to forget. Yet there are others like Adi who refuses to cooperate and insists that history is written by the winners so he can write whatever he likes ? including lies. This is when I try to link it with the craziness going on in Hong Kong right now ? that what the government officials, police, and anti- occupy people are saying just defy basic human sense. But then as the movie goes along, it also shows even these twisted people have their human side ?Anwar teaches her grandsons to treat the duck nicely and apologize to them. Adi goes shopping with her family like any other normal family. Gradually it becomes interesting when Anwar begins to feel like his victims when he acts in a scene of being tortured. He is quite shocked and stunned and he has to pause. He cries after watching this scene even though he tells his grandsons it is only a movie. We hear Joshua says in the background that for him it maybe a movie but for the people he killed, it was real. The ending was powerful as we see him going to the place where he killed many people. We saw this roof before in the beginning of the movie. Except this time, something drastic happens, as if all the unpleasant feelings trapped for half a century in his body and mind finally gets a chance to vent. I admire the Anwar's honesty in facing himself ? especially when he is fully aware that he will be exposing a very dark side of him ? in front of the world, including surviving relatives of the people he killed. Perhaps to him, it is a way to come to terms of his own misdeeds and thus redemption.It is encouraging to hear that this movie has woken up many people in Indonesia and people who have been timid in talking about it is now empowered to tell their stories. I look forward to the second documentary when the survivors confront the killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way this was done was quite unconventional, but it provided an incredible insight into the minds of men who seem to vacillate between feeling tortured about what they did and being proud of it. I found it profoundly disturbing to watch at times. It's certainly not a documentary in the ordinary sense of the word, with no real narration, and no overt point being put forward. They just allow these men to portray things the way they want to, and you are left to make your own impressions of it all. I found my head shaking in disgust at some of the people in this movie at times, the casual way they described torturing and killing their victims was chilling to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer ? This review is for the Directors Cut of the film which has a runtime of 150 plus minutes compared to the 122 minute U.S Theatrical Cut.Truly unlike anything you're likely to have ever seen before (not surprising considering Werner Herzog is one of the producers) Joshua Oppenheimer's quite frankly confronting and disturbing documentary The Act of Killing is an examination of Indonesian death squad members that from the outset takes a turn into the surreal and never comes back from it creating a movie that you have to keep reminding yourself is real and a movie that will not be easily forgotten by those that see it.The focus of The Act of Killing is on that of Anwar Congo a man who has become a celebrity in his own right for his works as a glorified murderer of roughly 1000 so called communists and Chinese immigrants in Indonesia is the political turmoil of the 1960's. Listening to Anwar speak about his time doing these deeds is eye opening and horrifying but seeing how others treat him as a man who did great works is equal of not worse to it. Oppenheimer captures Anwar in some at times amazing fashions and a star of the doco is Anwar's right hand man Herman who could easily have a documentary made on him. The two men's friendship is one of the strangest ever seen on the silver screen and what they come up with when Oppenheimer gives them the chance to make a film on the death squads the film enters a whole different level.Giving the subject's free reign to portray there version of events in the film was a masterstroke by Oppenheimer and is what makes The Act of Killing such a transcendent documentary that is now the front runner for this year's Academy Award in that category. Anwar with help from Herman recreates scenes from his favourite movies such as lavish musicals, gangster films and westerns all the while unearthing some deeper issues inside him that before the process had been repressed. These recreations are nothing short of surreal but for some strange reason work perfectly within the subject matter.At every turn The Act of Killing surprises, shocks and engages us in shocking acts of human behaviour from brazenly bribing struggling businesses, men talking about taking a human life (Anwar's favouritism of wire is particularly scary) or a re-enactment of a village raid are just some of the horrifying scenarios the movie has. Culminating in one of the most raw and realistic displays of human emotion Act of Killing is a stunning movie that while slightly overlong is a must see if not easy to watch documentary well deserving of all the plaudits.4 short lived political ventures out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curiously horrifying film that feeds on itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actual Indonesian title of this film translates, appropriately enough, as "Butcher." The main characters are Anwar Congo, Herman Koto, and Adi Zulkadry. Anwar and Adi are former mass murderers who were personally responsible for killing over 1000 people. They are both very proud of their murder of many communists during the 1965-1966 Indonesian purges. One of their main inspirations was the violence they saw portrayed in Hollywood films of the 1960s. It is evident that they are very flattered by the chance to re-enact their crimes against humanity for the cameras of American documentarian Joshua Oppenheimer. These men and most of their cronies who also appear in the film are bizarre parodies of themselves. They live up to every comical stereotype that any western mind could imagine about people from Indonesia, except what they are doing is as horrifying as it is absurd. They come across very much as savages pretending to be civilized, mimicking what they see as cool from western culture in a grotesque cabaret of genocidal anecdotes.Anwar and Herman go to great lengths to dramatize the mass-killings they are so proud of as a matter of their national history and heritage. They seem to think that the filmmakers actually share their esteem and enthusiasm for the events they are so eager to present to his camera in dramatic re-enactments. This is a key element that pervades the entire film; these men are being exploited and ridiculed, but they are more than happy to collaborate in their own humiliation and public denunciation for their crimes. They refer to Oppenheimer as "Josh" in a very friendly and conspiratorial manner throughout the film. One never knows whether to laugh or be awe-struck and horrified as the film progresses. It is difficult to understand whether they are actually great fools or merely compulsively performing to achieve some measure of catharsis for their guilt.Anwar repeatedly confesses that he is haunted by the specters of those he murdered. His conscience does not allow him to sleep, and he actually sometimes sees apparitions of his victims. This is another key element of the film; Anwar's journey from arrogance and pride to intense remorse, guilt, and abhorrence of himself for his crimes. In a pivotal set of scenes, Anwar volunteers to portray one of his own victims, who is beheaded and eviscerated by Herman Koto in a series of tableaux. As Anwar's torso is gradually dissected by Herman as his disembodied head watches from atop a nearby boulder, Herman taunts his head, laughing as he tries to force the head to eat organ parts from the torso. Anwar is noticeably nauseated and oppressed by horror and guilt over what he realizes he has done and over what he has become; a monster!It is impossible to not to feel some sense of pity for Anwar, since it becomes very clear that he has been duped into becoming what he beheld. The violent western culture that was exported to his country became his inspiration for enthusiastically embracing a systematic extermination of human beings who were designated as enemies by his government and their anti-communist western supporters, and thus marked for mass execution. Anwar's story is like "Goodfellahs" on steroids!Is there any possibility of repentance or redemption for Anwar and his friends after what they did? This is a hard question to answer. Only God Himself can say.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is stranger than the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the filmmakers of "The Act of Killing" are some of the bravest people I can think of. The fact that they were capturing the confessions of mass murderers in the place where those murders are still celebrated to this day is mindboggleing. I knew they survived to finish the film, but I was in fear for them all the same as I waited for one the elder killers to suddenly realize where all the work might go and decide that burying the film and it's crew might be a better idea. And the ex-hit squad guys would have never been bothered about it again. The film is experimental as well as "experiencial". What better way to learn about a hit squad than to find some of its members and get them to act out some of their murders? One thing i am glad to relate, there are no pictures of the dead. Scenes with blood and violence are all seen as be part of the film making process, we are shown none of it is real, however real the reactions of the amateur actors are. Nevertheless, a lot of the re-enactments very disturbing in themselves and very disturbing for the main actor, who did the real killing. The other hit men still feel justified. One seemed to long for the old days. The detractors of the film see it as a glorification or as therapy of some sort for the killers. I don't see that at all. Instead of pointing fingers at these men and saying, "he did this and he did that", the film makers point a camera at the killers and ask, "How did you do it?" and invite them to write the a movie about it. Some of the killers script ideas are as incomprehensible and bizarre and absolutely haunting as anything you can ever hope to see in a film. But we also see them in their own lives, see who they are at the time the film was made. Are they monsters? Are they single minded brutes? No, they are men, like other men. And it doesn't take much of a push for man to kill a man. A few labels, a lot of shouting and the unification that hatred creates, and ordinary men start doing hideous things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mind Boggling View of Human Nature and the "Act" of Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in awhile comes a film that leaves you more confused about the world before you began watching it. The Act of Killing is definitely that film. After just finish watching this unsettling documentary it calls to mind a quote from horror icon Tom Savini "The human mind is more capable of creating hideous horrors than anything I could ever make"... and rightly so. In this boundary pushing film, Joshua Oppenheimer really puts the method of in the "eye of the beholder" literally to work in allowing Indonesian executioners to recreate their crimes in the mass killing of supposed "communist" in which ever film genre they see fit.That premise alone is shocking enough.As we follow Oppenheimer and his film crew into the disturbed and insensitive mind of these killers, you can't help but be completely jarred by how candid and nonchalant they are in revealing their sins to the camera. Some of their statements were so sicken, I'm not even going to quote them particularly in reference to the Pacisilia village massacre scene. From the theatrical numbers, cross dressing, film noir torture sequences and Westernized ideals of power coupled with delusions of grandeur and insanity.The Act of Killing boldly asks the questions that people for decades have ponder since the atrocities of the Holocaust, Nanking Massacre and the Khmer Rouge. Though its not completely answered, it does prove that some individuals can rationalize anything.Anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets" Voltaire The above quote, appearing in The Act of Killing before the titles, permeates one of the strangest and most disturbing documentaries you will ever see. I'm not recommending it for faint-hearted liberals because its non-bloody violence is disturbing to the core of what we are as human beings.After the slaughter of more than a million communists in the wake of the1965 military coup in Indonesia, directors Josh Oppenheimer and Christine Cynn frame a compelling doc around two flamboyant thugs, Anwar Congo and Herman Koto. They gleefully re-enact their murder scenes sometimes imitating gangbanger brio from American noir cinema. Congo dresses like a 1970's B-movie gangster while seeming to channel Nelson Mandela's demeanor, and Koto, cross-dresses in garish colors with chilling detachment.Surreal it is: These two operatives glory in their achievement over 40 years ago, and the extras surrounding them verify their rock-star status. Try not to be disgusted.To the directors' considerable credit, they refrain from intruding in the grim reality that these thugs have outrun Nemesis and have attained a perverted glory. The artful element is running a "film" motif throughout, i.e., the heroes re-enact scenes revealing the influence of gangster movies as they torture and murder. The directors let us see the sadistic pleasure the protagonists take imitating American crime movies.A recurring abandoned fish-shaped restaurant with dancing girls spilling out of its mouth not only certifies the bizarre quality of this doc but also serves as a leitmotif that anything goes when murder is an unapologetic complement to a noxious time in history.The enraptured host of a talk show on Televisi Republik Indonesia interviewing the two "stars" serves herself as surrogate for the fawning public that allowed, indeed encouraged, the barbarisms against suspected "communists." The gangster theme handily allows us to see at least one influence on unrepentant murderers. Yet, the ending, not manipulated by the directors, shows the delayed disgust Congo feels for himself as he retches while visiting the killing field so long ago.Don't see The Act of Killing if you want your stories tied up neatly where the bad guys are duly punished. But if you want a hint of motivation for grand masters of genocide such as Hitler and Stalin, then see The Act of Killing as a help in understanding the complexity of horror sanctioned by the state and its meanest citizens."Exterminate all the brutes."

		<fullReview>"The Act of Killing" serves as a powerful medium for a bold historical reckoning - an act of recreation to confront a legacy created by means of genocide. In Indonesia between 1965 and 1966, following a failed coup attempt against the Sukharno government, the military and paramilitary groups killed over a million people in a bloody purge of suspected communists. These executions were not carried out by government officials, but by death squads consisting of local gangsters. No one responsible for these war crimes has ever been made to answer for these atrocities. Director Joshua Oppenheimer's attempt to tell the full story by interviewing surviving family members and friends is simply not possible, so he craftily turns the table on the repressive dictatorship by actually working with the oppressors. Rather than just interview his subjects about the blood on their hands, Oppenheimer and his co-directors employ an unconventional approach by allowing these men to re-stage their former exploits for the big screen. "The Act of Killing" picks up in present time and places the camera on several of these gangsters who walk openly among the descendants of their victims, revered as national heroes. It's here where Oppenheimer encounters his central figure Anwar Congo, a man who has killed an estimated one thousand people, and is quite happy to tell you all about it whether the camera is rolling or not. The film initially appears as a standard documentary focusing on a unique perspective of a past atrocity. However, as it unfolds, it becomes much more than that, and it is hard to say how the individual viewer will react. Oppenheimer and editors skillfully construct sequences of the re-enactment footage and outtakes, magnifying his subjects' blatant immorality for all to see front and center. The end result provides a cinematic experience that allows the criminals to indict themselves in a way that their accusers never could. As the movie progresses, Anwar begins to question for the first time whether he has sinned, and appears troubled by his victims' suffering with recurring and intensifying moments of regret. For the final sequence, Anwar and Oppenheimer revisit the rooftop where Anwar committed most of his murders, and it is a stunning and unforgettable final scene. What begs the question however is just how genuine is this truly shocking moment captured on film, or is this simply a charismatic performance for the cameras? There is an unexpected arc that occurs within Anwar Congo, which will perhaps help some viewers believe again in the basic decency of human beings. That being said, it's a far cry from softening the films distressingly grim impact.</fullReview>

However, after witnessing this monumental achievement, I felt compelled too, in the hope of persuading anyone who might be undecided, to please watch The Act Of Killing. I've seen plenty of documentaries that I'd describe as powerful but this one tops the list. Without going into too much detail, the film is a sobering, often shocking and brutal exploration of the consequences of state sponsored slaughter on the victims, perpetrators and society that allowed it to occur. The subject matter makes this film challenging to watch at times but it's the genius of Joshua Oppenheimer's approach that shines through. Inventive, thought-provoking and most importantly... REAL.

		<shortDescription>One-Note Documentary about Indonesian Genocide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ACT OF KILLING takes as its reference-point the killings in Indonesia during the mid-Sixties, when thousands of alleged "Communists" were butchered by pro-government forces as well as groups of gangsters working on the government's behalf.Nearly half a century later director Joshua Oppenheimer confronts some of those involved in that genocide, most of them now gray- haired old men, or middle aged men with paunches, and invites them to re-enact the killings in any way they choose, using intertexts drawn from Hollywood movies - westerns, melodramas, and the like - as well as their own first-hand memories.The result is a documentary that means to shock; to dramatize the sheer horror of the events, compared to the complacent ways in which the executioners recall what happened. Although one of them, Anwar Congo, admits to having sleepless nights as a result, it's clear that he still enjoys the company of his fellow-gangsters and the male bonding rituals keeping them together.As with many documentaries dealing with traumatic events, THE ACT OF KILLING seems too over-manipulative, almost as if Oppenheimer were deliberately playing with his subjects in the hope of making them "confess" to their sins. Things don't work like that - as other documentaries focusing on other genocides (for example, in Nazi Germany) have shown, the perpetrators often feel that what they did at the time was right, in the interests of their country's future, and find it difficult to alter their opinions. This is not to condone their actions, but nonetheless we have to try and understand why they did what they did. This is what THE ACT OF KILLING fails to address.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Act of Killing Joshua Oppenheimer and his colleagues deal with the massacre in Indonesia. But this is not a documentary, like any other, where people on one side or the other, and often both, sitting in chairs and speaking into the camera. This is something much more absurd and surreal. And that moving Surrealism. The main person in this "project" is Anwar Congo, now an amiable old man, a former gangster, paramilitary and executioner responsible for the deaths of at least a thousand people (by his own admission). He will need to use your gangster film collaborator with Herman Kota, jolly fat man who has a tendency to change into women's clothing (among other things) and playing various roles, and some of your colleagues, neighbors and friends. It should be noted that none of those involved in crimes not fit even after the change of regime at the end of the 90s, to no regrets, that the nightmares of PTSD interpreted as meaning "weak mind" and that these people live largely peaceful, comfortable lives, some far from the public eye, and some are still very close to the state apparatus.</fullReview>

It does so and it takes revenge for all of these millions of innocent people died when the main character is infected with guilt in the last frames while in the first frames he was just proud of his life. No jury, no history, no human did that. Only a film managed to do it. Only for this, it is a masterpiece that has to be seen from anybody.

		<fullReview>I got to know of this movie when reading about the follow up documentary dealing with the victims of the mass murder in Indonesia. As other review already summarized the background for the movie i will try to focus more on its importance and meaning. I sometimes wonder why i watch these movies like "Waltz with bashir", "Incendies", "Shooting Dogs" or "Shindlers List". All these movies deeply dive into the human soul and show how easy any human can commit the worst atrocities. It doesn't matter what color your skin is, how civilized your society is or what religion you belong to, nearly every spot on this god ridden planet is drenched in blood and has its own share of violence. This movie has a different drive though as its not about the victims or staged by actors. These are the real killers talking and japing life on camera and reenact their deeds. They get kind of tricked into thinking this movie will somewhat redeem them or they are met with same understanding as most of their countrymen show towards them. Sometimes they are worried that the movie show them in a bad light but after a short moment of doubt they return to smiles. The hardest to stomach is sometimes how these people seem to be kind people feeding little ducklings or one guy trying to calm his weeping daughter and next moment you see them telling you how to crush people skulls or behead someone. I put one point of the rating as i didn't understand the dancing scenes and why the fat gangster always was in woman clothes even when they reenacted some killing scenes. Also i feel sometimes you could have tightened the narrative a bit more to make it a bit shorter. I got a huge problem with the fact that countries don't try to work through their bloody history, Germany sure could have done better but at least they did for the most parts. But countries like Spain (Franco), Russia (Stalin),China (Mao) Japan (WWII Genocides), Indonesia here and many more can be found who silence anyone who will speak up or which history books tell straight out lies or play down the numbers. In Indonesia its a hard case, the history not only gets twisted, the killers from back then live a good life, benefiting from their deeds. They get invited to big paramilitary rallies, TV shows and people laugh with them when they retell their stories and how they crushed all communists. And this goes on till today as you can see how they collect money from Chinese merchants and threaten them in front of the camera. Some victim of the follow up movie had to move cause he got death threats for taking part in it. This movie should be a big warning sign how you have to approach countries who deal that way with their history, of course you cant condemn everybody in this country but you should keep it in the back of your head. Also it shows how easy people are deceived, they maybe know in the back of their minds that its wrong what they are doing but if they are given an easy way out by the society and government (anti communist propaganda, Chinese prejudices) they will happily continue killing people. So if your countries trys to gather hate on certain groups, be the one to stand in its way, the people are strong united, if everyone turns away in fear nobody will find the courage to stand in the way of control. You don't even have to like or know that group that is targeted just think about what if it was you? Sooner or later hateful words wont be the only thing and some sadists will take it into their hand to end the "problem". Remember movies like that and don't remain silent cause me personally would rather be beaten to a pulp instead of living with the shame of watching the other way when innocent people get tortured or murdered in my neighborhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most chocking and perfect documentaries of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joshua Oppenheimers "The Act of Killing" is an experience unlike anything I have ever witnessed before. Its a tour de force of emotions, guilt, evil and redemption. It grabs your heart and punches you in the stomach in a way no other documentary has ever done.Oppenheimer goes to Indonesia to interview some of the leaders of the death squads that were responsible for millions of deaths during the purge of 1965. He find them as aging men with powerful positions in the society they help to shape with violence and brutality that makes you question the very essence of mans capabilities. We meet Anwar Congo. Film lover, fashionista and loving grandpa. And responsible for killing more than 1000 people by himself during the purge. Anwar is viewed as a hero by the people of his community and he has never been brought to consider that what he did was murder. Oppenheimer challenge Anwar Congo and some of friends to recreate some of their killings to make a movie and during the filming, Anwar transforms. He begins to realize that what he did MIGHT have been wrong. Its a heartwarming transformation and a human being is born. The documentary challenges the conventions of the genre and has become the new benchmark for how you can tell a story of such magnitude and complications. You can't afford to miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Disturbing Original Documentary Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Act of Killing" is one of those few documentaries that you can watch once (and most who see it will prefer to watch only once) and never, ever forget. It is the best, most powerful, and one of the most unique documentaries I've seen this decade, and maybe in the 21st century.In Indonesia in 1964 &amp; 65 occurred what can only be called a genocide of presumed communist communities, caused by death squads which were at least tacitly backed by the West. Nearly fifty years later a number of those who participated in massacres of unthinkable horror talk about what they did. It's truly unsettling what they describe, in the form of beatings, strangulations, be-headings, rape and other forms of sick barbarities. But what's arguably more disturbing is the casual way these abhorrent crimes are talked about, and the lack of repulsion or remorse by many about what occurred, partially due to the fact there's little risk anyone will be punished for it, ever. Millions in the country still celebrate the military style rule of the time, they serve in elected office, and have propaganda talk shows to congratulate themselves (though many I'm sure also have little idea about this dark chapter in their country's history).The filmmakers here did something pretty brilliant, which probably produced more insight and history than any number of hours of interviews would have: they ask those who participated to reenact violent scenes of what happened during those purges. And these former thugs (they often proudly refer to themselves as "gangsters") are only too happy to oblige, putting in surprising effort to accomplish the cinematics. The scenes they act out, with some "Hollywood" stylization, range from darkly comical in a few instances, to absolutely grotesque and very hard to watch. Seeing them act out scenes they presumably partook in is chilling, but it's also where we see some humanity come out: in a few scenes the emotion of certain "actors" is overwhelming. As cold as these people might seem to the pain they've caused, no one deals with the situation in exactly the same way. And it all comes to an ending scene which will be etched in my mind probably as long as I'm alive. "The Act of Killing," tough watch as it is, needs to be seen, both for its important history on an under-reported atrocity of the 20th century, and for what it says about us as a people when we lose our soul and convince ourselves the worst acts are justified.I find it both interesting and a little pointless that they've now released a director's cut version that's a half hour longer. I have to think that version must be either for film students, historians, or for masochists. I won't sugarcoat it, this is one of the most grueling, uncomfortable movie experiences I've ever had in a long time. I'm glad I've had it, and I'm of no two minds in calling this film a masterpiece, but enduring an extended version is not something I plan on partaking anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the purpose of this documentary is to expose their killings. In the documentary you see how they executed people and how they feel/think about it, and they don't seem to happy with their past. It's coming back to haunt them. The main people in this documentary think that they are making a movie and are going to be stars. It took place in Indonesia and they're just reenacting how they ended thousands of lives. I enjoyed the documentary just it was hard to understand what was really happening. It surprised me because I didn't expect them to feel guilty and pain because of it, i thought they were just monsters. I would recommend this documentary to people and I might watch it again to fully understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I was slowly losing my grip in keeping up with the film's main idea since the flow of the story takes you to a never ending maze of the characters on the loop explicit story telling on how they get pleasure from killing the "communists". I kept on looking for the reason on why they would cast such brutality on their victims, but the other side of the story was nonexistent. As the film rolls its way to the ending, it keeps getting better as we were able to witness the core of the story, which was Anwar Congo unexpectedly took turn on the opposite fall of emotion which was "Guilt". Truth is, I wasn't really expecting that after everything he has cast on his victims would stir a dash of guilt inside his heart. Talking as an ultimate fan of films with a little twist in ending, it surprised me since I didn't see that moment coming. If you were watching closely, at the beginning, Anwar Congo confidently narrated and even acted the scenes of his past bloody executions. It was hard to see through his mind whether he has a humanity left in him. I think that was the "surprising" flavored filling of the film. I would give this film 6.5 out of 10. I think Joshua Oppenheimer is brilliant and brave for choosing a challenging concept. Even though the film wasn't able to get back their budget, it was still a success in getting its viewers jaw drop for every chilling moment and the death squad's hyper realistic brutal reenactment of their previous executions. The part where Joshua Oppenheimer let his subject take the wheel and make the film in any way they want is a brave move. The film could be a disaster without a goal of flow but the film turned out quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is Forbidden to Kill unless you are hired by the Government</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Act of Killing, one of the nominees for Best Documentary in 2013, may be the strangest film I have ever seen.It is repulsive but fascinating, nauseating but a rare look at the honest confessions of stone cold killers. In 1965, the Indonesian government was overthrown by the military. Anyone opposed to the dictatorship was labeled a communist. With the assistance of western governments, more than 500,000 up to 1,000,000, people were murdered by the military. An accusation that a person was a Communist was itself a death sentence.To carry out the killings, the military recruited thugs and gangsters. The genocide, one of the worst mass murders of the 20th Century, was never punished and is not mentioned in text books. The current dictator President Suharto rose to power as a result of purge of Communists in the country, and owes his place in the world to the bloody work of these killers.The documentary film makes clear that there were no fine distinction made about who was or was not a Communist. The killing was indiscriminate. One of the killers was Anwar Congo, now a white-haired grandfather, who has some charisma but who admits to killing as many as 1,000 people by various methods. He cut off heads, strangled people, ran over them in cars, sliced up people, chopped up bodies, etc.Herman Koto, also a murdering thug, is one of the weirdest characters ever filmed. A fat somewhat jovial man, he reminisces about raping women. He refers to 14-year-old girls he raped and killed as "delicious." He is depicted in drag, wearing outlandish colors and make-up. The premise is also odd. As the killings do not carry any legal penalties, the film project is being undertaken to depict the murdering of the masses as some sort of heroic endeavor. Congo and Koto are enthusiastic about doing the film, and they describe their participation in horror without a trace of concern about the legal consequences.As the story unfolds, Congo begins to experience something like remorse. At one time he asks: "Did I sin?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War crimes are for suckers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to add a few words to the many excellent reviews of this tremendous documentary. Like many others I've watched numerous documentaries but none as captivating as this one. By making them believe it was a movie, the re-enactment allowed the main actors to be completely uninhibited in describing their crimes. I don't think any other approach would've derived the same self confessions. Secondly these men are upheld as heroes in their society and hold no fear of ever facing justice for their crimes.One point I'd like to clarify among the reviews is that the victims are alleged "communists". Even Anwar and his cohorts admitted torturing them into confessions before dispatching them. Plus they also perpetrated ethnic cleansing of Chinese without finding out the victims political leanings aka "kill your girlfriend's dad day". Finally another reviewer mentioned a religious inspiration of these thugs for which there was none.I've paraphrased Adi's words here that "war crimes are for suckers"; the only thing that matters is whose side you're doing the killing for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Real Meets the Surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary that challenges former Indonesian death squad leaders to reenact their real-life mass-killings in whichever cinematic genres they wish, including classic Hollywood crime scenarios and lavish musical numbers.While the film does lack a bit of historical context (I suspect few Americans know about 1960s Indonesia, Sukarno or Suharto) this is not the point, and that minor criticism can be overlooked. If anything, hopefully this encourages people to look into that time more and learn a few things about this crazy world of ours.The men featured in this film are a strange lot, arguing that their country suffers from "too much democracy", as they reflect on the days when life was allegedly better under military rule. Constitutional amendments were passed in the late 1990s that effectively ended any sort of dictatorship.The primary focus is on Anwar Congo, a "movie theater gangster" who is revered as a founding father of the right-wing paramilitary organization Pemuda Pancasila that grew out of the death squads. If anyone is said to be positively affected by this whole experience, it is Anwar. How sincere or remorseful he truly is only Anwar himself knows, but he does finally seem to come to the realization that he is a mass murderer with an ocean of blood on his hands.He is sadly the minority. While the general population "gets it" that death squads are probably not right (with one television producer pondering out loud about how he can sleep), the bulk of the former killers are more than happy to make humorous skits and songs about their exploits. With colorful costumes, dancers, beheaded dummies and simulated cannibalism, they gleefully tell the cameras how they killed their victims. This may be the first surreal documentary, putting even Bunuel and Dali to shame.Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Chris Hedges called the film "an important exploration of the complex psychology of mass murderers" and that "it is not the demonized, easily digestible caricature of a mass murderer that most disturbs us. It is the human being." He is on to something here, as these men never come across as "evil", but merely numb or oblivious. While "human" and "humane" may be similar, there is nothing intrinsically necessary about their connection.In her famous book "The Banality of Evil", philosopher Hannah Arendt argued that the great evils in history generally, and the Holocaust in particular, were not executed by fanatics or sociopaths, but by ordinary people who accepted the premises of their state and therefore participated with the view that their actions were normal. If she were alive to see this documentary, she would see her beliefs proved beyond a shadow of a doubt.Is this the best documentary of 2013? Probably. While not as timely as "The Square" or "Dirty Wars", it says more about the human condition than most films ever could. To know that these men are the same as we are, only different by the pure chance of where and when they were born, is a terrifying prospect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review on this remarkable documentary The Act of Killing. Is it crazy for one person to be feared by a whole country? Would you celebrate and joke if someone killed 2.5 million people and didn't get punished? I want to first start off by saying this is a very unreal feeling when you watch this. I personally think that all people should be entitled to their own thinking and their own beliefs. When I watched this I was thinking I was just going to see someone telling the story of some type of pain they had endured during a war. I was surprised that death squads can kill about 2.5 million people with their bare hands. I also think it is insane that the government will make someone hold there tongue against their will making everyone scared to speak up knowing that they may be killed for their opinion. The bad part about this documentary was that at times it was hard to keep up because of the captions. The filming was very good. There were a lot of shockers in this film and it will have you gasping every few seconds. I'm glad that the director Helped Anwar Congo come to his senses and realizes that what he did was wrong and I hope he gets help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important and powerful film that offers new perspectives on movie violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about The Act Of Killing when it was making its festival rounds in 2012 and from the way it was described to me it felt like a mythic underground film that altered the perspective of its viewers forever. Like a fierce minotaur in the maze. It sounded gruesome and odd but powerful. I simply couldn't imagine what the film was going to be like until the moment I started watching it. Now the word-of-mouth bolder has steamrolled to an Oscar nomination and I've finally watched it. Like everyone else it turned my stomach. The demeanour of these men still in power is haunting. Their pride is truly chilling. The Act Of Killing offers a new perspective on movie violence. It's a case of life imitating art, then imitating art again as ethical questions on how to represent violent acts in film are brought up. Today we get a barrage of controversy in the news where acts of violence were inspired by video games and movies but this film readily admits it. It's something I passed off as just finding something to blame but the way in which American pop culture is plastered all over Indonesia opens our eyes on the responsibility of mainstream filmmaking.Although the approach is extraordinary the execution can be strange at times. It's often slow and repetitive with poor camera-work for the most part, but its ideas prevail. It's best in the reflective moments where the subjects watch back the footage we've just seen and study the way they've been represented and then share their thoughts. It's very satisfying if sickening in the end to see them get a taste of their own medicine, but I don't think that's justice enough. As they say, history is written by the winners. It desperately needs another draft. The Act Of Killing is profound and daring, if not enjoyable in the slightest. There could have been an even better film in there somewhere with a more consistent and engaging edit (I can't imagine the director's cut being any leaner than the 2 hour version I saw). It's certainly one of the most powerful and important documentaries of the last few years which can be forgiven for being so rough around the edges. The sentimentalist in me prefers 20 Feet From Stardom and perhaps Blackfish from this year's documentaries though.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I Had To Kill... My Conscience Told Me They Had To Be Killed."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is unlike any documentary or movie we've seen before. It is a haunting glimpse into the Indonesian history when the nation's notorious death squads massacred millions of people in 1965-66 under the leadership of Anwar Congo &amp; Adi Zulkadry and what the filmmakers have achieved here is something very bold &amp; daring. In the center of this story we have Anwar Congo, the leader of the notorious death squad who himself strangled thousands of suspected communists to their deaths, and when the filmmakers asked him &amp; his allies about their opinions &amp; to re-enact the manner in which they performed these killings, Anwar &amp; his partners-in-crime go ahead boasting about what they did with little or no remorse for the major part of the film.There are disturbing moments in the film where so many of us will be left wondering just how they can live with themselves without remorse or guilt for the massacre they carried out. What's even more upsetting is that these crimes remain unpunished &amp; the government plus society that rose from this regime continue to be in their support as well. However, there is one moment in the film where we see Anwar finally feeling the guilt as in the beginning he was excitingly boasting about how he killed so many people by strangling them with wire but near the end, he gets to taste a bit of his own medicine while re-enacting the scene which leaves him perplexed over what he has done.On an overall scale, The Act of Killing is absolutely raw, depressing &amp; emotionally moving documentation that must be seen by everyone whether in the end they like it or not. It brings on film canvas a history involving the crimes against humanity that never went under the scanner for investigation. Also, whatever rose from that regime continues to revel in Indonesia today &amp; the film also cleverly captures the corruption &amp; impunity that exists in the current system. How the filmmakers managed to get away from this is another mystery. In short, a powerful, evocative &amp; haunting documentary that's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staggering, jaw-dropping and quite surreal. You will never have seen a documentary quite like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary maker travels to Indonesia to meet a group of elderly men who led some of the notorious death-squad anti-communist purges in the 1960s. They were once small-time gangsters, who took advantage of the corrupt regime following a failed coup and became terrifying warlords; extorting from, raping or brutally murdering thousands. They have never been held accountable, and what is more, as the documentary progresses it becomes clear that they are minor celebrities still, admired seemingly by some, evidently feared by many others, and utterly brazen in their boasting of what they did.Co-director Joshua Oppenheimer invites them to go beyond telling the stories of their atrocities, but to actually re-enact them for the cameras as mini-movies in the style of their choosing. An idea to which these elderly monsters, deluded by their own distorted egos and immunity from prosecution for their crimes, eagerly take. What then follows is simultaneously terrifying and absurd beyond belief as they rally locals as extras, and get into the mechanics of script meetings, location scouting, and marshaling the required production forces, while practicing their best strangulation and torture techniques on each other. One later proudly shows off the raw footage to his young grandchildren. Another, perhaps gradually and dimly comprehending the horrors he perpetrated for the first time, cuts a pathetic, tragic figure, literally chocking on the evil that is consuming him from within. I doubt there was a more astonishing image in cinema all year than that of a vile, bloated, real-life mass-murderer, cross-dressed in a gaudy pink ball-gown, swaying in front of a waterfall as he serenades a chorus-line of his departed victims spirits into the afterlife.The fear and repression that infests the country still is no better illustrated than when the credits roll. The mostly Danish production team are naturally listed openly, while practically all the locally recruited crew simply scroll by as "anonymous", "anonymous", "anonymous"....</fullReview>

But I am glad I persevered and then watched the interview with Director Joshua Oppenheimer, one of the extras on the DVD.

The plot intended to bring the story closer from the perspective of executioners ? the free and well respected killers are both the actors and directors, having the freedom to plot the story and tell it from their perspective. So the butchers are the main characters, acting like a children nostalgically remembering 'good old naughty days'. While the concept might be successful, here is total failure.Instead of learning something, I was just tricked, left with so few facts that I didn't felt the need to even dig more. Instead of feel the tragedy, I was faced with childish group of pathetic figures, which woke nothing except stupidity and shallowness. Instead of being pulled on the chair as the tragic history would imply, I was bored to dead with repeating and repeating scenes, where showing it perhaps once would be OK, but even twice is too many.Finally movie left me empty, having celebrated the infantile beasts acting childishly convinced that they are even more superstars now than before. It left me with faceless and anonymous victims who are mentioned purely as an 'superstars' toys ? nothing more than objects. It left me with boredom, and I must give credits for that ? you really need to be real talent to lest the watcher with that impression, having the material so powerful.</fullReview>

That the act of killing is vile, that some extremists are unrepentant sociopaths while others are now regretful, or that the corrupt and evil are still in power in Indonesia today?Twenty minutes in I could almost see this amateur shock doc running out of steam before relaxing back to the standard formula of trying to supply more jolts, shock and contempt towards Anwar the straw character per minute with each pointed question being asked behind the camera. In one particular re-enactment of the massacre staged in a burning forest as well, choice of composition technique abruptly switches from realistic vrit to subjective theatrics. With that done and repeatedly done, the fact that this "documentary" claims to have brought the truth is a little dishonest. Then again, maybe they were being practical. Why risk it by interviewing genocide victims (illegal in Indonesia) or analysing the implications and effects of this historical event, when simply portraying pompous caricatures of the Pancasila as pompous caricatures of the Pancasila will do?C-grade shenanigan earning more praise and attention than it deserves? meh.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The military dictatorships that seized power in Portugal &amp; Greece in the 1960s seem like boy scout picnics compared to the events that followed the military takeover in Indonesia in 1965. But they had many things in common, the main one being the demonization of communism as a political ideology, and the use of the term "communism" as a label to mark out people for persecution in the post-war years when the interests of the national ruling elites were threatened from below. What this film shows very forcefully is how government propaganda disseminated through the mass information &amp; entertainment media in which "communists" are set up as an existential threat to the nation-state, can take such a strong hold on the minds of certain disenfranchised constituent groups among the lower social orders, young and old, that they think nothing of committing the most horrid crimes &amp; atrocities on their neighbors and even on members of their own families, fully convinced that their actions are justified and sanctioned by the state authorities. I think the film, however, doesn't explore this socio-political angle in sufficient detail. Instead it focuses more on the behavioural aspects of the paramilitary groups and pathopsychological tendencies of their members and sponsors, and their cruel and violent treatment of their "communist" victims. Although this makes for gripping and shocking viewing, with a somewhat surreal and bizarre ambiance, as for example, when the former killers now quibble whether their actions were sadistic, or just plain killing, this approach is also somewhat exploitative of the viewer's emotions, as well as the protagonists' present beliefs and views looking back, which to a large extent are not all that surprising. Moreover there is something uncomfortably voyeuristic about listening to them trying to justify what they did in the past, some trying to suppress remorse through expiatory quasi-religious confession of their crimes, while others come across as completely unrepentant with Nietschian clarity.For me, the key to understanding the political background to the events recounted by the protagonists is the telling assessment by one of them in regard to where their fervent anti-communist beliefs and zealous drive to exterminate communists came from, when he says, "The Americans taught us to hate communists." As a final note, while watching this film I couldn't help but recall reading somewhere that Obama's mother, &amp; perhaps Obama too, was stationed in Indonesia at the time of the military coup. Moreover, throughout the film, I couldn't help but notice the uncanny physical resemblance between Congo and Obama himself. Hmm!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Act of Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembering hearing the title of this documentary during awards season, and it was a recent edition to the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and with it being five stars out of five by critics I was hoping for something really good. Basically the film focuses on the Indonesian killings of 1965?66, and challenges the former Indonesian death-squad leaders to reenact their mass-killings in whichever cinematic genres they wish. Anwar Congo, aka the Executioner, and his friends were mass murderers, promoted to small- time gangsters at the time when the government of Indonesia was overthrown by the military in 1965, they helped the army kill more than one million alleged communists, ethnic Chinese and intellectuals in less than a year, Congo himself killed hundreds of people. They reenact their killings in the styles of classic Hollywood crime scenarios, film noir gangster scenes, western and even musical numbers, it is only towards the end that elderly Congo truly realises the viciousness of his past and retches over the though of killing so many innocent people. I will admit firstly that I did not pay the fullest attention to the entire film, I even trailed or dozed off at some point, but I definitely got the gist, where perpetrators to a military coup, who never faced justice, made to recreate their real-life atrocities, and in the process revealing their twisted souls, it is a fascinating enough documentary. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary, Features, and it won the BAFTA for Best Documentary, and it was nominated for Best Film not in the English Language. Good, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good movie ruined.Dialog is shown in small white text with black outline, OK but not ideal. Background information is displayed in text more than 2 times bigger, all caps, white with black outline, over the top of the subtitles. It makes the subtitles unreadable.For example, 30 seconds into a conversation between a shopkeeper and Parede, "SHOPKEEPER SPEAKING" and "PAREDE SPEAKING" blast over the subtitle dialog. Or, during a scene with principal characters singing to a small band, "SINGING", "ALL SINGING", and "WHISTLING", overwrite the translation of what they're singing (which is important to the story line). This was streamed from Netflix. Other reviewers have commented on having trouble with the resolution of subtitles, but this isn't that. The subtitles would have been OK if the unnecessary contextual clues didn't wipe them out.It's hard to imagine any of the creators of this otherwise fine film actually reviewed it with subtitles. It's like your phone ringing every 2 minutes. It's a good movie ruined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this a few days ago in my Communism/Fascism History class. I can't quite say I enjoyed it, obviously, but it lingers on the mind like few films do. It was especially disturbing because the class was laughing throughout many scenes. The humor added into the film just makes it all that much more disturbing and uncomfortable, and it really makes you question the role of the spectator and how the spectator should react. I found all of it appalling, it put me in a bad mood, but hours later I felt the impact. The reality show scene really got to me, and that ending is quite unforgettable. I haven't seen 20 Feet From Stardom, but I can see this not having won the Oscar to be seen as a ridiculous choice years from now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1965, there was a military coup in Indonesia. From then on, paramilitary groups have killed suspect communists as well as many others. The documentarians approached these people involved to reenact their killings. The killers themselves set off to make their own movie about the killings.The big name in this production is Errol Morris although he was probably just the producer. For obvious reasons, the people involved have remained Anonymous. It's definitely an odd documentary. The killers are all too happy to participate. Most of them see nothing wrong with what they did. However some of them are quite conflicted.They call themselves Gangsters. At least that's what the translation comes up with. It is a fitting word to describe them. Not only are they killers. They rape, they extort money, and they threaten. IMO this didn't really get real until they start walking around dealing with the regular people. The first scene has them cajoling people to do their movie. I didn't really know what to make of it. Either the people were truly scared or they were truly embarrassed with the attention. When they went out to extort the Chinese store owners, it got real. It's not just them telling stories or reenacting past events. They were being real gangsters right there and then. In the end, these are thugs with excuses. The fact that Herman couldn't get elected says a lot. They may not be as popular as they may believe. The people in power are more willing to put the brutality of the past behind. And I love the people expecting 'gifts' to vote. Obviously corruption goes both ways. There isn't enough fear of them or else the voters would be afraid to demand 'gifts'. They remind me of retired mobsters talking about the good old days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American producer and director Joshua Oppenheimer's debut documentary feature which he co-produced and co-directed with documentary filmmaker Christine Cynn and Anonymous, premiered in the Show section at the 39th Telluride Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Panorama section at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in 2013, was shot on locations in Indonesia and is a UK-Denmark-Norway co-production which was produced by Danish producer Signe Byrge S?rensen. It tells the story about some of the Indonesian death squad leaders whom in the late 1960s during the reign of the first president of Indonesia named Sukarno (1901-1970) and following an unsuccessful attempt at overthrowing the country's government which the Indonesian Communist Party was held responsible for, participated in a massacre which no one till this day has been prosecuted and convicted for, and their joyful way of illustrating and talking about their killings as something good. Distinctly and precisely directed by American filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer, this quietly paced documentary which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main subject's point of view, draws an increasingly disturbing portrayal of three middle-aged men who with the hopes of being movie stars agrees to take part in a movie as the main characters and re-enact their crimes against Communists and how this process leads them towards the actual truth about their regime and the gravity of what they have done to other human beings. While notable for its surreal and naturalistic milieu depictions, reverent cinematography and use of sound, colors and light, this dialog-driven and narrative-driven story about the political persecution of Communists in the late 20th century led by the Indonesian army and its general named Suharto, neo-fascism, the lack of consequences, justice and morality and the variegated internal consequences of having committed infernal acts against men, women and children, depicts three in-depth studies of character. This historically significant, socio-political, introspectively psychological, at times humorous due to its crazed absurdity and humanely observed non-fictional feature with fictionalized reconstructions of real events which is set in the Republic of Indonesia in the 21st century, which is essentially for the rulers of power and citizens of the nation where the genocide happened to see and where the act of killing by the perpetrators whose methods of killing were inspired by American gangster movies according to them, gradually becomes the act of recognizing what that really means, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, subtle continuity, distinct style of filmmaking, contrasting explanations where lies and truths are merged, interpretative last scene, the numerous questions it raises about human kind and the informative acting performances. A cinematic, somewhat fulfilling and exposing work of art which is documentary filmmaking at its most commendable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary was told from the perspective of ex Indonesian gangster Anwar Congo. His atrocity during 1965 military ruling where he was only a selling black market movie tickets before becoming a notorious gangster. This movie follows when he and his ex partners begin to remember his past incidents.I was uncomfortable throughout. I felt it was disturbing in many parts. Actually, they won't show any cruel stuffs in raw form than just an interview. Now and then they perform to explain us the real act and it becomes 'The Act of Killing'.This movie largely received critical acclaim. But my stance is just opposite to it because I hated almost all the character from the movie for what they did. Still a good documentary about what most of us was unaware of the real story. Because of this movie we come to know the dark secrets.These people tell their hidden secrets and feel what they did was an unforgivable sin. They came from lower class and they did it for good living. Suppose if they did not, someone would have done it. Many are backed off from the interview in the middle of the documentary, but Anwar Congo stayed till the end to give his side story.The director should be appreciated for his effort. He took nearly a decade to make this film. It is obvious that in the end he was confused over how to wrap it, but somehow he managed to do so. The most favourite to win Oscar. I am not in favour of this movie to win because it was told from cruel people and their dirty works. If you hear the same story from the innocent victim's perspective that would melt you emotionally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ooph, this movie will hit you like a punch in the gut.Documentary filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer originally set out to make a film about the children of people who had been murdered by Indonesia's military dictatorship as part of a Communist purge in 1965. But when people were unwilling to cooperate because of the threat of retaliation from an anti-Communist militia that is still very much in power in the country today, he instead turned his attention to the murderers themselves, letting them tell their story in any way they wished. They decide to make a film using a combination of popular American genres (gangster, film noir, musical). The result is a deeply, deeply disturbing film about men who are viewed as natural heroes for their acts and who revel in their status as cold-blooded killers.What gives the film it's emotional impact is watching what happens to the principal character as he is given a resource for playing out his fantasies of himself and his fellow murderers. In some of the scenes of the film within the film, he plays an interrogation victim who is beaten, strangled, has his throat cut, etc. Fiction becomes a little too real for him, and he begins to unravel as he feels a hint of what his victims felt. At the film's end, he takes Oppenheimer to one of the sites where he carried out his executions, and a weird exorcism takes place, his guttural retchings and gaggings implying a literal expunging of demons."The Act of Killing" is haunting for its recreation of the specifics of this particular human tragedy, but it's also haunting in a more general way, illustrating the inhuman barbarity of which so many people are capable, and the all-too-fine line that separates one man's psychopathic crime from another man's patriotic heroism.The spell of this movie still sticks with me.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing a review on the documentary The Act of Killing. To be honest I did not expect to see what I saw. I thought I was going to see mass murderers in the act. But really they were basically repeating what they did in the past. To see them so excited to tell their story of how they killed more than one million "Communist" was sickening. But when Anwar started showing guilt and started realizing what he really did, it was kind of unreal. What I didn't like about the film was that the captions were small and hard to read. But to see Anwar Congo, in those last 5 minutes of the documentary, retching from disgust was at least a little comforting. Because he realized what he did was wrong. He realized that these supposed "Communist" never did anything wrong. He and the rest of the executioners were forced to forget about it all. After 40 years they relive their story... wow is all I can say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE ACT OF KILLING': Five Stars (Out of Five)In many ways the best movie of 2013 is this critically acclaimed documentary about retired 'death squad leaders' in Indonesia who were asked (by the filmmakers) to reenact the mass killings of their past (primarily 1965 to 1966), in whatever genre styles they wanted. The result is one of the most unique and astonishing film going experiences I've ever had. The movie was directed by Joshua Oppenheimer and co-directed by Christine Cynn, as well as an anonymous Indonesian filmmaker (which multiple credits are listed as, at the end of the film, I think due to those involved fearing for their safety). It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary feature and (right now) it's ranked as the 5th best reviewed movie of 2013, according to a compilation of hundreds of film critics' top 10 lists (at Moviecitynews.com). It definitely deserves all the recognition it's been getting.The film focuses on Anwar Congo and Herman Koto. Anwar was one of the first death squad leaders (along with Adi Zulkadry) in Indonesia in 1965 (before that they were small time gangsters who scalped movie theater tickets). Anwar is also a founding father of Pemuda Pancasila, a right-wing paramilitary organization which the death squads evolved into. They're still in power today and Herman was one of their leaders. These men helped kill over a million people (and Anwar is said to be personally responsible for about 1,000 of them). Many of these executioners and paramilitary leaders also extorted people (and continue to do so), rigged elections, raped villagers and are responsible for many other atrocities against humanity (including genocide). Anwar appears to be a very nice and peaceful old man (now) but we learn how terrifying he can be, through the horrifying stories he tells. He's also haunted by the memories of his past and the filmmakers reenact them too (to nightmarish affect).This documentary is one of those rare films that goes beyond being just a movie; it really shows what power film really has (which is why it's my favorite art form). It completely blew me away and is honestly like nothing I've ever seen before. It's really haunting and depressing but what's most disturbing about it is the humanity it shows in it's subjects (Anwar and Herman). It really makes you wonder how such a nice and seemingly compassionate person could viciously murder so many innocent people. It's also amazing to think how the filmmakers got away with making this movie. I kept thinking (while watching it) that the director's life (and anyone else involved) has to be in grave danger now. So it wasn't surprising (to me) to see so many credits listed as anonymous at the end of the film. Supposedly Anwar wept while watching it (for the first time, in it's entirety) and both he and Herman say the movie is what they expected it to be (and don't feel deceived at all by Oppenheimer). It's one of those films that's nearly impossible to put into words (how I felt about it); it's something you really have to see to believe! In many ways I do think it's technically the best movie of 2013 but it's not my favorite; I can't say that it's entertaining or moving in an emotionally inspiring way at all (which is what I most look for in a film) but it is the most important and memorable film going experiences I had (watching a movie released last year).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAydMPYt0Hs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bold and creative director puts human face on purveyors of genocide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1965, following a military coup in Indonesia, various gangsters and paramilitary leaders and their followers were given free rein to kill as many people they deemed 'Communists' as they could. The result was that approximately 500,000 people were murdered in these anti-Communist purges including many ethnic Chinese. Joshua Oppenheimer, the film's creator, was living in Indonesia since 2001 and attempted to interview some of the victims and relatives of the victims of these massacres but soon found out that it would be dangerous to do so. Instead, it was suggested to him that he seek out the murderers themselves and much to his surprise, they were more than willing to cooperate.Oppenheimer developed the idea that if he allowed his interviewees the ability to create cinematic scenes illustrating their role in the carnage, this might get them to open up even more. After meeting with approximately forty of these self-admitted killers, he came upon one Anwar Congo, a white-haired, grandfatherly looking man, who bears a slight resemblance to Nelson Mandela (one good way of looking at Congo, is that he's the anti-Mandela). Congo explained that he was a young man back at the time of the anti-Communist purges, working as a ticket scalper, and soon became a self-appointed 'gangster', claiming to have murdered approximately 1,000 so-called 'Communists'. Joining Congo is Herman Koto, a paramilitary leader, much feared in the area of North Sumatra where he's from.One of the disturbing things about Congo is that he has a charming and magnetic personality. Congo openly boasts about how he enjoyed committing these murders and is now revered as an elder statesmen by the Pancasila Youth organization, a right-wing para-military group that reportedly boasts 3 million members strong. Oppenheimer films the current head of this youth organization who reminds one of Baldur von Schirach, the head of the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany. Congo demonstrates on film how he used to strangle his victims with wire, in order to prevent his victims from bleeding too much. When he visits the current governor of North Sumatra, the governor makes the point that Congo was much feared in his day as a 'gangster', but he had no fear of him, because Congo was basically like an uncle to him. Congo and the governor define the word 'gangster' as 'free men'. It's obvious that Congo's behavior is approved by all levels of the current government in Indonesia today. A newspaper editor who used to order the deaths of various people he deemed Communists back in the 60s, is shown to be a close friend of the current president of Indonesia, who received training by the US military in the United States prior to his election as president.Congo and his fellow henchmen seem to have no guilt feelings about insisting that they were far more cruel than the people they killed. But Congo seems to be the only one who was affected by the killings. He suffers from nightmares and at the end of the film, is seen retching at the site where many were killed. Another paramilitary leader, Adi Zulkadry, has no guilt feelings whatsoever. While driving with Oppenheimer who questions him from the back seat of a vehicle, Zulkadry boasts that he's not bound by the Hague Convention, since "history is written by the winners." Furthermore he points out that the US under Bush provided chemical weapons to Sadaam Hussein, who used them against his own people. So if the US was complicit in war crimes, why should he be singled out.The documentary takes on a surreal quality during the re-enactments created by the aging gangsters. One particularly disturbing scene involves women and children who volunteered to illustrate rapes and murders in a particular village. Even Congo seems a bit perturbed when children begin crying during these re-enactments.Other crazy stuff involves shakedowns by a high-ranking paramilitary soldier of ethnic Chinese vendors in the local markets. Right on camera he demands money from these poor businessmen and when he feels they haven't given him enough, he asks for more.Mr. Oppenheimer has provided a great service in putting a human face on the purveyors of genocide. Instead of horrible devils, Congo and his ilk appear to be charming raconteurs. These are people who revel in being sadistic and boasting about their many misdeeds (in their eyes), is a source of power. Don't ever think that any of these men will be brought to the bar of justice. The United States has been a long-time supporter of Indonesia, particularly during the cold war, when their anti-Communist stance was in full force. The same applies to China?despite the fact that many ethnic Chinese were slaughtered during the genocide that occurred in 1965, the Communist Chinese government resumed diplomatic relations with Indonesia in 1990, and the two countries are strong trading partners.'The Act of Killing' represents an indictment of a society that thrives on the intolerance of others. By exposing the mindset of these people, people here in the West should have no illusions about who they are dealing with in such countries that support and promote a fascistic mentality. Ultimately, I believe Mr. Oppenheimer's hope was by gaining the trust of these killers, he could perhaps influence them to develop some kind of moral conscience. Only Anwar Congo seemed to have any guilt feelings about his role in the killings as he admittedly suffered from nightmares and was seen retching at the site of the massacres. But even Congo still doesn't seem to make the connection?he can't stop the nightmares because he truly is not repentant. 'The Act of Killing' may have benefited from more judicious editing as it's a bit long in places. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer has exposed the dark side of human nature by bravely befriending people who can best be described as scary and dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly surreal experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine walking up to a known killer and asking him to reenact one of his murders, then questioning him about all the gory details. Well, that's exactly what Joshua Oppenheimer, the maker of the documentary "The Act of Killing," did - over and over again, in fact.The killers in question all committed their atrocities fifty-some-odd years ago as part of an anti-Communist purge in Indonesia perpetrated by the military dictatorship that had just risen to power there (it's made clear at the very beginning of the film that the "Communists" were often just farmers, union members, Chinese immigrants, intellectuals and anyone not supportive of the military regime). In one year's time, over a million such people had been slaughtered. Today many of the killers, all of whom have gone unpunished for their crimes, are now in positions of great influence and power in the government. The focus of the film is on two men and their minions in particular: Anwar Congo and Ad Zulkadry, members of one of the death squads in North Sumatra, personally responsible for the deaths of thousands. Congo went on to found a paramilitary right-wing organization known as Pemuda Pancasila, which boasts many adherents and followers - mainly young people - even today.The makers of "The Act of Killing" have gathered together this group of self-proclaimed "gangsters," who have decided to make a mainstream movie on the subject with themselves and their buddies as the stars. But what the documentarians actually wanted was to give these men the opportunity to relate not only how they committed the murders but how they feel about it all nearly five decades later. And it is their responses in this regard that make this such a stunning and disturbing movie to sit through. For not only is there virtually no remorse - or even much of an attempt at rationalization - expressed over the people they tortured and killed, these men can barely contain their feelings of nostalgia and pride as they regale their audiences with their memories. There are a few moments of quiet reflection: one man discusses the nightmares he occasionally has about the people he strangled; another dismisses concerns of morality by arguing that one generation's war crimes are another generation's accepted practices, and that the victors ultimately get to determine what is right and what is wrong in the long view of history (he brings up America's decimation of its indigenous peoples and Bush's sanctioning of torture at Guantanamo Bay as examples to buttress his argument). Apparently the PR spokesman for the group, this individual has at least enough of a perspective to fear that the movie that they are making may actually make themselves look cruel and the Communists sympathetic in the eyes of the general public if they re-create the tortures and killings too effectively.Yet, such moments are the exceptions. Most of the time, we're learning about how gratifying it can be to take another man's life or rape a child or burn down a terrified family's house as they watch. And it's all supposed to be okay since "gangster" really means "free man," a fact we are told at least a dozen times throughout the course of the movie. That is somehow supposed to justify not only the killings in the past but the corruption and abuse of power many of them are perpetrating in the present. And, most shockingly of all, the media and much of the general populace of the area seem to go along with it - though how much of their approbation is actually the product of fear is anyone's guess.The irony is that, while these "gangsters" keep declaiming against the evils of Communism, they have set up their own positions of power in a way perfectly aligned with how that system has worked wherever it has been tried. For instance, we see one of the men wending his way through a crowded marketplace, going from one honest, hardworking shopkeeper to another, extorting money through threats, and, later, running (unsuccessfully) for parliament so he'll be able to wring even more money out of the decent citizens of his country.Many of the men point to Hollywood as their inspiration, explaining how they adopted many of the tough-guy styles and attitudes they saw in pictures in their youth - and even some of their torture and killing techniques. Score another one for American exports! We've seen so many dramatized accounts of genocide and war crimes in movies and on TV that seeing these actual perpetrators re-enacting their atrocities takes the subject to a whole new level. And the depressing part is to realize that these are not just isolated cases, that the world is indeed full of such men eager to trumpet the evil they've done. It's true that, near the end, Congo has what appears to be a breakdown of remorse, finally comprehending what it is he did all those years ago. But is it too little, too late? And how much of it is genuine and how much of it is staged? (These are "actors," after all). Unfortunately for these men, redemption cannot be had for the price of a movie ticket.It's safe to say that "The Act of Killing" provided me with the most surreal experience I've ever had watching a movie. At times, I found myself thinking it must be some sort of put-on, an elaborate piece of street theater designed to trick the unwary into believing it's real. Alas, it isn't a hoax, and, for that reason alone, it emerges as one of the most deeply disturbing looks into the dark heart of humanity ever put on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentarian Joshua Oppenheimer was trying to interview survivors of the 1965 military coup in Indonesia, but the authorities there kept disallowing it. He found, when he turned the camera on those authorities, they were more than willing to tell them about their own role in that coup. You see, they won. They were considered heroes and founding fathers. That was because they killed communists. And ethnic Chinese. And pretty much anyone else who stood in their way, or whom they just didn't like. Thousands of them. An unknown number around the country (some say up to 2.5 million). And they were absolutely happy to speak of their exploits. In particular, the film focuses on a man named Anwar Congo, who claims to have killed a thousand people with his bare hands. He demonstrates how he did it. While dancing and laughing. This film is absolutely insane. Last week I watched the film Hannah Arendt, about a German philosopher who wrote about the "banality of evil" concerning Adolf Eichmann. This film would have been right up her alley. Oppenheimer spent eight years filming in Indonesia. The resulting documentary is sometimes a little unfocused, sometimes maybe too deliberately odd, but what he has filmed here is simply astounding. It's one of the most unique and compelling documentaries ever to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece doc examining how mass murder is justified and the implications</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is an amazing film. I guess you could call it a documentary but it's so much more, packed with ideas, so revealing of human nature. Its subject is the Indonesian death squads of the mid- 60s, gangster paramilitary hired to exterminate all the Communists in the country. But how do you know someone's a Communist? I guess if someone looks like a Communist, then you grab them off the street, interrogate them, beat and torture them, then kill them and dump them in the river. Anyone suspected of being a Commie was systematically wiped out: union supporters, intellectuals, any ethnic Chinese, over a million in all.Tragically, there's nothing new about mass killing and ethnic cleansing, just keeps happening over and over. What's amazing about the movie is that it reveals how HAPPY these murderers are. They're proud and boastful of their deeds, totally open about their actions as if they were great achievements of mankind. They've been rewarded and praised by the government, awarded medals and lionized as heroes of society. They won, the military dictatorship took over and their fascist regime has ruled there ever since. War crimes are defined by the winners and there has been no punishment for these men. In fact, they take it as a sign from God that what they're doing is right.It's really disturbing stuff, shocking and surreal on a mind-blowing level. Outrageous. This is what life would've been like had the Nazis won. It's insanity. I can't believe what passes for normal in Indonesia. I'm scared of the place. A nerdy Chinese guy cannot be safe there. I've known one guy from Indonesia in my life and all he said about the place was, "Too many gangsters. Really f*cked up way of doing things." Couldn't really grasp what that meant at the time, what like a bunch of Al Capones running around? He wasn't real open about it and now I understand why. It's shameful what's going on there, fascists ruling by fear and force, oppression thick in the air.The masterstroke of the film is asking the gangsters to re-enact their murders and make their own movie about it all, which they do gladly. Anwar Congo, the main subject, loves American movies, always wanted to be in movies and this is his chance. He brings along his favorite killing tool, a wire tied to a stick which he used to strangle people, something he picked up from gangster films. He's proud of his innovation, how this technique was a real time-saver in terms of blood cleanup. (He can put an "improved efficiency" line on his resume.) Anwar likes to dance and he does the cha-cha at the rooftop site where he killed hundreds of people, a bizarre moment. The film's method brilliantly plays on the vanity of the gangsters, manipulating their egos to reveal the depths of their delusions. We see how the ego is able to build a self-righteous illusion out of anything and even the most heinous actions imaginable can be justified. It's mob mentality where the mob is actually "The Mob".The beautiful scenes of surreal majesty with pretty dancing girls by waterfalls and lakes are etched in my memory. They represent for me the fantasy world these murderers are living in where fascism is celebrated, a defense mechanism to cope with the horrors of their actions. It's the glossy illusion created to drown out any objections from their conscience. They do have morals; they're just buried under all that fascism.Comic relief comes in the form of Herman, Anwar's sidekick punching bag. He's a pretty overweight fellow yet Anwar likes to dress him up in drag to represent the Goddess of Revenge, Anwar's vision of a victim's daughter that haunts his dreams. Herman in drag is a sight to behold, like an Asian Divine. We get to witness how he brushes his teeth: like a gross messy warthog. Herman also makes a bid for parliament and is endearingly open about how he's in it purely for the graft. There's a hilarious scene where he poses for publicity photos in a variety of ridiculous outfits and backgrounds, then cuts to him mimicking Barack Obama on TV, making all sorts of funny faces in the mirror. Werner Herzog, apparently a (reluctant) Herman fan, says he can't take his eyes off of him and doesn't understand why.The film is brilliant and as thought-provoking as you can possibly get. Perhaps it'll get people wondering about what their own egos are up to and what's really going on with the local zeitgeist. It ain't all strawberry milkshakes. America may be half a world away from Indonesia but we're pretty involved in the whole thing. We trade with them; this military regime totally gets the U.S. stamp of approval. I've bought things made in Indonesia (pretty nice stuff, actually) and can only wonder what kind of sweatshop conditions are going on there and who's kicking up to the gangsters. It's just corporations passing on the cost to some place they'd like to take a dump on, we see it all the time, but shouldn't we be more aware? Should we have a conscience about this and boycott all goods made in Indonesia? The film states there was "direct aid from western governments" for the exterminations, and seeing as hunting Commies has been a favorite pastime of the U.S. gov't, I think they're just fine with the whole thing.The exec-producers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris (documentary gods) have hyped up the ending as something amazing, never before seen. Yes that is true. I'll just say that I think it's real, that he's too vain to purposely have a camera capture him doing that and making that sound. Anwar may look like a happy dancing friendly guy, but he ain't alright. No, he's pretty f*cking far from alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may think this film is too absurd to be real, but the massive political purge in question did happen during the Indonesian killings of 1965?1966, and US and other western countries chose to ignore this terrible incident just because they supported Suharto's right-wing regime as a part of their Cold War tactic. The people responsible for killing more than one million of union members, poor farmers, left-wing/anti-government intellectuals, and ethnic Chinese people during this bloody period are still alive well in their country, and they have been the powerful leading members of their society since the purge; they casually wield their power, money, and notoriety in front of others, and not many people dare to talk openly about the past.Nothing better depicts man's inhumanity than the pride and joy these people take in what they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Act of Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extraordinary documentary, filmed over many years by Joshua Oppenheimer and his co-directors in Indonesia examining the heroic status afforded death squad and paramilitary figures following the 1960s military coup and subsequent genocide of at least half a million people, under the pretext of being communists. Oppenheimer weaves many layers of fact and fiction, as the gangsters are given free reign to reenact scenes of their violence and choose to do so in the styles of some of the Hollywood genre films they adored back when they were ticket scalps by day and executioners by night. Anwar Congo is the most interesting of the killers, and becomes the main focus, his internal struggles and, presumably suppressed conscience, being further brought to the surface through the very act of dramatic reenactment. This ends in a horrible scene with Congo, still trying to boast of his murders, but now seemingly wracked with guilt, retching at one of his old murder sites. However unforgivably terrible his crimes, the process he goes through is very human, in contrast to some of the other death squad leaders, hollow men now rich and obsessed with collecting "very limited" diamond trinkets or dragged round shopping malls by a spoilt, Westernised teenage daughter. The film offers no resolution, the paramilitary Pancasila group responsible for many atrocities are still hand in hand with the current Government, but it does at least draw attention to the horror that lies in Indonesia's history and as one killer remarks, candidly shows the world that it was they who were cruel and not the "communists".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As U.S. power wanes, so does its ability to sell itself, and to suppress the truth about how it came to possess such world-dominating power. The Indonesian genocide tells us about how the U.S. conducted its "war on communism:" By giving free rein to the sort of revolting thugs we see in this movie and allowing them to gut the life out of a country. All of Indonesia's most honest, hard-working people, all its socially conscious individuals, all its intellectuals, as well as its Chinese minority, perished in this CIA-contracted genocide.It should be noted that Barack Obama's stepfather was one of these thugs, and a particularly senior one at that. The fact that his mother - a so-called anthropologist - went to a Russian-language school run by the State Department at the height of the Cold War (Didn't it occur to her that there weren't too many openings for American anthropologists in the USSR?) and took her child to a country where the corpses had barely stopped clogging up the rivers, where she ended up marrying one of the biggest thugs of the Suharto dictatorship, should tell us a lot about why Obama and Indonesia turned out to be the way they are.The director's brilliant idea of allowing these genocidal criminals to expose their crimes in the form of what they imagine to be entertainment, parallels the way in which the actual crimes were committed, i.e. to the music of gamalan bands. This isn't as unusual as one might think. For example during the Greek "revolution" Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians slaughtered their Greek-speaking Muslim and Jewish neighbors in a similar festive atmosphere.The film is surreal, much like Indonesia itself, a country that lost its mind in 1965 and has been schizophrenic ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What makes genocide flare up with such tedious frequency? Some kind of evil flea?" ~Geoff Berner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What are we going to do when genocide visits a group near us? Where are we going to fit? Truth be told, all things being remotely equal - most of us won't stand in solidarity with the victims. Not if we can help it. Instead, we'll pick our places, our helpful roles. From those roles that there are left for us to pick. As so many have before us. And so many others are doing as we speak. Some such roles will be harder for us to fulfil, but some - will be surprisingly easy. And either way, given the opportunity, most of us will manage. We'll put in our hard days' work and earn our keep and even advance our positions. This film is about just such laborers. Grunts, who found themselves slipping snuggly into those ageless roles of killers and torturers. With inspiration and joy. This film is very much a unique journey into the heart of human darkness. In many ways. Not least of which, is that both the protagonists and their acts - are still openly celebrated by their countrymen. Leaving them with little but their own thoughts to fear. Few scenes illustrate this point more vividly than the big interview in the middle of the film. Which I'm unlikely to ever forget. Caesar Flickerman's work pales utterly in comparison. Life outdoing fiction ever again. Ultimately, what I love about this film most, is how much deeper it aims than merely summoning another fruitless outrage choir. It is a character study fist and foremost. An attempt to understand how people who've played these parts so fully - deal. As with most all truth, when it is illuminated THIS vividly by art THIS brilliant - the answers feel both alien and as though they've been in there all along.</fullReview>

Getting to a truth far deeper than a standard documentary or drama can do, this surrealist film gets at the banality of killing. Murder is a part of the culture in Indonesia since the 1960s as much as texting, Tweeting, and shopping at the mall is in the United States. Former "gangsters" and paramilitary leaders are filmed as they reenact their brutality, justifying it as "killing communists." Full review pending. As of now Rating: Pay full Price, see it Twice. There is no other film like this, and I hope there never will be. This is not because of the quality; it is well done, but because of how powerful and affecting it is for the participants and the audience and the tragedy from where it stems.

		<shortDescription>Indonesian government officials gloat about the genocide by which they took and held office.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing reminds us that even in a documentary, the particulars of plot and character are as open to expand into metaphors as a fictional work is.The film presents the Indonesian death squad leaders who in 1965 overthrew the Sokarno government and committed massive genocide to maintain their power. There are two leading figures. Adi Zulkadry remains chillingly proud of his horrific actions. Anwar Congo -- who bears an unsettling resemblance to a younger Nelson Mandala -- shows some signs of a moderate guilt. As if to atone he has himself filmed pretending to be beaten up, then proudly shows the footage to his grandchildren. Despite his claims, of course the powerful killer can have no idea what his powerless victims felt. Oppenheimer has the killers restage their crimes for purposes of making a film. Zulkadry in particular relishes reliving the genocidal evil. Even Congo takes pride in demonstrating his efficient use of a wire to strangle his victims. What's most moving is the effect of the staging on the citizens cast as victims. Though they weren't party to the original crimes, just their staging moves them into uncontrollable pain and weeping. The "act" reminds them how vulnerable they still are to the killers now governing the country. That's what makes this film speak beyond its putative subject matter. The particular case of 1965 Indonesia comes to signify the callousness and amorality of any government drunk on its own power. It would be a mistake to leave this movie feeling comfortable in our political system's supposed superiority. North Americans may not be subject to their government's committing genocide but the power gap remains. The Indonesian killers' impunity recurs in a more civilized manner in the financial structure that remains intact, uncorrected, unpunished, for the havoc it wreaked upon the economy and the citizens. Here as there power corrupts. Here as there a government bent -- and I mean bent -- upon its own preservation can not be trusted to protect its citizens' lives, living or interests. Making this film, exposing their present government officials' bloody past, amoral pride and freedom from conscience, all that is still a very dangerous act. The killers show no qualms about luxuriating in -- not just admitting -- their jaw dropping torture and killing. But the ordinary citizens, including a host of production and crew members, are forced to hide behind Anonymous. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing and visceral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of interesting things about the movie, and things that you can think about and wonder about a lot. One thing that struck me was two of the main killers, Anwar and Adi, visiting with a newspaper reporter. The reporter commented on how smooth they must have been, because he never suspected that these interrogations and killings were going on right above his head. Adi, with some enjoyment I believe, points out that it basically means he was a lousy reporter, because they were not hiding anything. Normally that would just make me think about failure of the press, except for the way the reporter's face changes when he is told that his boss was in charge. His shock is so personal, that it takes him from a frustrating failure of a journalist to a person coming up against something he was not ready for.The conversations are important to have, and the movie has been facilitating many conversations, but I want to emphasize how important the "acting", and staging, ended up being.First of all, things came out. Anwar ends up being the main character, and he is charming. You see him being very sweet and gentle with his grandsons and an injured duck. You also see him demonstrating using a wire to strangle people, because beating them to death was too messy, with blood all over the place and stinking if you didn't clean it up. And you see him doing a little dance talking about this, but then there is also a list of substances used that keeps getting longer, and you see it has taken a toll that has not truly been acknowledged.A little later they are using a neighbor to play the part of a Communist facing interrogation, and as they are talking before he is smiling and laughing, but then he shares a story that maybe they could use, about his stepfather's murder. The feeling changes as they decide the story is too complicated to share, but there is a hurt that has come up, and as they act out the torture the neighbor is just a mess, but then after he is changed.To me it felt like he had suppressed that grief and everything bad it had done to him for years, and now it was back. He will have to face it, but there was a hollowness before, and there can be something there now. It felt like he was going to come to terms with it. The film gave him a chance to speak about it, and it gave him a chance to feel what his stepfather and others might have felt, and he can move forward.With greater involvement in the process, there is a greater effect on Anwar. As he takes on the role of someone interrogated and executed and beheaded, it becomes physically harder for him. His sidekick Herman is having a great time playing with the fake organs, but Anwar is looking ill. He says he could not do the scene again, and the end has him basically dry-heaving at the same spot where we saw him cheerfully talking about his killing methods and dancing at the beginning.Before the physical breakdown, but after watching the scene where he "dies", Anwar gets contemplative, wondering if he did wrong, and saying he knows now how those men felt. This is one of the view spots where you hear Oppenheimer's voice, as he argues that Anwar knew it was pretend, but those men knew they were really going to die, and it was not the same. Anwar insists that he can feel it.I am willing to believe that Anwar did feel something close. I believe the creative efforts of staging and acting unlocked the empathy which he had silenced at the time. I say that because of other results of creative expression I have seen, so it makes sense to me, but also because of seeing the weight upon Anwar grow.It is a hard thing. He is responsible for so much death, and he has stature and respect for that. He is the beneficiary of a cruel and corrupt culture because of his participation in it. He is also a human, and it hurts him, turning off caring about the suffering of others because they "deserve" it is an important step on the road to genocide.It's kind of like you are watching two movies. There are the scenes that the executioners stage, where it is filmmaking, and there are costumes and effects and a script, but what we are really watching is the documentary about the people creating the other movie.The other movie ends with a musical number with a waterfall and dancing girls and "Born Free" playing over the scene. In it, Anwar is thanked by two of his victims for sending them to Heaven and given a medal. It is telling that the ending he chose has to be one where it is okay that they were dead. Society has said that it was a necessary thing to get rid of the communists so they could have their freedom, but now he needs the victims to be okay too. That vision is not true enough, which leaves him on the roof struggling to get something out of him that won't leave.It is horrible, but it needs to be seen and known. It needs to be talked about and felt for all the people who have shut it up inside. It needs to not happen again.</fullReview>

I've never seen anything like it and not quite sure how the filmmaker got them to agree to do this. I did appreciate that it wasn't overly preachy or one sided; some of the men had some valid points about the hypocrisy of the West (i.e. how the victor always determines what's right, wrong, etc in war, there is some truth to that). While there appears to be some sort of redemption at the end, I was left however questioning how genuine it was and honestly, just feeling it was no where near enough given what they did.

		<fullReview>The Cinemanila International Film Festival has the noble aim of bringing World Cinema to the Philippines and Philippine Cinema to the World. On this its 15th year, aside from films in competition, there are also features from World Cinema and South East Asian cinema, including up to seven contenders in the Oscar Best Foreign Film shortlist.The Danish documentary film "The Act of Killing" is one of the films in the World Cinema category. It is directed by American director Josh Oppenheimer, who had immersed himself in this project for a decade. The final product is nothing less than bizarre.In the 1960s, Indonesian death squads carried out mass executions mainly of ethnic Chinese immigrants assumed to be communists. In this unbelievable documentary, Oppenheimer was actually able to cajole these real-life killers to talk about and even act out their killing sprees in the guise of a whimsical film project.Underneath the seemingly innocuous song and dance numbers and the cross- dressing, we vicariously relive the murderous acts as the perpetrators themselves describe and reenact these chilling scenes of murder as they happened years ago. Strangely, there might be some humor to be felt as these amateur "actors" awkwardly act in front of the camera, talking about their Hollywood pegs. These death squad people relate their heinous deeds lightly and nonchalantly, as if these were totally regular events. However, you are always jolted by the fact that hey, these people actually did these harrowing acts -- stranglings, decapitations, immolations, and more -- for real! For this unique conceit alone, "The Act of Killing" is an achievement in film making. It was able to permanently record and recreate a most infamous period in Indonesia's recent history with the full cooperation of the very men who were responsible for the reprehensible and cruel acts that marred that time. I am not sure if this type of work is unprecedented, but it is a definitely ground-breaking achievement. The medium of film was created for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mildly recommended.The Act of Killing is an off-putting but compelling documentary that examines the amorality of mass murderers. It is a rather bizarre experiment that rambles on to tedium, long after the killers' many confessions about their murderous reign of terror. The film plays more as a psychological thesis on abhorrent human behavior than a real documentary. Directed by Joshua Oppenheimer (and co-directed by Christine Cynn and Anonymous), the film is difficult viewing. Filmed in Indonesia, the film takes former death squad members and has these stone-cold killers perform and stage their gruesome acts of genocide as a theatrical presentation.One participant even boasts that his body count exceeded 1000 lives. He is the film's central character, Anwar Congo, a heroic messiah who relishes in his own cruelty. After meeting him and his gang of cronies, the film takes its best (worst) foot forward with its let's-put-on-a- show approach to their real life murders with a variety of film genres. These make-believe snuff films are faithfully recreated as Congo and his killing crew play dress-up, direct their actors, and demonstrate their "acts of killing". But it is the killers' matter-of-fact re-telling of their horrific crimes that creates an uneasy feeling for any moviegoer and gives the film some gravitas.As they present their re-enactments of their grisly deeds for the camera, there is an odd twist to the proceedings. They are asked to direct and film the murder scenes in the style of their favorite film genre. Film Noir, horror, musical, or western, the resulting surreal effect is chilling and simultaneously repulsive and gimmicky. The Act of Killing does provoke outrage and effectively captures some chilling moments of profound absurdity, mostly due to the braggarts' inane comments and their lack of remorsefulness for their actions. But Oppenheimer and the other filmmakers' decision to show no blood letting or graphic violence downplays this grotesque charade of multiple killings. By playing it safe, the documentary loses its initial impact and desensitizes the extreme murderous actions of those involved, making this film a needless exercise in hyperbole. While the subject matter is important and needs world-wide exposure, the execution of the film (and the staged executions themselves) is heavy-handed, talky, and tiresome. Monotonous rather than truly shocking, The Act of Killing is stunt casting at its worse. The film effectively shows a country filled with amoral people whose lack of respect for human life is disturbingly common. Yet it also unfolds as just another creepy film with a lack of respect for its movie-going audience as well.

		<fullReview>I found this movie utterly disgusting, not only (of course) because it tells us about horrible crimes, but also because of the quality of filming. The director did not make any attempts to create a high quality documentary, even if the story being told is indeed very interesting. Instead, he created something half way between a cheap horror movie and a bad taste soap opera, with a bit of politically biased propaganda here and there. Most of the contents are non-informative, disturbing to watch or just plain stupid, and all throughout the movie we are left with the doubt that everything was completely scripted, while trying to make it look like it was real and spontaneous.As I said, the subject deserved much more than this sort of naive, amateurish attempt, hopefully a more serious and capable director will take the opportunity to inform us about what happened in Indonesia in the 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I found out that this film was produced by Werner Herzog, then it all made sense. In an idea spearheaded by director Joshua Oppenheimer, "The Act of Killing" is a documentary that challenges a few former Indonesian death squad leaders, who are referred to in this film as executioners, but refer to themselves as gangsters and embrace their roles as cold blooded murderers, to re-enact a few of their real-life mass-killings, using whichever cinematic (Hollywood) genre they wish. OK, let me give you a tiny bit of historical context. When the first Indonesian president was overthrown in 1965, groups of thugs where recruited to initiate an anti-communist purge, now referred to as the Indonesian killings of 1965-1966, where anyone suspected of being a communist was brutally killed, raped or severely extorted. Today these executioners are seen as war heroes. During the course of this documentary, we look on as Oppenheimer gathers interviews from a few of these renowned former death squad leaders, as they boastfully speak of the creativity behind the different types of mass executions they've conducted and their excitement about re-creating said executions for the big screen. The most notable of these "former executioners" is a man called Anwar Congo, who also happens to be the founder of a paramilitary and violently anti-communist organization called Pamuda Pancasila; an organization that is openly backed by the Indonesian government. But Anwar is not the most polarizing subject of this film simply because he himself claims to be responsible for personally killing over a thousand people, but more so because he seems to be the only executioner Oppenheimer speaks with, who shows any ounce of regret at all. Obviously bothered by his part in an infamous genocide, and claiming, in his old age, to be suffering from nightmares and hauntings brought on by the souls of the deceased, he seems to agree to partake in this social experiment for different reasons than the rest. While fascinated by the opportunity to dress up as an old fashioned movie gangster (as he claims to be a huge fan of old Hollywood cinema) after a while you get the sense that Anwar is really seeking some kind of morbid closure for the atrocities that he perpetrated and that nobody else around him seemed to recognize or even fully understand. Gearing up to be hands down the best documentary of the year, there is one aspect of "The Act of Killing" which I had a problem with. The genre re-enactments, as clever as they sound on paper, don't really work as well as you might think. That is to say, the fact that one brutal re-enactment is constructed to resemble an old fashioned Hollywood gangster movie and the next as a musical and the next as a western, doesn't really add much to this film. However, the scenes which stem from the re-enactments themselves and even the casual reminiscing by these men, are quite emotionally draining to watch and hear play out. Final Thought: Juxtaposing the beautiful landscapes of Indonesia with moments of raw emotion (that are not for the squeamish) and shockingly coherent views on war crimes and human rights, Oppenheimer has constructed a documentary which allows emotions to play out on-screen in such a way, that even amidst the depressive and at times morbidly celebrative atmosphere, we (as audience members) maintain hope that the subjects (the former death squad leaders) will undergo a change of heart and see the errors in their ways; even though this "hope" is a candle which becomes dimmer as the documentary nears its finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is proof positive that a compelling documentary pushing two hours (or more, depending on the cut) needs more than just an intriguing concept. In this case, Western-funded Indonesian death squad members (chief amongst them, Anwar Congo) recall the splendor of participating in the systematic elimination of millions of communists in 1965-1966 by re-enacting their atrocities on camera. In so much as the victors ultimately define what do or do not constitute war crimes, the same paramilitary groups born of that era now thrive in the midst of a corrupt "democracy." That's all well and good, but how many times do we have to hear one participant or another dubiously define "gangsters" as "free men"? How many times do we have to view Congo revisit the scene of the crime to describe the method of homicide he devised to minimize blood spillage? (In both cases, I counted three, but it may have been more.) Even the surreal John Waters-esque wardrobe choices are overplayed for comic relief to diminishing returns. It's too bad that director Joshua Oppenheimer did not fully appreciate the benefit of subtlety (e.g., Congo tenderly explaining how to apologize to a baby duck with a broken leg). Instead, we get entirely too much footage of the low-hanging fruit donning meat-taped-to-the-face prosthetics and reminiscing about carnage, while juxtaposed against lingering shots of Congo pretending to have a conscience. For those of us who attended a screening at Alamo Drafthouse (Drafthouse Films distributed the documentary), the video introduction by the director ? telling us how we should be expected to react to the film ? should have been a bad sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly One Of The Most Surreal Documentaries You Will Ever See.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters, I ended up watching the extended cut (2 hour 40 minutes). If you haven't heard anything about this movie, then I seriously recommend you do a little research before viewing. As for the entire running time, it'll blow your hair back on how easily manipulated some people (Innocent or not) can be.Directed by Joshua Oppenheimer, and produced by documentary masters Werner Herzog and Errol Morris. It follows the life of Anwar Congo, now an old man who was a part of the Indonesian killings between 1965?66, an anti-communist purge in which more than 500,000 people were killed. Anwar claims to have personally killed 1,000 people by various sadistic methods and tools. He is also regarded as a founding father of the right-wing paramilitary organisation "Pemuda Pancasila", that grew out of the death squads. The organisation is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers who are openly involved in corruption, election rigging, clearing people from their land for developers and genocide. The documentary then begins to take a surreal direction, as Oppenheimer challenges Anwar and his friends to discuss and re-create his violent crimes in the form of their favourite Western and Gangster movies (Even Musicals). When it is time for Anwar to face simulated death, he buckles and begins a vague journey of realisation and remorse.Like I said, it'll blow you away how extreme the levels of right and wrong seem to be vacant throughout the picture. While the recreation scenes sound like a detriment, they are most certainly not and everything is very well paced (I can't even begin to imagine what the shorter cut must be like).Final Verdict: Joshua Oppenheimer doesn't hold back, and the results are staggering. "The Act of Killing" is one of the most important documentaries you'll ever see, and in my opinion one of the best films of 2012. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other film has left me so speechless. This is how documentaries should be made; documenting the facts and letting the audience decide what to make of it. It tells the story of horrible atrocities committed by mass murderers, told by the very murderers themselves.The biggest strength of this movie is that it puts you in a very unsettling spot. You know these people are monsters, and their acts were heinous. But at the same time, no one seems to be bothered by it. Everyone acts casual and talks about it without flinching. You get drawn into their mad world just to find out why they are acting like this. What could possibly be their mindset? Is it denial? Some twisted sense of justice? Are they just, plain and simple, crazy? The movie never gives it's own conclusion, it leaves it to you.People are giving this film props for it's chilling reenactments of war crimes, and covering a genocide not many have known about. Those are all true, but the real reason why 'The Act of Killing' is truly groundbreaking is the one I mentioned above. Other than that, its also a deep narrative about humanity that kills each other so much and then writes it in history. "War crimes are defined by the winners".Everyone absolutely has to watch this documentary. Yes it's haunting and not very fun, but its also eye opening and an important study of human nature.</fullReview>

When I title this review Breathtaking, I don't mean visually (although it is beautiful) I mean morally, the re-enactments are probably the most powerful, scary, gut wrenchingly real re-enactments ever put in to a documentary film. This is a must watch. This film evokes emotions in the viewer which are not pleasant, but are vitally important to human life, this film will make you feel bad in all the right ways, and leave you shocked and maybe even emotionally drained. This film, I believe, much like "Fog of War" is an absolute must watch for any human interested in ideology, society, human nature, politics, and life. I have never watched a film so morally disturbing, yet, not unwatchable, not trying to go out of it's way, giving you a plan and simple horrifically disturbing truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is incredible. Joshua Oppenheimer has walked into the lions den in making this film. He has lived with these killers in a land where life is cheap and easily ended. The gangsters he films have taken so many lives without thought there must have been plenty of moments in production where Josh has become nervous about what he has gotten himself into. Watching this doco you expect yourself to hate everyone on the screen, but in my case, besides a couple of exceptions, I found myself feeling pity and sympathy as these old men are faced with the slaughter they committed when young. The cinematography is great, as it transitions from interviews to cinema style scenes created by the killers themselves...with raw scenes of local happenings cutting roughly in. Joshua was very brave to film this and so was Anwa. No events are forced and they all seem to occur very naturally as the horror of crimes past sink into the minds of those who have committed them. The creepiest part of this documentary is the way the media in Indonesia promote this "movie", getting behind the ethnic cleansing as if it was the pure thing to do. Not pretty. Absolutely brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 20th century evil was synonymous with Hitler and the Nazi regime, but these Indonesian gang-lords make them look like pussies. This is a docudrama following and depicting a dramatized tale of the Indonesian paramilitary and gangs who marauded, extorted, murdered slaughtered, raided and truck fear into the poor villages and communists who opposed the then politically established. Their modus operandi was as while as possible, at the hight of hypocrisy the gang members and their political patrons at government blessed themselves and their movement by sermon and prayer to God (Islam, Muslim society). Indonesian society and culture sort of glorified the gangster, in the Indonesian language as they point out a word for gangster is derived from the English language, 'free-man' become 'primaan'. This documentary was play acted by the actual gang lords proud of their history, with glee the horrid stories was reiterated. The crowning moment for them is that even Indonesian national television has picked up on the documentary and did a promo with the actors/gangsters. In my impression the whole culture gave off a very primitive feel, like sorts of a throwback into a much more barbaric times, I was thinking when the Mongol horde swept through Asia all the way into eastern Europe sacking cities slaughtering millions of children women and men, did they feel remorse, they kept to their goal of building an empire and amassing wealth in the primitive way they knew how. This is well worth the look to get a feel this throwback culture.PS: The the main attraction Anwar Congo, at the end of looked an awful lot like Nelson Mandela, and at some angles like Barack Obama, Ironic isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is about people that used to kill a lot of people for talking bad about their government. They are basically reacting what they did in their past lives. This movie is both sad and unfair, the people that would be killed for saying one bad thing about the government were known as "communists" and they would get brutally beaten or how ever they decided to take their lives. The people that fought against the "communists" were mainly younger men and women, they had about 3 million soldiers ready to take down any and all who talk badly about their government. They controlled everything, even the papers. If they wanted someone to look bad they would lie on the papers and make everyone hate them. Its amazing to me how calm they were while talking about what they've done in the past, they have probably killed over hundreds of people but talk and react it as if they weren't killing people, i would have thought they would feel bad or show some emotion to the situation. I also cant believe people actually played the parts in the documentary, because me personally wouldn't want to do it.The things that happened in this documentary was shocking, but it also opens up your mind to see what really happens in this world. Also that a lot of this shows how unfair it is in other parts of the world, and we should be glad we have the freedom of speech. Id recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in stuff like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this documentary The Act of Killing is about former Indonesian death squad who killed lots of innocent people and decided to reenact all of the fictional scene into a movie. The vigorous leader of the death squad, Anwar Congo inspired many people in Indonesia to execute anyone who was a communist. Lots of people in Indonesia group together as an unofficial military of the country. The people who were communist were unfairly persecuted by people that were supported by their government. The communist people believe that they wanted everyone to be equal and heard. It's insane to me because I live in a democracy where u.s. citizens get to choose who can run over our country. We get to have privilege and equal rights. Although in Indonesian they do things differently. It must be hard to be someone who is poor that lives in Indonesia and can't make up their own choices. If they try they will be persecuted. It makes me very uncomfortable and I feel a lot of sympathy for the children, women, and men who were once killed. However this documentary made me surprise was the ending. When I watched Anwar reacted to his own movie. He soon realizes that what he did in the past was very bad. He thinks to himself that the emotion that he acted out for being an innocent person getting killed in the movie isn't worse than the people who were really getting killed. He started to have respect and empathy. It amazed me a lot. I didn't think he would care. This is sooooooo crazy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my eyes, this documentary was made for not only to let people know what happened to all of those people but to show you how Anwar Congo, the biggest gangster in Indonesia, grows from this experience and it changes his point of view on his actions. I had no idea what this documentary was going to be about, but it really surprised me. The main story was about an old executer named Anwar Congo who is a death squad leader and in line with the Indonesian Paramilitary. They are basically the "gangsters" in Indonesia. Whoever didn't believe in what the Paramilitary believed, they would be killed. Anwar would call those people "communists". So Anwar made reenactments of all of his killings he did. Throughout the story, Anwar changes his perspective on the whole concept. At first he thought it was cool, and he was kind of proud of what he did. But by the end of the film, he couldn't even be in the spot he used to kill people without gagging. This documentary was filmed in Indonesia. Overall I loved this documentary. It's very raw and real and emotional at times. The best part of the documentary in my opinion is when Anwar actually felt fear when he was acting the part of a communist. He felt somewhat how the people he killed felt. So if you are thinking about watching this documentary, you should not hesitate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is so extremely disturbing to watch, I find it impossible to give it a decent rating. I believe documentaries about this sort of subject, brings further recognition and glory to the sadistic ego of the subject matter and his followers. Clearly this is believed by themselves as is touted throughout the disturbing film.On the other hand, it could serve the director's purpose in attempting to show viewers the disturbing trailways in killers' minds. I just don't think focusing on their disgusting, horrid deeds is the way to do it. However, knowing that justice is not going to be implemented against these war criminals, despite their flagrant, nose-thumbing views towards the Geneva Convention and international law and decency, makes me sick to my stomach as a participant in the world. WHY hasn't the international powers that be demand that such despicable and horrendous crimes and mockery of societal decency and law and boycott the country and government that supports such acts against humanity and mob-oriented techniques imposed upon the country's middle and poor classes as I write this? I'm enraged by the pathetic, non-invasive lack of action by viewers such as myself and the wasted money for holding and creating international laws, only to allow a country to mock it so openly. Equally and more deeply am I'm enraged about feeding the ego of a maniacal sociopath by creating a documentary about him and his followers. Horror and rage also persist that atrocities against any parties, and the innocent lives still fed upon by the loathing persons that create the permanent memory upon the viewers' minds, go unchecked and unpunished.It's never really clear what is the payout for videotaping such an atrocious person by the documentarians involved and in that the documentary loses power and ability to take a stand against the subject matter. I don't think it warrants even an Oscar nomination -- what hypocrisy to nominate this type of film for an Oscar from an institution simultaneously applauding humanitarians such as Angelina Jolie.I can only hope the documentary will fade into a grey memory and the subjects themselves UNTIL they are brought to international justice for the crimes they have and still commit against humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a word from the director added to the beginning of the film, Josh Oppenheimer rather fatuously assures us that really evil people only exist in the movies, and that most of the great crimes of history were committed by folks like you and me. Of course we all know there are such cases - Nazi officers who believed they were doing their duty, participants in the Milgram experiments. But that's now what we are shown: what we are shown is already pretty ruthless self-styled "gangsters" used by their government to carry out a bloody job. These are not ordinary folks caught up in the web of circumstances.The film is supposed to show us one of these "gangsters," its central character, coming to realize how awful what he has done is. IMDb puts it this way: "Most dramatically, the filmmaking process catalyzes an unexpected emotional journey for Anwar, from arrogance to regret as he confronts, for the first time in his life, the full terror of what he's done." It's not clear whether Joshua Oppenheimer believed this, but if he did, the narcissistic Anwar Congo took him in. Congo didn't realize anything except that he had been given a chance to be in a movie with the dramatic role of a lifetime. Think of the moment that's supposed to exemplify this supposed dawning of conscience: Congo says something like "Did my victims feel as bad as I did in that scene?" and Oppenheimer, off screen, replies that they felt worse, because Congo knew he was only in a movie, and they knew they were really going to die. That's *exactly* the way the banal Hollywood screenwriters who wrote the films Anwar Congo so admired would have written the scene. So think again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is a fascinating movie with a unique approach to presenting some of the details on the killing of hundreds of thousand Indonesian "communists" in 1965 and 1966. The murderers responsible for the killings tell the story themselves.I'll give the movie 8/10. It is an important movie to watch, about events that we (at least here in Europe) haven't heard much about previously. Not traveling to Indonesia any time soon after seeing this film? However!... there are a couple of points which made me feel slightly uncomfortable and is why I didn't give a full score:- First of all ? I can't see how this can be labeled as a documentary. The story is told by individuals who have been tricked to think they are participating in a completely different sort of film. Their descriptions sound believable ? however there clearly isn't much focus on getting factual/real descriptions ? particularly when several of the re- enactments are done in cowboy-costumes and/or drag-outfits. The movie they think they are making obviously isn't a documentary ? so for all we know they might be either just be making up stories and/or heavily exaggerating to fit their own ambitions for the partly fictitious film they think they are participating in. In short ? it's hard to know what is real or not. I don't really doubt that these guys are killers ? but the way it is presented blurs out the lines between fiction and reality to such an extent that I can't label this as a documentary.- Secondly,(after googling and reading about it after the movie..)the murder of several hundred thousand people in Indonesia in 1965 and 1966 is an event that deserves more respect than this movie gives ? particularly since it attempts to be a documentary. How to kill someone by strangling them with wire really doesn't need to be demonstrated five times ? lingering on the same gruesome details might appeal to the horror-movie crowd ? but it becomes somewhat disrespectful to make a horror-movie out of such serious events. Particularly when mixing in comic-relief and a complete lack of factual information.</fullReview>

It's a decision that will haunt me to the grave, even though I was told that he was dying from heart disease (I watched him suffer to a degree that I couldn't even BEGIN to imagine was possible). Watching THE ACT OF KILLING actually made me nauseous. My revulsion at seeing these members of the Indonesian thugocracy reenacting their crimes against Humanity rivaled my revulsion at seeing the sociopathic members of the Bush theocracy still soft-peddling THEIR war crimes during their rape and murder of Iraq. "In less than a year, with the direct aid of Western governments, over one million 'communists' were killed," we learn in THE ACT OF KILLING. Says Anwar Congo (whose preferred method of strangulation was a wire garrotte): "This is who we are." "He's a happy man," his friend observes. Echoing the American media's build-up for the debacle in Iraq, the Thugocracy in Indonesia benefited from the complicity of newspaper publishers (who laugh about lying about Communists). When Congo says he has nightmares about what he did, accomplice Adi Zulkadry tells him: "You feel haunted because your mind is weak." The trick to living without guilt, Zulkadry explains, is "all about finding the right excuse." (I can attest to the fact that we ALL do that...) "It's not a problem for us," he tells Congo: "It's a problem for History." He concludes: "I believe even God has secrets." Alongside these two upstanding gentlemen we find the unrepentant child rapist Safit Pardede, whose tastes run to the tender fourteen-year-olds. But Congo still claims to feel haunted by a severed head whose eyes he didn't close (the eyes moved, WATCHING him, before the brain died): "Is it the vengeance of the dead...?" Director Joshua Oppenheimer, speaking on DEMOCRACY NOW!, pointed out that "the U.$. CELEBRATED the slaughter." The taking of a single life should NEVER be celebrated, whether it's a dying pet or 2.5 million Communists.</fullReview>

Indonesia may be the world's fourth most populous country, but they don't give Olympic medals for fourth place, do they? Obama's Indonesian step-dad enrolled him in school there during this barbarous nation's darkest hour, as 2.5 MILLION people were being slaughtered, mostly for protesting the John Wayne flicks imposed upon them by the right-wing dictatorship. (Like many Americans, the Indonesian working class viewed "the Duke" as a fate worse than death!) Some of the key executioners of this genocide brag during THE ACT OF KILLING about 1)slaying anyone out of extortion payment cash via beheading-by-wire or sharp-wooden-stakes-shoved-up-their-anuses, 2)being MORE sadistic than the Nazis and Idi Amin Dada, and 3)raping ethnic minority 14-year-old girls. These murder kingpins also supervised legions of Henchboys called the Pancasila. This Indonesian version of Boy Scouts, three million strong today, was the primary youth group available to the young Obama. Yet John McCain did NOT know enough to ask Obama even once about what connection (if any) he had with this organization (which makes Germany's infamous "Brown Shirts" look like Wussies by way of comparison). This documentary proves that today's Indonesia remains a thug state, with rampant government corruption, human rights abuse, and Stone Age policies. Paramilitary vigilante groups such as the orange-garbed Pancasila rub out any hope of reform. Even Mr. Anwar Congo, the other focus of this documentary, cannot think back to Obama's years of residence there without being racked by nightmares and becoming literally sick to his stomach. The brave crew of whistle-blowers behind THE ACT OF KILLING were so frightened of the Secret Service, CIA, Navy SEALs, and Hellfire Missile drones that 37 of them are listed in the closing credits as simply "Anonymous." Obviously, more Americans need to slip into anonymity if this country is to be prevented from becoming the next Indonesia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is a rather off kilter work in that the documentarian lets his subjects take a certain amount of control, directing many scenes themselves. In many respects it resembles Idi Amin: An Auto-Portrait, but is ultimately far more surreal and disturbing. Whereas the aforementioned film indicted a single figure, The Act of Killing targets an entire society.Joshua Oppenheimer allows two participants in the 1965 slaughter of Communists and Chinese in Indonesia, Anwar Congo and his friend Herman, to reenact the killings using the trappings of Hollywood genre movies. What ensues is both comic and horrifying, as Congo and Herman interpret a massive atrocity through the lens of Westerns, gangster movies, and horror films.There are many possible issues to discuss with this film, ranging from the nature of historical memory to the representation of violence on film. However, the most important theme is how a society processes an atrocity. We get a disturbing look at Indonesia both then and now, including the role played in modern Indonesian politics by the perpetrators of the slaughter. Brief appearances by the leader of a paramilitary organization provide a case study in hypocrisy as he easily shifts from posing as a bastion of social morality to making downright perverted comments to women. Perhaps most disturbing are the end credits, which provide an oblique but smashing condemnation of Indonesia's political orders.The film's main flaw is its lack of context. Viewers are not given much background information about Indonesian politics, making it difficult to understand why the atrocities happened. As anthropologist Clifford Geertz once noted, all actions, ranging from winking to genocide, take place in a specific cultural context that needs to be understood to truly grasp the situation. However, this omission serves a broader point about humanity and violence. In the end, all societies rest on violent foundations of varying degrees and must come to terms with their collective legacy of brutality. As one of the killers states, there are people like them all over the world</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea that is chillingly terrifying when it works but needed more structure, context and direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is currently the darling of every critic and is getting close to universal praise and I can understand why. In terms of the concept it is a great one. The film sets out to look at the murders carried out on behalf of the Government of Indonesia and in particular follows Anwar Congo, who reportedly killed over 1000 individuals, garroting them with a thin piece of wire after torturing and questioning them. Instead of doing it remotely or with interviews though, the film asks them to recreate the murders for a film using whatever methods they want. The result is not really a documentary but a film that is hard to explain and hard to watch; it is horrifying one minute and absurd the next.It works best when we see the characters themselves because it is genuinely chilling to see how their morality has shifted so badly. They were the "winners" and it seems they are lauded for their actions even though there is a certain knowledge of how awful what they did was. Several people express concerns about how this will all look on film if they do it right, that it reveals their cruelty but generally they don't have doubts. Congo seems to have some remorse as the film goes on but it seems to be mostly for himself ? not for those whose lives he took. There is a real problem with the film though, because it really needed a lot doing to it to make the most out of the concept.So the concept plays out and at times it is chilling to see these deeds and to understand their cruelty and murderousness but beyond this the film doesn't utilize it well enough. There is very limited historical context and mostly it is delivered in text at the very start of the film. I would have really liked more of an understanding, more documented detail to be delivered as we wander through the concept. I get the feel that the makers wanted to see where it went as they shot, which is fine, but the edit room is where this should have been firmed up and more of a structure given to the material. As it is, the film feels like it doesn't have a goal beyond just the concept, because it delivers this but doesn't do well enough for the total structure. As a result it occasionally feels aimless and seems to leave so much unasked and unexplored.It is a great concept but it is a great concept in search of a more effective film. It is great in specific moments but as a whole I really wanted more of an aim, a structure, a direction. It is worth seeing for the concept, but it had the potential to be more than just a good concept but sadly it doesn't deliver on it as it really should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have been to south east Asia (Malaysia) with the RAAF in the seventies. The street scenes reminded me of the dirty and crowded streets of Penang in the 1970's. The perpetrators of the Communist killings of 1965 shown in the documentary show no remorse for their actions and even brag about it in no uncertain terms.It's hard to believe that these people are adult supposedly thinking human beings responsible for their actions. In some scenes they seem more childlike in their references to acts of killing fellow human beings, ideology aside. What really worries me is the fact people like this exist in a country just outside our borders. If only half of what is shown is true then we have much to be worried about. When you watch this it must be remembered these Asian people do not have any sense of British fair play, they don't consider a moral sense of justice. The man smiling almost laughing when telling the story of the murder of his parents is really disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst excuse for a documentary or movie I have EVER seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever written in to pan a movie before. This piece of trash, with zero research, background information, cinematography or interesting dialog is utterly worthless. The rave comments are astounding! There is nothing here.....some old guy and a goof ball saying they killed a bunch of people. Well, maybe they did, and maybe they didn't. It is not horrifying, it is senseless and boring.I'll admit I'm only 1/3 the way through the film. I will finish it. But I think it is the worst trash I have ever ever seen.I cannot fathom the compliments. It could all be made up. True or untrue makes no difference. It is boring and worthless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, a new level of honesty has been reached. Slavoj ?i?ek, love him or hate him, shares an idea of mine - that we are in a very bleak moment of history - When he was talking with Julian Assange (Wikileaks), about US war (&amp; other) crimes; he said something about how amazing it is that these days people can be caught red-handed in said war crimes, yet with stupefying impunity, simply reply with the likes of 'So what'!?Welcome to sinister conundrums and lack of accountability 101; where post modernity has brought us. Welcome to an amazing Doco that shows us this stark reality, transplanted to Indonesia. Imagine these days, hopefully less people (than at any other point in history) would accept an official criticism of Indonesia from the International Community. Why, of course the USA supported Suharto, fascists and the massacring of (supposed) Communists.So, there you have it - eternal impunity, and let's look forward to a huge amount of war crimes &amp; genocides, still happening and still to come! (Sarcasm's in the 'look forward to it' part, nowhere else, unfortunately).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a great concept. Interview those who were responsible for the deaths of innocent Chinese in the Indonesia in the 60s.It was astounding to see how two different mass killers reflect back on the grisly events, one with no guilt all and the other we see who has nightmares yet, still laughs and jokes about the killings, the blood, the body bags, and he even instructs the audience on how to kill with a fast, easy and method! ( Like we really needed that clip in there, Josh? Especially since we saw the method over and over in reenactments?) Any redeeming value ends there. The director clearly wishes to rub our noses in the blood, sadistic acts, the gore, and murders well beyond what is needed to tell the story. He seems to go for the shocking, disturbing and sensationalistic events, even after we were exposed to the same details over and over. In doing so, he misses great opportunities to explore in greater depth, the militant organization responsible for these atrocities and the psychology of how both killers handle the memories.To conclude: Would you want to watch a bunch of Nazis talk and laugh with pride how they tortured, burned, maimed, and raped the Jews? In gruesome detail? For 2 hours? The camp factor with one of the killers in drag made me want to see the film, thinking it was some kind of parody or creative take on an atrocious, yet historically significant event. BUT NO. It is just thrown in there for "entertainment" to offset the sickening details of gruesome murders and rape that we were forced to sit through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amateur Film about a Serious Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Act of Killing is a documentary that, according to Rotten Tomatoes, "offers a haunting testament to the edifying, confrontational power of documentary cinema." Actually, The Act of Killing offers starkly amateur depictions of horrific events. It's poor film-making at best and exploitative at worst. Imagine you and your friends for some reason try to re-create scenes from the holocaust. You go down to the Halloween store, buy some campy outfits and fake blood. Then you proceed to act out scenes from history. The results are of the same quality and perspective as The Act of Killing. The scenes are inappropriate, silly, and dare I say again, amateurish.This film is about a tragedy, but the tragedy is the missed opportunity to capture an important time in history. The director should be ashamed at mocking the deaths of innocent people.The end of the film is just ten minutes of an old Indonesian gangster dry-heaving. It's really the only interesting footage in the whole film. Seriously, screw this film.</fullReview>
