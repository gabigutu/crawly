		<shortDescription>The first-class suspense film that foreshadowed conscious and technique...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1955 a young man, who had produced a couple of 35mm. shorts and a feature which were so little known that they were never even shown in England, made a suspense thriller? From the fact that he co-produced it, wrote it, directed it and did the photography and editing himself you may deduce that he had more talent than backing? The movie was called "Killer's Kiss," and the multi-talented man who made it was the young Stanley Kubrick? "Killer's Kiss" is a fascinating movie to look back as it is a notable thriller in its own right? It is a film about lonely people; alone people, which is not quite the same thing; their roots almost severed from a past which was once good and is now lost; solitary in the impartial big city at the end of the line? It starts with a confident, quiet slowness that few directors would dare in the frenetic Seventies? It takes its time to develop, and for nearly half the film you can't guess what the plot is going to be? But this carefully measured film gives you a deep feeling for the characters and their context that leaves you, even after all the suspense, with an overwhelming feeling of the humanity of the movie? The narrator, Davy Gordon (Jamie Smith) is a young and fading boxer, past it, but not defeated in his heart? The girl Gloria Price (Irene Kane), who lives in the same apartment block, has, like him, no family nor friends? She's come down to working as a dance partner in a shabby hall run by a baddie called Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera).Kubrick slowly, and movingly, shows the two principals taking the downgrade: Davy fighting a losing bout in the ring while Gloria is trying to push off some heavy passes from Rapallo? Even he, Rapallo, is made human, understandable? When he stands in his shadowed office, making up his mind to some malice, his eyes fall on cozy family photographs in nice domestic frames that he takes the trouble to keep there; and, when his mind is made up, he gestures irritably, guiltily, as if knowing he's letting them down and trying weakly to dismiss summarily aside their silent reproaches? The whole story is condensed into three days? Yet it seems to have the natural, inevitable pace of real life; and the moments briefly taken out for little touches of New York street scenes add to the reality and place it in a context of truth? Very little violence is actually shown except in Davy's boxing match which, in just a few minutes, gives a better feeling than most movies of what it's like to lose a fight in the ring? But, in spite of all, you're on the edge of your seat and you're glad to be there? There is a classic chase over the rooftops, but even here there are human touches that kill cliché? These villains are not supermen, any more than Davy is: they can stumble on a fire escape, and not for laughs; one of them can fall as you or I would fall and drop out with a twisted ankle? The suspense is not lessened by these touches: it is increased, because it is more real, seems less contrived? "Killer's Kiss" was a first-class suspense film that foreshadowed conscious and technique that Kubrick was to take to the limit in later years? And, after all, the ending was fair enough for the Fifties? In the Seventies, Gloria would probably have got raped by the railway porter, and there'd have been a lot of unlovely detail and no suspense at all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrik's kiss to New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, directed by Stanley Kubrik, is not seen often these days. It was a surprise that it was shown recently on cable as it gave all of Mr. Kubrik's fans the opportunity to watch one of his early works.The copy that was shown is amazing in that it has been kept, or probably restored, with great care. Stanley Kubrik was a genius; he probably knew more about movies than many other of his contemporaries. Yet, his legacy is somehow meager, only sixteen full length features in almost fifty years as a director.Killer's Kiss shows the Manhattan of 1955 like it has never been seen in other movies made in the city. Mr. Kubrik's attention to detail and style overshadows the story. The main problem is his screen play, it never involves the viewer in what he is seeing. This is exacerbated by the voice over one hears over the action. We never know what makes these people tick, much less what's going on in their heads at any given moment.The story is told in a flashback. We see Davy waiting at the old Pennsylvania Station for the train that is to take him to Seattle. He had planned to leave with Gloria, but she seems never to appear; for all we know, he might be waiting in vain.The streets of Manhattan come alive in the brilliant black and white cinematography by Mr. Kubrik, himself. That old New York that is no longer around, is captured by Mr. Kubrik in such brilliant detail that we mourn the fact those buildings and institutions are not around any more. The night scenes around Times Square, especially the stairway leading to the dance hall have a style that brings some of Edward Hooper's work to mind. Mr. Kubrik deserves credit for filming on location and never making it feel as though those scenes have been fixed to give that effect. In fact, that's where Kubrik's genius comes into play, we realize he had an eye for making things real.The acting is not the main focus of this film. Frank Silvera makes a menacing Vincent, the mobster and dance hall owner. Jamie Smith and Irene Kane, go through the paces, but they don't convey to the viewer the passion that is supposed to be going on between them.This movie should be seen by the serious moviegoer as it shows Mr. Kubrik's tremendous talent. It might be a minor film, in comparison to his best work, but being one of his first movies, one can clearly see what will come later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sneak Peek At Things To Come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young Stanley Kubrick's bare-budget film - perhaps his first "mainline" movie - shows him still in the minor leagues but very close to making it to the Major Leagues. In fact, he did so the following year with "The Killing," a film noir that still ranks among the best. At any rate, this is an opportunity to see Kubrick at work right before he "makes it" in the business.With an almost-nothing budget you aren't going to draw too many professional actors, and that certainly was the case here, but still is worth watching. It's definitely a "B" noir that is more melodrama than crime until the ending when it gets very, very suspenseful featuring a chase over New York City rooftops and then into abandoned warehouses.Jamie Smith and Irene Kane are the stars and if you've never heard of them, it's probably because they weren't exactly Humphey Bogart and Bette Davis, acting-wise. The other star, Frank Silvera, at least is a name I recognized.Overall, the best feature may be the camera-work. It gives us a preview of the visual talents that Kubrick would bring to the big screen in following decade. On its own merits, if you are a film noir fan, you'll want this in your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's fully formed masterpiece at age 27</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At an age when most wannabe filmmakers are still 'in training' Stanley Kubrick was producing full length feature masterpieces.I'm still shocked at how many fans of Kubrick's later work do not appreciate Killer's Kiss. While the basic plot of the movie is nothing special and decidely more 'Hollywood' than Kubrick's later works there are more signs of his trademark style in this film than I feel there were in The Killing or Paths of Glory. Kubrick's own cinematography in particular blew me away. The use of depth, light and shadow and of his trademark moving camera show us more skill and thought than directors with dozens of films and much better scripts under their belt. And Kubrick's trademark use of his camera to observe silently, capturing the true spirit of his characters when they are alone (no music, no dialogue) is seen over and over in the apartment. If Kubrick's direction could turn a story like this into such a masterful cinematic experience I shudder at what he would of done with this film had he made 10 or 20 years later. If you love the unique cinematic idiosynchracies of Kubrick's later work then you MUST SEE KILLER'S KISS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A early start to Kubrick's fantastic career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 3 short films and a feature (Fear And Desire [1953]) under his belt, none of which had received any notice (in fact, Kubrick bought up all of the existing prints of Fear And Desire, because he thought it was poorly done [not to mention that it was being billed as a sexploitation film]), Kubrick decided to try out something new. He decided to go with Film-Noir.The film is filled with Kubrick trademarks through and through. He uses boxing (which was the subject of his very first short Day of the Fight [1951]), zooming techniques, flashbacks (also used in his next film The Killing [1956]) and narration. The cinematography is exquisite, as usual, with many shots (particularly in the boxing studio and the train station) being backlit with a soft, grey light to give it a disconnected, almost rear-screen-projection feel. However, it is obvious that this is the early, naive Kubrick at work here. The entire movie, like Fear And Desire, is post-dubbed (much like a Fellini film), with all of the sound effects being done over by a meticulous Kubrick. And, of course, the Film-Noir. Davey Gordon (played to perfection by Jamie Smith) is the almost-stereotypical Noir anti-hero, with Irene Kane (aka journalist Chris Chase) as his anti-heroine. Frank Silvera, who had the lead role in Fear And Desire, is the slimy villain, whom you actually want to die (a good sign [for a villain]).This Kubrick film can most be compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Barry Lyndon (1975), in that, once you get past a slow beginning, the end is absolutely riveting. Kubrick knows that he wants to grab his audience, and he does so with perfection. Some of it is padded (the ballet sequence is not particular interest), but the rest it great, from the initial boxing sequence to the chase scene at the end. If you're a fan of Kubrick, see it. If you're a fan of great cinema, see it. If you're a fan of Film-Noir, see it (but take it with a pinch of salt). If you're none of these things, see it, and you will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genius of a Young Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss is a 1955 movie produced, directed and written by a 27 year old Stanley Kubrick. Coming off the heels of a poorly received first effort, 1953's Fear and Desire, Kubrick stormed back with an interesting little story set in the heart of New York City. The film's protagonist Davy Gordon, is a struggling local boxer who gets involved with a woman, Gloria Price who's ex, Vincent Rapallo hasn't let go of her yet. Kubrick slowly, and movingly, shows the two principals taking the downgrade: Davy fighting a losing bout in the ring while Gloria is trying to push off some heavy passes from Rapallo.While the pair try to flee the city, Rapallo and his henchmen foil there escape. Price meanwhile, has changed her mind and decides she's better off with a real man, Rapallo. In the thrilling climax, Gordon and Rapallo battle it out in a run-down mannequin factory which foreshadows his technique shown in later masterpieces. "Killer's Kiss" was a first-class suspense film that foreshadowed conscious and technique that Kubrick was to take to the limit in later years. After all, the ending was fair enough for the Fifties. Out of a possible 5 stars, I give young Stanley Kubrick's "Killer's Kiss" 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting early Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's career really took off in 1956, upon the release of his first masterpiece; "The Killing", after which he would go on to make many much loved cinema classics such as "Dr Strangelove", "The Shining" and "A Clockwork Orange", to name a few. This movie is, however, no masterpiece; but that's not to say it's without it's plus points.First and foremost, this movie is admirable for it's directing, which is excellent. Of course Stanley Kubrick would go on to show himself as a genius behind the camera, and this movie is an early taste of that genius in the directorial department. Secondly, despite the B-grade cast, the acting is not bad at all. It's not marvelous, but considering the cast's accomplishments, previously and after this movie was made, it's better than one would expect.One of the movie's major flaws, however, is its lack of ideas. There are some nice ideas in the film, such as the part where Gloria tells her story to a backdrop of her sister doing ballet, and the Rear Window style way that the Gloria and Davy meet, but as the film is only 67 minutes long, it felt at times that Kubrick was spending too long on certain sequences, which is a problem if the movie is as short as this one is as it looked as though Kubrick was just dragging things out in order to meet an acceptable running time. That might be so bad in a longer film, but here it's not good.This movie is a nice, taut little thriller and is definitely recommended to people that want to see some early Kubrick and thereby see how he developed as a filmmaker, but it's not a great film and I don't recommend going into this movie expecting it to be one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick deals with murderous obsessions in this 1955 Film-Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers** Stanley Kubrick's debut film about obsession and murder on the gritty and dangerous streets of midtown Manhattan and the empty and deserted factory lofts along the Brooklyn waterfront. With a number of fine performances by Jamie Smith &amp; Gloria Price as the two unlikely lovebirds Davy Gordon &amp; Irene Kane and especially Frank Silvera as Irene's jealous and obsessive former boyfriend Vicent Rapallo. Who runs the Pleasureland Dance-Hall where Irene works as a dance partner for the customers who go there for their nightly entertainment. Davy who's a professional boxer just came back from the sports arena after getting his brains scrambled by the up and coming world welterweight contender 22 year-old "Kid" Rodriguez, who knocked him out cold in the first round of their match. With his boxing career on the ropes the 29 year-old washed-up fighter was nursing his wounds when he hears a scream across the other side of his apartment building. With the women, Irene, in question being beaten up by her boyfriend,Vincent, and comes to the women's rescue as Vincent flees the scene. Irene had just broken up with Vincent who's also a part-time hoodlum as well as dance-hall manager. After spending the next morning with Davy, who had breakfast in her apartment, Irene decides to leave New York City with him for Seattle. It's there where she can live and find work together with Davy on his uncle's horse farm. Davy and Irene plan to meet after they both get paid at Penn. Station in mid-town Manhattan for a train to Washington State.Davy gets in touch with his fight manager Albert, Jerry Jarret, and tells Jerry to meet him at the Pleasureland Dance-Hall to pick up his check for his fight with "Kid" Rodriguez. Meanwhile Irene also goes to the dance-hall to get her severance pay from her former boyfriend Vincent. After having it out with him, when he begged her to please stay, Vincent sends two of his thugs outside the dance-hall to kidnap Irene and also work over Davy who's expected to meet her outside the place. Instead they mistake Jerry for Davy and end up beating him to death as they grab and take off with the terrified Irene. Davy getting to the dance-hall late, due to him chasing these two wackos who stole his scarf, goes home and takes his belongings to go to the train station the next morning thinking that Irene left and deserted him. Checking Irene's apartment Davy finds it empty but as he's there he sees outside the window into his apartment two police officers talking with his super about him being suspected of murdering his manager Jerry earlier that night. Realizing now what really happened and him being framed for Jerry's murder Davy get's a taxi to Vincent's place at the dance-hall. After taking him hostage Davy has Vincent drive him to a Brooklyn warehouse where his two hoods, who murdered Jerry, Mike Dana &amp; Felice Oriandi are holding Irene captive. Exciting final with Davy battling both Vicent and his two henchmen with a real knock around battle with Vincent in a garment factory loft filled with mannequins that are used as deadly weapons in the fighting; together with axes and steel-hooked poles, with Vicent ending up dead and Davy arrested for murder. Davy is later vindicated at the police station for Vicent's death due to self-defense but Irene whom Davy rescued leaves the precinct without going with him to the train station to leave for Seattle, as she said earlier she would. We see this all in a flashback by Davy, reflecting on what he went through the last three days. Feeling hurt and dejected as Davy's about to get on the train by himself he spots running to the train station Irene! The film ends with Davy now knowing that he's not alone as he and Irene both kiss and leave for Seattle together like they planned to do in the first place. Stanley Kubrick showed in his first major motion picture "Killer's Kiss" just what the movie going public could expect from him in the future when he has more money and experience to put into the movies. Movies that he'll make and direct. And after some 44 years up until his death in 1999 the movie going public were never disappointed in any of his cinematic efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kubrick film at only 67 minutes - can you believe it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's just over an hour long and even so we have the trademark Kubrick opening, where he takes his own sweet time in letting us know what the film is about but somehow draws us in all the same. Look: it's an hour long, and it's a slight, hour-long kind of story. Don't expect anything more. I think there's also rather clearly a moment when Kubrick realised that he didn't know how he was going to end it all - to be honest, I have a sneaking suspicion that a similar thing happened on "2001", "Eyes Wide Shut" and even "Dr. Strangelove". In each of these cases it was the prompt for a daring and unconventional conclusion. I wish I could say that was the case here.This doesn't prevent it from being involving while it lasts. Kubrick once again demonstrates the he could point a camera at anything at all and make it interesting - the images are amazing, yet entirely functional. If you have ever loved any black-and-white camera work you'll love this. It's also a masterpiece of violence-without-violence, if you know what I mean. It deserves to be more well-known than it is.</fullReview>

Thefilmmaking was great. There were great tracking shots, wonderfuluse of mise on scen, great long shots and close ups.

It was in the morning so there was no tag by Bob Osborne when it ended and since I did not catch the very beginning, I did not see the credits. I saw the boxing match and it was BRUTAL. What a fighter goes through was never conveyed more clearly and more succinctly. I remember Frank Silvera from other films (and it was his name that I looked up to find here at IMD. The actors were unknown and the two leads were not that convincing but the story was riveting. I was prepared for an ending suitable to the type of dark film it had been up to that point. I really liked the ending that was revealed. I came here to read comments on this little known film and was totally surprised to learn that Stanley Kubrick directed it. He told a story in a lean, sparse way that was different from the way he told later films but his genius was showing here. Bravo to all connected with this little gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.There's nothing like this stuff. If you ever thought Kubrick was a genius, you should consider that such an eye is not learned, and one would expect to see it in the young man. Here's where he is taking chances.He produced, wrote, directed, photographed, and edited this effort.Here you see some real energetic expression of more controlled notions you see later on:-- time and space symmetries, lots of them-- lots of narrative in inanimate objects from the environment-- dancing/boxing: life as a test performance, with the space between being dead time-- narrative folding-- a mimimalist, deceptively symbol-laden story that all but ignores the actors-- a consistent `eye,' often from waist level when the lovers are together-- stylized voice-overAll this is fascinating enough. But an extra treat is to see this next to Welles' near masterpiece `Lady from Shanghai' of "48. Check out showdown in the manikin warehouse compared the manikin part of `Lady's' funhouse at the identical part of the story, with the same loser-woman dynamic.Irene Kane has real presence despite her relatively poor acting. Kubrick married her ballerina `sister.' Wonder what happened to her?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic &amp; Visually Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was the director, cinematographer, editor, co-producer and co-writer of his second movie and commendably, despite his lack of experience and an obviously low budget, "Killer's Kiss" proved to be an extremely enjoyable and visually impressive film noir drama.Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith) is a washed up boxer who meets and falls in love with a dance-hall hostess called Gloria Price (Irene Kane) and together they plan to relocate to Seattle. Unfortunately, Gloria's violent employer Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera) has designs on her and dispatches two of his henchmen to deal with Davey. However, due to a couple of unexpected coincidences, the plan goes wrong, the two men kill Davey's manager and the police suspect that Davey is the murderer. In order to prove his innocence, Davey pursues Rapallo and this eventually leads to a final confrontation between the two men when they engage in a spectacular and well choreographed fight for supremacy.Throughout the story the action takes place in locations which seem claustrophobic and often the framing of the shots emphasises this impression. Davey and Gloria's living areas and Rapallo's office are all small. Camera positions which look down on the characters when they're on the stairs in the couple's tenement building and in the dance-hall entrance area also appear to significantly constrict the space they occupy. During a boxing match in which the two boxers are already confined within the ring, when Davey's opponent stands up to start the bout, he is seen from a low viewpoint behind the still seated Davey, with the result that the space which he visually inhabits is made even smaller as he is then seen framed by Davey's right leg. Even the outdoor sequences in the latter part of the film convey the same impression as narrow streets and alleyways surrounded by very high buildings seem to close in on everyone who enters those areas.Some good ideas are also used to make the film visually interesting. Davey's face is seen peering through the water in a fishbowl and the viewpoint is the position of the wall behind the bowl.. Similarly, when Rapallo throws a tumbler at a picture on the wall of his office, the glass is seen shattering from the viewpoint of the picture. A dream sequence is photographed in negative and the final confrontation between Davey and Rapallo is staged in a warehouse full of mannequins in a sequence which is rather reminiscent of the "hall of mirrors sequence" in "The Lady From Shanghai". There is also a brilliantly composed shot of the streets down which Davey is being pursued by Rapallo and his men where the lit area of the street and buildings is reduced to a limited area on the bottom left hand side of the frame with everywhere else being bathed in black shadow. Rapallo's thugs are also shown in silhouette when they attack Davey's manager and their elongated shadows on the walls of the alley seem to exaggerate the sense of danger involved.The night time street scenes shot in Times Square are particularly good and the other New York locations are also portrayed in a manner which powerfully conveys their squalor and potentially threatening atmosphere."Killer's Kiss" is rather short and contains some dead pan performances but its real strength lies in its incredible visual impact and its ability to evoke threatening and oppressive atmospheres so successfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss is an incredible film technically. The lighting, set and cinematography are nothing short of stunning. The cinematography was incredible, and the lighting showed only what Kubrick wanted to be seen.Where the film comes up short is in the plot and the character development. The character's are boring (a great feet to accomplish with a title like Killer's Kiss). The audience doesn't really get involved in the story. The acting isn't wonderful, but at least it's believable. The plot line is extremely poor.Killer's Kiss, shows us where his talents are: Directing, and Cinematographer; and more-so where they don't: Writing. Killer's Kiss is a wonderful film to watch if you like to see good lighting and cinematography, or if your a Kubrick fan. Otherwise, it's not worth the hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The name of movie which were made by one of the most influential director's of 20 century,- Stanley Kubrick were Killer's kiss. The great view of main character of movie were directed to the individualistic part of human society. Dave Gordon man on the ring and jealously writer with wife, trying to balance the life around him. Story is proceeding because of religious aspects and breach of justice which comes to Gordon, like killer's kiss. His lover Gloria Price is Russian neighbor who is ready to support young libertine of love. While Dave's fight Gloria didn't miss the time and plunged to the dark story with broker. The feeling of jealous we could see in Kubrick's parallel describing of relationship between man and woman. When she was in her privacy he was giving his last breath for victory.Kubrick shows us the contradictions of sad boxer's destiny and light of happiness in simple look of Price. The main act begins on the New- York streets. The multicultural boom and its reaction to main citizens was coolly handed given in interior of Gordon's imagery A waltz between words and actions, friendship and relationship, trust and betrayal was ruined by Gloria's misstep. Her simply wave of live made him to be sentimental person ready to do last step in chaotic rhythm of New- York.Dave got the chance to be survived and to put dote in fellow's actions. Gloria were hide by broker and his mob. Feeling to lost his future wife made him to see obvious scene of woman privacy and man's dignity. Last ring between Gordon and broker made first to think about importance of value. The scene of fight was shown through ax in one hand and prowess in another.The dote was put from where story begins. Railway stations of confusing souls, lonely poets, pleasant musicians was exact place for Dave and Gloria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow: right from the start, Killer's Kiss shows a noticeable step up from Fear and Desire- we open in a train station, and will see many people and large sets for the rest of the film. More than a technical advance, Killer's Kiss is an excellent noir with a tight plot and much larger scale than what actually happens. There's a boxer, a dancer, a gangster and his goons, and one big flashback. From the first scene, and the beginning of an ongoing narration, we see that Gordon is alone, so we can focus on the why- it relates to the message.There are great scenes in Killer's Kiss. The boxing is raw, much better than fight scenes of the time: it feels like you have front row seats. The ballerina and exposition of Gloria's life, and the climatic chase and mannequin mangling. The acting is fair, but Rappello is a real slimeball.This is a huge step up from Fear and Desire technically. The shooting is excellent, feeling large and small at the same time. We get treated to some artistic shots as well. The editing is fine, and the lighting is true- noir. The music is fantastic, very upbeat, fast and fitting, adding to the tension where needed. This is visionary directing with funds.Then there's the ending. No spoilers. This was an 8 the whole way through, I was loving it, but then the last scene shatters the message as well as the score. You'll roll your eyes at Gordon's reaction. If you want to see a much better film, end it with 1 minute left.But overall the film is excellent and I feel it's better to have too much than too little- you can edit the ending yourself. A solid noir, and even more promise than Fear and Desire, despite the contradictory ending. 6.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Valuable NYC time capsule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent, B-NeoNoir with the expected trimmings--boxer, dame, thugs, dingy walk-up apartments--given some class (to use the noir vernacular) via Kubrick's lush direction, and a wildly unsettling finale amongst disemboweled mannequins. Earns a place on your "must" list for its remarkable on-location NYC photography, some of the best of any noir. Two locales in particular--the cavernous original Penn Station (already on the road to ruin) and 1955 Times Square with its acres of movie palaces and neon marquees--get plenty of footage, serving as an irresistible time capsule. It lends great realism to one of the least glamorous urban films since the Warner pre-Code era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Kubrick Movie That is Also An Interesting Film Noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Killer's Kiss" (1955), acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick's second feature film, starred Jamie Smith, Irene Kane and Frank Silvera.The story looks like it was partly inspired by Robert Siodmak's The Killers (1946): A boxer called on the slide Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), is awakened from a dream (a stunning piece of surrealism, it's only fault being that it is too short) by the screams of Gloria Price (Irene Kane), who lives on the other side of his apartment block, as her lecherous boss Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera) forces himself on her. Gordon goes to her help, but Rapallo escapes. He falls in love with Gloria, a "dancer" at a nightclub run by Rapallo, but in doing so, he faces Rapallo's wrath and his deadly vengeance.While the plot may be slightly run-on-the-mill stuff, the movie as a whole is certainly not. Shot on the streets of New York by Kubrick himself, the picture benefits enormously by this "breathing" quality, making the story more believable as it's set and shot in a real place, a rare practice at the time (one wonders if Kubrick did this for purely aesthetic reasons: the budget of the movie was only $40,000 or so, extremely cheap even then for a movie). The camera-work is very high contrast black and white, all the automobiles surfaces gleaming and enabling the tower blocks Gordon rushes past during the final look dark and foreboding. He also inserts a few stylistic shots like Gordon looking through a fish-bowl; but Kubrick uses these sparingly so they always look unexpected. Along with the beautiful cinematography, the action is the highlight of this motion picture: a violent and ruthless boxing match early on, shot with a hand-held camera is exciting and brutal; capturing what the sport is really like. Another set piece is justifiably famous: a climatic fight between Gordon and Rapallo in a mannequin store house with fire-axes.But there are flaws, flaws than cannot be overlooked even if one is kind to the young Stanley Kubrick and very lenient. First and foremost is the acting: Irene Kane as the woman who sparks off all the trouble is desperately weak and is hard to see why a Rapallo lust after her and Gordon falls in love with her so quickly. Silvera is excellent as our villain and Smith, while nothing special, is good enough for his part, but because Kubrick opted to film the movie "silent" and then put in the sounds in post-production, not only do you have errors like cars driving in the background but no noise issuing forth from them, but the performances are made rather stilted and the dialogue spoken doesn't always match up to their lips. The motion picture is in (a needless) flashback, so we are given a redundant voice-over and the ending in the train-station is overly-sentimental and it is not only alien to the world of noir, but alien also to Kubrick. Despites these flaws, the movie reminds an enjoyable, at times very exciting, film noir that isn't just for Kubrick buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's "Hearts of Age"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing to be said of KILLER'S KISS is it is promising. Like HEARTS OF AGE was promising for Orson Welles when he directed it as a school project in the 1930s. It's hard to believe, watching this film, that Stanley Kubrick directed first THE KILLING and then PATHS OF GLORY immediately after he did this film. One can see while watching it spurts of Kubrick's inventiveness and story telling ability. Two examples come to mind: the murder of the hero's manager Albert by Rapallo's two bodyguard/goons, and the fight between Rapallo and Davy in the mannequin factory/warehouse. The latter has been well analyzed by critical fans of Kubrick, particularly as he uses the body sections of the mannequins (note the heads and hanging hands, and legs and torsos being thrown about) as a suggestive way of showing how the ax wielding Rapallo can possibly maim and disfigure (if not kill) Davy. As for the former, we see the killing in three stages (the two goons separating Albert from Irene, then the goons forcing a frightened and desperate Albert back into the alley to kill him, and then the two goons leaving the alley - and briefly returning to the alley to make it look like a robbery murder. We never seek Albert dying (we hear later that the poor guy's head was bashed in).Sequences like that are worth noting. It shows what to expect from Stanley once his career takes off. But that doesn't hide the defects of the film. Of the performers, only Frank Silvera (Rapallo) rises to the role of the villain. He is a middle aged creep who has fallen for Gloria, but she is disgusted by him. So he is determined to have revenge on her and on Davy (whom she favors now). But Jamie Smith and Irene Kane are no more than competent (and Jamie Smith is sometimes rather dull as Davy - the fight sequence is okay but no more than that; It's no RAGING BULL). Better, however, is Jerry Jarrett as the doomed Albert, making the most of the scene where he tries to escape the two goons. The actors playing the goons are reasonably threatening, but no more than that (one is surprised that one of them complains when he apparently hurts his leg in chasing Davy). And so it really goes in the film: the acting is barely adequate except for the villain, and you will note that only the villain really had a decent film career.There is also a defect in the script that the later Kubrick would not have made. The genius behind DR. STRANGELOVE destroyed the world in a nuclear holocaust. The man who made PATHS OF GLORY made sure that the film ended on a sad note of hope when Kirk Douglas' Col. Dax hears the soldiers singing the sad song in honor of their three murdered comrades. But the screenplay/story here is crazy. In the last quarter hour Gloria shows her real opportunism in an attempt to save herself at the expense of Davy by offering to return to her relationship with Rapallo. Davy is hurt by this and says as much - he doesn't even try to rescue her when he flees. Yet we see them in each other's arms at the end! Compare that to Michael O'Hara leaving Elsa Bannister to die at the end of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, or Phyllis Dietrichson being shot by Walter Neff after confessing she is rotten but does love him in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Film noir relationships are usually doomed. They rarely are set up for the man to forgive the woman and embrace at the end. In fact, think of the way THE KILLING ends, with Elisha Cook Jr. shooting the traitorous Marie Windsor. That's more typical.The shots around 1955 New York are fascinating. In particular the ones inside the old Penn Station (torn down within a decade despite much public outcry). They too add a bit of enjoyment to the film for New York viewers. But if the total is tallied, while above average KILLER'S KISS is minor Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Masterpiece by Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss is not a famous film. It's barely even a famous 50's film but it is, in my opinion, one of Kubrick's most under appreciated works. The movie follows a boxer who falls in love with his hot neighbor that happens to be in a relationship with a shady rich old guy who (when he finds out about the affair) sends out goons to try to kill them. The actors are superb, especially Irene Kane whose performance of the pragmatic Gloria Price is probably one of the best parts of the film. The film is absolutely beautiful and expertly shot by a young Stanley Kubrick. Some of my favorite shots include a scene in which the movie's bad guy throws something at a window and actually breaks a piece of glass off the screen and another shot in which Daley's eyes are seen through a goldfish bowl. There is also a short dream sequence in the movie that is very strange (much like 2001's space sequence) but is definitely a welcome addition. One of the reasons I truly love this film is the strange relationship between Gloria and Davey and the biggest flaw of this movie is the fact that it skips the interrogation of the two (replacing it with narration) which could have been an opportunity for Kubrick to use Irene Kane even more. In fact, a lot of the film's back story (and...frontstory?) is filled in through narration which might have an artistic purpose, but might also be because of budget constraints. At the end of the movie, Daley describes the events of the movie as being "rather silly" and you never really find out why Gloria loves him, making this movie one of my all-time favorite Romantic crime films that involve boxing somehow and were filmed in the mid-50's by famous directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film has problems, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a *lot* bad things about it. They are pretty obvious when you see the picture. That's why I only gave it a '6'.However, instead of focusing on the many bad points, let me point out some very nice things about it: It looks realistic. The streets of New York are alive. The alleys and the interiors are authentic and give you a sense of actually being there. The story (written by Kubrick) is believable.The last 15 minutes of the film is a real nail-biter. While the final action scenes are certainly choreographed, I never felt as though I was watching Kubrick's second film. Even then, he knew what he was doing, he just made a lot of mistakes (needless to say, he got better). I was going to avoid negativity but I am compelled to say the sound department for this feature did a horrible, sloppy job; that alone takes 3 stars away from my rating.But worth watching for the last couple of scenes, which are amongst the best (or at the least, most memorable) film-noir scenes in history, in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning directing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I'm not a fan of Kubrik's career after 1975;I think his three last works were highly overrated and would not enjoy such a high rating if it were another director.But I must say that "2001: a space odyssey" is by far my all-time favorite .I saw every movie SK made bar the very first one."Killer's kiss" already displays Kubrik's forte ;his stunning directing which mainly shines in the second part makes us forget the triteness of the plot which would be another film noir if there were not Kubrik's Midas touch.The hero,running on the roofs or in geometric streets ,is like an ant,like the astronauts of 2001 lost in the infinite space,or the slaves in the Italian plain or the soldiers in the trenches.Kubrick does not care about his characters,his art is almost totally abstract.Even in the most poignant scenes of "paths of glory" ,his most "moving" movie,the story takes a back seat to the directing (with startling results anyway).The movie is a long flashback and ,what's more intriguing,there are flashbacks IN the flashback.The more intriguing is Gloria's one:during the time -and it's a pretty long sequence - when she tells her story,we see her dead sister dance ,something absolutely unusual in a film noir.THere's more:a very short nightmare scene shows the negative of the film (and thus predates "2001" by more than ten years.It's impossible to pass over in silence Hitchcock's influence though:a lot of scenes recall "rear window" (released a year before)and Irene Kane resembles Grace Kelly.Spoiler:the happy end comes at the most awkward moment and probably stems from the producers' pressure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know. "Killer's Kiss" was one of Stanley Kubrick's first motion pictures and was made with very little money and no great Hollywood star. I know that. But if you compare this one to the perfection of "2001: A Space Odyssey", the brilliance of "A Clockwork Orange", the frightful suspense of "The Shining", the beauty of "Eyes Wide Shut" or with any other great film of his, it's kind of a disappointment.Let's go to the story: a fighter falls in love with his neighbor, the girlfriend of a gangster. This is the plot. Most of the film is predictable and the acting is kind of bland. However, we can see some traces of a young Kubrick. The camera-work is just great, and some scenes can talk for themselves. There's not much dialogue here, and Kubrick fill this with some takes that are, if not memorable, at least beautiful.If you haven't seen any other Kubrick picture, this is a very good beginning. But if you are like me, a huge Kubrick fan, this is not a great film, just a very good one. But I can't give it less than a 8/10, because... hey! It's Kubrick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few flaws and not among Kubrick's best, but solid for a second film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is not among Kubricks' best (his masterpiece to me will always be 2001', though personally rate most of his films very highly indeed), 'Killer's Kiss' is a significant improvement over his previous film 'Fear and Desire' (by far his worst and the only film of his this reviewer deems bad).'Killer's Kiss' has problems. Aside from a suitably slimy turn from Frank Silvera as the villain, the acting is quite weak with a lot of going through the motions and lack of interest. The music is overly bombastic and inappropriately jaunty, instead of fitting with or adding to what's going on on screen it distracts heavily from it. The film also gets off to a rather slow and uninteresting start.Once 'Killer's Kiss' gets going though, it's quite good and solid. There is much more of Kubrick's trademark directing style and it's far more accomplished whereas in 'Fear and Desire' inexperience showed badly. For a very low-budget film, it also looks great, it's beautifully shot and there is some wonderful use of lighting, light and shadow.There is nothing confusing, self-indulgent or irritating about the writing, and aside from a slow start and a couple of moments too stretched out there is enough suspense and tension to keep being engrossed in the atmosphere-heavy story. The climax is just terrific and the ballet sequence is also memorable.All in all, quite good and improves significantly over the mistakes made previously. It's still not perfect and doesn't see Kubrick at his best, but it's still solid. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick Makes Pulp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the rediscovery of "Fear and Desire" (1953), "Killer's Kiss" (1955) no longer bears the curiosity status as Stanley Kubrick's earliest film, and it hardly fits into the Kubrick canon anyways, so to speak. It is, however, an interesting film both from the perspective of its genre and its creator, thus remaining as an enduring meeting place. Although "Killer's Kiss" might be your standard B-movie with a low duration which was probably produced just to accompany a bigger production, it still has its striking moments of poetic intuition. Its finale among abandoned mannequins could very well be a classic. The story as well as its representation have the basic traits of film- noir, the darker crime genre which crystallized in post-war American cinema. The majority of the film consists of a long, mainly uninterrupted flashback sequence as a boxer recalls the past days that have led him where he is now. He became involved with a beautiful woman living next door who has a violent, jealous gangster boyfriend. The boxer and the woman find their reflections in one another. They are two hurt, lost, and lonely souls wandering the streets of New York. Boxing rings, rooftops, apartments, and dark alleys serve as the primal settings of the genre, while a desperate loner, a femme fatale, and a gangster as its archetypes. Strong contrasts in lighting characterize Kubrick's expressive mise-en-sc?ne making several shots prime examples of the film-noir aesthetics. Although "Killer's Kiss" surely has the trademarks of film-noir, it does feel a little bit off, yet not in the masterful sense of "Kiss Me Deadly" (1955). This is most likely due to the film's low budget which, however, also gives the film its gritty touch. One simply gets similar enjoyment from watching the characters walking the streets of New York as in Cassavetes' "Shadows" (1958). Moreover, some of Kubrick's visual decisions with regards to composition and camera angles feel conspicuous. In other words, despite potential weak points in the film's style, it also had the edge and piquancy which give the whole of the film its poetic dimensions.Overall, one might characterize "Killer's Kiss" as poetic pulp. Its stylistic touches rise above its mediocre content. While the film might strike like a sore thumb in a director's oeuvre who later became famous with his sublime and breath-taking images of grandiose awe, it also has the benefit of strangeness which is why it will continue fascinating film buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's promising noir debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boxer Davey Gordon (a likable performance by the brawny and rugged Jamie Smith) finds himself in considerable jeopardy after he rescues dancer Gloria (fetching blonde Irene Kane) from the foul clutches of pernicious gangster Vincent Repallo (a nicely slimy portrayal by Frank Silvera). Repallo sends his men out to kill Davey, but when that fails he resorts to having Gloria kidnapped instead.Writer/director Stanley Kubrick provides a vivid evocation of 1950's New York City, with especially excellent and inspired use of fabulously grungy practical urban locations. Moreover, Kubrick puts an intricate flashback-ridden narrative structure to intriguing use, maintains a tough gritty tone throughout, shows a remarkably attentive eye to meticulous detail which in turn enhances the strong sense of lived-in workaday reality, and stages a few exciting action set pieces with great skill and aplomb (a rooftop foot chase and the fierce climactic fight in a mannequin factory stand out as definite thrilling highlights). Although slightly marred by a sappy ending and some painfully obvious post-sync dubbing, it's still quite an impressive first feature just the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Stanley Kubrick's second film, and it's significantly better then Fear and Desire, his first film. The plot revolves around Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith) a struggling boxer who meets Gloria Price (Irene Kane) when he saves her from gangster Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera). As Davey and Gloria's relationship blossoms, Rapallo gets angry and set's out for revenge. The film shows us these two struggling people and how they are both looking for better lives. The cinematography of this movie is excellent. If you've seen some of Kubrick's photos of New York when he was working for Look magazine, you'll see a lot of that imagery here. The film starts out slowly but escalates faster and faster as it goes. Killer's Kiss is a top notch film noir and it really works. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick Definitely Improved Over His Previous Effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a man waits at a train station for his girl, he tells us about the recent past and we segue into a long flash-back.Killer's Kiss was the second movie directed by Stanley Kubrick, and I do have to say that he definitely made an improvement over his previous film, Fear And Desire. Killer's Kiss is an exceptionally well movie, while it definitely is not a masterpiece (like many of Kubrick's later movies would turn out to be), it is still a good movie. Unlike Fear And Desire, this movie actually has a plot, (Fear And Desire did have one, but it didn't seem like much of one), and the acting is good, as well as the writing. Even more interesting, the film's budget was rather low. But that didn't mean much as far this this movie was concerned, as even with only $75000, Kubrick was still able to make a good movie that shows that he was now really starting to get somewhere as far as his movie talents went. Interestingly, much like Fear And Desire, Kubrick also hated this movie, but I actually liked it, and apparently other people do, and at least it's better than Fear And Desire. I guess it only goes to show that you can only keep doing better the more you go on in show business.Although the movie only takes place during the course of three days, we get a good view of what's going on. It's the story of some people who try to go about their lives normally, but some trouble happens along the way. The cinematography gives the movie a very dark and dramatic appearance to it. In addition, the actors in the movie, particularly Frank Silvera, Irene Kane, and Jamie Smith. There's also some tense action in this movie, like a chase across some rooftops, but Kubrick manages to keep all of it relevant to the plot, and he doesn't try to glamorize things, he keeps it all realistic. Well, being the perfectionist that he was, you'd probably expect something like that to come from a Kubrick movie.In short, it's safe to say that Kubrick definitely made an improvement over Fear And Desire, as this movie was a good movie. If you are really into Kubrick's movies, then you should give this movie a viewing just to see where he really got going before he made movies like A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Barry Lyndon. So all in all, while Killer's Kiss does not rank alongside Kubrick's best works, it is still a good movie that's worth a viewing or two. And lastly, and I know I've said this already, but I'll say it again, it is definitely better than the very silly debut that Kubrick made in 1953, Fear And Desire.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Showcase For Kubrick's Talent With Light.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The techniques of "Killers Kiss", shows a lot more familiarity when it comes to your expectations of a Kubrick picture. A young boxer towards the end of his career, eventually begins to grow closer to a woman who lives in the apartment blocks next to his. A relationship then begins as the two grow closer, as they also plan to collect money from her violent employer. Does things ever go smoothly in these scenarios? I found myself enjoying this work much more than Kubrick's earlier effort "Fear And Desire" (1953), which Kubrick himself tried to remove from circulation. Shot when he was 26 years old, it shows a fantastic use of light when it came to emphasis and also a lot more confidence in narrative and framing. There is a long dance sequence where the Ballerina is played by Kubrick's second wife (Ruth Sobotka), and the sound was post dubbed as the microphone would interfere with the lighting system.Final Verdict: Unfortunately I can't say much about it compared to his previous and later works, as well as only talk mindless movie trivia. But it is worth your time if you can find it, it is usually boxed as an extra in the Home release of Kubrick's next picture "The Killing" (1960). 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a peck on the cheek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Killer's Kiss, I'm going to keep my review brief and pointless. Before Stanley went on making 150-180 minute epics, he started out with this little noir thriller about a boxer protecting the girl next door. At just over one hour this is his shortest ever film and only his only film to have an entirely original screenplay written by him. It's easy to see why Stanley later looked to adapt stories by others, as Killer's Kiss unfortunately isn't up to much at all.Considering that the film was made on a teeny weeny budget of $40,000 raised by friends and relatives (kind of like Darren Aronofsky's Pi) it's actually not too bad. It was also made during the pre-Spartacus era where the studios didn't give Stanley final cut on his films and so his original ending was changed to a happier one. I think a solemn ending would've helped the film be slightly more memorable though.The film is brilliantly shot and I couldn't help but marvel at the use of lighting. Towards the end of the film, the lighting almost becomes another character and adds to the film's incredibly stylish mood. It has the look of a classic noir however, it doesn't have a story to match.It all feels rather too conventional and fairly dull. There's a boxing sequence which the back of the DVD compared to Raging Bull, but it's nothing like and adds little to the story. There's a good fight scene at the end, but by the time it's all over I was left wondering what the point of it was.It's a brief film which features bland characters and a boring story. It is very stylish and lovely to look at but it doesn't have much depth to it. You can tell that it's directed by a man who knows his wizardry, however he clearly hadn't fully learnt his craft yet. Let's hope that the more lauded, The Killing has more to offer in the way of plot and thrills!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting early Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith) is an over the hill prizefighter who's considering returning to the family farm to help out his uncle. Then fate steps in: one night he witnesses a neighbour, the pretty Gloria Price (Irene Kane) being accosted by her employer Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera), a gangster. Davey is almost instantly taken with her, and after getting to know her a little bit, he decides that he will be her protector. That will prove to be a challenge, as Rapallo sends two of his goons (Mike Dana, Felice Orlandi) after Davey and abducts Gloria to boot.Short &amp; sweet, this reasonably enjoyable little noir is compelling viewing for both fans of the genre and of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. It may not be quite as accomplished as his later works (it *was* only his second feature film), but it still has some genuine stylishness going for it. The boxing scenes early on are noteworthy for the camera placement and operation, creating a genuine intensity. Kubrick also edited, shot, and wrote the story (Howard Sackler wrote the screenplay, uncredited), and it's clear that he was a real talent who could go far. There's one mighty fine bit of nightmare imagery, and the story does have a fairly good pace going for it. Unfortunately, the rather loud and jaunty music score tends to work against whatever tension that Kubrick is able to generate. The final battle between Davey and Rapallo is a pretty good one, and the fact that it takes place inside a mannequin factory helps to make it visually interesting. Silvera is fine as the gangster, Smith and Kane (the latter is better known as journalist Chris Chase) less satisfactory in the other principal roles. Ruth Sobotka, who was married to Kubrick at the time (and was also Kanes' sister!), plays the ballerina.Overall, a solid effort although it was with his next picture, "The Killing", that Kubrick really hit his stride.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's Deep Breath Before The Plunge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A severely underrated film-noir that turned out to be far more engaging than expected, Killer's Kiss is no masterpiece in my opinion but it did serve its purpose well as a warm up feature for director Stanley Kubrick's talents before he started churning out one masterpiece after another until the very end of his legendary film career &amp; is as experimental as his other features.The story revolves around Davey Gordon; a 29-year old boxer well past his prime, who's waiting at the train station for his girl and in an extended flashback recounts the happenings of his recent past. Filmed on a shoe-string budget, it presents Stanley Kubrick in charge of the responsibilities of director, cinematographer &amp; editor all by himself, at which he impresses greatly.The film employs many unconventional &amp; new tricks of shooting a picture from start to finish and exhibits the remarkable eye for detail Kubrick has when it comes to camera placement &amp; lighting. Editing also never lets the uncertainty go out of the story &amp; music manages to fit its accompanying sequences rather well. Performance by the cast isn't anything special but every one chipped in fine in their given roles.On an overall scale, Killer's Kiss is a very well crafted &amp; firmly composed film which over the years has influenced cinema in a number of ways with its narrative structure &amp; inventive use of camera angles. But since Kubrick went on to achieve even greater prominence in his later films, Killer's Kiss seems to be faced with no choice but to accept a rank provided at the back. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick is gaining momentum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irene Kane is gorgeous! What a performance. Although, she had her awkward moments in which I felt the behavior didn't match the mood which caused me to become less engaged. Jamie Smith played his role really well and sure intimidated me. Let's just say you wouldn't want to be the guy between him and his gal. And I learned that Frank Silvera has been cast as a white character before due to the inability to really take notice when shooting in black and white. His performance was also really good. I began HATING his character because of how pathetic he made himself out to be at times. But, that was his character and eventually things took different turns that revealed more about his character than you first imagine. I'll leave that to the viewer to find out. Overall, the story is intriguing. It was a well done film for its time. You can see a dramatic improvement in quality over Kubrick's previous film especially in the acting and sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a kubrick's masterpiece of course, but good still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before judging "Killer's kiss" one has to take into account some considerations. It is Stanley's second feature film. With a very low- budget he achieved a decent film noir. Unlike every other Kubrick film, the plot is quite plain and predictable. A classical criminal storyline together with a sensitive love story. The attempt of davey of rescuing her woman from the hands of her crazy boss who is in love with her.I particularly enjoyed the chase and finally the fight between Davey and Rapallo. After a stimulating chase they end up in a creepy warehouse, inside a circle of maniquies and they fight, spear against axe. In a sort of circus-like battlefield, or maybe a colisseum of maniquies, Davey is victorious. Maybe this movie doesn't fit the category of "unique" as his work of the following years would, but if you enjoy film noir then you should definitely watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer's Kiss review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir has always eluded me, but Killer's Kiss is one rare exception. Maybe it's because it's so short, or because the photography is so stylish, or because it has an excellent fight scene at the end. Drag is pretty minimal, as is the story, but what it lacks, the film makes up for in its visual prowess. In fact, with only limited dialogue and plot, the film is best seen as a visual experience: it's a story told with the images, rather than with words or narrative.I've shown this film off to a few folks, and they all find the plot to be pretty stupid and silly. I can't deny that there's not a whole lot to it. It's a very simple story with minimal character development. It is framed as a flashback story, lending some strength to the narrative.What I find most notable, however, is the filming. The photography is top-notch, with superb camera angles, lighting, and composition. Editing is solid. Acting is not too bad, and the writing gets the job done. This production uses very simple, but also very real-looking, sets, props, and costumes. Music is appropriate as well.I find this film to be a quick and easily-accessible dose of quality film noir entertainment. I recommend it.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir from Stanley Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With minimal budget and no real big name stars, Stanley Kubrick directs a straight forward simplistic script,with no frills,drama. Davey Gordon(Jamie Smith)is a washed-up boxer with a glass jaw. At this point in his career, he gets the little, last minute fights that pay just as small. Davey gets several glimpses of Gloria(Irene Kane) that lives in the apartment across from his. She is going through hard times too. She is a taxi-dancer that is trying to break away from her job and her boss Vincent Rapollo(Frank Sivera). The fighter goes with the dancer to collect her last paycheck. The jealous and lustful Vincent gets the idea that Davey and Gloria are now an item and he is willing to commit murder to have her for himself. Rounding out the cast: Mike Dana, Jerry Jarrett, Barbara Brand and Falice Orlandi. KILLER'S KISS is what it is and just happens to be a worthwhile film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith) an unsuccessful boxer becomes involved with a neighbor Gloria Price (Irene Kane) he can see her through his window in the one room dive he rents. She screams fighting off unwanted aggressive passes by her boss at a dance hall (Frank Silvera). Gordon goes to her room and they meet and click learning about each other's lonely failed lives.Silvera possessed with jealousy sends two hoods to beat up Gordon but they instead kill Gordon's manager--they then abduct Gloria. Gordon finds and rescues Gloria in a very intense and suspenseful sequence--including a great fight in a mannequin warehouse.This short movie is intense you develop real rapport with the two main characters--even to a certain extent with the Silvera's character. The ending is very suspenseful.It is obvious from the start of the movie that you are watching something it took talent to create and Kubrick was at the very start of his career. Kubrick's talent and intelligence show through even in this very low budget movie. The key to a good movie has nothing to do with the money thrown at it. Unbelievable.RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one of the thousand stories.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lower east side gets a major role in this extremely short later day film noir that has deservedly found a cult following, thanks mostly to the presence of its director, Stanley Kubrick. Using a cast of mostly unknowns, Kubrick sets up the plot simply through the hero, Frank Silvera, letting the audience in on the fact that he is in trouble, and that he isn't capable of a rational decision because of his predicament. Through flashback, the audience sees his story, a prizefighter who isn't going anywhere, and a Times Square dance hall hostess (Irene Kane) who has fallen on rough times, obsessed with a mixed up childhood thanks to an unloving father, a more talented sister, and a mother who died on the day she was born. These are two screwed up people living in the Naked City who decide to escape it but face opposition from one of Kane's criminal dance partners who realizes that she knows too much about his activities. Remain patient with the convoluted first 20 minutes of the film (which features a flashback within the flashback) and just wait for the second half to explode into a chase downtown near the Fulton Street fish market. Even more gripping is a fight between the hero and villain in a warehouse (involving unclothed mannequins), which is powerful stuff. Downtown Manhattan has never looked so empty and spooky. The filming is rough, the editing sketchy, but somehow it all comes off. Silvera is a great non-traditional movie hero, and Kane a bewitching femme fatal that will keep you guessing as to whose side she is on. "Killer's Kiss" may not be the first crime film to get out of the studio and onto the streets, but it comes off as one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the performances are atrociously bad, the storytelling is clunky and even some of the editing choices are poor. It's certainly not of the great noirs. But Kubrick's photographic talents are quite prominent, and the film looks absolutely fantastic. From the fight scene to the warehouse climax, it's a terrific example of noir lighting. Even the ballet scene, as plodding and unnecessary as it is, looks dynamite. Also the use of real New York locations adds a lot of spice, as does the jazzy off-kilter score. The whole thing has a surreal, almost dreamlike quality to it. At any rate, I'd rather watch this than SPARTACUS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable no-budget film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see the beginnings of the career of a landmark director here.Despite the fact the film had a tiny budget, Kubrick does an impressive job with a tight, simple and compelling story. He undertakes his own photography brilliantly, and the film is generally well edited, particularly the boxing match and the rooftop sequences that are part of the film's climax. However there are a couple of edits that are a bit rough in some places. Nevertheless, the story is compelling enough that you quickly ignore this as you are swept along in the story and root for the hero/heroine. The action sequences are well realised and the payoff is satisfying if corny. In fact, this film the characters are very much archetypes of the films of the time, and is before Kubrick really starts to think about challenging the film-making and storytelling conventions of the industry. Nevertheless there are moments where the directors future can be glimpsed including some use of flashback and some interestingly composed shots, as well as filming on real locations with depth of field without resorting to the trick of process shots for the background.The acting performances are OK, but you feel this is mainly due to Kubrick teasing good performances out of them. Jaime Smith and Irene Kane don't seem to have gone onto prolific careers in acting after this film. Frank Silvera is OK at the main antagonist, and did go on to have a very successful career in television, theatre and film. He gives the most interesting performance in the film. Ultimately though the film belongs to Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2* for performances, 3* for nostalgia, 2* for locale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a B-minus film noir, with C-list thespians, and a look at Stanley Kubrick's fledgling efforts on the barest of "bare bones" budgets. It is indicated that production cost $75K. No U.S. receipts are shown, but they couldn't have been a lot - although it apparently recouped cost and maybe 20% profit in - of all places - Spain.As one person commented, the lead couple certainly weren't Bogart and Bette Davis (hell, they weren't even, say, Sonny Tufts and Vera Ralston).The view of New York City more than a half century ago is one of the best aspects. There is also a silly scene with some "raucous" Shriner's, with fez, teasing the "hero" by grabbing his scarf. This is a glimpse of the "silent-generation" 1950's, especially at this time just a few years prior to the city riots, assassinations, all the Vietnam goings-on, etc. in the 60's. During this time, harmlessly hell-raising Shriners, along with dentists and doctors on convention, and the like, WERE the most adventuresome persons found on city streets.One thing I appreciated was Kubrick's realistic portrayal of the lead male, as a moderately-talented boxer, but possessing a "glass jaw," rather than some sort of minor hero. And the boxing scenes were excellent, despite Kubrick's lack of a budget and many of the technical advances which were later available for boxing genre movies in later years.Actually, the acting was at a level for which "B-" may even be generous, but we perhaps afford it a few more compliments because of who made it. Still, an credible piece of nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I prefer Stanley Kubrick's earlier films to his later ones, I can't help noticing that hardly anyone has remarked upon the dialogue and narration in Killer's Kiss, and how cripplingly bad they are. Even allowing for the limitations of amateur and semi-professional actors, and the fact that every word was dubbed in post-production, each stilted and leaden line just lies there and dies there. As Harrison Ford said to George Lucas about the script for Star Wars, "You can type this stuff, but actors can't speak it". It's amazing that only a year later Kubrick's best film, The Killing, crackled and fizzed with sheer verbal electricity. Killer's Kiss is for die-hard Kubrick fans only, I think - just like Eyes Wide Shut ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweat Filled Outing Of What Was Soon To Come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the critical and commercial failure that was Fear and Desire ?a work Stanley Kubrick reportedly disowned- he released his second feature-length picture, Killer's Kiss. Although deeply blemished, it boldly paved way for the career of one of contemporary cinema's most beloved and greatest directors. As the tagline maliciously utters, "Her Soft Mouth Was the Road to Sin-Smeared Violence", as for its time it was reasonably bloodthirsty, with its intensely choreographed boxing match and gripping finale. Do not let this marketing tagline deter you into believing this is all about fight scenes, because there is a fervent element of romance additionally integrated and so it avoids becoming superfluous.Concluding where it first began, this cold-hearted thriller weaves a noirish web of macho deceit and feverish obsession. Kubrick utilises his minimal budget of $75,000 admirably and displays his talent by making the low-budget appear nearly as costly as the Hollywood productions of the same period. Filming in his hometown of New York City, the city streets are deftly captured with naturalistic maturity and expressionistic manoeuvring. The camera places a morose gaze on its even moodier characters, observing their moping around in a way which echoes their botched ambitions, neediness and boiling frustration.My fundamental gripe with Killer's Kiss is that it feels far too casually strung together, in a way which makes a lot of the scenes feel both useless and ineptly edited. This leads to a dispersal of tension, thus it does not feel as taut as it should do for a film-noir. If you are able to excuse the overly dramatic performances, bare screenplay and weak editing to the shoe-string budget then you will witness considerable vigour in its short running-time (falling little over an hour). Ultimately, it is all about the perishing style with Killer's Kiss because the narrative is far too iffy for much attention to be spared, let alone critically garnered.Kubrick was not eager to "get deep" with his second-feature, but rather to make a name for himself in the industry with something which would allow him to have more control over his future directional attempts. For any aficionados of the man's career there are many examples of themes and imagery which is further studied in the director's later career. So, if you are willing to view this sketchpad of motifs, then prepare to witness the irrefutable promise Kubrick offered with his ominous noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The surfaces of "Killer's Kiss" are more convincing than its under-structure. Its pluses are its noir New York camera work (sense of place and time) its somewhat offbeat narrative and original characterizations, and its economy (a lot on a shoestring). Where it does not cohere is in its effects, such as flashbacks, symbolic scenes, and symbols which may add to the flavor of the film, but not to its meanings. This in turn leads to problems with the ending and in on interpreting the movie on more than one level. In other words, if you dig too deep the film is less convincing.First, the problem with Gloria Price's past-- both the story and the images of her ballerina sister performing that accompanies it. We learn about the multiple tragedies that have shaped her young life--her mother's death at her birth, her father's close relationship to her successful older sister, her sister's suicide over her father's death, and Gloria's own ensuing abandonment (assumed) by the brother in law. Add in the extended performance that fills the screen for the story's duration. The meanings seem lucid enough but how do they enter the movie? Well we do learn why Gloria's alone, that her taking up work at Pleasureland as a partner dancer in what she calls "a human zoo," is explainable, and that the lowly dance form isolates her even further from her sister and memories. But what about it? How does this central story exert itself on the film? Then there is the very drawn out fight among the warehouse mannequins. Very symbolic of something--those hundreds of nude dolls. That Rapallo uses an axe and repeatedly slices into these mannequins makes perfect sense since he has shown himself to be a sadist (tries twice to force sex on Gloria) and this reinforces his killer kiss identity. But how are we to interpret Davy Gordon's wielding some kind of spear and piercing torsos in a graphic way that clearly denotes rape? Davy does seem to see Gloria in a sexual way during the film (e.g. touching her drying lingerie as she sleeps), but this does not approach sadism, womanizing, or rape. In fact, for a boxer, Davy is remarkably reserved. But he does distrust her: he says, "I'm in over my head," and, of course, abandons her when she adopts female wiles to save her own life. But then this reading does not jive with an ending which certainly seems unquestioningly a happy one.(Let me add that the scene before the ending might make more sense in terms of Gloria's growing distrust of men---her father, her brother-in-law, her Boss, and now Davy's flight--but even this ending still does not explain Davy's piercing the mannequins.) Then we have the notes of perversity supplied by the harmonica dancers outside the dance hall on Broadway. Dance again and sexual innuendos again. Outside of adding a sense of underworld menace and city street "arts," what do they contribute to the movie's undercurrents? Last--and least--there's the image of the horse ranch (perhaps a tribute to John Huston's great noir film "The Asphalt Jungle") which surfaces in personal photos, phone calls, and a planned escape. Again this has surface motion, but it doesn't drive the film--the Sterling Hayden character in "Jungle" has a compelling need to break with the rackets and even refuses death so that he can realize a few moments in the pasture of his long dream. In this movie, Gloria is Davy's need, and one gets the impression they would do better in NYC than on his Uncle George's horse ranch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise of a young genius...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the relatively young age of 23 years old, a promising photographer named Stanley Kubrick decided to try his luck at making movies after becoming fascinated by the inventive camera-work of Max Ophüls' movies. The young Kubrick had a promising start, as he quickly sold his first two short films (the documentaries "Day of the Fight" and "Flying Padre") to RKO Radio Pictures' newsreel division, a success that made him decide to quit his job at "Look" and become a full-time filmmaker. However, not everything was easy, as the critical and commercial failure of his first theatrical movie, 1953's "Fear and Desire", almost put a halt to the young filmmaker's career. After this failure, Kubrick decided not to give up and spent the following two years saving money in order to make another movie: "Killer's Kiss", the movie that would pave the way for Kubrick's future masterpieces."Killer's Kiss" is the story of Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), a 29 years old boxer living in New York at the apparent end of his career. After losing another fight against a younger and better opponent, Gordon contemplates to retire and return to his uncle's farm in Seattle to work. However, everything changes when he notices that Gloria Price (Irene Kane), the young lady who lives next to his apartment, is being attacked by a man named Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silver). Gordon quickly intervenes and manages to scare Rapallo away, and this event makes him meet Gloria and discover her life. He finds out that she is a dancer, and that Rapallo is her employer, a violent man that owns the dance hall where she works. While Gordon is quickly falling in love with Gloria, Mr. Rapallo is planning his vengeance, as he is not willing to let Gloria run away from his hands.With a screenplay written by Howard Sackler (who also helped Kubrick in "Fear and Desire"), "Killer's Kiss" was based on an original story by Stanley Kubrick himself (something he would never do again) that in many ways seems to reflect Kubrick's vision of New York in those years. Essentially a crime film deeply rooted in the film noir genre, "Killer's Kiss" deals with Gordon's adventure through the dark side of New York and his gazing into the morbid world of low-life gangsters. It's certainly a very simple story, and while the quality of the dialogs ain't really amazing, Kubrick and Sackler manage to add nice twists to the plot, a good dose of suspense, and specially, an interesting development of the characters and their relationships. They all seem very human and realistic, which together with the dark and gritty world they inhabit enhances the realism of his story.While the story may not be of the quality Kubrick would achieve later in his career, visually "Killer's Kiss" is a joy. With a superb work of cinematography, Kubrick captures New York city at its darkest with a raw and gritty style that fits perfectly the tone of the film. His mix of light and shadows in the noir style is remarkable, and adds a lot of atmosphere to the movie. Taking a realist approach to the story, Kubrick seems to give a good use to everything he learned by making documentaries (the fight scene brings back memories from his first short, "Day of the Fight"), and it is in fact his dynamic camera-work what makes the movie special. Finally, the music by Gerald Fried (who also started his career in Kubrick's first short) is another of the highlights of "Killer's Kiss", subtly adding a morbid and somber tone to the movie's images.Well, the acting is not exactly good, as with the exception of Frank Silvera and Jamie Smith, nobody in the cast was a professional actor at the time of making "Killer's Kiss". As boxer Davy Gordon, Smith is actually good and is very convincing as a fighter whose better days are in the past. While his character is a tough guy, Smith manages to give him an everyman look, making really easy to sympathize with him. Like Smith, Frank Silvera is also good in the role of Mr. Rapallo, the sinister owner of the dance hall, although at times he is not as convincing as Smith. However, Kubrick's screenplay makes Rapallo more human than the villain caricature that it could had been, and Silvera truly takes good advantage of that. It is Irene Kane as Gloria Price where the movie fails, as she seems unable to do with her character something more than looking great on film.Sadly, the rest of the cast is actually worse, with the probable exception of Jerry Jarret, a non-professional actor who is very convincing as Gordon's manager. The bad quality of the acting truly diminishes the power of the writers' script, as while the dialogs aren't exactly good, the bad acting makes them sound even worse. Still, Kubrick's visual poetry is what makes the movie to stand out among the rest as despite its flaws it shows that the young photographer who made it was truly a promising talent. Shot in areas near the apartment where Kubrick lived on those years, "Killer's Kiss" is like an oddly attractive postcard of those sides of New York where nobody would like to get lost, as Kubrick makes this dark and gritty story a haunting portrait of his city showing its best and its worst faces at the same time.While at first sight it may seem that the movie is important only because a young Stanley Kubrick made it, "Killer's Kiss" really has some interesting elements on its favor. Kubrick's powerful cinematography and skill as a storyteller are already displayed here, as well as his skillful use of music to add atmosphere to the scenes. While certainly weak in some aspects, "Killer's Kiss" is an excellent film noir that most importantly, would attract producers for Kubrick's first masterpiece: 1956's "The Killing". 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexual Violence &amp; the Production Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone know if the Production Code (1934-1967) had any affect on the final cut of Killers Kiss? I heard that the film had sexually explicit scenes before Kubrick finally sold (and re-edited) it to UA or whatever studio. Can anyone point out some of the more implicit sexuality of the movie? I know that sexual violence was a big theme in Kubrick's movies and that he would go to some length to smuggle the not so implicit sexuality under the nose of the censors. Clock Work Orange (1971) being the most obvious example of sexual violence, where a woman is beaten to death with a big dick statue, in Eyes Wide Shut (1999) where a masked orgy becomes the almost cult like murdering of Tom Cruise and even in Fear and Desire (1953) where the horny solider can't help groping the female hostage. Lolita (1962), made just five years before Hollywood's adoption of MPPA film rating system, was absolutely ruined by the Production Code and a lot of the implicit stuff sexuality was deeply imbedded. So maybe some of the more alert and perverted IMDb users can pint out some of the implicit sexuality in Killers Kiss. I'll start with the fight scene in the manikin warehouse. Using the limbs of the female body for violence. Violence generated by the desire for a female.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, Feverish, a Mess?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second feature film directed by future critical darling Stanley Kubrick, Killer's Kiss isn't a particularly good film. With its very basic "B" film noir plot, choppy editing, post-dubbing and "interesting" acting from the unknown cast, the film should really be a chore to get thru. However, it represents a worthwhile investment of our time for two main reasons. One is of course to witness the early work of a most revered and talented director. The other is because of some indelible images that exist within the piece, images crafted around authentic New York locations.The plot revolves around Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), a 29 year old New York boxer at the end of his career, and his relationship with a dancer and her violent employer. Love, violence and revenge all crammed into one sweaty New York weekend. Kubrick co-wrote the screenplay with Howard Sackler, he also edited, co-produced and photographed the picture himself. All financed by cash generated from friends and family of the novice director.While there is nothing to write home about in the writing, certainly there is no hint of the creative writing flair Kubrick would show later in his career, it's with the visuals and to a lesser extent, the sound work, that Killer's Kiss shows that the powerful director was quick out of the traps. The whole film comes across as some feverish fairy-tale, one which at frequent moments shifts to some sort of surrealistic nightmare. The effects aided by the use of negative film stock and the tilting blend of opposing character scenes. Sexual aggression segues with a brutal boxing match, a ballerina dancing sequence takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the loud streets. Streets where bizarre fez wearing musicians prance about gaily, and where shadowy figures follow men down alleyways to enact a brutal crime. All distorting, memorable stuff, capped off by an axe fight in a mannequin factory, the dismembered parts used not only a weapons, but also as a point of reference to the weird thematics laid down by Kubrick.With stark black and white imagery augmented by the harsh music, and Kubrick dallying with close ups and low angle camera shots, Killer's Kiss is never less than engrossing from a technical viewpoint. Think of it like that weird dream you had when you had taken too much cough syrup that time, and you will be half way there. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While very far from perfect, it's an amazing example of a very good movie made with practically no budget!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am about to say something so radical, that many film lovers will probably automatically dismiss the rest of this review. I much, much prefer director Stanley Kubrick's earlier work. While later in his career he became known for his obsessive-compulsiveness that led to him often filming the same scene a hundred or more times, in his earliest work he was quite the opposite--shooting the scene right the first time because he couldn't afford to use a bazillion feet of extra footage with each film. He was a master of the simplistic and reminded me, a bit, of Sam Fuller--who was also an incredibly talented director when given almost no budget. Both actually were not at their best when the studios gave them more money--at least when you are looking for the percentage return on their investment. Sure, Kubrick also did some great films with a large budget (DR. STRANGELOVE comes immediately to mind), but for tight and exciting films, it's hard to beat KILLER'S KISS or THE KILLING--two exceptional Noir films.Now I am NOT saying that KILLER'S KISS is a perfect or even near-perfect film--there are some technical problems that make it obvious it isn't great art. But, given that Kubrick was on welfare when he made it, he had almost no money or backers and he had equipment problems that necessitating re-dubbing the film, it's an amazing little film. In particular, the black and white camera work is among the best I've seen of the era for a Film Noir picture---dark and occasionally just a bit grainy and filled with amazing camera angles. I particularly loved the boxing match--bizarre but highly exciting camera shots abounded, you could see and almost feel all the sweat on the boxers (more so than in more polished films like CHAMPION or REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT) and the boxers looked like they were beating the crap out of each other--not pulling their punches or dancing.As for the story, it ain't deep but it's a textbook example of "simple is best"--and for some films this is definitely true. The only failings are minor and can be forgiven considering the budget and that this is Kubrick's first film. Occasionally poor dubbing, a few irrelevant camera shots and two scenes that summarized what happened instead of actually filming the scenes that just screamed "we ran out of money". The ballerina scene was poorly done--just showing the same dancer for a LONG time while the female star told her life story. It just looked cheap. Also, the final scene where the hero gave a lengthy exposition what happened once the police showed was obviously done because of economy--I really wanted to see instead of hear about this.Overall, despite some minor problems, this is a great film for young film makers. This is one of the very best independent films you can find--and few films have come close to it for a quality to investment dollars ratio.For a few other exceptional low-budget films, try CARNIVAL OF SOULS, STEEL HELMET, the original VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and TWO THOUSAND MANIACS! (this final one is a bit terrible in spots, but is amazingly watchable--and bears repeated viewing). There are many, many more and when I find one of these films, it thrills me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyable and interesting early film from Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think in Killer's Kiss you can really start to see the genius that is Stanley Kubrick beginning to push through. By the time the film had reached the finale of its 67 minute runtime, I was ready for it to carry on and keep on going giving us more and more. Alas, what happens next on the train journey away from it all is never revealed but isn't that the sign of greatness when a director can leave the audience wanting more even when they've rounded the film off in a satisfactory manner anyway? Over the coming decades, Kubrick would go on to cover a range of genres such as war, comedy, horror, science fiction and so forth, all with tremendous results, but this seems to be his only divulge into noir and it goes without saying that it is a damn shame. In true noir fashion, Killer's Kiss begins in the present and goes back into the past as an anxious and somewhat lonely man regresses on what's happened. Needless to say it isn't good, it usually isn't in the genre of noir. The man is Davy Gordon (Smith), not a disgruntled P.I. or someone else connected to anything legal or illegal whom teeters on both sides of the law but a boxer, plain a simple, perhaps a boxer due to Kubrick's 1951 short Day of the Fight given its boxing content.Following Davy's fight, he is awoken in the middle of the night by Gloria Price's (Kane) screaming and it turns out she's having a bit of trouble with her employer Vincent Rapallo (Silvera) who is helplessly in love with her as it is and thus, the obsession inspired behaviour does not bode well with a woman unafraid to use her voice and loose enough as it is anyway. Naturally, Davy gets involved but ultimately it won't be for the good. The film carries a fair amount of chemistry between the two leads and the scenes they share work to a degree but Kubrick would never become one of those sorts of directors and it's no surprise that the graphic content and element of antagonism are the key things here. There is a feeling of power struggle between two sides and we get a feeling there's something at stake once Davy has meddled with the affairs of criminal boss Vincent.What follows is the alleyway killing of a certain character by hoods employed by Vincent and you do get the feeling that although he isn't allowed, Kubrick really wants to show us the beating to add to the danger these gangsters pose as well as well before that the expression of love between both Davy and Gloria. But he can't due to the censorship rules although it doesn't detract from the film's quality ? later on, Kubrick would confront global fears such as nuclear war and make a black comedy out of it and with A Clockwork Orange, he would pull the film from cinemas himself due to all the content many people were unhappy with; examples of taboo subjects and lack of compassion towards censorship that were trying or wanting to break out in Killer's Kiss.The film continues down its unpredictable route of noir and crime, using bizarre street locations full of towering chimney's and bizarre desolate buildings as the finale nears. The location work echoes A Clockwork Orange, for example the opening underpass/tramp beating scene as well as the great use of the grand hotel in The Shining as a close and claustrophobic area, almost threatening in its presentation. But what follows the scenes of chase in this film is a finale fight that should be mentioned within the same breath as the hall of mirrors fight in Welles' The Lady From Shanghai, itself a noir from a legendary director. That is when the final fight occurs in a mannequin doll factory. As the fight goes on, the dolls become increasingly eerie; the audience almost distracted by them as they watch on in a human-like manner. Killer's Kiss is a fascinating and really nicely unfolded film that ranks up with some of Kubrick's best in my opinion and should be seen by as many of his fans as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting early achievement by one of cinema's undisputed masters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick famously wound up despising three of his films: Fear and Desire, Killer's Kiss (both for being amateurish efforts) and Spartacus (for being a studio picture on which he was hired after the original director got sacked). And while it's true that Kiss, his second feature, doesn't quite match his more famous works, it is undoubtedly a fascinating example of a genius filmmaker learning his craft.The most unusual thing about the movie (by Kubrickian standards, that is) is probably the story, which is very simple and straightforward, as opposed to the more complex, layered studies of human decay the director is known for (it is also, alongside Fear and Desire, his only original screenplay). The film opens with a man (Jamie Smith) waiting for someone at a train station. He introduces himself as Davy Gordon, a mildly successful prize fighter, and starts telling the audience what led him there, in a long flashback: it all began when he met Gloria Price (Irene Kane), a dancer who was being followed and harassed by her manager (and occasional lover) Vincent Raphello (Frank Silvera). As Raphello gets more obsessive and violent, Davy decides to help Gloria and gets increasingly involved with her on a personal level, which upsets Vincent to the point he asks for help to get the boxer out of the way.The transition from romantic drama to hard-boiled gangster movie would be risible in other films, but Kubrick manages to make it look natural and realistic. Realism also plays an important part in the strong characterization and sharp dialogue, which are the main tools that allow the movie to be engaging despite a not-so-original plot. Moreover, while the picture lacks the technical finesse of his later work, the director proves to be at ease with time-shifting narrative, albeit at its simplest (the flashback is completely linear, with none of the head-scratching jumps made normal by Tarantino and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu).Overall, this may not be Kubrick as we know him (hell, this movie even has a happy ending, sort of), but all fans of the 2001 director ought to give it a look. Amateurial it may be, but there are flashes of real brilliance throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irene Kane &amp; Jamie Smith Made this A Great Kubrick Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Missed this great film of director Stanley Kubrick in 1955. The black and white effect was perfect for this depressing story. However, it was enjoyable watching these two actors, Jamie Smith (Dave Gordon),"Only Fools &amp; Horses '81 TV Series" and Irene Kane(Gloria Price) "All That Jazz" '79, look at each other through the windows of their one room apartments in the same building, dressing and undressing and looking very depressed and down in the dumps. Jamie was a down and out prizer fighter and Gloria was a dance for hire gal, who was down on her luck working along Broadway, NYC and being taken advantage of by the villian, Frank Silvera (Vincent Rapallo) "Valdez Is Coming" '71". Stanley Kubrick wanted this film to be a very realistic film about two people being drawn together by hard luck, therefore, he had these actors act just the way ordinary people would act in REAL LIFE, it makes it appear that they are both poor actors, which is far from the truth. It was great to see a man and a woman become drawn to each other and be able to try and cope with their horrible situations in life. This a great Classic film by Stanley Kubrick!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Urban Dour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few have captured the glitter and grub of a cityscape better than this 70-minutes of neon and alleyways. The plot's all over the place, along with choppy editing and so-so acting. Thus, the storyline leaves a lot to be desired. Nonetheless, the visuals are consistently striking, from crowded dancehall to jagged rooftop. Clearly, Kubrick's sense of compositional artistry has already kicked in. And judging from the slick flashback of The Killing (1956), a lot was learned from this project. Sure the movie's done on the cheap and Kubrick has to do everything but cater the food. Still, the imagination is rich and pervasive at a time when Hollywood was arguably most straitjacketed. Despite the many flaws (god-awful musical scoring), this slender film put Kubrick on the movie-making map. Not surprisingly, his next film The Killing would provide a lot more to work with. All in all, the production remains a treat for the eye, if not for the ear; that is, if you believe urban dour can be made compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important stepping stone in Kubrick's journey to becoming a cinematic master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1955, a young man of seemingly limitless - but as of then unrecognised - talent, wrote, produced and directed a short B-grade film noir called Killer's Kiss. The film, apart from some excellent technical aspects, is relatively average, and would probably be all but forgotten had the young man not been Stanley Kubrick. Killer's Kiss only really shows glimpses of the greatness that would come from the much revered director, but no doubt this was down to - as Kubrick's many roles behind the camera would indicate - a lack of backing from the film industry. But Killer's Kiss proves to be a snappy little noir, with a truly thrilling climax.Over-the-hill boxer Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith) has just been beaten by young, up-and-comer Kid Rodriguez. He decides that he's done with being a human punch bag and prepares for a life of farming with his uncle. Sharing his apartment block is the beautiful Gloria Price (Irene Kane - who passed away just over a month ago), a taxi dancer who, on the night of the fight, was being groped by her sleazy manager Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera), who she knocked back. While resting after the fight, Davey hears a scream from Gloria's apartment when Vincent attacks her. After chasing him off, Davey and Gloria start a relationship, yet they both need to collect the money owed to them by Vincent before they can move away and start a life together.This ticks all the juicy boxes for your typical B-movie noir - a dangerous dame, a bum who is in way over his head, cynical narration, a case of mistaken identity. The film makes up for it's pretty bland plot and dull leaning man with an exciting rooftop chase that comes at the climax, and a well choreographed fist-fight in a room full of mannequins. While the film as a whole shows little of Kubrick's unparallelled talent, it does display his eye for visuals. Kubrick was a painter with his camera, and here we get some glorious German Expressionism-inspired moments, as well as showing us the real New York in the 1950's in a scene outside Vincent's club. It's a pretty forgettable movie overall, but no doubt an important stepping-stone in Kubrick's journey to becoming a cinematic master, as The Killing came the next year, which was the first in a long line of masterpieces from the director.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Loaded Gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most great directors make a movie early in their careers in which they lack budget, or talented actors, or technical know-how (or sometimes all three) and yet the movie transcends its weaknesses and burns with a raw talent that lasts for decades afterward and serves as the promise of greatness to come. Spielberg had "Duel," Scorsese had "What's A Nice Girl Like You Doing In A Place Like This," David Lynch his "Eraserhead.""Killer's Kiss" is Stanley Kubrick's loaded gun.It's a moody big-city pressure-cooker, and it's far from perfect, but the film's obvious flaws only serve to highlight the brilliance: masterful photography, confident storytelling, hypnotic visuals... the Times Square standoff is beautiful, as is the mannequin-finale which reminded me of the Milk Bar in "Clockwork Orange." The rooftop finale and the visceral boxing sequence stand out- no other film of the era looked anything like this. This is Kubrick flexing his muscles and stitching achingly beautiful photographs together to tell a simmering story of lost souls in lonely New York.The film's defects: over-reliance on voice-over to tell back-story and explain off-screen events, a dubbing delay between mouths moving and spoken dialogue, and an extended final battle which may go on just a minute too long. But what you can take from this picture is what you want to take from any director's loaded gun: the electric directorial style and visual eye that points to limitless potential and profound talent. Kubrick made good on that promise, and "Killer's Kiss" stands as the first chapter of his masterful career in film.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot here is pretty lacking, but it's visually challenging and prefigures what Kubrick is about to offer when he sprouts his wings with Lolita. He's my favorite director because he's never treated the same theme twice, and his movies ask more questions than they answer.This one doesn't do that, but it has some neat tricks of cinematic value, kind of like what P.T. Anderson offers. That fight scene with the mannequins and the rooftop chase; the murder of the agent in the alley (that remarkable frame-within-the-frame shot, and the characters bursting from within it); and finally the nightmare sequence -- juxtapose this with the slit scan sequence in 2001, a perfect prefiguring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try to imagine going to the cinema back when "Killer's Kiss" (about a boxer reminiscing on unpleasant events while waiting for a train) was released back in 1955. Certainly, it was a mind-blowing movie - especially the chase sequence - but even so, it probably would have been hard to guess that the director would go on to direct some of the greatest movies of all time.No matter, watching the movie today, one can see shades of what Stanley Kubrick (who would have turned 79 today) later brought to "Dr. Strangelove", "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange". Does this one count solidly as a film noir? That might be a matter of debate. But you can't deny that this movie is an important part of cinema history, affirming Kubrick as an indelible name on the silver screen.Starring Frank Silvera and Irene Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boxing is one of my least favourite subjects, so much so that I put off seeing this film until now. However, it is no more about boxing than "On the Waterfront", a great movie, which I think Kubrick was emulating (or "tributing", as we say these days) to some extent in this movie.The plot reads like a cheap B movie, as does the script and the budget. Yet with these severely limited resources, Kubrick manages to make an utterly compelling film. The pace is helped by the length of the movie - 67 minutes would be unacceptable today, but is right for this piece; an additional 30 minutes of padding would have ruined it.The fight scene in the mannequin warehouse is an extraordinary piece of imagination, cinematography and fight choreography. And no, that fight is not even faintly like boxing.So, Kubrick's first feature effort. Minimum budget, maximum effect, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is nothing remarkable; it's an hour long tale of boy meets girl, boy fights girl's evil boyfriend, boy gets girl. I hope that not considered a spoiler. Still, Kubrick shows tremendous promise in his direction of this, his second feature and first that most of us can watch (if anyone know of a way to get a hold of Fear and Desire please let me know). The movie, in addition to being well photographed, possesses terrific atmosphere, really creating the feeling of being in the slums with characters. Silvera is kind of cartoonish as the villain, and all three main characters are somewhat one dimensional (granted it's hard to develop them in such a short time) but they are interesting nonetheless. If you like film noir, you might want to give this a look, and if you're a diehard Kubrick fan like I am, definitely go for it. I say 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss is a tight 70 minute crime film (the shortest movie Kubrick would make). While it has some Hitchcock touches (in the characters and subject matter), you can tell this is a Kubrick film, even if you ignore the opening credits. The wicked sense of humor contained in all of his films is here, along with a truly bizarre climax inside a mannequin factory (with the villain yielding an ax at the hero---not the first time Kubrick would produce such as scene). I've never heard of the actors, but as we would later find out, Kubrick preferred style and substance over actors who do justice to their parts (with the exceptions of Kirk Douglas, Peter Sellers, and Malcom McDowell). This is an engrossing start to a legendary career, and worth seeking out. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of flaws in this movie (directed AND shot by Kubrick), but also a lot of very nice solutions and great atmosphere because of the lighting, contrast and composition. All of these are credit to Kubrick himself apparently. His cinematography is in my opinion greater than his successor's in The Killing (1956). Here is also the use of constant music in the background that can't really be distinguished from the source music. Together with the awkward cuts, dream sequences, city scenery and almost experimental lighting that creates a very charming mood.This movie should indeed not be longer, because the story is too simple and not really entertaining, although it fits right in with most other fifties film-noir flicks. It is however recognizable that Kubrick tries to accomplish some technical and aesthetic solutions on a low budget. Later of course he got the money to be a perfectionist director. I guess he started writing the story right after filming 'Day of the fight' (1953, short docu about a boxer). What I appreciate most in this movie is the looks of it. It obviously cannot be compared to great 'Rififi chez les hommes' (1955, Dassin) and the legendary 'Night of the hunter' (1955, Laughton), but I want to rate it 8/10 because 6.6 is definitely too low. To me Killer's Kiss has more ups than downs.8/10</fullReview>

He utilizes voice-over techniques, flashback, and creates wonderful imagery with an interpretive ballet number during an expository flashback. He also films one the most realistic boxing sequences, realistic in its brutality and naturalism. The one oversight that Kubrick makes is in casting. Frank Silvera(as the protagonist)is both bland and devoid of depth. Jamie Smith(the antagonist) is a stereotypical "thug" with little to offer this otherwise excellent film.

		<shortDescription>Early Kubrick, definitely worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tidy little opus that Kubrick wrote, directed and filmed himself on a $40,000 borrowed budget. It comes a year before "The Killing" (1956), a more substantial film noir that marked Kubrick as a film maker for whom you might want to front some money."Killer's Kiss" runs sixty-seven mostly taunt minutes in New York City gritty black and white, featuring some stylistic variations on some standard Hollywood noir elements: the fight game, bare-knuckle toughs, a chase scene, a good guy/bad guy fight (the bad guy, Vincent Rapolla played by Frank Silvera, swinging a fireman's axe, the good guy, Davey Gordon--Jamie Smith--coming up with what looks like a pointed flag pole), a blond beauty to be fought over, Gloria Price (Irene Kane AKA Chris Chase), and a very satisfying ending.The film is framed as a first person flashback from Davey Gordon as he waits for a train to Seattle. He's a prize fighter with eighty-plus fights under his belt, but a guy with a weak chin near the end of a mediocre career who serves as a tune-up for contenders. Gloria Price is a dancehall girl controlled by the dancehall manager, the bad guy, Vincent Rapolla, a kind of swarthy masher. All the action takes place in a two to three day period following Davey Gordon's last fight. The last scene neatly takes place at the train station.Kubrick doesn't dwell on the fight game much. We see the gym where the fighters are working out and Gordon's last fight against "Kid Rodriguez" which is over quickly (although three minutes in the ring is an eternity for the fighters). Andy Warhol would have loved the later fight scene which takes place in a storeroom full of hundreds of white, naked manikins that the combatants toss at each other to ward off axe and pointed flag pole. Hitchcock (and others, by the way) would have smiled at the scenes in which Gordon and Gloria can see the action in the other's apartment through conveniently opened apartment windows. (But this was before most people had air conditioning.) Irene Kane reminded me a bit of Grace Kelly, not quite as tall or as graceful, but a bit more sensuous with similar features.I was struck by Kubrick's clear, tight direction and by his use of the camera to highlight the mundane but very telling artifacts that surrounded the lives of the characters: the cheap, tiny apartments, the hard indifferent streets of the city, Gloria's old doll, the glitter of the marquees ("The Queen of Sheba" was playing at one theatre), the window shade that flies back up, the not really pretty dancehall girls, and the repeated focus on important elements, like the axe and guns. I was amused to think that even the very young Kubrick exhausted the actors, especially in the fight scenes.This is a film by a young man who impresses with his knowledge of the psychology of film noir while displaying his artistic talent. I predict a great career.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss (1955)Clearly a lower budget affair, with some leaning on editing and location ambiance to hold it together, but a simple, forceful plot with a little sentimental edge. It makes for a good movie, and a fair enough first step for a young director working with few resources. But it's not Breathless (also low budget) any more than it is The Shining, which is his most famous film among the general public.Overlooking some clear gaffes (clocks with the wrong time, a stairway that goes up to the room and yet there is another stair that goes to the floor above, which doesn't exist), the general feel to the movie is terrific. Especially glowing are the scenes of Times Square at night, but even the boxing, with its crazed (and beautiful) camera-work, and the interior shots of the two bedrooms (and the windows between) are great. The feel is gritty and the pace is realistic, and the dialog is good.Acting? This isn't Kubrick's strongest suit (he's good with the monkeys in 2001 and with actors who do their own thing really well, like Jack Nicholson and Kirk Douglas). And if the lead actor Jamie Smith, playing the boxer, is good, his counterpart, the sculptural but wooden Irene Kane, is not. That's too bad, because the core of the movie is not the action (there is a great rooftop chase and drawn out but spectacular fight in the mannequin room), but a love story. The end still makes you feel good, but getting there is a little rocky.This isn't just for Kubrick fans. Especially at an hour long, this has enough memorable scenes to make it totally worth it. But it's flawed and almost too long, given the simple plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stilted But Interesting And Offbeat Early Kubrick Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Davy Gordon is an over-the-hill boxer who has just lost an important fight when he hears his neighbour Gloria being attacked by her hoodlum boyfriend. He scares off the creep strikes up a friendship with Gloria, but can they extricate themselves from their unwanted problem situations ?This movie has problems; the cast are wooden, the post-synched sound isn't good, Gerald Fried's score is annoying in the first half (though picks up by the end) and crucially, the characters are so muted and unsympathetic that there's no real drama to be found. That said however, it's a good film. I judge movies on the resources the filmmakers had and Kubrick had peanuts for this (about $75,000 by all accounts), but despite that turned in an intriguing, original picture, with plenty of stylish touches and some strong moments (the murder in the alley, Davy eavesdropping while the cops toss his room, Gloria's turncoat speech to the gangster, the fight in the creepy mannequin warehouse). Kubrick wrote, co-produced, edited, shot and directed the film, and it's his photography which is most impressive for such a low-budget feature; the lighting is superb, the angles dynamic, characters throw things directly at the lens, there's a negative-exposure dream sequence. The boxing match at the start features some wild point-of-view shots and is gritty and hand-held, recalling Kubrick's 1951 documentary short Day Of The Fight). The hastily-grabbed and five-o'clock-in-the-morning NYC locations add greatly to the evocative atmosphere. Even at the age of twenty-six, Kubrick's camera-work is superb, a successful combination of film-noir and post-war black-and-white still photography (Kubrick's day job was as a freelance photographer for Look magazine). A fine no-budget picture made with love and hard graft by a great filmmaker-to-be, in the vein of Night Of The Living Dead, Dark Star or Eraserhead. This was Kubrick's second movie after the little-seen 1953 Fear And Desire (which also stars Silvera), and the dancer in the ballet sequence, Ruth Sobotka, was Kubrick's second wife. Trivia - there is a very obscure 1983 movie called Stranger's Kiss which seems to be about the making of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Born Noir Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's raw, austere first feature is perhaps best viewed as an extension of his documentary short Day of the Fight, which chronicles the preparation of an on-the-rise boxer and approaches the Bronx with the same subterranean eye for littered streets, bare tenements, and ominously gray mid-day skies. Davy Gordon, the washed-up protagonist of Killer's Kiss, is far from the polished young prizefighter of that earlier film, his fight-day routine consisting of pacing about his ramshackle apartment and stealing gazes at his neighbor, a fetching blonde named Gloria who lustfully reciprocates. She's involved with a jealous hoodlum (Frank Silvera) who runs the dance hall at which she works. When Davy intervenes in a dispute between them, Silvera targets him for a fall.As he would in many of his subsequent features, Kubrick uses genre framework (here, film noir) as a means to explore characters negotiating an irrational environment in which they're both victims and manipulators. Society is only as backward as mankind, so here we have Davy, a man who miscalculates the situation (and realizes he does so) but determines to bull ahead anyway. Tellingly, Kubrick uses a dissolve flashback to clarify the inciting incident (Silvera's assault on Gloria), which Gloria relates to Davy secondhand. The next morning, Gloria tells one more story, also relayed via dissolve, about her ballerina sister's unhealthy attachment to their father (a stunning scene that conveys background information in the most disturbing, expressive way imaginable). These flashbacks cumulatively suggest that: (a) Gloria is neither fatale nor innocent, but something much more psychologically elusive; (b) Davy is out of his depth; and (c) Kubrick enjoys toying with the guilt-and-victim archetypes of noir, using them as an instructive link to his worldview.Kubrick was already operating at near-peak technical efficiency despite budget constraints (he also photographed, wrote, and edited the film). The exaggerated sound design paints an oppressive and crude tone. There's a scene in which Davy phones his gym and the sounds of sparring and heavy-bag work emanating from the other line resemble the grinding cacophony of a printing press. Shooting on location often with hand-held cameras, Kubrick "finds" seemingly spontaneous details that factor significantly in the story: as Davy waits outside the club for Gloria to collect her money, two costumed street dancers emerge from off-screen and swipe his scarf, leading to a chase that results in Davy's manager being mistakenly beaten to death by Silvera's goons. Davy's bout, a brief tour de force of editing and camera-work, similarly benefits from the director's workmanlike approach: moving beyond the short's detached fascination with boxing as competitive sport, Kubrick thrusts his camera into battle, weaving between flying fists, moving low, always staying dangerously close to the combatants, capturing boxing at its most kinetic. (The only other director I can think of to film boxing this way is Michael Mann, whose Ali-Liston fight almost certainly borrows elements from this scene.) In stark contrast, the climax?a chase across rooftops filmed via tripod from a restrained distance?defiantly holds the tension at a remove, the camera placidly surveying and literalizing the world's indifference to this human plight. When Silvera and Davy finally duel in a mannequin factory, the struggle for survival is desperate and pathetic, and the score quiets to emphasize their wheezing and posturing. It's brutal and debased but, as with the sanctioned boxing match, ironically the purest validation of life in a society that swindles and betrays with impunity. Clearly, Kubrick always had a noir kind of sensibility, and on evidence of this and The Killing, he probably could have made this type of film his entire career and still been considered one of the greatest directors of his time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Davy Gordon (Jamie Smith) is an over-the-hill boxer, lonely in life and feeling particularly useless to the world. We first find him standing agitatedly in the centre of a train station, puffing away at a cigarette, anticipating somebody's arrival. Via a flashback that spans the entire film (including numerous flashbacks within flashbacks), we explore the events in past days that have led Davy to this moment. Three days earlier, Davy prepares for one of the most important fights of his life, determined to beat the up-and-coming boxer Rodriguez to retain his pride. The woman in the apartment opposite his, Gloria (Irene Kane), fascinates him, and he stares mournfully through her window in an attempt to appease his loneliness. It is his future relationship with Gloria, and her connection to the sleazy bad-guy Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera), that precipitates the suspenseful events in the film.Stanley Kubrick's second feature film (after the impossible-to-find 'Fear and Desire' of two years earlier) is a solid directorial effort, especially considering that Kubrick, just 27 years old at the time, was living on welfare and working on a shoestring budget. Indeed, as the young director was simply unable to afford on-location filming permits, filming of the picture was mostly done discreetly, some shots even recorded secretly from a nearby vehicle. When the sound equipment suffered technical problems, Kubrick fired his sound crew and decided to record the dialogue in post-production. Since Irene Kane was unable to return for the sound dubbing, radio actress Peggy Lobbin filled in.The first thing you'll notice about 'Killer's Kiss' is that, even so early in his career, Kubrick had an eye for stunning and unique cinematography. The short but brutal boxing match near the beginning of the film is the most gritty I've seen since 'Rocky' or 'Raging Bull,' and Kubrick's camera-work puts the audience amidst the action. The hand-held camera employed during the action-packed scenes hovers just outside the ropes of the boxing ring, as if we are a spectator watching on. Suddenly, without warning, the viewer is tossed into the thick of the violence, and we witness the fight from Davy's point of view, as he cops a nasty blow to the head and plummets to the floor, the counting referee bearing menacingly over him.At just 67 minutes, 'Killer's Kiss' is substantially shorter than any other Kubrick films that I have seen, but this is probably a good thing ? I don't think the story and suspense could have held up any longer than it did. The acting in the film is adequate enough (I actually quite enjoyed the performances of Smith and Silvera), though I wasn't too enthusiastic about Irene Kane. To be fair, however, the aforementioned post-production dubbing might have played a part in this.If this were not a Stanley Kubrick film, I firmly doubt that anybody would even recognise the name of this film (in fact, even now awareness is somewhat limited to Kubrick enthusiasts). However, this doesn't stop 'Killer's Kiss' from being a competent ultra low-budget 1950s film-noir thriller, and it most certainly predicts greater things to come for one of cinematic history's greatest directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is safe to assume that if this film did not have Kubrick's stamp on it, it would likely be relegated to the dustbin of history. However, that is not to say that it should be discounted. The first time I became aware of this film, I did not see the opening credits and therefore was unaware that this was a Kubrick work. However, this film does offer insights into what is to come from Kubrick, particularly the use of music. Kubrick fans should view this early effort and see how many elements of this film remind them of later Kubrick works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touch of inspiration but a very hollow ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the recent Eyes Wide Shut hype, I went back to take a look at this early Kubrick work. Yes, you can see some touches of inspiration in this period piece, but I think it really fell short. For its day, the boxing sequence was pretty good, though I was more impressed by straight ahead camera angles in Requiem for a Heavyweight. Kubrick's gladiators didn't even seem like they were taking hard shots at each other -- not nearly as hard as the sound effects would have you believe.Anyway, I thought Irene Cane did a fine job playing a wayward girl looking for some purpose in life. She latches onto whatever lifts her spirit for the moment and then can so easily turn it away with a casual look. So near the end of the film when she's pleading for her life with her offer to leave her new lover to marry the thug she had seemed to take pleasure in spurning, we just aren't sure whether she is simply acting desperate or if she really can recant her affection so easily. And the main character, Davy Gordon, openly considers this too as he dashes through the window to save his own neck.If the film just ended right there, with those threds left unresolved, it would have been a much better movie. Davy could have boarded his train to the West never knowing what became of his two-day girlfriend or the thug she tried to appease. And wouldn't it have been ironic if she were forced to marry that man -- like her sister was forced to marry someone she didn't love? That would have been a cruel twist of fate indeed!Yet what we got was neither cruel or unusual or even mysterious. No, we got the standard Hollywood ending to a film which had done a good job of breaking a standard Hollywood mold to that point. If it wasn't Kubrick making this film, making that woman run down the stairs into her lover's waiting arms as the big music came up to signal the Happy Ending(TM), I would have just clicked off the TV and forgot all about it. But this is Stanley Kubrick!!!!!! Boy was I disappointed! The only thing I can hope for was that the movie studio forced him to edit his true ending and Kubrick wasn't in a position to reject them at that early stage in his career.Oh well. See this movie if you're a Kubrick fan, but don't say I didn't warn you that the ending is completely Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moody film noir has boxer Frank Silvera becoming involved with his comely neighbor (Irene Kane, later known as film critic Chris Chase); she's being harassed by her gangster boss, whom the boxer eventually crosses paths with. Stanley Kubrick directed (he also wrote the initial treatment, co-produced, edited and photographed the movie!), and he does well with his first full-length feature, although his unerring eye for detail and ambiance outclasses the script and characters. The picture is enjoyable for film-buffs on a minor level (it's a footnote, nothing more), yet the set-ups and camera-work must have seemed high-reaching in 1955. It's a vivid, arresting movie which grabs you by the eyeballs, but the sum total isn't equal to these parts, and half the time there's just not much happening plot-wise. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Kubrick film well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An effective thriller with exquisite photography (most of it probably done personally by Kubrick), a realistic gritty feel. Follows a plot structure similar to Jules Dassin's "Naked City", and likewise ending with a chase on rooftops, though Kubrick takes his action into a memorable sequence in a mannequin factory. Irene Kane is breathtaking and shows off real acting panache, but unfortunately her voice was dubbed (along with the rest of the actors; which, in the case of a "realist" tight melodrama like this, hurts it quite a bit). Silvera is also very effective as the crooked dance hall owner whose possessiveness motivates the plot. Good music, unfortunately overused (probably they only had 3 minutes or so of music and had to loop it repeatedly). Fans of this movie should check out Kubrick's follow up, "The Killing", a better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really nothing special about Killer's Kiss other than the extensive role that Kubrick played in its making ? as writer, director, editor, etc. Granted, the film was made nearly half a century ago, but for the work of someone who is now known as a phenomenal director, this was a truly mediocre debut film. It is a simple story about a heroic boxer who rescues some singer from an abusive boss. Kubrick's masterful direction is largely absent here, and the film has a dumb, clichéd ending. Besides the uninteresting direction and the sub-par acting, the sound effects throughout the film are badly flawed, giving the film as a whole a sloppy, unrefined feel. Film buffs should watch it just because it's the early work of one of our great directors, if for no other reason than to see just how far he's come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Early Effort by Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Stanley Kubrick could have made Killer's Kiss a lot better, but, of course, back in 1955, he was not well-known at all so he had to work with what he had. Besides, he only had $75,000 to make this film, and I think that Kubrick did a good job in this early effort. You can tell that this is a Kubrick movie because of his cinematography and his camera angles, but, unlike most of his other films, he didn't exactly choose the best actors. I'm not saying they were terrible, but they could have been better. Killers Kiss is very well shot and has some excellent scenes, especially the chase involving Davy, the thugs, and the old manequin factory. The premise and story of the movie are good, but the ending is just your typical happy ending, very un-Kubrick-like. I wish that he would have come up with a better, more original and satisfying ending. But for one of his early films, Kubrick did a good job directing Killer's Kiss. If you can get your hands on a copy of this movie, be sure to get it, because you can't find it in many Blockbusters or in the TV guide that much. Any fan of crime movies, film-noir, or Kubrick movies will like this one. -2001Rulz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A game effort - but MASTERPIECE - hardly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's most amusing to read the comments at the IMDb re Killer's Kiss (and every other movie ever made): The loud shouts of MASTERPIECE are laughable. It's just amazing how people see what they want to see, or see what they want to see based on some critic's evaluation. Killer's Kiss is hardly a MASTERPIECE - it's an interesting film by an evolving filmmaker, but undone by its crude post-synching (it actually reminds one of the French nouvelle vague which would come along in about five years), and it's horrible script. However, there are some wonderful occasional images, and the ideas, if not always the execution of them, are interesting, technique-wise. Nice shots of 1954 Times Square, too. The one sequence where you could really say, "Yeah, this guy is going to be really good" is the mannequin sequence. I don't know what boxing sequence the IMDb MASTERPIECE zealots were watching, but it's clearly not the one in this film, which is fine and nothing more. Apparently these Kubrick-heads have never seen The Set Up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Davy Gordon (Jamie Smith) is a boxer in the end of career. His neighbor Gloria Price (Irene Kane) is a dancer, who dances with lonely men in a club of bad reputation in Times Square. After losing a fight, Davy decides to move to his uncle's farm in Seattle, and work with horses. While looking through the window of his small apartment, Davy sees Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera), the owner of the club, beating Gloria. Davy goes to her apartment to defend her, but Vincent has already escaped. They starts dating each other and having an affair, and Gloria decides to move to Seattle with Davy. She goes to the club to receive her week salary while Davy waits downstairs for his couch Albert (Jerry Jarret), who promises to cash his check, received due to the last fight. An incident happens and the gangsters of Vincent kill Albert by mistake, supposing he was Davy, and kidnap Glory. Davy searches for the girl, having the police on his back, chasing him by the murder of Albert. This movie has many attractions: it is a low budget movie with the geniality of Stanley Kubrick, the narrative is in off, the shadows are marvelous, in a wonderful black and white photography, and the camera is fantastic, such as filming the fight of Davy, or the panoramic chase on the top of an old New York building. When one of the gangsters stumbles, it seems to be an accident not in the screenplay. The fight between Davy and Vincent is very realistic, and difficult to be performed.Title (Brazil): `A Morte Passou Por Perto' (`The Death Has Passed Nearby')</fullReview>

Even in bad films like Barry Lyndon or Eyes Wide Shut it was always clear that Kubrick was getting exactly what he wanted.But when he made Killer's Kiss, he obviously hadn't got it all figured out yet. The movie has some interesting pieces, scenes with striking lighting, original, clever ideas, but it also has drably lit scenes and hackneyed dialog. You can see the future Kubrick in individual shots, but it's all over the place. The movie has the quality of a student film, in which Kubrick is so excited by all his super cool ideas and all the fun stuff he can do with film that he throws it all in willy nilly.It is difficult to believe any of the people on this site who are declaring this movie a brilliant classic would do so if they'd never heard of the filmmaker. The story is perfunctory, the pacing is sluggish and the acting is abysmal. The movie is really only notable for film history, a way of understanding Kubrick's thought process as he was teaching himself the art of film. But it's a lousy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the most notable trick that Kubrick pulled off in this fledgling effort was to shoot several sequences in the 'city that never sleeps' and catch it napping. It was so disconcerting to see an almost deserted Times Square followed by first a car journey through totally empty streets and a chase across equally empty roof-tops with not even a distant sound of what had to be heavy traffic below. It was equally clear that Kubrick had dipped heavily into the oeurvre of William Irish/Cornell Woollrich and maybe even watched such low-key adaptations as Phantom Lady and The Window. It was equally clear the film was made for a stick of gum and couldn't run to even mediocre acting talent. It's probably fair to say that if it didn't have the name Kubrick attached it wouldn't have attracted the amount of ink it has. Watchable - barely.</fullReview>

I particularly loved the roof top shot when the hero runs over the connected roofs and final clash between the hero and the villain, there was something to it. It was humorous as well as satisfying. So this movie seems to be for those students studying film direction, and it is only this part the movie gives something and that too quality stuff considering the genre.

		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination. It's poorly acted on the whole, often incredulous, and full of abyssal plot holes. But it's essential viewing for all Kubrick aficionados. Apart from anything, it's a logical starting point, given the fact that Fear And Desire is unavailable (at the director's own behest).This is film noir in its true sense: made on a shoestring budget with no permit to film, Kubrick was forced into the dim back alleys of New York to tell the story of a failed young boxer (Jamie Smith) who falls for Gloria Price's gangster's moll. In doing so he garners the attention of the fearsome Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera, returning to work with Kubrick after Fear And Desire). Following a well-staged rooftop chase, the movie culminates in a memorable battle in a mannequin warehouse.It's clear to see a skilled film-making talent blossoming here - the movie is brilliantly shot and atmospherically lit, while the opening boxing match is undeniably powerful, cleverly choreographed and packed with punchy cuts. The post-dubbing (whereby all the sound and dialogue was laid on afterwards) was, shall we say, a 'learning' experience for the director, although it does not detract from what is essentially a visual experience with a paper-thin plot.Well worth a purchase for Kubrick completists and noir enthusiasts.</fullReview>

Later, a beaten Smith watches Mr. Silvera attack Kane in her apartment, and rushes to her assistance. Smith falls in love, but smarmy Silvera is willing to kill to keep Kane? "Killer's Kiss" features a superb 1950s New York City "film noir" setting, and its three central performances are very natural. The soundtrack, which includes some good music, some bad sound effects, and a great vocal performance by Peggy Lobbin (dubbing for Kane), is eerie and effective. While there are many obvious ways the film could have been improved upon, the revelation of Stanley Kubrick's potential as an extraordinary powerful filmmaker is unmistakably evident. Mr. Kubrick was definitely going places.********* Killer's Kiss (9/21/55) Stanley Kubrick ~ Jamie Smith, Frank Silvera, Irene Kane, Peggy Lobbin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people complain they don't understand 2001, A Space Odyssey: well here is the movie for them to see, because the story is the same. A man, alone, fights for survival, facing an evil and mysterious enemy. By coming out scarred but alive, he reaches grace-redemption-love. The feeling of loneliness is acute. Beautiful, haunting scenes come one after the other. Dialog is down to a minimum, and as in 2001 is kept deliberately trivial not to interfere with the visuals (that's my theory, anyway). 2001 is set in space, Killer's Kiss is set in New York, but both are filmed as dark, hostile, beautiful, mysterious, and threatening places. It may look like a "film noir" but that is just the outer shell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First twenty minutes well ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters in Killer's Kiss are B-noir clichés. However, the first twenty minutes of the film exists with the sort of atmospheric realism and flare for experimentation that only could have been found in France in 1955. Kubrickuses hand held cameras, jagged cuts, and real locations in the same year that Mellvile was making Bob le Flambeur. The boxing scenes in particular were amajor breakthrough in subjective cinema. For whatever reason, the film then becomes a pretty standard crime genre piece (with rare exceptions). Kubrickdefinitely had one of the greatest eyes of any director ever, and it is evident even here in his first film. The ending is pure Kubrick at his most demented, featuring a fight between a guy with an ax and a guy with a spear-- in a room full of mannequins!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Budding Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an avid fan of the films of Stanley Kubrick, my first viewing of "Killer's Kiss"(1955) a couple of years ago was followed by disappointment. I found the plot to be a hackneyed variation on a thousand other B film-noir's of the period, with holes a mile wide. The acting left much to be desired as well. I remember noticing, this first time I saw the film, a scene where the villain attacks the heroine and it's clearly noticeable that she's suppressing a laugh. Only a few of the outdoor urban shots seemed to make an impression on me. However, upon a second viewing of the film, I was able to see that although the film was not by any means a work of genius, it is clearly the work of a budding genius.  On second viewing, it is clear to see that the photography is top notch throughout. Kubrick's use of harsh lighting and shadows are put to particularly good use in the boxing scene, the scene where Davy's friend is murdered, and the final fight between Davy and the villain in the mannequin warehouse. What is also remarkable is the use of space in each of these scenes. The boxing scene shows that Kubrick's strengths for hand-held shots and quick editing for maximum impact are already evident. Even though the crowd is never shown, the audience still gets the feeling that we are there through the tight shots and sound effects, and the scene becomes quite involving.  The scene where Davy's friend is murdered is eerie, and almost expressionistic in tone. Using one camera set-up, placed low to the ground at the mouth of the alley where the victim is murdered, the shadows of the killers bear down on the cornered victim as he struggles to find a way out. It is probably the most effective scene in the movie. The fight at the end combines the tight, rapid editing of the boxing scene, with the eerie expressionism of the murder scene. As Davy and the villain fight it out among the lifeless spectators, Kubrick cuts to various close ups of mannequin faces or hanging mannequin body parts to heighten the mood of the scene. Kubrick's visual flare distracts from, but does not hide, the major flaws of the film. Yet although both the plot and dialogue are very corny, and the insights into character are only partially effective, this is forgivable. Forgivable, not only because this is only Kubrick's second feature, but also because the film was shot on a limited budget within a limited shooting schedule.  This is compact film-making. So, when we see Davy feeding his fish or reading that hokey letter from his uncle, we understand that this is to briefly show us that underneath his gruff exterior is a sensitive man. At one point Davy hears Gloria scream and rushes to save her. When he arrives at her place, she informs him that "about an hour ago," her boss came to her place and tried to rape her. We see the entire ordeal in flashback, ending at the point where she screams and Davy hears her. However, this scene only takes five minutes at most. That's one fast hour! This is also excusable: since Kubrick is concentrating on several aspects of the film- making process at once, an oversight like this is an honest mistake and does not significantly detract from the dramatic impact of the scene.  Sometimes when you see a mediocre movie, you wish that movie had never been made. "Killer's Kiss" is an example of a less than average film that definitely should have been made. By making this, Kubrick worked out his bugs and was well prepared for making his next film, The Killing, his first film that was successful as a work of art. As a footnote, I should mention that shortly before my second viewing of "killer's Kiss", I had the opportunity to see Kubrick's rarely seen first feature "Fear and Desire" (1953). This film, although beautifully shot, is even more uneven than "Killer's Kiss", and makes one realize just how much Kubrick had improved as a film maker in just two short years. It also gives one an empathetic sense of the necessity of early efforts to enable the film-maker to hone his art to the point of eventual genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is actually quite surprising. Made for a meagre $75,000, technically, there is no major flaw. For only his second attempt, the directing is not only competent but quite accomplished, note the crane shot as Gloria crosses the street, Davy's negatively shot dream or the boxing match - as well directed as 'Raging Bull' or 'Rocky'.Again, the same goes for the other areas of the movie. Kubrick, who wrote, directed, edited, produced and photographed the movie, did a great job on all fronts. The soft under or side lighting of whenever the movie reaches a sad or dangerous point was very noir for what essentially is a B-movie.This movie is a B-movie. It's the kind of film that you turn on the TV to on a Sunday afternoon, and it seems to be proud of it. Kubrick later said that he was ashamed of his first couple of attempts at feature-film directing. That's too bad, he had a damn fine film on his hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way over-rated to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I assumed like most that if you watch a known filmmakers lesser known works you might get a treat and maybe some insight into how they started. After this one, makes me wonder how Kubrick got from this to 2001. This is a not a very good early work.To start with, the actors chosen in this are just terrible. You talk about coming straight outta "Acting Class 101". Take a look at the actors in this and their credits and see why they don't have many. Simple, they can't act.I think the tell-tale warning sign for this one is the lack of dialogue. This film seems like an early Warhol work or some of that 70's black and white independent cinema stuff. Zero actors and a slap shot script that pre-dated that 70's junk. This was obviously done all (or mostly) by Kubrick himself. I'm guessing he panhandled for loose change to get this thing made.Wow, save your time and patience for a better film and remember, just because a film comes from a highly accredited filmmakers canon....doesn't automatically make it worth seeing.This one was a 100% flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Stanley Kubricks second film, it's about average. The cinematography is beautiful, New York looks amazing. The direction is very good, a hint of things to come. The acting is below average unfortunately. Stanley Kubrick would revisit Film Noir with his next film, The Killing, which is possibly the best Noir ever made. This movie is kind of slow and the lackluster direction doesn't help much, you do see early Kubrick in this film, just like you see Tarantino in My Best Friend's Birthday. The two films are very similar in the sense that, they're both pretty amateurish and the directors went on to make Masterpiece's soon after. Reservoir Dogs or any of Tarantino's other films wouldn't be possible without The Killing. Basically see this if you love Kubrick, so you can experience all of his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> *******Spoilers Ahead*******`Killer's Kiss' is about a boxer whose career is going nowhere fast. His life is imperiled when he protects his new love interest, a nightclub dancer, from her gangster/lover boss.`Killer's Kiss' is Stanley Kubrick's second film and it shows much he had matured as a director. The film begins with scenes of a man getting ready for a boxing match. He is knocked out in the first round and that event confirms what he already knows, that his boxing career is not progressing well. His life takes an unexpected turn when he falls for a nightclub dancer. .The boxing match scenes may be the most beautifully filmed and most visceral of any film I seen except `Raging Bull.'`Killer's Kiss' is different from other Kubrick films because of the love story. I feel that there is more expression of human emotion than what I saw in `Full Metal Jacket' and `2001: A Space Odyssey,' though I consider `2001' to be Stanley's best film. Many of Stanley Kubrick's films demonstrate hope in the end. `Full Metal Jacket' ends with the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse song and `Paths To Glory' has an uplifting ending. `2001: A Space Odyssey', ends with the astronaut's--man's rebirth. I love the fact that this film is only 1 hour and 7 minutes This is a very good film and I highly recommend it. I rate it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is the Greatest Film Director of All Time. No Contest. This, his second film, provides a solid basis from which connections can be made to his subsequent features. The story is second rate, as is the screenplay, but this film has a visual flair that is unmatched for it's time period. This is no masterpiece and it certainly isn't for everyone, but any serious Kubrick fan should seek it out. Kubrick didn't start off as the best director ever, but it is apparent from this film, that he had the potential to do it, and he did. Goodbye, S.K. You are missed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect to be sure, yet a picture that holds the Kubrick touch- indie inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killer's Kiss holds the story elements of a down and dirty film-noir, made for the drive-in and smaller theaters of the mid 50's, and of a Davey, a boxer (Jamie Smith). He's just lost his last fight, though that's hardly on his mind now. What is on his mind is Gloria (Irene Kane), the woman who lives across from him in his apartment. When he views her getting harassed by a thug (Frank Silvera), he steps in to help, and in the process is drawn into her story, and then drawn into her affections. When she's kidnapped by the same thug, this leads him to go looking for her, in the dangerous side streets and alleys of New York, before he heads off to Seattle.This was iconoclast Stanley Kubrick's second feature film (his first that's most easily available on video and DVD), and as I watched it I knew I wasn't seeing anything of a landmark caliber. Indeed, there were some flaws in the performances (though to Kubrick's defense some of the voices are probably not even of those who are talking!), as well as a weak story turn here and there. However, what makes Killer's Kiss such a highly interesting view is how the 26 year-old Kubrick approaches the material, and what he adds to what else would be a low-grade B-noir. While he is working cheap, he's doing it in his own experimental fashion. That he was so young when he made it adds a special little touch- college kids and independent filmmakers could look at this and feel inspired, despite it being nearly half a century since it was made (real locations and on a shoe-string budget is a constant for those in the indie world). Using the neon-lit streets, the darkened side-streets, and the rooftops and building interiors as his landscapes, Kubrick paints a vivid backdrop for his characters. It is probably correct to say that Kubrick got better as a filmmaker after this film, yet there are sequences (the entrancing ballet sequence with the narration, the timing in the boxing match, as well as his expressiveness with shadows/value, and the mannequin climax) that display his obvious talent as a director, photographer, and editor.

		<fullReview>Killer's kiss does not deserve to use memory space, even for a movie buff. I wonder what makes it worth watching. Not the acting nor the directing. The filming locations maybe. The story? It's a lame one: hardly any tempo and a poor development.Surely the fact that it's an early Kubrick directorial (and writing and lighting and editing) effort artificially keeps it away from oblivion. Some people in the audience seemed to be pleased to see Kubrick prove very little here. They laughed during what is intended to be the key scene in the warehouse, just before the epilogue. Although I didn't find it funny, neither did I find the scene more effective than the rest.To sum it up I was quite disappointed. I didn't expect a great movie but I was not prepared for something that boring. Anyway what remains is that Kubrick managed to shoot that movie on a shoestring yet he wears too many hats. Reminding next year's The Killing I believe he learned a lot from that poor work. That's what is important after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other reviewers have seen signs of genius in this film. I didn't. If I didn't know that this film was by Kubrick I would dismiss it as some B movie made by a third rate director. The Foley sound were way over done and the voice dubbing was poor. The sound track was irritating after 10 minutes. It was the same maudlin crap over and over. The acting was mediocre and the story matched the music. "The Killers", Kubrick's next movie was a much better and worthy movie. Any fan of Kubrick would have to watch this movie for historical purposes but besides that it is really not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First class Stanley Kubrick stinker about a pugilist's finding love with a dancer who tells him a story of woe.Seems that her ballet sister married a wealthy man to help them care for their ailing father. On the day of his death, the sister killed herself. Come on, this is just a little too much to take.The acting is absolutely awful. The cast seems to read their lines without feelings. For a pugilist, this guy is far from punchy.The woman at the dance hall has a black boss who is insanely jealous and doesn't want to let her go. Blaming the boxer for her departing, he sends his goons after him only to have the latter kill his manager by mistake.The story lasts for 70 minutes. 70 minutes of sheer ennui.</fullReview>
