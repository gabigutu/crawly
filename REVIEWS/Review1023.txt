		<shortDescription>Beautifully done, action-packed, great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attended a pre-opening screening of Laika's stop motion animated movie "Kubo and the Two Strings" yesterday and I have to say I totally loved it! The story is set in ancient Japan, where a young boy named Kubo cares for his ailing mother in a seaside Japanese village. He is a beloved storyteller who plays a magical shamisen (Japanese 3-string instrument). A spirit from the past turns Kubo's life upside down by re-igniting an age-old vendetta. In order to survive, he sets out on a quest to locate a magical suit of armor once worn by his late father, a legendary Samurai warrior. He makes friends and allies, encounters monsters and evil demons, and learns important lessons along the way. Visually, this is epically incredible and a game changer for stop motion. The action and excitement kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn't recommend it for really small children, though. There are times it's scary and the monsters are very well done! There's an excellent moral to the story and delightful humor, so children and adults will both enjoy it. Well done Laika. Best one yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a plethora of imagination, invention, and a fusion of visual storytelling and myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what I love in Kubo and the Two Strings (among several other things)? It doesn't go out of its way to explain its magic. It simply IS. Oh, sure, there's a talking monkey that saves the lead character Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson, the monkey by Charlize Theron), and there's an explanation briefly (and then a later one, which I won't reveal at all), but it doesn't matter any more than how Kubo can use his guitar strings to make his origami turn into sword-wielding samurai, or how the former bodyguard named Beetle comes to be (Matthew McConaughey going back into his 'McConnaissance' mode as being a truly great performance expanding what we thought he's capable of a semi-comic sidekick).The filmmakers let the characters explain when they need to, yet when they do it's done in the form of storytelling - at one point when Monkey is finally pressed by Kubo (and Beetle too) to say what is going on with his otherworldly grandfather and his Aunt who is out to, well, kill him and what Monkey has to do with it, she can only tell it as Kubo plays his guitar and the papers for his origami go into the air to show as she tells. This is a film that loves storytelling and storytellers, and yet never forgets that this is a full-bodied CINEMATIC experience.I can't remember the last time I've recently seen so much imagination and visual invention in one fantastical animated film, stop motion or otherwise (not even Finding Dory, which certainly has both humor and some heartfelt moments, got to that this year). The story involves a little boy, who we are introduced to at the start as being saved/protected by his mother as a baby (with an eye cut out, by his grandfather), that is at the start making money by performing with his flying/magic origami in a village while tending to his mother who seems to be suffering from amnesia (as an aside, I knew I would love this movie about five minutes in when the filmmakers show us what this dynamic between son and mother is as the latter stares off into space with a haunted, sad look as the son tries his best to care for her, all without words, a perfect moment that I'd never expect to see in a kid's film in a multiplex kind of environment).But Kubo can't be out after dark, the evil sister of his Mother - with a black hat and white mask that makes her creepy past Burton-type standards - attacks, and Kubo is sent away and is knocked out. When he awakes Monkey is there and, soon after on this quest to find items that will help him face his evil Aunt and grandfather, the Beetle guard, and it becomes a hero's journey story. And what a hero and journey! There's a lot of action that the filmmakers pack into this movie - it is a Japanese fantasy-inspired film, so there may be some violent imagery that may scare the wee ones like under four of five, but most kids should be able to take it and, if I remember how I was at that age, love it - and it involves things like a giant skeleton monster that comes to life with swords stuck in its skull (and the three characters have to find which one is their unbreakable one), and, my favorite weird and wonderful creation, a group of underwater eyeballs that, when one looks too long at them, puts the person in a trance leading down to a... well, don't want to give it away.The voice-work is a delight which, as I said, McConaughey really digs into being a character who is the faithful protector though has some 'off' memory problems at times and a looser way of looking at protecting a child than Monkey (Theron plays the strict motherly figure as good as she's played any role, including Monster or Furiosa), and it becomes this story that's as much about family than it is about revenge or other petty things. You do have to pay attention, this isn't a movie that you can throw on for your kids and they can act crazy or get distracted: it asks that you watch it and take in a story that at its core isn't too far removed from Joseph Campbell, but does so many twists that it becomes its own original entity.Kubo and the Two Strings gives you all that you could want in a family animated movie, but more than that is a splendid, heart-rending fantasy epic in under 100 minutes. It brings me back to when I first saw something like The Dark Crystal and was amazed at what creators can do when they embrace really creating a WORLD that their characters can inhabit - not to mention keeping any humor to the situations or behavior, nothing that dates it at all. I can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laika's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kubo and the Two Strings" is a hard movie to explain. There is a story in it and the adventure is grand and fun, but I can't place it into a category of traditional storytelling. The themes of the film are the values of memories and how we truly can never forget people that we lose throughout our lifetime. Very mature themes that are handled with such finesse and creativity that I can't say I have seen anything like it before. Even when you as the audience know where the story is headed, the film surprises you with the delivery and you actually grow and learn with the characters. The strength of the film is the pure visceral experience it provides. The visuals and sound had a layer of depth and drama that you feel in your inner core. It is more of an experience than it is a movie that you watch. Throughout the film, I felt moments of sadness, loss, happiness, horror, fear, and accomplishment. It is a movie that truly raises the bar for animation and it saddens me that many people will not check it out as it is very different from traditional animated films that we are used to seeing from other major animation studios. So much care and attention went into this film. The world Laika has created is rich with so much history, story, mythos, and culture that even some movies and series that are much longer can't fully create. I felt that the world is living and that magic is truly alive. I love how the character make it feel special that magic exists, but aren't put of by it, when they see it for themselves and have to question the logic.The characters are fun and lovable, but also brave and dimensional. Not one character felt out of place and they're inclusion felt important. The voice casting is top-notch and I felt like the celebrities actually made an effort. Unlike many big-budget animated productions, The voice actors weren't distracting and added their own layer of charisma that enhanced and drew attention to the characters. Monkey is probably the best character and I feel like she'll be the fan favorite as she's funny, powerful, and a total bada**.Overall, Laika has produced probably their best animated film to date and that is saying a lot from a studio that produces quality efforts time and time again. "Kubo and the Two Strings" is unlike anything out there and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The animation alone is breathtakingly gorgeous. The beautiful score and music only adds to the complexity of the film. It is probably the best film of 2016 so far and I find it hard to beat. I highly recommend that people check out this highly creative experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LAIKA has done it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those talented folks at LAIKA have done it again. KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is not just one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. Not since Pixar's "Up," have death and loss been handled do firmly and delicately. "Kubo" is fun, moving, hopeful, and profound. A terrific story of bravery and acceptance.Written by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler and directed by LAIKA's own president, Travis Knight, KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is set in a fantastical Japan where a one-eyed kid who masters the art of origami and storytelling, Kubo, (voiced by Art Parkinson of "Game Of Thrones") would go out to work to earn money during the day by entertaining audiences in the middle of a market but he comes home right before sundown to tend to his sick mother, it has to be before sundown because at night, his mother's sisters, two evil twins (voice day Oscar nominee Rooney Mara) would try to get Kubo's other eye. The past catches up to them, an old vendetta resurfaces, Kubo must run and join forces with Monkey (voiced by Oscar winner Charlize Theron) and a beetle (voiced by Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey) on a quest to retrieve the helmet, the sword unbreakable and the armor that would prepare Kubo to fight the vengeful Moon King (voiced by Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes). This quest would unlock Kubo's family mystery and lead him to fulfill his destiny.I've always appreciated animation, but with stop-motion, it's extra level of appreciation, knowing the extra hard work they put into even just to get a few seconds of shots. It's a level of dedication and discipline that never ceases to blow my mind, that's why I'm a huge fan of LAIKA. Especially with this latest film of theirs, the scale is much bigger, there's a sequence involving a large skeleton giant, your brain starts to wonder as you see that scene just how many hours, how many weeks, how many months did it take for them to make that happen.This film has action, it has love drama, it has family drama, it has a great sense of humor and it's also about community coming together to help one another. It has its own way of featuring and respecting Japanese art and tradition, but even if you're not too familiar with that particular culture, KUBO resonates much deeper than just the aesthetics. It's a film that's perfect for the whole family. And on top of that, it delicately teaches our young ones about how to grieve in a healthy manner. There's also a twist to the story which I won't spoil for you here. This film is just so beautiful and pristine. Charlize Theron has that commanding voice you would follow to the ends of the earth. And Matthew McConaughey voices Beetle as playful and as proud as Tim Allen did Buzz Lightyear. So it's a combination of outstanding stop motion animation, excellent voice talents, a well-told story and strong characters that make KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS one of my favorite this year.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film was told from another perspective, Kubo and the Two Strings might be considered a bit preachy. It still might be, regardless. But no matter how you look at it, it is something to be looked at more than once. It is simply an amazing work of animated achievement in cinema.Set in what could be medieval Japan, a little boy named Kubo scratches out a meager existence on the village streets earning just enough for him and his mother to survive. For her part, mom (voiced by Charlize Theron) sits at the mouth of their mountaintop cave in a comatose state every day until dusk. This is also the time when Kubo must be home, not only to be there when she snaps out of it to regale him with stories of his long lost warrior father, but so he can be safe from the evil that bewitched his mother and left him with only one eye. Failing to do this one fateful night forces Kubo on a journey to recover mythical armor and weapons that will beat back the forces of darkness and restore love and harmony to his life and the lives of others. Aiding him on his quest are a miniature monkey carving come to life, an origami samurai, and a beetle/man warrior (Matthew McConaughey).What is truly exceptional about Kubo and the Two Strings is not the story. The characters have American English accents and are not Asian. A couple characters aren't really fleshed out (those of Brenda Vaccaro and Ralph Fiennes for example). Although the film is geared toward a younger audience, there are deep themes of rebirth and reincarnation that are a major part of the movie and seem heavy handed, as was hinted at earlier. The story is not the star, the presentation of the story is what shines.Anyone who is familiar with Laika studios work (Coraline, The Boxtrolls) will not be disappointed in how Kubo and the Two Strings looks. For the uninitiated, be prepared to see a film that hearkens back to the old style of painstaking, stop-motion animation with a splash of 21st century wizardry. These filmmakers have done what other strive to do with budgets two, four, even six times larger. They have made an animated world that pulls you in with its realism. It doesn't come off as cartoon like. Eyes glisten, teeth are almost translucent, hair blows in the wind, characters have shadows. Any shortcomings in the script are quickly forgiven when the evil sisters float into the scene or when Kubo (Art Parkinson) captivates the town folk with his storytelling. It's the attention to detail, the craftsmanship, and artistic appreciation that sets films like Kubo and the Two Strings apart from other animated feature films. The filmmakers have learned a lot from the old masters and have served notice that they are at the top of their game. Just sit back and let them and their latest undertaking work their magic on you.www.mediumraretv.org</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of epic proportions. Lovers of film, animation, storytelling, do not miss out on this one!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubo and the Two Strings might be one of the best movies I've seen all year. In a crowded year of comic book movies, sequels, and remakes, that's probably not saying much. I wanted to be fair though and look at those movies with an open mind and a little background on their franchises for what each movie wanted to accomplish. However I've been waiting for so long to see something fresh, original, and holy cow this was it. Kubo is a stop motion animated film by Laika studios who've produced Coraline, Paranorman, and the Box Trolls. I really enjoyed Coraline and didn't really like Paranorman or the Box Trolls so I had no idea what to expect from this movie. My friend and I went opening night because the trailers looked interesting, and we were into the entire run time. It's so beautifully shot, the story is simple yet engaging, and the action is just amazing to behold. I don't want to give away anything about the story because I went into this movie blind not knowing that much and I think people should try to do the same. It's surprisingly also very funny! My friend and I just looked at each other shocked at how much this movie made us laugh. The characters are great and the voice work is very impressive. Everything about this movie is just so impressive. For little kids maybe it's not something to hold their interest, but older kids and adults I think should seriously consider checking this out. It's a fun, well written, and very emotional story. Not only should this movie win best animated feature so far, it should be nominated for best picture I'm serious! Lovers of film, animation, storytelling. PLEASEEEE go out and support this movie I heard it will have a low opening weekend and it's such a shame. We need to make this film a hit I want more animated movies of this quality, check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding! Original, beautiful and heartful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is original, beautiful to watch and has heart and soul. The quirkiness of this movie only adds to its lovability. It is hard to find an original movie and using origami as the base of this movie is simply genius.Kubo's grandfather has stolen his eye and now is after the other and he will do whatever he has to, to get the other eye. His two aunts are frighten witches. His mother has lost all her memories and many dangers await Kubo and his only helpers are a monkey and a silly half man, half beetle and an endless supply of paper. I know this all sounds totally crazy, but it all works together quite nicely to make this incredible movie.I struggled once trying to make an origami swan so I appreciate the origami in this film which has a mind of its own. Kubo plays a two- stringed instrument which transforms simple paper into magnificent, magical shapes and forms. The voice-overs in this film are stupendous and really bring it to life. My favorite character is Kubo (Art Parkinson) who is just so adorable yet strong, independent and goodhearted. My other favorite is Monkey (Charlize Theron) who is brave, funny, clever and very stubborn. I love her character because of all these traits. Even though she is tough, she has a kind, sweet side that she shows how much she loves her son. There is also the beetle (Matthew McConaughey) who is hysterical, dangerous and a straight shooter or, at least according to him he is. I love his character because its funny and had me belly laughing. His affection for Monkey is adorable. Of course, there are villains of this film. The sisters, both played by Rooney Mara portrays them as crazy, wacko witches and her voice is perfectly scary. The other villain, The Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is the weird Grandfather who wants Kubo's other eye and he is super creepy.One of my favorite scenes is when Kubo, Monkey and Beetle are trying to defeat a giant skeleton and find the sword of unbreakablity. It is adventurous and funny. The graphics are incredible, especially the way they created the skeleton. This is the biggest clay animation character ever made. I thought this action scene was intricate and believable.I recommend this film for ages 7 to 18. Adults will like it too. I do want to suggest that if your child is younger than 7, they might get scared with the darkness and the villains, but if they can accept that it is all fake then they will be okay. I rate this film 5 out of 5 magical origami stars. Reviewed by Morgan B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By the time the talking monkey shows up, it never once feels out of place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young Kubo (Art Parkinson) lives a simple life on a small island village. At night, he cares for his frail mother, who suffers from bouts of amnesia. But during the day, Kubo fervently entertains the townsfolk with music, magical origami, and fantastical tales of heroic samurai on treacherous crusades. One evening, while Kubo participates in a customary ritual to receive guidance from his departed father's spirit, he inadvertently ignores his mother's warnings not to stay out past nightfall and is accosted by two powerful witches (both voiced by Rooney Mara). His mother comes to his aid, but must sacrifice herself to allow him to escape. Awakening in a snowstorm with a strange monkey (Charlize Theron) as his only friend, Kubo must embark on a quest of discovery just as mystical and perilous as those he once told."Pay careful attention to everything you may see or hear." There's something striking about the choice repetitions of significant lines, and something reservedly powerful about the opening moments, featuring a mother who bares physical scars to match those of her son. And the use of a diminutive storyteller to narrate and shape his own skein of adventure and tragedy is particularly inspiring, especially as he bravely confronts the heartbreak of tending to the gaps in memory and the spells of stupor that overtake his mother's normalcy. It's all part of the groundwork for a mesmerizing odyssey.Masterfully blending together Oriental high fantasy (or a romanticization of Japanese feudal military aristocracy), Greek mythology, and an Americanized viewpoint on action and heroism, "Kubo and the Two Strings" is seemingly anachronistic in its cultural suggestions and verbiage (though nevertheless sharply scripted) as it sets about constructing an epic expedition through an orphic land. Despite resorting to formulaic processes for its protagonists, for the great evils that target them, and for the supernatural heraldry that protects them, few moments can be directly compared to any other animated picture. The witches are perfectly diabolical - and entirely uncommon for a family-friendly venture - while a bone golem, a paper samurai, and a boat of leaves are each wholly original manifestations. The artistry on display is of the extremely imaginative, highly visual kind, creating a notable style for its world that Laika Entertainment appears to have cornered (predominantly in its use of stop-motion animation and massive armatures, previously employed for "Coraline" and "Corpse Bride," among others).The plot tends to wander in the middle of the film as the basic components of a grand adventure weigh on the uniqueness of the individual missions, which occasionally fail to transition or relate to the overarching concepts as smoothly as the should. Similarly, the editing together of a few scenes is abrupt, as if segues was cut out for time. But it does succeed handsomely at the start. Setting a tone and introducing characters are efficiently handled tasks, but steadily incorporating the magical elements is done superbly. By the time the talking monkey shows up, it never once feels out of place. The possessed folded paper, the phantasmal music, and the winning expressions on strangely palpable faces are all natural, amusing pieces of this vivid trek of continual wonderment and excitement.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite part is the 2 sisters. I like them because of how emotionally creepy they were. They appeared in the background and wore masks. The masks really made them cool. I liked how her voice echoed behind the mask.I was actually emotionally disturbed about the parents. The mother seemed like she was wasting away anyway. I was creeped out when I found out the monkey was the mother all along. The father seemed like a lost cause.I actually liked the part of the ending where the grandpa was knocked out and didn't know what just happened. He seemed like a good guy. I think Asians tend to go crazy like that. It's really creepy. A lady at church is gone who I liked but who was bothering me once, when I left and moved somewhere else.I liked a lot of the animation, like the eyeballs under the sea being so cute and funny.It was neat after the credits seeing them make the big skeleton and seeing the cool artists at work. That one guy at the end was really cute!I think the "only" really interesting thing for most of us was the sisters and probably because they were magic, ultimately as the best part. The whole show was still good as is, but I cherish this piece of this show, as I do that when I move on from show to show sometimes.It was also moving/touching to see the ancient Japanese ancestors and the Japanese culture as what they showed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Laika the foil to Aardman?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start this review by revealing that when I was younger, my family absolutely loved Aardman and their stop-motion comedies, especially Chicken Run and The Curse of the Were- Rabbit. I need to see them again at some point, as back when I was at the age when we still watched them, I considered them nothing special. After seeing Kubo and the Two Strings, I have revamped interest in stop-motion animated pictures, especially Laika's other works. While Aardman represents a light-hearted comic style, Laika represents the high-action, complex, dramatic style, and nowhere is that more apparent than here. I was so amazed and scared at a decent amount of the effects the animation gave out (I didn't see the 3D version), and for stop- motion, the way everything moves is so fluid (despite some expected choppy parts) that anyone who hasn't looked into this film might think of it as CGI. While the writing makes some mistakes with the placement of its humor, it is still quite hilarious and offers a lot of epic and moving scenes. Each of the characters bring this to light, being outstandingly developed and being just what they should be, if not a tad more. Kubo and the Two Strings is, by far, among the strongest non-Disney animated movies I have seen, and should not be missed by anyone who likes animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5 )THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An animated film brimming with stunning visuals.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: A young boy goes on a quest to find a magic helmet and armor to protect himself and others from evil forces.JIM'S REVIEW: Laika Studios (Coraline. ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls) has long been pioneers in stop-motion animation, a time-consuming and difficult art form. This studio has always set a high bar in terms of animation, although its storytelling never quite equal that pinnacle of success. With Kubo and the Two Strings, it has finally combined the two and has created a joyous and totally satisfying film experience.&#xfffc;Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a master storyteller who charms the villagers with his imaginative tales and origami skills. As his stories unfold, literally, so does this film. Colorful sheets of handmade papers glide through the air and form various objects in such graceful and enthralling ways, animation-wise. We learn of his story, of his past life, and the dangers that await in his future. We meet Kubo and begin his journey with new comrades like Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey) as they travel from one peril to the next.&#xfffc;The screenplay by Mark Haimes and Chris Butler has an epic feel and keeps the action sequences moving at a fast pace after a leisure beginning as its sets up its character and the interrelationships of this trio of adventurers. The direction by Travis Knight is impeccable. He envisions surreal worlds that are masterful created by him and his creative team. In general, the voice-over work is strong and appealing too, especially by Ms. Theron, Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King, and Master Parkinson in the title role. There is also fine work from George Takei, Brenda Vacarro, and Rooney Mara in smaller roles. However, Mr. McConaughey's vocals never quite blend with his character, but, in his defense, the character needed better development on the written page and in its animated form.&#xfffc;At times, the words sound like second-rate bromides from a fortune cookie factory, but the imagery is consistently outstanding and awesome to behold. There is so much artistry that it overwhelms...in the best of ways. A magical sword cuts waves in two...a large red skeleton looms over its prey...black smoke bellows around a village, enveloping it...a sea of glowing eyes fills its watery surroundings...blue paper-folded birds fly with their real counterparts before rapidly converting into mosquitoes...golden leaves float effortlessly and create a ship of wonders. (One long and memorable sequence involving a fluorescent metallic serpent is spectacular state-of-the-art animation.) &#xfffc;Beside the remarkable stop motion work, special mention must go to Dario Marinelli and his musical score which melds perfectly with the imagery on screen. His use of atonal chords and dissonance reflect the Japanese sounds beautifully and enhance the overall impact of the film.There are some minor, very minor. missteps along the way (Mr. McConaughey disappoints whenever his Southern drawl slips in and out of character, most jarringly, the spiritual symbolism of the narrative gets heavy-handed, and the dialogue has a modern edginess that conflicts with this ancient narrative story-line).&#xfffc;That said, Kubo and the Two Strings, is easily one of the best animated films this year...and one of the best films as well.

		<shortDescription>A masterful stop-motion film for kids and adults alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, here's the problem with writing about Kubo and the Two Strings: a lot ? and I do mean A LOT ? of what I need to point out might or might not slip me to spoiler territory. Sucks, I know, but not doing so would not give this movie justice. So what I'm about to do is explain the story, explain the surface level stuff, and leave the deeper material later on. Deal?In either case, yes, you've heard it right; Kubo and the Two Strings is a masterpiece. After almost a decade of major studios like DreamWorks, Disney, and Illumination trotting out safe, eye-appealing kid's movies, the small Claymation studio Laika returns once again with yet another masterwork. It's a film that exceeds more than just their use of performances and impressive visual style with their usual somber aesthetic and shockingly relatable fables. This time, they finally step out of their usual Gothic horror design and focus more on a Miyazaki- inspired Eastern palette. The result might finally replace their previous film ParaNorman as their definitive peak of their abilities, and probably be the best stop-motion movie ever made since Nightmare Before Christmas.Borrowing wholesale from Asian folklore, the story takes place in Ancient Japan where a one-eyed child by the name Kubo lives in a desolate mountain with his grief-stricken mother. During his downtime, he travels to a nearby village to perform origami tricks with his magic guitar (which is so amazing you won't even question it) , which he uses to tell an ancient story about his father - a legendary samurai - who was the first to square up against the Moon King with the aid of three pieces of golden armor (sword, helmet, and breastplate) . But after disobeying his mother for not staying home after dark, he soon encounters the Evil Sister who are in cahoots with the Moon King and decides to mess things up in the village and take Kubo away in the process. The mother, reawaken from her grief, defends Kubo with her last of her powers in an attempt to fend off her foes. In the aftermath, Kubo now must find the three pieces and make things right while fending off the Moon King and his cohorts. Along the journey, he encounters a stern, assertive Monkey (Charlize Theron) and a brave but dense warrior Beetle (Matthew McConaughey).So, no guesses for which this story will wrap up in the end, or even how the inevitable plot twist will turn up. However, like Laika always promises, there's real depth and a fresh new take on this material amongst their visual flair.SPOILERS!!! You see, the whole film is pretty much a parable for a broken/dysfunctional family scenario integrated into an epic fetch quest storyline. Kubo's mother is scarred by the Moon King who happens to be Kubo's grumpy grandfather (Ralph Fiennes). When she wouldn't comply to join his world ? the world free of mortal consequence and pain ? he punishes her by killing her mate and damaging Kubo's left eye. So really, the whole clichéd epic story where the hero fights a villain to save the kingdom actually has some resonance because they twisted it into a psychological trial of fixing a broken family. It's even right down to having the two companions (You read the spoiler warning!!) be the reincarnated versions of Kubo's parents guiding Kubo to find the right tools to fend off old Grandpas' evildoings and bring him away from his evil. It's the type of story that can also relate to both young kids and adults alike, which is a type of feat we seldom see these days.Now granted, the twist with Beetle and Monkey seems fairly obvious right from the get-go, with them possessing typical mother-and-father traits. However, it seems like it's the point like it almost comes with the supply of Kubo engaging in a trial for finding his courage and family connection up until the big boss fight.Even if any young mind wouldn't capture all the subtext, they're probably too busy gushing over the widely impressive stop-motion animation. Even for a guy who never really get all impressed with stop- motion, I was in awe with what Laika has done here. With subtle feats like face details and clothing/hair physics to grand moments like the varied and large-scale boss fights, I'm glad this type of animation came quite a long way. What also amazes me lies in the remarkably detailed Eastern setting bursting with color and homage. For an animation company coming from the origins of the classic Harryhausen days, it's simply astonishing for how far their hard work exceeds this medium.The performances are too good to dismiss. Mathew McConaughey shows his usual charming swagger in Beetle while also pulling off his shortsighted aspects. Charlize Theron once again gives her best as a stern Monkey. Ralph Fiennes almost disappears in his role as the intimidating yet entirely nuanced villain the Moon King. Rooney Mara also impresses as the Sinister Twins, who mostly sounds reminiscent of the Twins from The Shining. The standout, though, is Game of Thrones own Art Parkinson utilizes impressive range as Kubo, invoking both the vulnerable and the courageous aspects of his character.By now, you probably guessed that this is my new favorite movie. There's virtually nothing hampering the movie nor any one element overwhelming another. As a kids film, it's pretty much perfect. As a warm diversion for the adults, it still works considerably. The type of film that relates to kids without talking down to them. It's the type of deceptively simple storytelling that captures adult themes without falling gratuitous territory. It's the type of film that contains huge respect for Eastern folklore without wearing out its welcome. Filled with character dynamics and emotion, this is an instant classic and you need to see it!For more reviews, check out my blog: http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, moving, and so beautifully crafted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stop-Motion animation can be a thing of pure beauty. I've been a fan of Laika's previous films (particularly Coraline and ParaNorman to a great extent), and so I really was excited for this. Based on the trailers, it looked like a dazzling experience and I was sure that it would not fail to meet expectations. I was right. There's a real sense of artistry to the film that is missing in a lot of other kids' animated films. It's about family, the power of memory, and longing, and it manages to create some truly memorable, fantastic villains that happen to be both well-written and really terrifying. More than anything, the themes at its core really resonate. This may likely be the best animated film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great story coming from stop motion animation studio, Laika.It's not the greatest story from their list of animated movies, but it's very poetic, and this creativity really makes up for it.Kubo is a kid with one eye taken from him as a baby by his grandfather, he's a story teller in his village (The story he told with his paper characters within the film is better than the story overall). Then in an attempt to make contact with his father in the after world, brings him back on his grandfather's radar who sends his aunts to get him as he goes on a journey to find his father's Armour for protection.The story was implemented so well through animation. It was so imaginative. Nothing like being shown a story rather than being told a story which is bad for animation.They really moved the characters around, and the characters are worth moving. Very artistic and colorful. I especially like Monkey, from the character design to the voice of Charlize Theron.Overall, very good looking picture.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's something special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare that I feel like I have seen something remarkable, special, or original. Everything that comes out seems to be a sequel, reboot, remake, or ripped straight from something else. I didn't feel this way about Kubo. I remember seeing a trailer for it as part of a survey I was taking on movies a while back. I was instantly interested in seeing it.I went with my wife and son. He's five. I expected the parts that were slow to bother him as Pete's Dragon (for example) lost his attention several times. He said, as we left, that this was best movie he'd ever seen. He was genuinely excited about it. The wife liked it and I loved it. I've been a big fan of animation since I was a wee fellow myself and I still enjoy the genre mostly in anime and the more "adult" stuff like what DC releases. Take from either me or the five year old that this is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the darker 2016 animated movies, also one that is Oscar worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look guys, I appreciate stop motion. I've seen some shorts that feature it, mostly Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep. I even saw The Oscar nominated Shaun the Sheep movie while traveling to Paris. But I haven't seen any of Laika's movies. Not even Coraline. But when the trailers made it intriguing, I knew I was going to miss something big if I didn't go. I'm glad I did go (Note: this review will be spoiler free).The story is about Kubo, a storyteller with the ability to use two strings to animate his storytelling, who must go on a quest to find his fathers magical armor to fight his grandfather, the Moon king. Going into it, I thought it would be too similar to other action packed animated films, but I was incorrect. The story is sometimes unique, yes action packed, and entertaining. I do have one nitpick to give out, but I won't say it do to spoilers.Along with the great writing, we are brought a cast of memorable and charming characters. Kubo is a likable main character that is bright, funny, and brave. What is more interesting about him and the journey is that the journey he goes through is similar to the story he tells. The monkey (who came to life from a money charm) starts out as the impatient guardian of Kubo through his journey, but then becomes less harsh on Kubo and more caring. She was my personal favorite character due to bringing humor in her impatience and sarcasm. Bettle, who was formerly trained by Kubo's samurai father and then cursed to become a beetle, is the more dim-witted one, but is very funny and charming as well and serves some purpose to the plot. Kubo's two aunts (who are on his grandfathers side) are CREEPY beyond belief, and those two characters make it more suitable for audiences older than 6. There's a few others I won't spoil, but they bare importance to the plot as well.The animation in this movie is unbelievable. The animators took years of effort to create figures and animate them, and the effects and character movements came out so great that has just as good animation as the lego movie. It looks realistic and beautiful, and the credits are similar to Hotel Translvania where they have traditional animation. Also, the humor in the movie is really funny, and makes the movie even more enjoyable.Kubo and the two strings is a movie that I highly recommend to 8 or over. The writing is solid, the animation is beautiful, and the characters are memorable. So all I can say is go watch it. Just do it. It's a movie for kids and adults alike, and it gives Zootopia a run for its money (No pun intended, it's not getting even close to what Zootopia got in the US and Canada).9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a visually beautiful movie, but I'm not sure which age group it's actually pitched at. Scary dementor type creatures, scary skeleton monster and a scary old guy. Probably too scary overall for young children. But it's a good action adventure story set in medieval Japan, with a cheeky young protagonist and a couple of unexpected sidekicks going on a quest. It may kick off a whole new origami craze too. Is it origami if scissors are involved? Definitely worth going to see if you like children's animated movies, but think twice about the age and sensitivity of children that you might take along to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film hit a sweet spot for me. It merges essential Shintoism, magic and origami in a story about storytelling, four subjects of deep interest for me. This is orgasmic level engagement, this mix. I need to see it again in 3D to see if it improves. This would have been the very rare modern film actually photographed in 3D.Some other elements could have distracted: the very western idea of a quest gives enough script to fill the time. The style of animation has bodies and motion more realistic than faces; in another context this would matter but here we are in a paper world. The use of traditional Japanese villains and characters from myths requires knowledge even I lacked. The style of animation requires a relatively stationary camera which seems inadequate, even in a Japanese context.The writing is superb, surpassing Pixar and achieving a level completely unexpected. This is true in lines: "blink now;" in the way things unfold unexpectedly and in the nesting of stories. Oh, the overlapping nesting! We have stories within that tell enclosing stories. We have recalled and invented stories cogenerating. The main combat is between/among stories. Memory and stories are bound in an unusual way. So many events unfold in novel ways. This is all the more impressive when you consider the inflexible manner of production. You cannot iterate and reshoot like you can with computers or eve actors. What you see is largely what they started with years before even they saw it. If just for the writing, see this movie.The effects were interestingly different, and by themselves would perhaps have underwhelmed. But the story context by the time things got active added enough. Effects early in the movie have magically folded characters animated by the stories within the story and these were amazing.I am not seeing many films these days, so it is profound luck that my 3 and 5 year olds took me into this.And... the credits roll over the George Harrison song that very few understand in its role in the White Album. Here it isn't just used with this knowledge, it is rendered so by a woman I never heard of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Magical Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubo and the Two Strings, the next installment from the stop-go animation studio Laika is here, and I think it's an amazing film. I've stated for years that Laika could be the biggest competition for Pixar, and finally Laika has delivered a movie to prove me right. Kubo and the Two Strings is beautifully animated, conveys amazing amounts of emotional depth, and brings a true sense of magic. In the past I had been critical of some stop-go animation, but the works of Aardman and Laika have taken it to a premier level.This film's animation is gorgeous, simply put the characters, the settings, the creatures, they all look amazing. It shouldn't come as any surprise, Laika has consistently made beautiful films, but it's always impressive when you consider the amount of time and effort that goes into animating a stop-go animation film. Above the animation the looks of the film is amazing, as the animators used color so well to give the film a look, and even more impressively the animators weren't afraid to make it dark. That has been one of the best staples of Laika, it's boldness to be willing to make an animated movie dark (but only to an extent.) The boldness to make the film look dark occasionally, really exemplifies the film's impressive emotional depth. Much like Pixar, Laika seems to understand that the marshmallow fluff most studios give kids, are very one dimensional. While that fluff is in this film, there's elements of light horror in this film as well. Any film that can juxtapose kiddy fluff with any kind of horror tones, deserves credit for their depth and understanding of mood. It also helps make this film feel all the more magical, as if the presence of a character can change the mood of an area, which is amazing.The entire film's look and depth help create a truly magical film, one where imagination seems to be at full capacity for the writers and filmmakers. The film's villain characters, voiced by Rooney Mara, are creepy and perfectly designed, and the main characters are very well developed as well. This film uses color amazingly, especially blue, which is a common color used in films today, but the use of it in this film both enhances the story and the mood beautifully. Above that the voice work is also incredible, especially the work of Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron.All in all, this film is amazing, it may possibly be the best film of the year so far, although it's still early and Captain America: Civil War was pretty great as well. The story may have been a tad predictable in the end, but the magical look and feel of this animated film transcends a slightly predictable story. For those who love great movie and those who have imaginative young kids, see this in the theaters where the sense of magic can still be felt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether you're young or old, "Kubo and the Two Strings" is a wonderful stop-motion adventure for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kubo and the Two Strings" is the latest film from Laika, the animation company that created stop motion films like "The Box Trolls", and "Coraline". In ancient Japan, a young boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson) sings songs on the streets, and tells grand tales to passersby to make a living. He supports his sick mother (Charlize Theron), the two living in a cave by the sea. The stories he tells of a warrior fighting the evil Moon King are more than just faerie tales, and soon Kubo has adventure thrust upon him when one day he discovers the truth about his family, and the powers he has hidden inside him.Laika's latest work is a beautifully imagined adventure that handles its mature themes of family and loss without pandering to children. The characters are all colourfully developed; the stop motion animation and the Eastern settings being incredibly detailed.The journey itself is fairly standard fantasy, with Kubo having to run away from his enemies while he and his followers retrieve magic relics (a suit of armor, a sword) to help defeat forces of evil. It takes a short while to gain momentum, but once it does, the story is a delight right up until the end.The strength of "Kubo and the Two Strings" is in the way fantasy tropes are presented - each new set-piece dazzles the imagination; deserts, caves, the ocean and ruined fortresses are all vibrantly designed and given a unique character. The same is true for the inhabitants of these places, like the birds and sea creatures, or even Kubo's companions: a talking monkey and a cursed samurai who is now a beetle (played by Matthew Mcconaughey).Good-natured humor and pathos is equally balanced in the script by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler, and the direction by Travis Knight is always exciting, especially in the action scenes that were actually pretty intense for a children's film."Kubo" is an excellent film that will appeal to both the young and old. I hope the film does well at the box office, so that more stop motion films can be made, especially if they're of the same quality as this picture is. "Kubo" is a fine alternative to lackluster live- action films in the action genre that have lost their sense of fun, as well CGI animations that are perhaps too zany for their own good.MORE REVIEWS AT MY BLOG: dynamitefilms.blogspot.com.au</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer's best by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had long been anticipating the release of "Kubo and the Two Strings" and needless to say, I was not disappointed. I have been a fan of Laika's productions, favoring their uniqueness-not only in stop-motion, but how they are able to make films both adults and kids can enjoy. I have seen all four of the Laika movies and by far, I believe, "Kubo" is the best."Kubo and the Two Strings" has such a thoughtful story with an heart-warming message that teaches about tradition, family, and courage. I found the uniqueness of "Kubo" to really stand out, what with the magic, monsters and storytelling done through animated origami. But I really enjoyed the character of Kubo. Not only is he a mama's boy, which he demonstrates by watching after his ill mother every day, but he is very courageous and I found him inspiring. He is just an all around lovable character you can't help but root for. Art Parkinson did a great job giving Kubo life.I do applaud Laika for the great job they did on visuals, storytelling, and sound in "Kubo". It was so nice to finally receive a genuine summer movie, especially after such disappointments like "Finding Dory" (so much hype, what a waste). "Kubo" captures the spirit of everything a family movie should be, and I highly recommend. For those worried it may be scary for younger viewers, do not worry. Of course, it all comes down to knowing your child well, but there was a group of 8-10 year old boys seated behind me who thoroughly enjoyed the movie (laughing loudly at the funny parts, getting into the fight scenes with loud "Ooh''s). When exiting the theater one of the boys even told the ticket taker,"The movie was so cool!'Overall, "Kubo and the Two Strings" leaves you with a warm feeling you just can't shake, and don't want to either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept hearing a lyric from Hamilton echo in my head as I watched this movie: "Who lives? Who dies? Who tells your story?" From a technical perspective alone, I'm in awe of Kubo. It features the best stop-motion animation I've ever seen. Although there was some augmentation with CG, the blend was seamless. (Stay for the credits where you actually see how one of the characters was animated.) Of course, technical achievements alone can't save a movie. Kubo has a unique story that kept me guessing most of the way through. It's a story about family and community and dealing with loss. The visual design of the movie is truly stunning, often lit like a candle flame and crafted like the origami that's so central to the story. There are occasional giant leaps of logic required to stay with the story, but like with Wizard of Oz this is a child's fantasy told by a child. So in the end I was okay with that. And the children in the audience when I saw it seemed to love the movie as much as I did. Kubo is a remarkable achievement and I enthusiastically recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubo is set in ancient Japan, yet created by Westerners. It is the story of a boy, told by the boy himself, yet he finds himself inside his own story. The story has a couple of holes, hence my score of 9 instead of 10. The film making carries you along so beautifully that you don't notice until it's over. The film making is extraordinary - combining stop motion animation with digital animation to create a wonderful ancient world of magic. And, the magic feels real. The characters are consistent, if impossible. And, the pace showcases the beauty of the story. The writers let you in on the plot as the characters learn it too - a wonderful approach that makes the audience a part of the film. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubo and The Two Strings quick review (cause I can't wait to sit down and write what I think of it)Coming to the cinema with my missus just to find out that we made the wrong date for the movie we intended to see which was "The secret life of pets", Kubo and The Two Strings served as a last minute backup plan. That being said we were pretty blind of what we supposed to see and let me tell you sometimes it is the best way to enjoy such a delightful and majestic animation. Plots: I won't spoil anything rather than three words: GO SEE IT! Bring your kids, younger siblings with you because this movie is downright for family. Moral lessons were being taught in natural way as if they were parts of a brilliant story told in one of the most unique kind of way. There were a few minor plot twists here and there which served enough for the unpredictability. As how some of the mechanism of magic in Kubo's world worked, the movie was pretty self-explanatory in terms of allowing the audiences to use their own imagination to interpret how things unfolded in their own ways. Visual and audio: This one is a feast for the eyes with the combination of both stop motion and CGI. Surprisingly they worked very well together as the stop-motion side brought life to the characters while CGI did a solid job at bringing effects to some of the fighting scenes. Overall the stop-motion played a majority part of bringing the spectacular of out Kubo's world and attending to even the tiniest details of each visual. About the soundtracks: There are distinctive and memorable songs everywhere. The use of Kubo's three-string guitar was smartly integrated into creating some of the most sensational sounds without overuse feelings. It made the audiences actually care and see how much emotion he put into each of his performances like each of them count for something. Overall judgement: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Thumbs Up For Two Strings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another day, another animated adventure ready to happen, and for once it is not from Disney. Hi Robbie K here, writing another review on the latest and greatest of the silver screen. The name of the movie is Kubo and the Two strings, a stop motion project that curtails to Japanese culture. It certainly promises to be a magical experience, but as always I'm here to share some thoughts on the subject. Let's get started. LIKES: ? Original and creative ? Animation and design of the movie ? Emotional BalanceWith all the cartoon sequels that come out, it is sometimes hard to find a new original tale to follow. Kubo breaks the mundane of sequels with a fresh new approach that will certainly stand out amongst the ranks of CGI films. The Japanese folklore theme provided a pallet of magic, combat, and monsters that are the essential components of an adventure tale. Kubo's land is filled with a bounty of story elements that will keep the intended young audience entertained. Both good and bad guys each have a certain edge, flare, or other characteristic that helps them stand out and all are integrated into the tale well. And it is all animated so beautifully! Kubo's animation and design are certainly a strong component that makes the adventure so unique. Stop motion continues to be one of my favorites, because the animators often think outside the box to bring the magic to the screen. I myself was impressed with how the world popped to life in a fantastic display of color that added to the character's personality. In addition, the world is also designed to represent the Japanese culture, but is presented in a manner that is somewhat warped to have that spooky/Gothic edge that we've loved (like in Coralline!). And when the spirit world denizens make an appearance, they get their own extra glaze to mirror their ambiance of the Moon Kingdom. If you haven't guessed, I really liked the animation and feel that it is certainly one of the more unique styles I've seen in a while. Where the animation and antics will get younger audience members invested in the film, it is the emotional punch that will catch the adult's eye. Kubo's story contains the heartstring pulling, gut wrenching moments that might just bring a tear to your eye. All the character dynamics are strongly built in this movie, much of which is designed around the importance of family and friends. Sure that is typical of any movie, but in Kubo this concept is also laced with the threat of death and how quickly those things can be snatched away. When combined with the music, the character design, and the voice acting?it all comes together to really hit home. DISLIKES ? The Action Component ? Lackluster SolutionsIt was hard to find fault in this movie for me, but alas there are some things I felt could have been improved on. First is the action component. Yes, I am an action junky and yes I know it holds a PG rating (I'm not that dumb). Hence I will say that the action is appropriate for the intended audience with enough excitement to latch your attention, but not too much edge to cause psychological trauma. But what I wanted was for them to use their concepts more. For instance, Kubo has some pretty cool magic, but I was expecting more spectacular spells and moves from all the hype of the trailers. I was hoping for the magic to be better integrated into the combat, perhaps integrated with some sword combat to really live the battles. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as much of Kubo's exciting qualities were used for comedic relief. Oh well at least it was done tastefully and retained the artistic style I so loved. As for the lackluster solutions category, this pertains to how much of the conflict was resolved in this movie. Kubo's fights start out with edge, pick up some excitement, and then end very? abruptly. With how creative the team had been with much of this movie, I was hoping to see that design carry over. But again the underutilization of magic resulted in these kind of boring, although very emotional, fixes that were dialogue heavy. This was especially true in the final fight, where Kubo was able to make a few speeches that preached the important morals like an after school special. While very important to the story, it just wasn't what I expected and was somewhat of a disappointing end game after all the set-up. Is this a big weakness? No, because like I said it was important and well integrated into the story and that is important to me. Still?I was hoping for more. The VERDICTKubo of the Two Strings gets two thumbs up from this reviewer and is certainly an adventure many will enjoy. The unique design, fantastically developed characters, and bright colors are mixed together for an entertaining show with a great story to boot. Yes it lacks some of the excitement I was hoping for, but they didn't sacrifice the story quality in their editing. Based on all these qualities, this reviewer certainly recommends dropping to the theater for this one, and may even suggest catching it in 3-D should the opportunity present itself. Recommended audiences for this film are those who have kids, appreciate fantastic animation or are young at heart. My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Family: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is amazing. The design aspect is incredible. It had almost a darker kind of theme which why it was so unique and breathtaking. I loved many of Kubo's lines. "If you must blink, do it now." "...Or the hero shall surely parish." (Or something along the lines of that) The dialogue drew me in from the very beginning. The animating of the water was absolutely astonishing. I did expect a lot out of this film. After all, Laika makes incredible films. I love Coraline, and Paranorman. I do like Boxtrolls as well but I think many people can agree that it doesn't come close to the phenomenal story lines of the other films. Kubo and the Two Strings does fit in with Coraline and Paranorman. The ending wasn't surprising exactly but it was beautiful and fitting. I did not expect Monkey and Beatle to die, I thought they would come back to life. I also loved how the villagers stepped in to aide Kubo without hesitation. And the way that the dead came to help was awe inspiring. Amazing film, definitely living up to the legacy of Coraline and Paranorman. Amazing style. Wonderful movie.</fullReview>

The story is a wonderful, timeless story of love, sacrifice and adventure told with mystery, warmth and a considerable amount of humor.Kubo, a boy from whom one eye was taken when he was young, must pit himself against a cold and heartless immortal, the Moon God, and his two equally cold and cruel daughters, after a quest for several pieces of magical armor. Kubo, his monkey charm come to life, and a beetle samurai with almost no memory, are the three main characters who experience the adventure together and who learn about each other as the audience learns about them.Highly recommended, from the same great studio (Laika) that created Coraline, ParaNorman and Box Trolls, this fourth meticulously and beautifully stop-animated movie continues their growing reputation and tradition of excellence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop Motion Animated Film - Love the Monkey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubo and the two strings is the latest American 3d stop-motion fantasy motion adventure animated film. Mostly people like animated films, but specifically animation by stop-motion is quite amazing and beautiful. Kubo is one of the best film by LAIKA animation studio. This film tells the story of the young boy name Kubo, who go through various circumstances that is not required to describe. He fined himself with the Monkey and a Beetle searching for 3 very specific object that he believes, he can use to win the battle against an evil force from his past. This is a glorious beautifully animated film. This is such a well- directed movie too. Movie is thoughtful with various different themes used. Action packed extremely fun adventure film, so they can work on multiple levels. You can watch this movie as a more mature film or you can enjoy the adventure and the spectacle, because it is beautiful to look at.The voice work in the film is great, you cat praise it forever it's fantastic to look at and the action sequences are extremely fantastic. The characters are also very entertaining, the monkey especially stole the entire film. You will gonna love the Monkey, she is awesome.The film brimming with imagination, that as kids to be imaginative to use their imagination and to think beyond our own physical world that in front of us and to think about other more important things as well. This is a hugely important message for kids. Kubo and the Two Strings is such a quality film. This movie is really too good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie. It's not perfect but it's a fantastic tale that holds your attention from the first scene. Why do I think it's so good? Well, it goes far beyond my merely "liking" it. As an anthropologist and linguist who's familiar with Japanese culture, I was struck by the weaving of Japanese folklore into a captivating tale of a heroic journey. You have the boy, wounded from infancy by his grandfather whose mother is injured. The fetish is the three string samisen which arranges colored papers into origami figures into action to tell a story. The instrument is also wounded as it's missing a string. In an attempt to contact his departed father, Kubo the one- eyed principal endangers himself and winds up in a strange land with a monkey as a mentor who tells him of his quest. Another ally is a huge beetle who provides comic relief and assistance against Kubo's Noo-masked aunts striving to take his other eye.The tale unfolds in an amazing collage of several Japanese ghost and folk tales. The cultural depictions and insights are many and the CGI are delightful. As an anthropologist, I kept wondering what happened to the monkey's tail but that feature offered only a slight distraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Masterpiece of Artwork and Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubo and the Two Strings is the latest full-length stop-animation feature by the production company Laika. Laika also made the movies Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. I tell you the truth, Kubo and the Two Strings is a genuine masterpiece of artwork and storytelling. Coraline is also a masterpiece, but Kubo touches you emotionally even more than Coraline does.The story of Kubo is that a young boy in ancient Japan must embark on a quest to find 3 magical pieces of armor to confront a dreaded mystical enemy. I don't want to give any spoilers but suffice to say there are some emotional and clever plot twists along the way.I'm sure I'm not the only one who's frustrated with all the "reboots" and "remakes" that the movie industry is shoveling at us nowadays. The reboots and remakes are nothing more than shameless attempts by the movie industry to make a cheap buck off of the successes of older movies.If you've been waiting for the movie industry to finally offer something original and artistic, look no further than Kubo and the Two Strings. I can say without reservation that this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever experienced, and I've seen a lot of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent End to an Otherwise Miserable Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young boy is thrust into a dark world when he discovers there is more to his simple life than just taking care of his ailing mom and performing every day for the local village people. When he doesn't heed his mother's strict warning to be home before sunset, he is found by his grandfather and two wicked aunts, who have already stolen one eye from him and want the other.Kubo and the Two Strings is a magical, Far East tale that has a lot of heart at its very basic story. There isn't much that hasn't been seen before, but Laika, the production company, really puts a lot of effort into the story, making it shine far more brightly than it really has any right to. This statement is not to disparage the movie but to show what truly great characters and settings can do to even a basic story. From the start, you're drawn into the story by the movie's very first words, and very quickly you realize how important they are.The story is told flawlessly from start to finish, and the action pieces never overshadow the importance of the story. This is a movie where story comes first and foremost, and you are never left wondering why something happens. Everything that happens is important, even if it doesn't feel like it at first. Where Kubo is a master storyteller in the movie and directs his puppets as the story dictates, the same can be said for the director, Travis Knight.The stars of the movie are mostly recognizable names, but their names are quickly lost in their flawless voice work, where there are times you struggle to place a voice with the actor, which is another good thing. Even actors with typical voices that you think you can place anywhere (like Matthew McConaughey) sound different enough that you have to wonder if that's truly them. They really gave Kubo their all, and the movie is much better for it.One of the greatest aspects of Laika Entertainment is how they seamlessly use stop-motion animation for all of their films. The animation in Kubo is flawless, and while watching the movie, you have to wonder if they actually used computer animation instead of stop-motion. But they did not. Everything was made with puppets and sets, and the look is stunning. Especially when Kubo uses his shamisen to bring origami to life.And while the animation is stunning, the music is not quite stellar but it does fit perfectly with the movie. There's nothing about it that screams for you to go buy the digital download of the soundtrack, but it serves its purpose for the movie and that's all that really matters.From start to finish, Kubo grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. From one beautiful set-piece to the next, you are along for a magical journey that enraptures you, with characters that are fun and that you want to share this journey with. Sets are beautiful and unique, and the costumes are stunning to behold, as are the character designs.Kubo and the Two Strings is a movie I wasn't sure I wanted to see again instantly, but the more I thought about it after it was over and the more I think about it now, the more I realize I do want to see it again in theaters. How many more times, I'm not sure, but I think it will be a lot. The movie really captured my imagination, and it made me wish I could do stop-motion animation.Kubo and the Two Strings Final Grade: 9.6/10: A (Excellent)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laika's Best Looking Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you must blink, do it now. So starts the tale of Kubo and the Two Strings, a chanbara inspired animated fantasy about a young boy with amazing gifts and even more amazing enemies. On a stormy night, the young baby Kubo (Parkinson) is brought to the outskirts of a remote village by his severe-looking mother (Theron). As Kubo grows into adolescence, he ventures into town every morning to earn money as an origami storyteller; using a magical shamisen to bring his characters to life. When he returns home, he cares for his sickly mother by the light of a makeshift hearth. Piecemeal by piecemeal the audience is primed into a world full of mystical creatures, selfless heroes, stunning magic and an age-old vendetta that pit's Kubo against virtual Gods.As a work of stop-motion animation, Kubo and the Two Strings just might be the best looking thing to ever come out of Laika Entertainment. The images on screen are beyond breathtaking with painstaking detail brought into every spellbinding period specific set-piece and every darkly resonant tonal shift. Furthermore, young children (and the young boy or girl within us) will be beside themselves in awe when the origami magic really hits its crescendo midway through the movie. spiders, birds, snakes and even samurai warriors are constructed out of multicolored paper. As soon as the film was over I personally wanted to go home and dust off the old origami workbook and see if I remember how to make anything.As a story, Kubo can be accredited for being uncharacteristically mature and even a little somber for a children's movie. It stands alone foisting upon the viewer themes of loss and remembrance that isn't just there as a hurdle to get over but as a reality meant to be both felt emotionally and in Kubo's case metaphysically. There's real pain within the excitement and fastidious world-building. Pain that may just go over the heads of your little ones but will hit anyone paying attention like a ton of bricks.Yet Kubo isn't without some serious drawbacks the largest of which is its rather byzantine plot. After ignoring his mother's warnings of staying out of the moonlight, Kubo is stalked by two phantasms who seek to take his only eye. After fleeing, Kubo is allied with a Japanese Macaque (Theron) and a warrior resembling a Beetle (McConaughey). Revelations involving Kubo's new friends were probably expected to produce grasps but succeeding in only producing confusion. What's worse, the epic world building has an epic amount of exposition to go with it. Instead of letting the story breathe when it needs to, the rules of the film are clunk out like the rangy spare pieces of a model set. I wanted to know more about Beetle. I wanted to know more about Monkey. But instead we're treated to long tracts of dialogue explaining in exhausting detail the birds in the sky as congruently relevant psychopomp.Yet if the worst thing that can be said about a movie is you wish you could know the characters better then we're in good hands. The voice acting is superb with the young Art Parkinson holding his own as a charismatic leading lad against a tsunami of veteran players. And director Travis Knight proves he's got the talent and discipline to maximize on the Homeric themes of Kubo having cut his teeth as lead animator on other Laika projects Coraline (2009) and Boxtrolls (2014). Here's hoping that with a little bit of fine tuning, Kubo's pulpy blend of sorcery and swordplay will yield a trilogy rivaling Hiroshi Inagaki's Musashi Miyamoto (1954-1956) works. As it stands now, Two Strings is quite a yarn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie held back a bit by flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks stunning. There, got the great blatantly obvious part out of the way. Let's move on.While I thought the movie was in every way good, there were a few flaws that held it back from being my fav of the year so far. Mind you, outside of these 2 flaws I'm about to get into, the movie was great. The plot, the action, the animation (I said it before but it bears repeating. Best animation of the year so far!), it was quite the enjoyable movie. But no movie is without flaws, and in this case... these flaws are noticeable.It was PREDICTABLE. SO VERY, VERY PREDICTABLE. I heard one line of dialogue and immediately guessed the next, and was practically word for word on many occasions. There was a moment of predictable-ness that stood out for me (SPOILERS AHEAD. BEWARE). Hanzo's death. It's revealed that the beetle guy is actually Kubo's father, cursed to be a beetle without memories for the rest of his days. Right after I saw that reveal (which was one of the moments I predicted), I knew he was gonna die at some point. SURPRISE SURPRISE, he gets killed in the next scene.The second issue? The ending. It's just kinda thrown in for no real reason. Kubo goes to his father and mother's grave and places a lantern, then talks for a bit about how he wants them back, even for a moment, so he can give the story a happy ending. Then the camera goes black, then pans down the river, to the edge, where Kubo and his parents in spirit form are. Then the movie ends. Now riddle me this: Was that final shot really necessary? They could have ended it with Kubo turning to the lantern and seeing it glow (in the movie it's a sign the spirits are nearby), then him smiling and walking away. It would have been so much more emotional than "Oh the parents are there in spirit but this time it's literal! woohoo". No. Not woohoo. Lame.It's a great movie. I recommend it. It's worth the price of admission. But the flaws present keep me from absolutely adoring it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise that doesn't know how to be told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a pretty big fan of Laika. As a studio, they have brought a blend of stop-motion and CGI into the mainstream and have also tested much riskier subject material than other animation companies. Not only is their animation time consuming and risky, but their ideas are fairly risky as well (in today's market, that is).And Kubo is another interesting premise with beautiful animation, gorgeous backgrounds, and a nice style to it. It looks really good. Props to the animators. Stop-motion is advancing further and further with every movie Laika is making, and the stuff that is done in this movie would have seemed impossible to do only 7 years ago when Coraline was first released.The first 20 minutes of this movie are excellent and well-told!However, beautiful animation does not make a good movie...Story is the heart of a movie, and if you don't know how to tell a story, then you should go back to the drawing board (or storyboard). The biggest issue with Kubo isn't the most obvious one. The characters are nice, the animation is nice, the action is nice, and everything feels pretty solid, but what really kills this movie is the editing, the script, and its lack of solidity. In short: Kubo and the Two Strings doesn't know what it is.I could write a 10 page essay on the deeper issues of this movie, but that doesn't fit in one IMDb review. In Kubo, and lot of interesting ideas are brought up, but none of them fit together or are cohesive. For example, what is Kubo's motivation? Staying alive? Saving his mom? Beating his grandpa? Kubo never really gets true motivation until the third act and this is a major issue for the movie. The movie says Kubo is on an adventure, but he doesn't seem to feel the stakes until the final act, which is way too late in the game for us to care about him.The same goes with the villain. The background and motives of the villain are constantly changing and inconsistent. One second he wants to kill Kubo. Next second he wants his eye. Yet another second later, he just wants to help Kubo come to heaven with him. Then he hates everyone becomes they are human. Then his motives change to he just hates human because they could overthrow him. Then another motive where it is because he thinks they are disgrace.THIS IS A BIG ISSUE.For the villain's motivation and reasoning to be completely ambiguous and confusing completely ruins Kubo's arc... which is equally confusing and muddled. Essentially, both the villain and the protagonist are the weakest points of this movie. A movie can't really hold together with this big of a problem. And this issue is repeated throughout the movie where nothing is actually fully realized. For example: there is one scene where Kubo briefly loses control of his powers and it does something he didn't mean to do. Never mentioned again in the movie.The plot of his mother being sick and needing to be taken care of. Never fully explained or fully realized.Why the mom can't recognize her own husband when she sees his face? Why does the mom pretend she isn't kubo's mom (she says it is so he won't feel bad?!?!?). How come the mom told stories of the locations of all of the MacGuffins, but then doesn't know where they are?What did the moon king want with Kubo's eyes? Why does the moon king have Kubo's eye at the end when he is a human, but not when he is a spirit being? Why does the moon king become a human? Why does the town lie about his past? Why did Kubo trust the moon king in the dream, when his whole journey is to beat the moon king, but then when he sees the moon king he trusts him?*big spoilers* Why is there a red paper samurai? Why is there a red paper samurai once the beetle shows up, who is the actual real-life version of that samurai! Why didn't anyone recognize the beetle as the father, especially when the father's samurai armor appears to be sitting within that same cave? Why didn't anyone follow the red paper samurai to the last location of the armor? They followed it the entire time, but not at the end?Long story short, this list of character problems and inconsistencies is much longer than this, but a lot of these are pretty big plot problems and not just nit-picks. The finale of the movie is problem the worst element of the movie and not because it isn't visually stunning, but mostly because it is one character who has no tangible motivation versus someone else who hasn't had a very clear goal throughout the film. To make it worse, the movie doesn't even know what it is about. Is it about memories? Is it about death? Is it about stuck-up snobs? Is it an attack on tradition? Is it attacking perfectionists? What is the movie about? What makes this all the more frustrating is the fact that ParaNorman is a movie that has a similar premise, but it does it perfectly. The ending of ParaNorman works, because all of its themes tie together flawlessly. ParaNorman is a cohesive story and knows what it is saying. Kubo does not.Sadly, if you are expecting the next Coraline or ParaNorman, then prepare to be disappointed. This movie feels like a first-pass. A lot of ideas, but none of them mesh together or are completed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most moving film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you must blink, do it now."Once again, Laika gives us a hero worthy of the story he is in. Kubo is a child, but as we see in the beginning of the film, his circumstances make him so much older. We don't see a boy burdened with the task of taking care of his mother; we see Kubo, selflessly cooking for and feeding her, tucking her in at night, pushing hair out of her eyes so that she can watch a world that she may or may not be seeing. It's easy to imagine that this is the entirety of Kubo's life, but then we hear the distant ring of a morning bell. Kubo goes to the village and that's when we learn what kind of story we're in. It's a world of heroes and music and origami and magic. The detail of the animation is already striking, but when the paper figures come to life at the bidding of Kubo's instrument it's downright baffling. Stop motion animation is exactly what it sounds like: one picture, a slight movement; another picture, another slight movement; until there's enough for a scene to unfold. And now I understand why it took five years to make Kubo. The intricacy of movement and design is insane, and I found myself several times asking in wonder, "How the heck did they DO this?"I don't want to give away too much, but you do learn in the first few minutes of the film that Kubo is missing an eye. You might think that would put the animators at a disadvantage, but the variety and depth of his expressions, even with just the one eye is exquisite. I find it difficult to say in brief what I adore most about Kubo's character, if it's his bravery and tenacity, his admiration of the natural world, or merely the way he chooses to use his magic.There are so many moments that tugged at my heart, and none more so then when we learn what the two strings are. As someone who'd been looking forward to this movie since the title was announced, that moment is and will always be precious to me. I'll have to let you discover it for yourself. Be warned, the movie has a PG rating, but like Paranorman and Coraline before it, some of Kubo and the Two Strings may be frightening to young children. Personally, I think the younger me would have loved it just as much as this me does."And that really is the least of it."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never reviewed anything before on here. I wanted to add my review to this page to help Kubo gain more attention and hope to raise the rating overall. I've read a few reviews that discuss Kubo as a movie. Kubo is not just a movie. This is a masterpiece of art that is nothing short of its own kind of Mona Lisa. My jaw dropped within the first 5 minutes. I thought this was made with all CGI but I was stunned when I learned that Kubo was made with miniatures that are handcrafted. It truly is an act of love from the filmmakers to the audience. How many movies take 5 years to make by hand? I can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

Well crafted by a fun and dark screenplay by Marc Haimes, Chris Butler &amp; Shannon Tindle escalates the adventure thanks to skillful direction by Travis Knight and a game blue-chip cast including Theron as a fierce monkey protector and McConaughey as a warrior cursed as a full-scale beetle (go with it). One of the best animated films in quite some time and a gauntlet thrown by Laika Entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now Top Favorite from LAIKA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer, I have been curious about this film from the film-makers that brought us "Coraline." After seeing it with a couple of friends, I thought this animated film aesthetically beautiful and top favorite from Laika.In ancient Japan, living in a mountain cave on the shore, young Kubo takes care of his ailing mother by earning money telling stories to the villagers, by a magical shamisen that manipulates paper into origami figures. His story tells of a samurai warrior and his battle with the Moon King. But at the sound of the evening bell, Kubo has to leave for home without finishing the story. At night, Kubo asks his mother about his father, who was the samurai from his story. Mother reveals that his father was killed by the Moon King, who is Kubo's grandfather. The Moon King had taken one of Kubo's eyes when he was an infant. And his mother flees with him from her father and her two sisters. She then warns Kubo not to go outside at night, or his grandfather and aunts would find him. The next day, on the festival of Obon, Kubo made a lantern for his father. He waited for a light, but no light appeared. Things got worse when he forgot to listen for the evening bell and it became dark. The two daughters of the Moon King appear and chase Kubo. But Kubo's mother appears, and with the last of her magic powers made the beetle from Kubo's robe fly him to safety before her end. Kubo wakes up in a snowy blizzard, and meets Monkey, who had been a little wooden monkey charm for Kubo before she was brought to life by his mother's magic. Inside a whale's carcass, Monkey tells Kubo that she is going to help him find the three pieces of the magical armor, which would help him defeat his grandfather. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.So overall, this is one of the best animated movies of the year, with plenty of fantasy, adventure, humor, shocking surprises and beautiful animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you must blink, do it now." So fittingly opens the stop-motion fantasy Kubo and the Two Strings, against a black screen soon to be filled with a 90+ minute roller coaster of cinematic emotions. Excitement (giant skeleton monsters), humor (sentient origami), terror (Shining-like twin sisters), romance (cross-species), and tears (the danger of family love) serenade every surprising moment of this Imaginative tale. Even with character conveniences and exposition, commonplace in the fantasy genre, Kubo is masterful filmmaking that far exceeds typical family-friendly animated features, or most others for that matter. Unlike most of what we get in theaters these days, Kubo has the audacity to be something that exists outside of our cultural subconscious. Its originality and tone give it the potential to have a Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-esque effect on audience. It's the story of a boy with a life-giving guitar and a mysterious past, forced upon an adventure with a beetle-man samurai (McConaughey) and a wonderfully wry talking monkey (Theron). Under its character-based humor and blistering action, it makes powerfully pointed statements about the inevitability of death, and love's ability to almost musically unite people in overcoming fear. Oh, and did I mention that the animation is perfectly gorgeous in every single way? Laika Studios (Coraline, Paranorman) have always matched their stunningly groundbreaking animation with stories that are among the best in kid's entertainment, and Kubo may be their best yet. With sweeping landscapes punctuated by seemingly innocuous little details filling their cinematic world of magic and adventure, it may be about time we start seeing Laika as the next Pixar. Kubo is the perfect respite from the dirge of summer franchises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Key to How Storytelling is Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Travis Knight takes the director's chair under the same studio that created other stop-motion spectacles such as Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Except this one stands out far greater than the others, as Kubo and the Two Strings uses a classical story to make a tribute to the art of storytelling, in the form of Japanese clay puppets and the old forgotten art of origami.Never before has a story about a one-eyed lonely boy feeding his spiritually lost mother felt so captivating for a contemporary audience. This little restless wanderer takes his journey toward self-worth to a much greater level, as he treats us to a story told within a story with his origami figures, the strings of these puppets controlled by the strings of his musical instrument. Just one sound of the strum, and the paper folds itself to tell of a Moon King who takes a samurai and his family. But young Kubo is not satisfied with his life, as he longs to find his lost father, who he's been told was once a mighty warrior.All other strides taken by the animators to generate this moving picture are worth the attention of all worldwide art academies. These artists know how to fluidly combine the techniques of stop- motion animation and computer generated imagery in a way that services the artistry rather than the technicality. I am now officially won over upon the concept of combining CGI with Claymation, as everything in the frame of this feature flows and blends together seamlessly, making it impossible to tell what is CGI and what is practical. Kubo is a remarkable feat for 3D viewing.The moments of spectacle in the near-two-hour run time include a moonlit ocean wave split in half, a big scary skeleton with glowing eyes, a large underwater sea creature with a circular mouth, a sword fight with a monster from the afterlife, and two frightening looking ladies who appear merged from V for Vendetta and the twins from The Shining.With such a love toward the history of storytelling, it's a shame that the story itself needed some fine tuning here and there, particularly in the second act.After some serious drama, Kubo winds up in some other world coated in snow, a monkey there to greet him. Here is where Kubo begins to feel tonally different from how it was marketed.The next hour contains an excess of humor that for the most part falls flat. The conflict is there between the boy and the authoritative monkey, but by jokes that suggest a genre not previously established. To make it worse, Kubo and the monkey later meet with a beetle who has no memory of his past life. Almost all of his dialogue contains jokes that would get on anybody's nerves like the class clown you had in fourth grade. The voices of these two mentors to the boy are voiced by Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey, neither of which are that terribly fitting with their parts. But Theron does actually have her moment as she gets to tell a story to Kubo in the classical warm tone as told through memory. I'd also like to add that there is a plot twist involving these two figures, but it's one of those twists you could have easily guessed.This film's theme supports the belief of Buddhism, which includes reincarnation and praying to ancestors. If you, like me, are of a Christian or other religious belief, it might be offensive to you. But on the plus side, strong bonds in the feature are made between mother and son, offering children an important moral on the importance of storytelling from generation to generation.I always enjoy a good stop-motion film now and then; it's such a shame there isn't nearly enough of them being made nowadays. I think innovative forms of animation such as this one add significantly more meaning and artistry to storytelling, much more impactful than the computer animation we've gotten way too used to. Now look, I still enjoy CGI as much as the next guy, but I also enjoy a little variety.This story about stories reveals to us why we go to movies: the stories told reveal our true selves, including which ones appeal to us and which ones we choose to tell. Stories, especially in movie format, live on past our own lives through constant retellings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical boy in medieval Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magical and tragic movie about a boy with magical powers as he goes on a quest for his father's sword and armor he needs to defeat Raiden the moon king. Laika Studios has done it again. First there was Coraline and ParaNorman. Now this film that takes place in medieval Japan. Probably the best film of the year. I thought stop motion animation was highly detailed and colorful. I was a fan of Laika Studios' Coraline and ParaNorman and I'm interested in medieval Japanese history during the Sengoku Jidai (Japan's Civil War). So that is what brought me to watch this movie's premiere in theaters. To top the film off, I thought the end credit music sung by Regina Spektor's take on George Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For Little Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Kubo and the Two Strings", starring the voices of Art Parkinson- Game of Thrones_tv, San Andreas; Charlize Theron-Madmax:Fury Road, The Legend of Bagger Vance; Matthew McConaughey-Free State of Jones, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, Red Dragon.This is a stop-motion/animated film by the Laika studios, who also did Coraline, ParaNorman and The Boxtrolls. This one is not for the little kids-some parts are slow and loses their attention and others are a little frightening, judging by some of the kids in my audience-but older kids and adventurous adults might like it-I know I did. The story takes place in Japan and concerns Art/Kubo, a one-eyed boy living with his mother, just outside of a village-there is a reason for the missing eye. During the day, Art goes to the village and plays his lute-a 3 stringed instrument-while telling stories of a samurai and evil forces battling it out. His lute is magical because when he is getting his Hendrix going, he has sheets of paper forming into origami and flying in the air, enhancing his story. He has to return before dark to take care of his mother so sometimes, he will leave in mid story, disappointing the villagers. Oh yeah, his mother also told him that if he did not return before dark, evil spirits would come out and get him and of course, he misses curfew one night and things do go haywire. Art is told that he must go on a quest to find 3 magical pieces of armor that will help him fight the spirits and their boss, Ralph/The Moon King. Charlize/Monkey and Matthew/Beetle are his traveling companions on his journey. FYI: This is Matthew's first venture into voice work on an animated movie. As the end credits start, there is a nice cover version of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. It's rated "PG" for thematic elements, scary images, action and peril and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 41 minutes. It's not for everyone but if you like Japanese culture, samurais, martial arts and reincarnation you might like this one. I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animation/stop-motion on this movie was amazing. The visuals are great, the voice acting is top notch and the sequences of action are top notch as well. My one complaint about the movie and the reason it dragged my score down a little was because the overall plot was a bit...muddled. I won't go into why I think that because I don't want to give anything away, but I will say I wasn't the only one at the screening who felt the same way.The only other thing I would point out is that this MAY not be a great film to take younger (5 - 8 years old) children to, I could see some of the sequences being a bit frightening for them, but, as an adult I really liked how dark some of it was.Overall the film was really good and I would definitely recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

One could only marvel so very closely at the detail that was put into this film, and i thoroughly enjoyed the subtle hints of suspense and comedy. Kubo will have you mesmerized by a character that is very relatable and humble.The way this film put into detail how each character is made is simply remarkable.(Possible Spoiler) Backstory is the main point in the film and each character is revealed as to how they came to be who they are. I witnessed this movie in 3-d as well and it was a fun experience getting to see the characters like they were right along side of you throughout the entirety of the film. See for yourself if this movie will make your deepest imagination come through and find out if this adventure is the one for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great graphic, good plot and beautiful story. The part I hate about, is the same with many other Asian stories/movies - The Voice actors are Pure Americans! For crap sake it's Asian movie. I understand it's made to be released in the U.S. But they can at least used Asian actors who speaks English but obviously a little touch of Japanese accent to it! How hard could that be. So many talented Asian actors who can speak English clearly, clear enough to understand. Most Asian actors are bilingual. If insisting on hiring American actors, then please have them learn on how Japanese speaks. They've got to learn the language, the tone, the accent while speaking in English. Otherwise, you have an Asian looking family but speaks perfect American language. It does not coincide with the physical feature of the story. A Japanese family doesn't sound Americans. It's never been and never will. A little respect for Japanese culture goes a long way folks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gathered with movie club friends from our old neighborhood last night and watched "Kubo and the Two Strings" - worthy entertainment. The visuals are continually clever, the challenges of the hero's journey are always surprising, and the moral resolution of the journey is hopeful. Produced by the studio that gave us "Coraline," "Kubo" is a great stop-motion animation that is almost too scary for little kids (there were some in the audience, but nobody screamed) but a worthy evening for adults. The story is set in old Japan and revolves around young Kubo and his parents (sort of) and a lot of dangerous spirit world nemeses. Enjoy the visuals and stay through the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's great filmmaking and then there's the breathtakingly great filmmaking that Laika studios has continued to put out. With mind- blowing stop-motion sequences that rival anything Pixar does, and a heavy focus on a creative story, Kubo and the Two Strings may be the best that Laika has had to offer to date.Kubo and the Two Strings tells the story of Kubo, a young boy searching for a mysterious set of armor needed to defeat a vicious spirit set on killing him. It's much darker than Laika's previous effot, Boxtrolls, but it ends up having something for people of all ages. Matthew McCconaughey and Charlize Theron play Beetle and Monkey respectively, who accompany Kubo on his quest. They both provide well-timed comedic relief, which luckily never steps too far into the goofy kid humor realm. Other than the brilliant animation, Kubo provides us with a refreshingly poignant animated feature for people of all ages. Besides Zootopia and Finding Dory, there hasn't really been an animated film that impressed, especially one that spread out its humor and story arcs amongst age groups. It's worth noting that this was McConaughey's first time doing voice over, which should give you an idea of how impressed he was with the script.It's not going to wow audiences with over-the-top colors and forced potty-jokes, but it has a big heart with woeful ideas that may top even the best of what Pixar as to offer. Kubo and the Two Strings is a filmmaking gem, and easily one of 2016's best.+Poignant+Breathtaking animation+Fun journey+Well-timed humor8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshingly different - and visually spectacular - family flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Operating in the niche market of stop-motion filmmaking, Laika Entertainment have produced yet another sweet, thoughtful and visually sensational adventure that ranks behind only Coraline (a masterpiece) on Laika's resume. But whereas their previous four films ? also including Corpse Bride, ParaNorman and Boxtrolls ? have existed in the realm of the horror genre, the mystical and Oriental-flavoured Kubo sees the studio branch out into foreign territory. Following our titular young protagonist on his quest to locate magical items in order to defeat the enigmatic Moon King, the story tackles themes of love, loss and growing up, astutely balancing on an emotional razor edge that is simultaneously heart breaking and heart warming. There is sporadic humour but it's rarely hilarious, the focus clearly being on conveying a tale of substance and wonder ? a goal that's undeniably achieved albeit at the cost of potentially boring younger audience members on the odd occasion. Kubo himself (voiced by Art Parkinson) is someone who you can barrack for and invest in, a charismatic and energetic kid wise beyond his years (but mercifully not precocious) who is hiding an immaturity underneath the resilient façade. Joining the voyage are Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), the former an overprotective warrior and the latter a bumbling but sweet natured do-gooder who fails to connect due to McConaughey's incredibly recognisable voice. The stop-motion animation is unsurprisingly breathtaking, the Eastern setting rendered with beautiful and meticulous detail whilst the character designs are stunning in both concept and execution. The sinister twin sisters who hunt Kubo are particularly spectacular, their floating visages and porcelain-masked faces combined with Rooney Mara's haunting voice performance simply oozes creepiness. The two big action sequences featuring the twin sisters are amazing, the first an epic showdown on a sinking ship and the second a deadly feud in an abandoned temple courtyard, both astonishingly brutal for a PG-rated movie. An affecting, sincere and delightful journey that credits its audience ? children and adults alike ? with intelligence and maturity, Kubo and the Two Strings is a refreshingly different family flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is good, it might be the coolest looking animated film in a long time. it is beautiful, and stop motion captures the characters perfectly in each demeanor. The timing of sequences is great and the story - though it has its weak points - was thoroughly riveting.My problem was a personal one. I have to say that the film struck me as incredibly preachy, to the point of being zealous, and it frustrated me as initially it felt like preaching was its purpose. However, upon reflection, this film is preaching, but not what I would consider zealously. the film highlights the idea that there are no endings over and over again. it also highlights the power of memory, and the strength stories give you. To tell this story well, with respect to the Japanese folklore roots, this tale had to delve into the supernatural, and should, as the supernatural is a excellent story telling tool.On the whole the film exceeds expectations in almost every facet - the plot initially falls agonizingly short but regains composure, the characters are amazing... Monkey! and the twists, though I saw them coming; were clever, well thought through, flowed with the plot, and made the film more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best animated movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so it's a bit premature to call Laika's latest masterpiece the best animated picture of the year, especially given that Disney's Moana has yet to come out, but I find it hard to believe that any other animated film this year can match the originality and the quality animation of Kubo and the Two Strings.Kubo is a more somber story than we're used to seeing in animated movies. Kubo and his mother deal with the death of Kubo's father while seeking refuge from Kubo's evil grandfather, the moon king, a god like creature who lives in the heavens and can only come to Earth at night. Kubo's mother was once an immortal princess who fell in love with a common man, Hanzo, and together they had a mortal son, Kubo. Her father, the Moon King, considers this a betrayal, and seeks to steal Kubo's eyes in order to turn Kubo into an immortal creature like himself. Kubo's mother is injured during her escape from the Moon Kingdom and she develops a kind of Alzheimer's like condition where her memories fade and she is immobile during the day. Kubo takes care of her as she literally stares into space ? it's pretty deep stuff for a kid's movie. Kubo and his mother manage to fend off the Moon King and his two evil daughters for a few years, but eventually they are found. His mother uses her last bit of magic to send Kubo far away and enchants a monkey doll to come alive and protect him. Along the way, Kubo and the monkey meet a giant beetle, a former Samurai who was cursed by the Moon King. Together, they have to find an indestructible sword and magic armor with which they can defeat the Moon King. Kubo is not defenseless, however, as he uses a magic guitar that can create and control origami figures to fight off the Moon King and his minions (it comes in handy, trust me). Make no mistake, the animation is this film's crowning achievement. Laika does brilliant stop motion animation, which is such a nice change from the abundance of computer-animated movies we see nowadays. The scenery and the characters come to life in a way that CGI can't capture. There are some very scary images here, like Kubo's flying Aunts who wear Japanese versions of Guy Fawkes masks (there may be a real term for their masks, I just don't know it). While the animation is excellent, the story is not to be discounted either. Kubo and the Two String's themes of loss and the strength that we can derive from the memory of deceased family members make for a very moving story, and it deals with these themes in a way that is not too manipulative or cookie cutter. There are also plenty of laughs along the way. The antics between Kubo, the monkey (voiced by Charlise Theron), and the beetle (Matthew McConaughey) are very funny. I do think that the story could have been tighter. Kubo gives a heavy-handed speech about the power of family at the end of the movie that I don't think we were adequately prepared for, for instance. But you can certainly understand why the speech is there, and the movie has so much else going for it I really didn't mind. It's a shame this movie isn't doing better at the box office. Maybe it's bad marketing, but I think Laika's animation style and darker kid's stories are simply not appealing to American audiences. This is unfortunate as their movies are more intelligent than most American animated films. I hope the studio endures. So go out and see Kubo and the Two Strings! We need to reward intelligent movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful is the only word that defines Kubo and the Two Strings. It's animation, story and emotion make it one of the best of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 has been an impressive year for animation. Disney hit it out of the park with Zootopia and Finding Dory, not to mention they have another one coming later with Moana. DreamWorks gave us more spiritualism from Kung Fu Panda 3, Universal scored a hit with The Secret Life of Pets, and Sony took chances with The Angry Birds Movie and Sausage Party. It seems that more people are responding to animation then they are the live action movies. Being that I'm already a fan of animation, this is good news as I want more material like this coming out. For today's movie, the magicians from Laika have returned.Laika is the company who has brought a new revival of stop motion animation. They have crafted the beautiful stories of Coraline, Paranorman, and The Boxtrolls. I compare these guys to Studio Ghibli as they both craft original stories, have never produced sequels, are full of stunning animation, carry some big name voices, and sadly are not major moneymakers. These movies speak to children and adults while providing some great messages, so I hope the marketing will get better of their latest does well. Their next story is a Japanese centered tale called Kubo and the Two Strings. On top of a mountain below a village, a boy named Kubo takes care of his mother who suffers lapses in memory. During the day, he travels into the village where he uses his guitar to tell stories through the magic of paper origami figurines that come to life. At night, when she's alert, Kubo will ask his mother questions and spend as much time as he can with her while obeying her rule to never leave the cave after sunset. During a ceremony that honors the dead, he accidentally stays out later then usual, causing him to be found by his aunts (both played by Rooney Mara).Kubo is nearly caught, but his mother temporarily stops them and sends him away to find his father's armor. He awakens in a snowstorm where a talking monkey (played by Charlize Theron) is there to help. She explains that she was that little wooden charm that he carried until his mother's magic brought her to life. The two set off to find his father armor, in which their also joined by a beetle-hybrid man samurai (played by Matthew McConaughey). They hope that the armor will stop Kubo's grandfather, the Moon King (played by Ralph Fiennes) from taking over the land.This is a tough synopsis to transcribe as a lot of it relies on being spoiler-free. Without giving away the major points, Kubo and the Two Strings is another work of beauty from Laika. I have to first give credit to it's animation which again is just gorgeous. From the warmth of the village to the scares that it's dark characters to the living origami, this is a visual treat. This is one of the few movie's I'd to have liked to have seen a work in progress version of, just to appreciate the hard work these animators have put in. While it was a risk to cast mainly Caucasian actors to play Japanese, they all feel right. They all manage to bring a lot of personality, humor, and emotion into a very complex story. The journey that Kubo is on really pushes him, especially during the last thirty minutes, so everything feels earned. Every laugh and tear feels genuine and shows that this studio knows that children can take more then most people realize. While the villain's motivation is a little vague, it's only a small mark as this movie deserves to be a hit.I'll give this ten origami figurines out of ten. Kubo and the Two Strings is now the only movie in Zootopia's way that could block it from an Oscar. I cannot phrase it enough as one of the best movies of 2016. All I can say is to consider the shape of things and see this beautiful movie. Just don't spoil it, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lika At It's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deserves an Oscar. I know they will give to the big $ Disney, Pixar or maybe DreamWorks, but Kubo and the Two Strings is marking new and greater creative ground for Lika. The use of sound alone (traditional Japanese music to approach climaxes of action as well as softer instances of contemplation) is noteworthy and unusual for any genre. The story seemed complete and emotionally driven and gives a small unlikely band on a quest against impossible odds. Since it is large budget stop-motion it is meticulous and beautiful in it's craft but the characters have expression and depth. These qualities should be shared with a a wider audience (adults and kids alike). I was unsure of how the studio would handle such an Asian-centric styled story (I mean come-on, Matthew McConaughey? (No he does NOT say "All right, all right, all right!") but it didn't feel like a cultural affectation and both the dialogue and the acting were excellent. I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD and telling everyone how much I liked it. I would say my favorite character was Monkey. The themes of community through the village and family were there to enrich the story but they didn't seem overly saccharin as sometimes animated pieces can be. I would sum it up as a beautiful action movie with a heart that is animated...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about Alzheimers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with very low expectations, so I was positively surprised that it wasn't as bad as I'd prepared myself for. Even so, there were numerous problems. You can interpret a film in many ways, but in my opinion this was a film about alzheimers, and specifically about having a relative die with the disease. There were numerous alzheimers sufferers throughout the film - the mother, Hanzo, the grandfather - each one of them fading in and out of lucidity; while Kubo plays the role of the person who has to take care of the alzheimers sufferer - at the beginning his mother, at the end his grandfather. Now for the issues I have with the film which detracted from it:1) The villains were completely totally utterly flat. I've seen some reviews on here that praise the villains - how?! Is that how you like your characters? No realistic motivation. No personality. Just evil for the sake of evil. Whose even like that?? It isn't like they couldn't have made the villains deeper with absolutely minimal effort. The Moonking could have said that he wanted to save the world - that collecting the armor and weapons would destroy everything - the "greater good". Then, when Kubo defeated him, the world could have self destructed and we could have gone right to the credits from that.. maybe Kubo could have said "uh-oh" first or something. Give the audience some complexity for god sake. All the villains spend three quarters of the movie laughing. Nothing is THAT funny. Nobody walks around roaring with laughter 24 hours a day. When kids were bullying you in school do you remember them laughing themselves silly all the time and doing it "for the sake of being evil"? Everyone has a motivation and everyone has a deeper personality than that.2) The ending was *weak*. Kubo's fight with the moonking was underwhelming and the way he defeats him made the previous quest for the armor/sword pointless. He could have gone into the town square and beaten him in the first two seconds of the film in the exact same way. Also, what was the point in letting the moonking live on as an alzheimers sufferer after he had massacred Kubo's entire family? Couldn't his memory come back at any instant? A more ambitious screenwriter/director might have done the scene the same way, but had Kubo decapitate the moonking while the villagers were distracting him. Then Kubo could have said "you didn't think I was going to let you live, did you?" or something equally dark. 3) Kubo's power is pointless. He can make origami come to life but he doesn't use that to win any of the fights that he's in. He does create the paper Hanzo that directs him on the quest, but since the quest itself is pointless (see #2) that doesn't mean much.4) The Southern woman in the town is pointless. I was expecting her to turn out to be one of the villains and stab Kubo in the back - that, at least, would have justified her extensive screen time. However, no, alas, she's simply there to chuckle a lot. 5) Hanzo and the monkey is simply a repeat of the start of the film. First Kubo's father and mother die, then Kubo's father and mother die. It would have been far preferable to have the monkey *not* be Kubo's mother and the beetle *not* be Kubo's father - because by making them the same characters it makes the initial deaths meaningless (not to say that their deaths later were any more meaningful given the last scene). 6) Kubo seems to buy rice without any income. He and his mother live in a cave expropriated from the village for free(?) The cave is in a mountain that doesn't seem to be subject to any kind of erosion - it's as sharp as a knifeblade. The villagers are so lazy that they can afford to spend a whole afternoon looking at Kubo instead of actually working. There is no form of government whatsoever. The villagers prefer to remain in the wreckage of a destroyed village for days waiting for Kubo to come back and have his final battle - people tend not to wait around after earthquakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new stop-motion animated fantasy flick, from director Travis Knight (the son of Nike co-founder Phil Knight). Knight is a debut director, who was also the lead animator on 'CORALINE', 'PARANORMAN' and 'THE BOXTROLLS'. Like all of those movies, this film was produced by the Portland animated film studio Laika Entertainment, LLC. (which Travis is the CEO of, and Phil Knight owns). This movie tells the story of a young boy, named Kubo, who must find a magical suit of armor, owned by his late father, in order to defeat the vengeful spirits of his grandfather and evil aunts. It was written by Marc Haimes, Chris Butler and Shannon Tindle; Butler and Tindle also worked on 'CORALINE' (as storyboard supervisor, and character designer), and Butler also wrote and co-directed 'PARANORMAN'. The movie features the voice talents of Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and George Takei. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, but that didn't stop it from bombing at the Box Office. I think it's an OK kids' flick, but it's also severely overrated. The story is set in Ancient Japan, where Kubo (Parkinson) lives with his mother (Theron); in a cave on top of a mountain. He goes into the local village, every day, to tell the residents mystical stories; using magical pieces of origami. One day Kubo stays out past sunset (which he's never supposed to do), in order to try and communicate with his deceased father; in a special ceremony. He's attacked by the spirits of his evil aunts (Mara), who can only come out at night. Kubo's mother saves him, just before she's killed, by giving the boy magical wings and sending him far away. Kubo then begins a mission to find a magical suit of armor, owned by his late father, in order to fight his evil aunts and defeat them. He finds aid from a talking monkey (also Theron), and a samurai beetle man, named Beetle (McConaughey).I love the film's visuals (like all of Knight's films) and it's creative (and pretty imaginative) story; but the movie is also extremely slow-paced and uninvolving. I was bored almost the entire time I was watching it. The comedy isn't funny, and I just didn't care enough about the characters (or story) to stay with it (although I had to). I got really sleepy while watching this movie, as a result. The voice actors are good, and fun to hear, but it's also pretty offensive; that it's almost all white American actors, playing Asian parts. The movie is kind of a disappointment, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Japan had a Holy Bible . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . about twice as long as the American one, and if you crammed it all into a Claymation Puppet Cartoon about 90 minutes long without the credits, you'd probably wind up with something like KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS. Even though I got a full night of nine hours' sleep before viewing KUBO, I kept finding myself waking up from momentary weird dreams during this animated feature, mostly about baseball. This isn't as odd as it may sound. There's an element of repetition to baseball, whether you're watching a game in America or Japan. Baseball has nine innings, each of which starts out with no one on base and three outs to go for both teams in turn. KUBO seems to go extra innings, as it resets itself every couple minutes. A beetle pinch runs for one of KUBO's parents, a monkey bats for the other, and an infinite number of origami pages turn into virtually anything, just like your baseball scorecard boxes, which are all blank at the beginning of every game. After seeing Ichiro Suzuki break George Sisler's hallowed season hits record, is seems KUBO is gunning for Steamboat Willy's copyrights on MULAN and the rest of World Culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is the most ambitious feature for Laika Studios till date. Laika studios already introduced us, Coraline. We experienced the wonderful world of Coraline and that is also a very good movie and visually stunning creation. After the huge success of Coraline, Laika studios starts their most expensive project named KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS. this movie is directed by Travis Knight and the casting (voice) is very interesting and I want to tell you this is also a very good movie and you will surely enjoy this. It is no wonder that the VFX and the animation graphics of the movie will be good and the story is also good. But the main positive thing is the direction and the script. The story is very good and the script is very well written. Director Travis Knight has done a very good job by executing the story, the chemistry between the actors and the subplots of the movie are also well organized. Another plus point is the animation quality. We already know about Laika studios and their reputation of animation, in this movie the animation quality is very good and it is very supportive for the storyline and for the character maps.I already told the chemistry between the actors is very good. Especially Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes have a done a wonderful job. But the surprise came from Art Parkinson. He has done an outstanding job by his natural mindblowing voice. This is a very good example of how a voice actor can do the perfect job with his voice. There are lots of new releases in this summer and I think this is a major risk in this summer. Lots of big budget movies already are showing in theaters but this movie will a very fair choice for movie goers. Lots of action and good character development will give you a good experience and typical but good story will also give you satisfaction. I think this is a very good animation movie after a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful animation but weak story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Laika Studios movies I was incredibly excited to see Kubo and the Two Strings. Whereas Laika's best films Coraline and ParaNorman take place in a Western society, Kubo and the Two Strings is focused on Japanese culture. This made me very curious because I wanted to see what movies outside of their usual genre would look like. In general I really enjoyed watching the movie. This was mostly due to the incredibly animation. Laika's stop motion animation never ceases to amaze me. The film had the most beautiful scenes and the animation quality has progressed a lot since Coraline. Secondly, Kubo and the Two Strings had the same amazingly creepy vibe Coraline and ParaNorman had, which made it not suitable for kids but really entertaining for adults. However, even though the animation style was the reason I went to see this movie it was not enough to make it a good movie. In my opinion the film seriously lacked in a good story line. At the beginning I felt like I was dropped right in the middle of something. I hoped that eventually all the questions I had at the beginning would be answered but instead I got even more questions. More characters were put into the story without a proper introduction and background story, which resulted in me not caring much for them. A sudden switch in genre with the introduction of the not-so-funny-Beetle resulted in annoyance, as most of the humor was out of place and too much. Lastly, the story line was extremely predictable from the beginning. I was hoping that the writers were trying to trick the viewer into thinking the predictable but then ending up with a different story, but alas. In conclusion I would like to recommend Kubo and the Two Strings to those who want to see some absolutely stunning stop-motion animation. Those who seek a movie comparable to Coraline and ParaNorman better stay home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely made movie, but American audience won't like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could the producers of this movie be so foolish to NOT realize that American audiences will not be able to identify with a story based on Japanese characters? I couldn't relate to any character at all, even though I am an immigrant. Please don't get me wrong. I have great respect for Japanese . But I couldn't relate to y he characters or the place. How then could the local audience? The makers must understand where their core audience is.... But apparently they didn't. Cost them heavily. The movie has bombed at the box office because of the reason I've cited here. If they'd asked experts like me before making the movie, I would have screamed "Dont do it!!!" That being said, was a nice movie....made for the WRONG audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of domestic violence and mental health issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me see, begins with Kubo's father dying. It's very subtle, you don't realize at first, and then it occurs to you that the father has died. This is particularly apparent as the mother is clearly having dis-associative and/or psychotic episodes as a result of the trauma and grief that she is experiencing - sometimes she doesn't recognize Kubo. Often Kubo has to wake and feed his mother as she cannot do it for herself. Overall, Kubo's daily care is generally neglected and he is left to his own devices, to wander around the village and talk with the street vendors. Then there's a lot of (extended) family domestic violence when Kubo's maternal aunts find him and his mother. They are really really angry and bitter with their sister (Kubo's mother) as she chose to have a relationship with Kubo's father against their father's (Kubo's grandfather's) wishes. Violent incidents between Kubo's mother and his aunts continue throughout the rest of the story. The mother's mental health worsens as she begins to believe that she is a monkey sent to protect Kubo from his aunts. Then, it turns out the father isn't dead after-all, but is wandering around with some kind of post traumatic amnesia diagnosis. He thinks he is some kind of samurai warrior that has been cursed as a 6-legged bug. Not even Kubo's mother recognizes him at first and then the penny drops - this is Kubo's dad! In a final incident of family violence, everyone in the family gets killed, except Kubo and his grandfather who resolves to be more loving/giving in future so Kubo isn't orphaned alone in the world. And it ends with a lantern ceremony (funeral) for the parents. Happy days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animation certainly isn't sufficient for a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had certainly increased expectations with this movie since my benchmark had elevated after watching previous animations like "Inside out" and "Zootopia". Kubo with two strings, unfortunately, was a big disappointment.The movie has a weak story line with an average animation. Story: The weak script fails to impress the audience of any age. Story is poorly defined and weakly executed. While one will keep waiting for the story to grow deeper and reveal any more suspense, the story actually becomes very direct and unveils itself in very early part of the movie. It's just another fantasy, without any strong take home message. This is very unlike the movies like Zootopia and Inside out which were entertaining, attention-grabbing and communicated a strong message. Animation : Animation is average. Doesn't score much over Inside Out/ Zootopia. I watched the movie in 2D. The only thing which created excitement was the magical origami. The floating papers assuming different shapes based on the imagination of Kubo was certainly a treat to the eye and I am sure would be spectacular when watched in 3D. Certainly; just animation is not sufficient. A weak story line and poor story telling is what makes this movie a no-no to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Storyline is good, some animation glitches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Kubo" is an OK movie. Without going into details that might give away the movie, I found the story-line was pretty good, but predictable. It felt that there was some repeated content, but just in different details. I also noticed for the scenes that show Kubo walking at a distance, Kubo's legs kind of jump around (stutter). I understand that the studio is not a big name like DreamWorks or Pixar, but they have a 3d version that I feel might have sacrificed the quality of the animation. The majority of the people will not catch it though. Also, being a Christian, I would not watch it again, since there are Asian religious beliefs in the movie. Would I recommend it? Not for young kids, as a few scenes are violent, but for older people, if they want to go to a movie and nothing else seems like a good option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saddened by not going to the fair with anyone, my mom suggested me to see Kubo with my grandpa (he was the one that was going to take me to the fair), a movie that I have been eager to see since I first heard of it. Hoping that it would cheer me up and entertain me, it ended up being slow and quite boring.While on the surface, it looks like it could be a cool story and great film, it just focuses too much on the story than developing the characters. While there were some developments, the story was still quite predictable and the action sequences, especially in the third act were nothing new.Of course Kubo is a grounded character who plays the banjo with a few strings and the movie is quieter than most action-fantasy films. I am not a huge fan of action, though, so this one didn't entertain me as much as other action films such as "Zootopia".The animation, on the other hand, was mostly exceptional. I liked the design of the moon king dragon and the movements of the characters. Though, it may have been a bit rushed but still wonderful. The mid-credits scene, where the animators were moving the giant skeleton in this room was real awesome and I wanted to see in real life how Laika makes their movies.Overall, Kubo while being slightly better in storytelling and entertainment department, deserves a spot next to "The Boxtrolls" as one of Laika's weaker films. Paranorman is still the best Laika film and Coraline is better. Though, I'm still waiting for what other great films Laika has in store for us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good plot but fails in storytelling and animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we watched the trailer of Kubo, it didn't inspire so much. However, we thought to give it a shot after reading the IMDb rating. However, now I'm more confident of my judgment based on the trailer. Although it's less than 2 hours of a movie, we started feeling sleepy after about an hour itself.Story (5/10): Kubo is the story of a kid who is trying to find answers regarding his family history. With a mother who is slowly losing her memory, he has more questions than answers about who his father was, why they have to live in hiding, why his grandfather and aunts want to kill him and much more. While the story was good, the screenplay, or if we say the art of storytelling, is where the movie suffered and made it very boring to watch. The characters are dull. His mother is totally lost and lifeless in one scene and extremely lively in another and angry in the next, which just doesn't make sense. The chemistry between Monkey and Kubo is totally missing. While Kubo has been shown as a boy, his voice (Art Parkinson) and dialogue delivery resemble more to a girl (could have been a better idea if the protagonist was a girl).Animation (4/10): The movie reminded me of 90s animation techniques. Hollywood has moved way ahead now. The movie could have done much better with a story around magic and Samurai warriors.Direction (6/10): In his directorial debut, Travis Knight impressed in bits and pieces. To begin with, the opening scene of the movie was simply brilliant. The humor from the character of Beetle was good, which made the movie enjoyable to some extent. However, the overall storytelling wasn't up to the mark - I feel Zootopia, Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda (1st) were really good in that. Besides that, some logical mistakes (a small kid doesn't take on a giant caterpillar holding sword in just one hand) made the mockery of the character. Consistency in characterization was also missing. Overall (5/10): Overall, the movie had a very cliché but a good plot. However, it went downhill when it came to executing it. You won't miss anything in life if you don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy, uninspiring &amp; schematic writing, suitable for very small kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading this film was supposed to be "a new animated classic", I truly hoped for a different experience - imaginative, mind stimulating and heart filling, as some of the classics truly are. However, ,this film, that claims to present a child-storyteller as a protagonist, fails a colossal failure in its storytelling above anything else. It could be a good match for those who visit the cinema for the visual thrill only (if there can be any such creature??), but those who wish to find a soulful plot, clever dialogue and inspiring characters are about to have an ailing time, which will induce serious wondering about all the forces who collaborated to make this film happen, not noticing how corny, lifeless and utterly tedious is the script, and eventually the actual film, despite the "action scenes", which are aimed to blur the film's emptiness and fool us that something important is happening. Alas, no such thing is happening, let me assure you. Better pick up your copy of Spirited Away and avoid this film, which only gives American animation a hard blow in the gut. My suggestion to the makers - dub it anew, with a convincing, well thought-of script, and then, maybe, it could be saved. Another option is to watch it mute. Till then, do your soul a favor, and keep your distance.</fullReview>
