		<shortDescription>One of Warner Brother's triumphs of the forties?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting? For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings? Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully? This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold? Although "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is indisputably one of Bogart's best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie's director and scenarist, John Huston? Based on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico? Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera? He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight? Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him? Tim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs's rage and greed? However, it is the director's father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time? Life can't surprise him any more? He's already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime? Like a faithful dog, he's along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that's just a bonus? It is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" one of Warner Brothers' triumphs of the forties?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly something special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made a huge impression on me when I first saw it at the age of 15 or 16. A recent rewatching on DVD really served to bring home for me what makes this film so special.The whole thing is quite good, but it really hits you when Howard goes off to celebrate with the Indians, leaving Dobbs and Curtin to care for his gold and burros. The ensuing scenes of their spiraling mistrust and tension are absolutely spellbinding--the kind of thing that makes you lean forward in your seat just to get your eyes a little closer to the raw humanity unfolding in front of you. Their paranoia, the way you can SEE scenarios of betrayal dancing in their eyes, Dobbs' burgeoning madness--these are the moments that make this film one for the ages.At its best, film noir (which this most certainly is--Western surroundings or no) makes the viewer complicit in the evil depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watching--we start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do. "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" accomplishes this bond with the audience as well as any film you are likely to see.A magnificent film--one of the few great screen tragedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What acting is all about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although John Huston's directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay, winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that makes "Treasure of The Sierra Madre" the classic film that it is. Beginning and ending with Walter Huston's award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter's portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.When, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Treasure Of The Sierra MadreCertainly a consuming piece of cinematic achievement. I was delighted in viewing this film, especially when you have the talents of Bogart, Holt and Huston?..oh what abilities or should I say ?gifts'. My eyes never strayed from the screen, I couldn't take the risk of missing one second of this tremendous adventure/drama film. Bogart played the character ?Fred C. Dobbs' so convincingly, it doesn't surprise me though he was at his career peak. It was like his portrayal of ?Lt. Comdr. Philip Francis Queeg' in `The Caine Mutiny' surely no one would disagree he carried the part to it's limit. The B &amp; W format gave an added depth and the direction by John Huston (as usual) was nothing more then what I would expect from an accredited director like him. I was amused to see a very young Robert Blake in the role of the boy selling lottery tickets and the brief appearance of Bruce Bennett as ?James Cody'?. whom starred with Bogie in `Sahara' several years prior. Another reliable support actor was Alfonso Bedoya as ?Gold Hat' my fondest memory of any of his acting roles must be `The Big Country' in 1958.Walter Huston stood out with his performance, this was the first time I've had the privilege to watch him in a film role. His portrayal was astounding?..and the script he had to work with was a treat to hear.Another funny point I want to point out, I don't know why I kept comparing Tim Holt to John Derek. In some of the scenes his appearance and voice were so similar to Derek's it was uncanny. I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but I can't dismiss the similarities (to me anyway).The plot was an interesting one, one that slowly draws you in until you can't stop watching. I really enjoyed `The Treasure Of Sierra Madre' certainly a ?must see' film?highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I knew who B. Traven was. He wrote the novel this film is based on, and it's a good read. There are stories that he was a German. Maybe he was. The dialogue has little German touches in it. Traven surely lived in modest circumstances in Mexico, the details of run-down hotels being far too accurate to have been made up in a comfortable armchair.But it's not really important. Huston and his cast and crew have turned the novel into a movie that is as good as anything likely to show up on the screen. It is in fact an astounding achievement. I can't even begin to list the moments that stamp themselves indelibely into one's memory, but I will mention one, just en passant, so to speak. After killing his partner and friend, Bogart lies down next to a fire and tries to go to sleep. He talks to himself about "conscience" and how it only bother you if you allow it to, and the fake, sulfurous fire blazes up higher and higher between the actor and the camera until he seems to be consumed by the flame.Alfonso Bedoya. He made a few other movies but nothing resembling this one.What lines he is given! "Aww, come on. Throw that old iron over here." "There's a good business for Jew." And the unforgettable "batches," which doesn't need repeating.It is surely one of Huston's best films. A lesser director could have ruined the novel's plot. But Huston adds his own touches. Cody is killed, shot through the neck, and the old man reads a letter from his wife, retrieved from Cody's pocket. But -- he doesn't know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It's not just a directorial flash in the pan, because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody's wife in the blossom-blooming orchard. What I mean is that the letter-reading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment. The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one fights involved (1) a general melee in which no one wins or loses, or (2) one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious. Here, MacCormack, the heavy, done very nicely by Barton Maclaine, bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. But somebody grabs his legs as he tries to walk out the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows. Pat is finally beaten to the floor and he's not unconscious. "Okay. Enough, fellas. I'm beat. I can't see." Bogart and Tim Holt take only the money that is owing to them, and Curtin (Holt) comes up with, "Let's beat it before the law arrives." Before the law arrives. That's straight out of Traven's novel and is one of the reasons people believe he wasn't that familiar with the English language. Not that it doesn't fit -- because it does.I could go on listing one scene after another that is simply outstanding but there isn't space enough to do it. I watched this repeatedly with my ten year old kid, Josh, who finally memorized almost every word of the script. I showed it in classes in psychology at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina as an almost flawless depiction of an ego defense mechanism called "projection." The Marines loved it. I loved it. My kid loved it. John Simon loved it. Rush Limbaugh loved it. Martha Stewart loved it. Napolean Bonaparte loved it. Moses loved it. Lenin loved it. St. Peter, when not attending the pearly gates, watches it on cable TV. (No commercials.) Everybody loves it -- and for good reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the great lesson of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is the effect civilization has on the behavior of man. Some people are only as good as they ought to be and the case in point is the guys that go out into the Sierra Madre gold prospecting and how their behavior changes.Dobbs and Curtin a couple of down on their luck Americans stranded in Tampico, Mexico. They meet up with old Howard at a flop house and his tales inspire them to try gold prospecting. The plot of the film is what happens to them when they find the gold they seek.The Treaure of the Sierra Madre is a film years ahead of its time for the stark realism it portrays. These are not classic movie heroes. I could see this film easily being remade today by some of our contemporary stars like Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe.It also has probably the most brutal bar fight ever put on film. Before going prospecting, Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs and Tim Holt as Curtin go out on a construction job for Barton MacLane who stiffs them when it comes time to pay up. They catch up with him at a Tampico dive and administer a terrible beating to MacLane. This is not some western saloon fight, this is probably one of the most realistic bar brawls ever filmed. I like to compare this film to The Oxbow Incident. In both cases, stress and a crisis bring out the true characters in people. Tim Holt is a lot like Henry Fonda's character and Bogart would have definitely been found in the ranks of the lynchers.Bogart as Dobbs is probably someone who in civilized society is no better than what he can get away with. His descent into uncontrollable paranoia is frightening on the screen, one of his best performances.Tim Holt who most of the time was content to star in B westerns for RKO shows what a capable player he is. In the flophouse scene look for an unbilled appearance by his father Jack Holt.Walter Huston capped a long career on the screen with the Best Supporting Actor Award for this film which also was the Best Picture of 1948. And son John Huston won his only Oscar for Best Director, making Oscar night a banner occasion for the Huston family. Huston's character of Howard you can see playing sidekick in many a Hollywood western. That would be a superficial impression. Howard turns out to be a wise old man.The ending of what happens to the men and their acquired treasure in the Sierra Made mountains is something else. In a location far from civilization and far from law it's shown that the Almighty does have a wicked sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Treasure of Sierra Madre, is not only a stunningly visual treat, but also a story and script of depth and magnitude, set in old time Mexico.As a Bogart fan, I found it at first, difficult to get past Bogart playing such a ragged and gritty character, once I did I realised him and his co stars - Walter Huston &amp; Tim Holt were such a tenacious force in this 2.5 hour epic.Sierra Madre feels fresh and could stand up well against anything put out today. I have not seen a film in recent years, with outstanding lines, powerfully delivered by Huston or with the conviction and honesty Holt does..with Bogart, all three characters are very different yet essential.Do yourself a favor and go buy or rent this. It carries great moral and truth, in a story of rags to almost riches.~Paul Browne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that glitters is "gone with the wind...."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's genius as a director is undeniable. From his beginning he showed an uncanny knack for getting not only excellent acting from his actors, but his movies always had a social conscience as well.Mr. Huston loved Mexico and it shows in this film. It must have been a difficult task for him directing his own father in the movie. After all, Walter Huston was a major star on his own right. Both father and son made a great contribution, John behind the camera, Walter in front of it.Basically the story is about men that have drifted into Mexico to escape jail, or in search of riches, as it was the case of the men that fate brings together in a Tampico shelter. Dobbs, Howard and Curtin start out as partners searching for gold in the Sierra Madre. They find it, but as luck will have it, none of them will live to be rich from what they find in that remote place.In the most ironic of film endings, this one will be a classic. After the trio finds gold, greed sets in. Friendship turns sour and the three friends become enemies. When the bandits finally catch up with an exhausted Dobbs, trying to go north, they beat him up and discover some sacks full of sand....Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs is excellent. Of course, Walter Huston made the best out of Howard, the clever old man who has seen a lot in his life. He is the only one that discovers a happiness living the simple life among the friendly Mexicans that welcome him into their community. Finally, Tim Holt, as Curtin is perfectly cast as an honest man who has gone into the adventure without any expectations.The final sequence of Howard and the peasants riding their horses into the 'yellow dust' is amazing, as it it incredible. In retrospect, it seems to be telling us that sometimes dreams of becoming rich the easy way will not be sustained, but honest work will be more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A treasure presented to the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies have certain scenes in them that hold the viewers interest more than others. However every single scene in this film holds the viewers interest. There is never a dull or lagging moment. Three down and outers who at one time in their lives were maybe up and comers strike out in search of a fortune or at least enough to live better than they have been.While Humphrey Bogart gives a superb performance it is Walter Huston who turns in the greatest performance as the old prospector Howard. The scene in the Indian village where he helps to restore a comatose child is one of the most touching in all of film history and is done virtually without any dialog. Mexican character actor Alfonso Bedoya of course steals all the scenes he appears in and delivers his classic "Stinking Badges" line. (what person would dress up as a Bandito for a costume party and not want to look exactly like Bedoya's Gold Hat character?) This film probably should have been a little higher on AFI's top 100. A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that glitters is not gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those great old movies that is worth a repeat viewing every now and again in a person's life. Sure, much of the acting and dialog have gotten corny and dated over the years, and I agree with one of the previous commenters who said that Bogart's acting seems very forced - like he's obviously just reading lines from script. Be that as it may, the story that is told here is every bit as important and thought provoking as something from the Bible. Throughout the film there is a spot-on wisdom about man and his endless quest for wealth (in this case, gold). I always come away from this movie feeling secure in my belief that in life you just can't have it all, and all that glitters is not gold (i.e. there are things in life more important than money).Since this movie was largely about lost fortunes (literally "dust in the wind" if you think about the end sequence), it must have made quite an impression on audiences back in the forties when it was released. I'm sure more than a few viewers back then still had painful memories of catastrophic losses caused by the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing Depression of the 1930's. Also, many people lost a lot in the war years that followed, and which predated this movie by just a few years.That's why I think this movie qualifies for repeat viewings, because just think how appropriate this wisdom is for our current generation of people: just consider the losses from, say, the stock market crash of 2000, the events of September 11th, and of course we just witnessed the horrific losses caused by the Asian tsunami... the cycle repeats. Fortunes come and go, gold is often times nothing but dust in the wind, but life goes on and so man must go on. That's what this movie says to me whenever I see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Greed is not presented as a force beyond conquering. It is a grave error to see this as simply a movie about greed by moralists. Curtain and Howard defeat it easily, Howard more easily because of his age and nearness to death. Dodds is destroyed; he is consumed until nothing of his personality remains. We see the predilections that led to this outcome. Notice his vanity with the haircut, hardly a necessity when begging, and his chasing after the prostitute. The little scene of his cruelty to the lottery boy all seem to be quite trivial and innocuous. Sadly, they are the inclinations that grow into monstrous proportions once the piles of gold begin to accumulate. Notice, Dodds is the one who wants it split up every night, this triggers hiding one's stash, always on the lookout for discovery. Huston takes some of the real bite out of greed and its partner murder by having the bandits arrive just when they are about to shoot Cody. Again, Cody is conveniently killed in the battle, again, sparing us from seeing the murder all three of them were about to commit for their gold. The voting to kill him is a nice reminder not to enshrine democracy, the majority is often wrong. Do not fall in love with the consensus of idiots. Dodds begins spiraling out of control whenever temptation falls on him. Howard leaves to help the natives, Dodd's complaints about the extra burros is just a subterfuge for stealing Howard's goods which also is why Dodds endorsed Howard leaving with such enthusiasm. This is not good enough; he projects his greed onto Curtain and convinces himself he has to kill him to survive. As before, with his stash, earlier predilections in Dodds are growing getting more and more dangerous. After he thinks he killed Curtain, watch the fire grow and grow as he mocks having a conscience, trying to convince himself. You do not need me to tell you what the growing fire signifies. Do not feel sorry for Dodds at the waterhole where the bandits kill him; he would have joyfully shot all of them if he had any bullets. Many people think the natives slow down or wreck the film, they are there to remind us of the poor and suffering surrounding these gold mad maniacs.The point of the movie is not that greed is evil; it is how to handle losing things which is an existential fact of human life. First Howard then Curtain laugh at losing everything, having it blown by the Hand of God back to where it came from. When they were saying what they would do with the money, listen to the beautiful music, re-prised again when Curtain talks about picking fruit with the poor and sleeping, singing under the stars. This is the film's message: a simple, basic spartan life free of desire. It is so hard within an economy that thrives upon creating eternal desire and boundless wants. The message is not just that greed is evil; it is how much do you require to be happy? Happiness is from within where all true wealth is, its reification into material goods will only be like drinking sea water; it makes you thirstier. Lose and laugh, my friends, for the last laugh is on all of us. We too blow away in the wind, love and goodness are all we can ever take with us. They are meant to be given to all we meet.

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Greed, With Outstanding Direction and Performance of the Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1925, in Mexico, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is an American begging for food and trying to get any job. He meets Bob Curtin (Tim Holt), another American in horrible economical situation and also looking for job, and the former gold prospector Howard (Walter Huston), and together they go to the Mexican mountains seek for gold. After ten months of hard and tense work, including confrontation with bandits, each one of them gets a small fortune in gold. Meanwhile, their personalities are disclosed, and Dobbs shows himself a man obsessed by greed. The end of their journey is ironic and tragic. This movie is a masterpiece. Having an outstanding direction of John Huston, an astounding performance of Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt and supported by a fantastic screenplay, it is certainly one of the best movies ever, highly recommended for any audience. Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart are really stupendous in their roles. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): `O Tesouro de Sierra Madre' (`The Treasure of the Sierra Madre')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you want somebody NOT to find it, . . . Put it in front of them"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1920's, labor was hard to find. If you happened to be a laborer, work was almost non existent. Indeed, if you were unemployed and in Mexico, your chances were dismal. Yet, these were the times, which attracted many South of the border. The place was barren, yet many a fortune could spring up directly before you, . . .if you were luckily enough to see it. That is the story behind this incredible film. The legend of El Dorado was only one of the many myths which lured the adventurous to Mexico, another was "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." The gold of the Mother of Mountains was passed from father to son for generations. Thus when the film adaption was made, it was sure to be sculpted by men of vision. One such man is legendary John Huston who directed this film. Three common men are lured by the promise of discovering a lost treasure. The first is Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a nice enough guy who wants only to be fair, but is hungry to 'strike it rich.' The second is Howard, (Walter Huston) as honest as you expect him to be and a man of considerable experience. The last is Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) who if given a chance, will use it. The trio make a PAC to share and share alike all the treasure they find. However, only Howard is aware of what the possession of Gold can do to a man. To find the treasure, they need the mountain, some hard work, a little luck. To bring it home, will require something only one of them possesses. The film is a Classic and is due to the combined talents of all the stars and the director. If you look closely, you'll see Robert Blake (Barreta) and John Huston in brief roles. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive Tale of Descent Into Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much that's already been said in previous reviews that it's senseless to repeat, but hard not to.On my 1st viewing 15 years ago, 'Treasure...' got catapulted into my top 10 best "1st time movie viewing" experience and it still remains there. Bogart, who displayed such cool confidence in "Maltese Falcon", "Casablanca" and "Big Sleep" is devastating as Fred (don't forget the 'C.') Dobbs. Hollywood brass wanted a more uplifting denouement, but that would have undermined the whole powerful impact of the story. It's dirty, gritty and unrelenting in the power of greed that comes with the lure of wealth. I totally understand if anyone places this as their #1 favorite. Another testament on the shallowness of the Oscars. Time is the only true testament on the truthful quality of a movie...and this movie stands high.Can't wait for the 2 disc edition being released in Sept, 2003.Not for all tastes, especially for those looking for the typical glamorized Hollywood product of a bygone age.

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this is easily one of the top 5 pre-1950 films in existence. No doubt about that in my mind. Not only that, but it is easily one of the greatest films ever made after 1950 as well.To me, this film in the end plays as a dark comedy. A dark comedy that pokes it's fun at the greedy devil within the minds of men.The thing that stands out to me the most about this film is the writing. The Oscar winning screenplay is in my view still under-appreciated. This film's writing is totally devoid of any prejudice at all, and has a depth that almost every other film can only dream to have. A truly amazing work.I could go on and on about this film, but I will just end by saying that as a story, and as a film, The Treasure Of Sierra Madre will stand as an artistic landmark for all of human history.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a great joke played on us by the lord, fate, nature or whatever"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir takes a Mexican holiday in this gritty adventure from John Huston. Pessimistic and full of irony, yet with a sense of adventure and a moralist edge to it, this is typical Huston material.Huston insisted on shooting on location in Mexico, which riled up studio executives no end, but it paid off in the quality of the picture. Treasure of the Sierra Madre would have really suffered in the canned air of a studio. By using the real thing, he perfectly achieves the stark and dusty atmosphere of the poverty riddled Mexican city in the earliest scenes. The sense of scale and grandeur of the mountains in the main part of the film is also very important in achieving the right effect.Huston's background was in fine art, and it's at this point in his career as a director that it really starts to show. The use of lighting is painterly in a way that is almost impossible to achieve in black and white ? particularly in the scene in the peasant village which looks almost biblical. Huston also has this unique style of framing, whereby he uses figures in the foreground and background to give the effect of a close-up and a mid-shot simultaneously. It's a look that is totally at odds with anything else produced in Hollywood at that time.Actor wise, Treasure of the Sierra Madre turns the clock back to the 1930s, putting the director's father Walter Huston in a starring role, and casting Humphrey Bogart as a seedy villain. The cast is rounded off by the too-little-seen Tim Holt. All three of them are spot on. The spry old prospector is a role Huston senior seems to have been waiting to play all his life. Bogart is also great playing the sort of character he made his name with a decade earlier. Also worth a mention is Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya who gives what is for this era an incredibly naturalistic performance as the bandit leader.Huston's forte was in his cinematography, his shot composition and the rhythm of his films, not so much in his handling of action or actors, which is why his pictures tend to be a bit hit and miss. This one is a hit though, thanks to the strength of its story and the quality of the cast, not to mention Huston's persistence for authenticity. Not my absolute favourite of his work, but certainly one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary and marvelously performed film about a grizzled hustler decides to join with other prospectors to find gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnificent rendition of B. Traven's story of ambition and human nature at its worst and dealing with an unlikely trio of ambitious prospectors . As Fred Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) , two Americans searching for work in Mexico, convince an old prospector (Walter Huston) to help them mine for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains . Through a lot of troubles they eventually succeed in finding gold, but greedy outlaws (Alfonso Bedoya) , and most especially craziness lead to disaster . As they sold their souls for the treasure of the Sierra Madre . It's an intelligent semi-western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group , including their enormous difficulties and breathtaking taking on between protagonists and the Mexican enemies that stalk to them . The film blends thrills , emotion , intrigue , high body-count and it's fast moving and exciting ; being filmed in Mexico, though Warners' studio head Jack L. Warner had the unit return to Hollywood when the budget started to exceed $3 million . Thought-provoking screenplay by the same Huston , concerning about greed and ambition that threaten to turn their success into disaster . Director John Huston had read the book by B. Traven in 1936 and had always thought the material would make a great movie . Based on a 19th-century ballad by a German poet , Traven's book reminded Huston of his own adventures in the Mexican cavalry . When Huston became a director at Warner Bros. , the smashing success of his initial effort, The Maltese Falcon (1941), gave him the clout to ask to write and direct the project, for which Warner Bros had previously secured the movie rights . Although by many to be director John Huston's finest film , this is a tale of fear , greed and murder , as three partners fall out over the gold they have clawed out of the inhospitable and bandit-ridden deserts and mountains . It also has probably the most brutal gold bar fight ever put on film along with "The Ruthless Four" . Overrated by some reviewers , but very interesting and attractive to watch . It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie, in which the three main roles are the essentials . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going . They are three totally different characters, which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film . Bogart is superbly believable and gives a nice portrait of an increasingly unhinged prospector , Walter Huston is very good as a cunning veteran and Tim Holt is also pretty well . John Huston has a cameo as an American tourist , this scene was directed by Humphrey Bogart, who took malicious pleasure on his director by making him perform the scene over and over again. And the little boy who sells Bogart the portion of the winning lottery ticket is Robert Blake . The bum seated near Walter Huston in the first scene in the Oso Negro flophouse is Jack Holt, father of Tim Holt . Walter Huston, father of director John Huston, won the Academy Award for best supporting actor , John won for best direction . This was the first father/son win . The musician Max Steiner composes a vibrant soundtrack and well conducted ; including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under sunny exteriors and a glimmer sun and fine sets with striking cinematography by Ted McCord , this was one of the first American films to be made almost entirely on location outside the USA . Also shown in computer-colored version . The picture was shot on location in Tampico, Mexico ; just as John Huston was starting to shoot scenes in, the production was shut down inexplicably by the local government ; it turns out that a local newspaper printed a false story that accused the filmmakers of making a production that was unflattering to Mexico . Fortunately, two of Huston's associates, Diego Rivera and Miguel Covarrubias, went to bat for the director with the President of Mexico , then the libelous accusations were dropped . The motion picture was stunningly realized by John Huston and the film took 5-1/2 months to shoot and was 29 days over schedule ; Robert Rossen submitted at least nine drafts of rewrites on the screenplay when John Huston was away during the war . Rating : Above average . Well worth watching , essential and indispensable seeing . In 2007: The American Film Institute ranked this as the #38 Greatest Movie of All Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Treasure" of American Cinema ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brutal and uncompromising portrayal of greed's effects on the human spirit and an exhilarating quest of the Mexican El Dorado, the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. You'll be thrilled by John Huston's masterpiece, a genuine monument that would catch by surprise, even the most skeptical viewers when it comes to 'old' movies.The "Sierra Madre" was the first major studios films set outside Hollywood, in Mexico, when even the most acclaimed masterpieces didn't raise such a level of authenticity in their exotic setting, like in "Casablanca" when Captain Renault refers to the titular town as the middle of the desert. The geography in Huston's film is crucial as it provides the obligatory escapism for any adventure film, with a unique flavor. In "Sierra Madre" we get the same authentic feeling that probably inspired Clouzot's "Wages of Fear", with the proverbial financial struggle of the white men in South America. There's almost the same criticism of capitalism that prevailed in B. Travel's novel, as these men have been purely and totally exploited by the capitalistic majors that literally raped Mexico from its precious resources.Huston's movie is less politically loaded, but it portrayed capitalism in a negative light through the downfall and total disintegration of its main character, Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs. Bogie, after having been a gangster, a private eye, a cynical, detached, and sometimes romantic lead, probably gives one of his best performances as a big s.o.b. And how he didn't get a nomination is unbelievable. His evolution from a decent man who wants a job and some money to the cold-blooded paranoid lunatic who tries to keep the gold for himself is not only fascinating but also mirrors the evolution of the film from a light-hearted mood, made of some comedic running gags like the encounters with Huston as the rich man in a white suit, to a heart-pounding thriller.And on that very level, the differences between the characters set the perfect circumstances for tension, despite the many signs of camaraderie displayed in the beginning. Curtin, Tim Holt in a remarkable performance, is younger and exudes a certain idealistic naiveté that counterbalances Dobbs' growing cynicism. Howard, the old-time prospector, an unforgettable Walter Huston, knows everything about prospecting, with enough experience to foresee the psychological changes on people when gold is at stakes. Of course, the movie is also remembered for the famous 'Gold Hat', Alfonso Bedoya with his unforgettable "stinking badges" line but more than an exotic villain, Bedoya foreshadows with a sort of charming charisma the evolution of Dobbs as a similar bastard.Indeed, one never knows how gold would transform us, and one must have the guts to work alone without falling into madness. During their journey guided by Howard, Dobbs and Curtin discover the true meaning of the word 'value' as measurable through the efforts you spend, days and nights, to find the treasure. Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting character, but he's as central as Vito Corleone in "The Godfather". Whatever Howard says, we know it's the truth, when he's reluctant, we understand it's a bad premonition. And when Howard esteems that the best would be to split the share when it becomes money, Dobbs, already showing signs of suspicion, recommends that each one takes care of his own share. Howard is experimented enough to resign, with all the wisdom of a man who doesn't want trouble.Dobbs' gradual descent into paranoid madness is highlighted in the episode when a gila monster gets stuck under the rock that covered his share while he suspects Curtin to have come for another reason. The paranoia grows and contaminates the whole team when another American named Cody, joins them and proposes his help. He's obviously smarter than them and doesn't deny that murdering him is an option they would consider. The way the team handled his proposal says a lot about the conservative instinct that could govern so called 'civilized' hearts, and again, doesn't speak in favor of the monopolistic systems regulated by capitalism. The alienation that grows within the team erodes all the camaraderie built during these months of labor, to a point even the word 'partner' loses its humanistic meaning.Bogart perfectly embodied the metamorphosis of a man alienated by his own greed, where the value of his share of gold, exceeded, every kind of principle that made him a decent man. As it's almost impossible to break free from a gila's bite, Dobbs became that gila with paranoia as a venomous poison, too mistrustful to go, to let go or to be reasoned. When Curtin says he protected Howard's money as he would have done for Dobbs, Dobbs uses the same reasoning in a reverse way, pushing cynicism to its paroxysm : betraying before being betrayed. And in an ironic anticlimactic twist, Dobbs is killed by bandits, 15 minutes before the end of the film as to highlight the pointlessness of this entire struggle. After all, what's the point of earning money if you lose principles? Failure is a recurrent theme in Huston's films with this double dimension of cynical denunciation, generally driven by an impeccable script, and this entertaining dimension that pleases the crowds as much as the more sophisticated audience, both who, matured enough by World War II, accepted a story about greed and deception, but maybe not Bogie so far from his usual character, playing such an unsavory bastard. I don't know, if like some said, this is why the film's flopped. One thing for sure, after 60 years, it remains as one of the most enduring classics ever, that beautifully earned a father and a son three deserved Oscars.And any other consideration is as pointless as crying over the loss of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and the only reaction it deserves is the unique loud and hysterical, jig-driven, maniacal laugh of Walter Huston ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How 'bout some beans?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by John Huston, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" stars Humphrey Bogart and Tim Hold as two down on their luck Americans struggling to make ends meet in rural Mexico. Upon learning that a nearby mountain contains gold, the duo team up with a wise old timer and go in search of riches. Predictably, Bogart falls under the spell of greed and descends into violent madness. The film's point: material wealth makes you paranoid, increasingly greedy and eventually corrupts the soul.Unsurprising for a John Huston flick, a subtle socialist undercurrent runs throughout the picture. Bogart is oblivious to his own class status, turning his back on those who struggle like him in favour for embracing the race for wealth. Instead of truly uniting himself with his partners, developing a trusting, mutually beneficial relationship, Bogart sabotages everything with his paranoia and every-man-for-himself ethos. So Bogart is essentially the ugliest incarnation of a popular American icon, the rugged frontier iconoclast, striking out on his own to make his fortune. Huston and B. Traven, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, also manage to turn the story into an anti-capitalist, anti-fascist adventure tome in which the greed and deviousness of human nature is juxtaposed with the psychological underpinnings of poverty and post-revolutionary politics on peasants and indigenous peoples. Like Huston, who fraternised with communists in is youth, Traven was an avowed leftist (at one point a character in the film even quotes Marx, applying Marx's "labour theory of value" to the search for gold) and so the film must be read through the lens of the workers revolutionary movements of the era, when the Soviet Union was more an ideal and less a corrupt manifestation of power.Huston made at least two films which defined their genres: "The Asphalt Jungle" and "The Maltese Falcon". "Madre" is equally influential, everything from "Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia" to "The Man Who Would Be King" to "The Wild Bunch" to "The Good The Bad And The Ugly" to "There Will Be Blood" borrowing heavily from its pages. George Lucas even stole the look of Indiana Jones from Bogart's character. Indeed, all 4 Indiana Jones movies are basically "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" with action scenes, greed corrupting the souls of each film's villains.More interesting is the way "Madre" fits in with its sub-genre of adventure stories. There have always been tales in which heroes go on quests to find "grails", "gold", "treasures" or "magical things", but for the most part, these characters have all been looking for essentially the same mixture of wealth, power, knowledge, dignity and individual freedom. In "Madre", though, the quest for wealth is seen as being inherently negative. Nastily portrayed, Bogart's gang evoke Shylock in Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice", Gekko and Bud in "Wall Street" or Ebenezer Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol". Economist Friedrich Hayek noted this long-standing tendency to interpret the acquisition of wealth as being sinister: "Distrust and fear have long led ordinary people to regard wealth as being suspicious, inferior, dishonest, and contemptible. Activities that appear to add to available wealth 'out of nothing', without physical creation and by merely rearranging what already exists, stink of sorcery. That a mere change of hands should lead to a gain in value to all participants, that it need not mean gain to one at the expense of the others, was and is nonetheless intuitively difficult to grasp. Many people continue to find the mental feats associated with trade easy to discount even when they do not attribute them to sorcery, or see them as depending on trick or fraud or cunning deceit."For Hayek, it is not that "greed is bad", but that people are irrationally suspicious of the entrepreneurial skills required to acquire and create wealth. Hayek, of course, is the godfather of contemporary Neoliberalism, spawned every evil from Thatcher to Reagan and has been thoroughly debunked by post neoclassical, eco-economists. His stance, which is how most vaguely and intuitively understand modern society (a type of sorcery which denies physics, energy flows and in which value is magically created and benefits everyone), is ultimately an apologia for exploitation which ignores deep rooted, systemic problems.The lesson put forth by art like "Madre", though, is consistently the wrong one. Such art doesn't challenge our conceptions of wealth (or the paradoxes of capitalism- the physics of contemporary money is fundamentally unethical and creates indebtedness), but simply warn us that "too much is bad". The moral tone of all these tales is thus similar to how Spinoza famously reinterpreted the Bible. Because early people were primitive, he says, God's will took the form of a performative command ("Thou shalt not do so and so!"). For the modern man, however, the way to grasp this is not through commands that appeal to authority, but through a kind of scientific or objective "constructive" statement ("Thou shalt not smoke because thou shalt get cancer!") which highlights a certain causality designed to keep excesses in check. And so modern man doesn't get orders any more. Instead, commands are hidden in a universal form, never spoken directly: "Smoke, but nicotine is dangerous for your health", "Eat what you want, but beware of cholesterol", "Money is great, but too much corrupts". The whole world is now a mass of conflicting information, food tins swamped with tables and charts, detailing the levels of sugar, fat, salt etc. In our permissive society, everything is available, you can have whatever you want, the world is yours, but actually, you better not touch anything. Everything is prohibited, even though it's not. Finding gold is great, but it will royally mess up your life.Incidentally, the film's downbeat climax is pure noir, very much akin to the climaxes of Huston's "Maltese" and "Asphalt". Huston would win Oscar's for directing and writing the film.8.9/10 ? Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONCE AGAIN, WE just cannot believe that we haven't written about this classic &amp; favourite long ago. Being that it is one of those "one of a kind" and impossible to truly classify films. We guess we're just getting a case of being slightly forgetful. (You know, Schultz, some call it "Senior Moments!" AS WE'VE ALREADY stated, this is a delight of a story that we can watch over and over again. It's earthy, it's Noir and at the same time, it emerges as hopeful.SET AMONG THE drifters, tramps and hobos of the 1920's, we have Boagey cast as a down and outer; who finds himself South of the Border. He does whatever to make do. He even panhandles "fellow Americans" for handouts; stopping abruptly when he encounters the same wealthy Americano (played by the Film's Director, John Huston).DESPERATION AND GREED, plus the luck of a winning lottery ticket bring Dobbs (Boagey), Curtin (Tim Holt) and old-timer, Howard (Walter Huston) together in setting out to prospect foe Gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains (Hence, we get the title. Get it, Schultz?) OF COURSE THE hostile environment of the City is bad enough, but when the three man party gets out into the hinterland, they encounter banditos, native Indian tribes and a most hostile landscape. While out on the trail they encounter another American, Cody (Bruce Bennett); but mistrust is already permeating the trio and he is accepted, although only because of the threat from the approach of banditos.ALTHOUGH THERE WAS an early warning from Howard about how gold can corrupt the mind, Dobbs goes off the deep end, trusting no one. His fatal flaw proves to be just that. He eventually meets up with banditos headed up by "Gold Hat" (Alfonso Bedoya); who gives an outstanding performance, forever giving the world a most famous movie line.* WE'RE NOT GOING to go any further with a description of the story; as we believe that it should be if you haven't yet watched it. Suffice it is to say that it will not disappoint. It does however have some peculiar and unique items to report.IN ADDITION TO the Director John Huston's portrayal of the wealthy Yank in Tampico, he was the son of Walter Huston (old timer, Howard). The young Mexican who sells Hobbs (Bogart) the Lottery Ticket was a young Robert Blake. Tim Holt's costarring role was a second choice. Warner Brothers wanted to have John Garfield cast as Curtin; thus giving us the solo teaming of the two screen giants. But by the time of finally getting THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE started, John Gatfield had left Warners for other studios.NOTE: * Having been a Chicago Cop for nearly 35 years I can tell this with some authority. In just about every Police Station anywhere, there are incidents where some now under arrest gang-bang punk will shout with a great deal of moral indignity something like: ".....and you didn't show me your Badges!"; at which time every Cop in earshot will reply in near perfect unison: "BODGES? WE GOT NO STINKING BODGES!" This is of course quite puzzling to the "Suspect" involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully.And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie.Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade.Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too.Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico.Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clichés, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work.I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great tale about the darker side of human nature...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are already a lot of reviews for this film and it's in the Top 250 list on IMDb, so I don't feel quite as much need to talk about his film in great depth--after all, it's all been pretty much said. This is an exceptional film for many reasons--most notably because it looks into the darker side of human nature--something you don't often see in films during this era.The film begins in Mexico. Two Americans (Time Holt and Humphrey Bogart) are stranded there and haven't a peso between them. Their needs are few--they just want to get enough to buy a meal and find a place to flop. Through this first portion of the film, both men seem like decent enough sorts and the audience tends to empathize with them--even when they are involved in a vicious brawl with Barton MacLane--you feel the guy has it coming when the two give him a beating.Later, however, their prospects change when they hit on the idea of hooking up with an old coot (Walter Huston) who seems to know a lot about gold mining. The three take off for the Mexican wilderness--and much like the story "Heart of Darkness", the good and bad within them is slowly revealed--all brought about by greed.What I particularly liked about this film is what a great professional Humphrey Bogart was. His character was extremely flawed and later in the film he was very easy to hate. Many stars of the day probably wouldn't have accepted this less role of a less than honorable man. Nor, I think, they would have been so willing to play a guy who wasn't all that macho.Apart from Bogart, the acting all around was very good, the script exciting and insightful and the direction just dandy. One of the best films of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done story with a valuable lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1948 classic is one of Humphrey Bogart's best-known films. Based on the novel by B. Traven, it tells the story of three men who go on an expedition in search of gold and discover that high hopes often lead to "changes in character" as I would word it.Of course, stories about looking for gold are nothing new, nor do I think they were in those days. But this movie is probably one of the better examples. The great John Huston won an Academy Award as Best Director. It is his eighth movie and one of his best. Bogart is fine as Fred C. Dobbs, the man whose greed eventually conquers him. Tim Holt gives a strong performance as his partner, Curtin. But these two men are easily upstaged by Walter Huston, the director's father. He won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Howard, the old grizzled prospector who is always leaving his comrades in the dust when they trudge through the mountains. This must have been the definitive year for him and his son, being that they shared fame on Oscar night.Rounding out the cast are the under-appreciated Bruce Bennett as the man who tries to join the expedition, only to be killed in the attempt, Barton MacLane as Bogart's and Holt's dishonest boss, and Alfonso Bedoya as the leader of the Mexican bandits (the one who wears the golden hat).Fourteen year old Robert Blake appears as a Mexican boy selling lottery tickets and- surprise surprise- Huston (John Huston I mean) as a man in a white suit who is fed up with Bogart's begging for money.The lesson this movie teaches us is: greed does not pay. I'm sure we're all aware of that, but this movie really depicts the consequences people often have to pay for their greed. It's not something to ignore. I think this is one of the best examples of that plain fact. I recommend you check this movie out.Famous line: "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges.

		<fullReview>The great movies never grow old, they age like fine wine. "The Treasure of The Sierra Madre" is such a film, a classic tale of corruption and greed that follows the trail of three would be prospectors, and ends as a rich morality tale reminding us that the best things in life after all, can't be bought, sold, stolen or given away.For fans of old movies, the casting of the principals may not seem to work on paper, as Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Walter Huston form as disparate a trio as ever to assemble on screen. The way the story brings them together is a minor act in itself, as the camera follows Fred C. Dobbs (Bogey) through the dusty streets of Tampico, Mexico, living on handouts and a dream. His chance meetings with Curtin (Holt) form a bond that sees the men through a rigorous work detail and a wild bar brawl against their smooth talking boss McCormick (Barton MacLane). When the time comes to move on, the pair seeks out the wisdom of an old codger who's been around the block and back a few times.Though the most memorable line of the film involves 'steenkin' badges' uttered by Gold Hat bandit Alfonso Bedoya, the best lines belong to Howard (Huston), but you better be attentive and listen closely. As he shows Dobbs and Curtin how to wash sand for fine gold nuggets, he comes up with one himself - "You gotta know how to tickle it so she come out laughin'". Later, as Dobbs begins his descent into paranoia and begins talking to himself, Howard challenges him accordingly - "You got somethin' up your nose? Blow it out, it'll do you good." In fact, Huston's a scene stealer more than once in the film. My favorite occurs when about midway through their trek into the mountains, Bogey's character is getting worn out and is ready to quit. It's then when Howard reveals they're actually in the middle of a workable vein, and he goes into a comical jig that's just plain fun to watch. Do they teach that in acting class?However it's not just for comic relief that Howard is so important to the story. Watch his expression and knowing eyes when Dobbs and Curtin shake on their deal the very first time. Later, he's the moral center and conscience of the trio, figuring it's just as well to divvy up the gold as it's mined so each man can guard his own share. Bogey's character is the first to allow his greed to take over, while Curtin falls in right behind. The introduction of Cody (Bruce Bennett) offers yet another psychological angle for the film to explore, as the original partners debate whether to kill him, run him off or take him in. It's the only time we have a hint that Howard's character may have a dark side as well.For his part, Bogart accomplishes a masterful turn as the down and out bum with dreams of glory, creating one of the great morally tragic figures in movies. Watching him wrestle his conscience after he shoots Curtin, then going doubly mad when Curtin's body is gone in the morning is Bogey at his best. That he meets his end ignominiously seems only proper as befitting his traitorous character, one who's willing to sell out anyone in his path.I guess the true measure of the film's greatness is it's ability to hook the viewer in a way that makes you feel you're a participant in the adventure. Come on now, didn't you shudder with disbelief when the 'steenkin' badges' hombre trashed the bags with gold dust, figuring it was only sand to weigh down the hides on the burros? I'm glad Howard was allowed to put his own unique perspective on things as a desert wind storm blew away a hundred thousand dollar fortune. Remarking that theirs was a ten month old joke in the making, he philosophically offers - "The gold has gone back to where we found it", as if that was just the way it was meant to be.For film trivia buffs, 'Treasure' is just that. Study the face of the young Mexican boy selling Dobbs a lottery ticket in an early scene. Doesn't it have an unusually uncanny resemblance to that of adult actor Robert Blake? Back then he was known as Bobby. And how about the white suited American who's constantly tapped for a handout by Bogey's character. That would have been Director John Huston in an uncredited appearance. Tim Holt's actor father Jack Holt also appeared uncredited as a flophouse bum in an early scene. Later the two would actually portray for the first time in the movies a father and son in the 1948 Western "The Arizona Ranger".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on the novel written by the mysterious B. Traven, which chronicles the exploits of two down-and-out Americans living in Mexico that join up with a gold prospector. They all go into the mountains of Mexico looking for gold. The movie (and book) is a critique of the capitalist system (B. Traven apparently worked during the industrial boom at the turn of the 19th century in Mexico). This movie's basic premise is the demise of humanity through greed, that even honest and well intentioned people fall victim to it.This is a classic American movie directed and written by John Huston. This is by far one of Humphrey Bogart's best acting role. The stand out performance of the movie is Howard the prospector. The role is played to perfection by Walter Huston (John Huston's father). The prospector is wily, talkative, wise, down to earth and a naturalist. The trio is rounded up by the youthful and idealistic Bob Curtain (played by Tim Holt, whose father Jack Holt has a bit part when Howards is talking to the hobos at the flophouse). When all is said and done, this movie is probably remembered most for the lines spoken by the bandit Gold Hat, played by Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya."Badges ??We ain't got no badges.We don't need no badges.I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges !!!"-Celluloid Rehab</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Steiner score is excellent, particularly the guitars on the San Joaquin Valley bit as Tim Holt recalls his youth, and later when Walter Huston suggests that Tim go and visit Cody's widow.But I really liked the Mexican music, mariachi and folk, in the beginning of the film.I've tried for years to find/track down the mariachi music used in the background when Bogart gets out of the barber chair. Anyone have a clue to the name of this tune?And the song that is played as Holt and Bogart enter the Oso Negro, the flop-house where they meet Walter Huston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie with a sobering message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is unique as ,besides superb acting and direction,it has a message,possibly several. Given the time the book was written,early twenty century,with socialism riding high,holding many not to be materialized promises,the book which is the basis for the movie,aimed at depicting the corrupting influence of wealth,the gold treasure. I find another,in my opinion more important,message:-holding a mirror to our face and telling us how we behave in our natural state. This is raw ,uninhibited behaviour,personified in the main character,Dobbs,played by Humphrey Bogart. We witness the evolution of Dobbs who, like the other gold prospectors,is devoid of any restraining influence-laws,family,friends,community or neighbours ,with the only means of settling differences being the gun. It is interesting what a disproportionate number of classic movies are black and white,when color was available.It may be that black and white adds somber and serious atmosphere. I think that this movie not only retains its power and artistic value after more than half a century,it has secured a prominent place in the pantheon of classic movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly fantastic and engaging movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why don't they make films like this anymore? Why can't we have character driven dramas and action/adventures with depth? Where have all the Bogies gone?This is easily one of Bogart's best films (he did some of his best work under Huston) and gives him a chance to stretch his acting muscles a bit. While he starts off as the hard-bitten hero, he quickly (and convincingly) degenerates into psychosis and madness during the quest for gold. The supporting cast are especially fantastic (particularly Huston himself as the dude that Bogie keeps hitting up for money at the beginning of the film). Bobby Blake (of both Barretta and Lost Highway fame) has a small role as the young boy selling lottery tickets. And Bogie's co-conspirators are both plausible and dramatic.Treasure of the Sierra Madre is an insightful look into human greed and into the human heart. Bogart plays out the evils of acquisitiveness to the hilt and kicks maximum a** while doing so. Any fan of Bogart, or simply of great film, should really see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold Fever and Greedy Fools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1925 Tampico, a destitute American, stiffed by his ne'er-do-well employer, wins a small lottery and teams up with an honest co-worker and a wily prospector to pan for gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. Writer-director John Huston, faithfully adapting B. Traven's novel, opens the film with a wry flourish, which peaks with a justified fist-fight in the local bar; the second and third acts are less satisfying, with the arc of Humphrey Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs character oddly (and improbably) turning from humble protagonist to mad-dog killer (without any preparation from the filmmaker). The melodramatic or sympathetic turns of the plot don't match up with the initial 30 minutes, which have a sarcastic or mocking tone, although the film is forceful throughout, well-produced and immensely watchable. Not a commercial success in 1948, "Sierra Madre" now holds a reputation as a classic, mostly due to Walter Huston's juicy, Oscar-winning supporting performance as the razor-sharp old coot. John Huston, father of Walter, also won statues for both his direction and screenplay. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ann Sheridan, my eye!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ann Sheridan my eye. I've just viewed the new Warner Brother's Classic DVD of this great film with commentary by Eric Lax and I have some commentary of my own.Firstly, I saw the still of Anne Sheridan posing with the crew in Mexico among the 'extras' but I have run the scene where she supposedly plays the prostitute back and forth and even considering Hollywood's make-up know-how, the black wig, etc., there is no way at all that is her. I looked at it with a picture of Ann Sheridan next to the screen and the eyes and jaw-line are totally different than that. My theory is that Sheridan did go to Mexico and did film such a scene but Huston or Warners decided not to use it for some reason and it was reshot but the story that that is Anne Sheridan remained alive.Mr. Lax identified the guy in the bar who warns Dobbs and Curtain about McCormick as Tim Holt's father Jack and goes on to tell the story of his life and career but in fact that actor, as the IMDb shows is Pat Flaherty. Jack Holt is the guy in the flophouse that Howard is talking to when we first encounter him. Lax has a tendency to discuss the biographies and resumes of people involved with the film ad nauseum instead of discussing what we are seeing on screen, which is what commentaries are all about. At one point he describes the history of the Warner Brothers and how they got into the movie business.One thing he could have spent more time on is Humphrey Bogart's hairpieces. In the barber shop scene, we see Dobbs setting all slicked up- and slicked down. He actually looks awful in this scene, like a 70 year old trying to make himself look half his age, (he is of course looking for female companionship but the prospects appear dimmer than he imagines unless money is involved). Later, when Dobbs is going nuts, he sports a wonderful thatch of thick curly hair. Even though his character is dirty and exhausted Bogart somehow looks a generation younger than he does in the barbershop scene. He looks downright handsome and a little wild. Lax continually describes Bogart's character as 'loathsome' and compares him to the gangsters he played early in his career. I disagree. What this really is is the greatest departure from the 'star' system by a male actor in the history of the Golden Age of Hollywood. All the characters they played were either virtuous, with their virtue somehow granting them great mental and martial abilities, or tragically flawed but powerful, with a great 'Is this the End for Rico?' or 'Top of the World Ma!' ending. Here we see that Dobbs, even at the beginning is a rather pathetic man who has been beaten down by life. He still has a few shreds of common decency left, enough to forge a tenuous friendship with Curtin and a partnership with Howard. The thought that his ship has finally come in through the acquisition of gold becomes his undoing. He expects life to take it away from him and figures, wrongly, that his partners are the biggest threat to his salvation. His growing paranoia separates him from them and leaves him vulnerable to the bandits who fulfill his expectation of doom. He does a despicable thing but is a pathetic, almost sympathetic character who is in no way similar to the gangsters Bogie played in the previous decade. Look at the careers of Gable, Tracy, Cooper, Cagney, Fonda, Stewart or any of the others and you'll not find a single Fred C. Dobbs.</fullReview>

We come to know these three men as real people and become involved with what they are doing and what happens to them.The theme is simple: there is something more valuable than gold. But the way the theme is presented to us is the real art. Consider the scene around the campfire which is followed by the scene in the Indian village. These two simple settings present the theme without turning it into a sermon.The plot is probably ancient. Chaucer used it in one of the CANTERBURY TALES.

		<shortDescription>Great psychological exploration, with a brilliant performance from Bogie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a great deal to recommend THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE: the names in the cast, of course (including Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston); the writer/director (John Huston); the plot (three gold prospectors brave the land, bandits and one another to seek their fortune in the hills of Mexico); or simply word of mouth (it's one of the best-loved films of all time, and for good reason). These are all wonderful reasons to catch the film. For myself, I find two in particular that stand out, the first of which is the wonderfully observed, carefully executed psychological journey on which the main character Fred Dobbs (Bogart) embarks when he and his buddy Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join old experienced gold-prospector Howard (Huston) on a new prospecting trip. The changes in his character are gradual but shocking, as he becomes increasingly more paranoid and suspicious of his partners. This is further complicated by the appearance on the scene of James Cody (Bruce Bennett), whose desperation to strike gold becomes clear following his death. But Dobbs becomes horrifyingly cold and unfeeling, even rejoicing when Howard is brought away to a Mexican village and leaves the 'goods' with himself and Curtin. The final denouement is painful to watch but true and not at all pat--in fact, it's a great Huston ending, realistic but also self-conscious, particularly at the end with Howard and Curtin realising that if they've lost anything, it's nothing compared to what Dobbs has lost. A good, simple message.The other reason to watch this film is most certainly Bogart's lead performance. His lined, extraordinary face conveys emotion like few others can, and simply calls to the camera for attention. Little wonder that Huston loved working with Bogie so much--Bogie's face, creased in non-sinister joy, or twisted with crazed suspicion, is truly one for the camera. His work in this film is exceptional as well: we believe his descent into madness, just as we accept his rough but amiable pleasantness before he gets enticed by the prospect of striking it rich. We can't help being revulsed by the sea-change in the man, but we can't help feeling sorry for this man, so generous and friendly in the beginning, whose corruption through gold is so scary and complete. It's truly a fabulous performance.So, for these two reasons and a host of others previously mentioned, THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE comes very highly recommended. It's a cracking film, suspenseful and funny with a great score as well. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MOVIE MAGIC!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I really add about this film classic? It has a great story, a great cast, and some of the most memorable moments ever filmed in glorious black and white. The story is at heart about the nature of man, and its message is two-fold. First, that man is very capable of being consumed by greed and self-interest, as represented by the character so convincingly played by Humphrey Bogart. Second, that man is also a creature capable of honesty, wisdom, and integrity, as represented in the characters of Curtain and Howard. Many people see this film only as a condemnation of mankind but it is really a very honest depiction of the forces of good and evil within each of us and the whole issue of individual choice. Philosophy aside, don't miss this film. There are so many highlights such as the famous scene in which banditos face Bogart and his pals and Alphonse Bedoya utters the famous line about "badges, badges, we don't need no stinkin' badges." Walter Huston gives a gem of a performance as a wily prospector who has seen it all.....the effects of gold on man and the hardships caused by questing for gold. Pure movie magic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another hugely overrated John Huston film: plays like a comic-book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first hour-and-a-half are not without faults here and there, but quite entertaining nonetheless. But once the trio decides to quit digging, the film deteriorates rapidly; from then on far-fetched and annoying plot-devices abound. For example, the little episode where Huston Sr. heals a Mexican boy; this entire scene was shot with too much pomp: the superior white man cures the savage child, while the entire village looks on, with the village lights shimmering with a divine glow - all this accompanied by glorious Hollywood music. Silly. Then Huston is forced to stay with the villagers as their "thanks" for curing the boy; John Huston uses an old cliché of natives threatening to use force when their wishes for hospitality aren't met. (A plot-device I'd use only in a comic-book.) A little later Bogart makes it crystal-clear that he: a) has gone crazy, and b) will kill Holt to get all the gold. Holt, in spite of this overwhelming evidence, takes no other measure to deal with this dire situation other than to take Bogart's bullets away from him. Eventually Holt falls asleep and Bogart injures him, thinking he had killed him. Now, I don't care how noble Holt's character is supposed to be in this Tinseltown fairy-tale, but there is no way in hell that Aany reasonable person would have not bumped off Bogart, or at least tied him up, or something like that.The film presents us with three gold-diggers whose characterizations aren't bad, but one of them is insane and evil, while the other two are good and nice; there is no in-between, no grey area, just movie (or comic-book) stereotypes. Black and white. Huston, Sr. is far too understanding and patient; he gives his wise-old-man speeches on a regular basis, but this is forgivable. However, what isn't forgivable is the ease with which he takes the news that Bogart tried to kill Holt and took all the gold. Huston, Sr. even shows UNDERSTANDING for why Bogart acted this way! Again: Aany reasonable person would have been very upset, to say the least - even the old man with his I've-seen-it-all-before attitude. Makes one wonder who is more insane: Bogart or the goodie-two-shoes Holt and Huston, Sr? At the end, when no one gets the gold (how very symbolic...), Huston, Sr. even laughs at the idea that they lost all of it! To make things even more annoying, Holt joins in, after staring at the old geezer in bewilderment.I find it ridiculous that the Mexican bandits who killed Bogart didn't recognize the gold; they mistook it for sand and threw it away. But why would anyone carry dozens of bags of sand in the middle of a desert?! Huston would have us believe that Mexicans (or Mexican bandits) are this dumb. Not very PC...The kind of nonsense that takes place in the latter parts of this movie would never be tolerated in a modern movie by any critic, good or bad. But old movies are like little children: they get away with almost anything.I like Bogart much better when he isn't playing gangsters or detectives. However, his portrayal of insanity is not without typical 30s and 40s touches of naivety; this may be the director's fault, not Bogart's, especially in view of the fact that it was Huston who wrote (or adapted) those monologues that Bogart has when contemplating his next moves; these scenes come off very comic-book-like, with the difference that movies don't have balloons so Bogart had to speak his thoughts out loud. Holt is the most convincing in the cast. Huston, Sr. is a motor-mouth actor who could have challenged even Cagney to a duel to find out who the fastest mouth in the West was. There were moments where I wished that Huston's machine-gun-fire line-deliveries had been subtitled. He is likable enough, but occasionally acts in the sort of semi-silly manner, typical of the 30s, 40s and 50s.The worst acting came from the character, early in the film, who didn't want to pay Bogart and Holt. Which brings me to the fight these three had in a bar: this is one of the most strangely choreographed fight-scenes I've ever seen. The fight looks totally unconvincing and lacks "logic". But Huston is known for that; just check out the silly fights in "Across the Pacific".Perhaps Huston's overblown reputation has something to do with his larger-than-life persona. People say he looked and talked like God, commanded respect. Unlike his movies, that elicit unintentional laughs.If you're interested in reading my "biographies" of Bogart, Huston, and other Hollywood people, contact me by e-mail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE is movie about greed, contempt and passions. Authentic location, phenomenal atmosphere, almost perfect scenery and exceptionally convincing acting elements of the film on which it is necessary to pay attention. This movie is without a doubt one of the best adventure westerns. Few of them. It's a fact.The nature of the film is not realistic, I'd rather say that is magical. Human relationships in the film are more than realistic. The richness of the human character in this case act incompatible. The hunt for gold leads to a collision of two civilizations. Ironically, the lack of knowledge creates a more natural effect. Greed, contempt and passion in each of the protagonists can be seen individually.Although I think this movie quite intelligent, I am impressed with his pace.Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs, extremely shocking role. Bogart was one of my favorite actors. The character that is rotten from the start. We have a chance to see the physical, moral and psychological decline of one character in the film. In the end, greed and contempt destroying all human in it. Excellent performance, at times I was stunned.Walter Huston as Howard Probably the most important character in the story. A brace or symbol. In certain moments of passion and philosophy of knowledge. The character who humorously touching human consciousness and virtues. Tim Holt as Bob Curtin He is a visible change in the character. I never would have described as the villain. He is soon honest, but positive figure. Character that will satisfy any change that is better in the current situation in which he lives.It is not gold. Character and raw nature is. Gold dust, which the wind carried away. Human virtue that man keeps to himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart's best - and that includes 'Casablanca'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' might be the crown jewel in the filmographies of John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and cinematographer Ted McCord, the latter being responsible for some of the sharpest, most inspired cinematography I've ever seen. (The only film from the era to challenge it, in my opinion, is Powell and Pressburger's 'Black Narcissus'.) What makes this one of my favourite films is its perfect balance of technical excellence and rich storytelling. To say too much would be to spoil the film, but I cannot help but commend the narrative style of this film. Every now and then, I see a title which promises one story and delivers something else: Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Neil Jordan's 'The Crying Game' and Spielberg's 'A.I.' are among the films most famous for narrative curveballs, but I think 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is one of the most effective. A large part of the reason this works so well is because of the man who probably brought the film's attention to you: Humphrey Bogart. Prior to watching this film, I didn't think that the performances of the 'Casablanca' icon differed too greatly; I knew that he was an outstanding actor, but his characters could generally be described as 'romantic' and 'cynical'. My opinion changed as I watched 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', as Bogart outstandingly portrays a character gripped by paranoia, greed and desperation, and I would confidently say that it is one of his best performances. However, my review thus far may have created the impression of this film being a one-man show; it isn't, as Walter Huston attests with his Oscar-winning supporting act. When you combine a great cast with one of Hollywood's most acclaimed directors, you probably anticipate an above-average viewing experience; if you haven't yet seen 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', you're in for an excellent two hours.</fullReview>

Walter Huston is just a treat to watch. One of the last great roles in his impressive career. Humphrey Bogart has what I think is his best non-heroic role here as the scummy Fred C. Dobbs. Tim Holt is saddled with a less meaty part than his two co-stars but still manages to deliver a great turn. Huston's script and direction are excellent. Max Steiner's score is terrific. There are so many wonderful scenes in this one. Of course, everybody remembers the "stinking badges" scene and the famous climax. It's a brilliant movie that stands among the best of its time.

		<shortDescription>One Of American Cinema's Greatest Triumphs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterwork of outstanding direction, terrific screenplay &amp; brilliant performances, a highly fascinating but equally unsettling illustration of poverty, desperation, greed &amp; its corrupting power, and still retaining all its potency despite being nearly 70 years old, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of American cinema's finest works that not only ranks amongst the best films of the 1940s but is one of the greatest movies ever made.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is set in Mexico during the 1920s and follows two down-on-their-luck Americans who meet an old prospector and convince him to help them mine for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Reluctant at first, the old-timer eventually agrees to the deal and while they do succeed in finding what they were looking for, all of it is threatened when greed begins to influence them.Written &amp; directed by John Huston, the film wastes no time in setting up its premise and the main plot surfaces real quick. The theme of greed &amp; its corrupting nature is addressed in an effective manner, the arcs of each of the three primary characters is elegantly handled, and the story only gets more intense as it nears its end, which in itself is a masterstroke that has a lot to say about the unpredictability of life &amp; the whole absurdity of our constant effort to control it.The cast comprises of Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt &amp; Walter Huston (John Huston's father) and all three of them chip in with commendable performances. Bogart brings a wide range of emotions to his flawed character and his degeneration is this story's core element. Holt does well with what he is given but it's Huston who turns out to be the most impressive of the three and effortlessly steals the show with his calm, charismatic yet balanced rendition of his character.On an overall scale, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is an expertly directed, deftly written, smartly photographed, tightly edited &amp; wonderfully scored cinema whose legacy hasn't been diminished by the test of time for it continues to be as entertaining, enlightening &amp; rewarding today as it was back during its time of release, keeps a firm grip on its aura of doubt &amp; suspense throughout its runtime, and remains a triumphant example of its genre. A timeless treasure in every sense of the word, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a definite must for every film lover out there. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superior Study of Greed: An All-Time Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mexican Revolution of 1910 is long over, as our story commences in Tampico, Mexico in 1925. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), a scruffy, unshaven American drifter, spends some of his last handout on a lottery ticket sold by a persistent Mexican boy. Meanwhile he is able to latch onto a backbreaking oil-rigging job. Dobbs teams up with Curtin (Tim Holt), another American drifter, after they get cheated out of their hard-earned wages by their shaky boss Pat McCormick (Barton MacLane). The two transients catch up with McCormick and get their money after giving the swindler a well-deserved beating. While staying in "El Oso Negro" flophouse Dobbs and Curtin meet up with Howard (Walter Huston), a wiry and tooth deficient old man who talks about prospecting for gold. Says Howard: "Gold in Mexico? Why sure there is. Not ten days from here by rail and pack train there's a mountain waiting' for the right guy to come along . . ." Howard though, grizzled but wise, warns the others that gold does make one ravenous, makes one want more and more. Dobbs says, "It wouldn't be that way with me. I swear it wouldn't. I'd take only what I set out to get ($5,000), even if there was still a half a million dollars worth lying around waiting' to be picked up." Right after Dobbs is told by the Mexican boy that he holds the wining lottery ticket (200 pesos). Dobbs gives the boy his ten percent cut. Stricken with gold fever, the three then pool their resources to buy provisions and mining materials; Dobbs has provided the larger share. The adventurers then head for the Sierra Madre Mountains to search for gold ore. After hard work they strike it rich. The gold accumulates, but Dobbs cannot adjust to his new wealth as his paranoia begins to manifest itself. He becomes insistent that the three prospectors begin to split their gold three ways. Also, instead of being content with his $25,000 share of the gold, he demands that they continue mining for more. Eventually the total treasure amounts to $100,000. Following the men's campsite from town is an American, Cody (Bruce Bennett), who wants to be part of the small group; he refuses to leave the camp. Weighing their options, the three decide to kill the stranger, but before acting out they are approached by a gang of Mexican bandits, led by Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya). Previously Gold Hat was unsuccessful in attempting to hold up the Tampico-Durango train that the prospectors were riding; their bullets helped repel the bandidos. In an exciting shootout at the camp, the bandits sustain additional losses and are again driven off, but Cody is killed. Resuming their trip to Durango, the trio is approached by some local Indians who ask for help in saving the life of a young boy who nearly drowned and remains unconscious. Howard goes along with the Indians; his artificial respiration and wiles indeed revive the boy. Meanwhile Dobbs and Curtin move ahead and plan on meeting with Howard in town. Without Howard's wisdom, the camaraderie breaks down because of Dobbs increasing mistrust: he believes that Curtin wants the gold for himself. This happens despite the fact that both Howard and Curtin had helped save Dobb's life on different occasions earlier. Curtin is just trying to hold on while Dobbs, already corrupted, becomes devoured by greed. His self-indulgence turns to madness as he begins to hear noises in the night. Alone as he staggers under the sweltering desert sun, he becomes desperate for a precious drink of water. Feverishly gulping precious liquid at a muddy water hole, Dobbs doesn't notice the ominous shadow of Gold Hat creeping up behind him. Dobbs is truly the tragic performer brought down precisely by his flaws. The ending is truly ironic with gold blowing back into the hills of its origin while we hear the echoing laughter of Howard. Because of his good deed, he will be cared for life by his new Indian friends. Yes, he was certainly the prudent old man, and even more inexplicably, will never have need of the lost gold. Set for life, he generously gives Curtin the proceeds of the sale of the burros, tools, and hides. Maybe Curtin even finds traces of the gold dust around the equipment. Carefully observe that scene near the end, after Hobbs is murdered. Gold Hat and the two survivors of his gang go into town to sell Dobbs' burrows and "hides." After someone spots a special brand on one of the animals, a boy notifies the Federales while people in the marketplace stall and surround the thieves. The robbers are quickly rounded up and turned over to the police who summarily execute them on the spot. Note that the entire dialogue is in Spanish, but is so well filmed that we know exactly what is going on. No English need be spoken. John Houston has told his story visually, a high art form.Shooting entirely on location, Huston won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay and Director, while his father Walter won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The feature was nominated for the Oscar for Best Film, but lost out to Hamlet. Huston shows superb character development, especially in the transformation of Dobbs. Before our eyes, Dobbs has changed from a fairly reasonable fellow into a nervous paranoid, and finally into an insanely avaricious madman capable of killing his friend. Note that glint in his eyes while Howard weighs out the gold and again when he lies down next to the campfire determined to stay awake. By the way, that is a very young Robert Blake as the Mexican boy who sells lottery tickets in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make Sure You Find John Huston's 'Treasure' Trove!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre tells the tale of two small-time drifters ? the short-tempered, glutton for pleasure Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and the easygoing Bob Curtin (Tim Holt). Both have been cheated out of hard-earned wages by a fraudulent employer, and when they corner him in a bar, they beat him so savagely that it seems pointless to hang around town. When they take lodging in a 50-centavo common room-style hotel, the seasoned, wisecracking Howard (Walter Huston) talks about treasure in the mountains as a way to make a sizable profit. The three down-and-out gold prospectors, hitherto slumming in Tampico, venture into the eponymous mountain range and strike the mother lode. But soon, trouble starts brewing as Dobbs finds his altruistic view of wealth transformed, grows avaricious and becomes completely conquered by his murderous suspicions towards the other two men, till everything they've worked for and accumulated is jeopardized.The simple tale of the Freudian triangle (that ultimately endures 10 months of hardship at the hands of mother nature and, to varying extents, each other) in the Mexican desert seems lifted straight out of archetypal myths, with the tragic Dobbs functioning as the moral lynch-pin - ultimately unlikable but achingly human in his weaknesses. Huston's crackerjack screenplay is a study in karmic justice; tragic in its portrayal of the inevitable crumbling of one's conscience in the face of fortune. Shot largely on location, the film posits its characters against the unforgiving immensity of their surroundings (sun-blasted high chaparral landscape, usually desolate, except for the three central characters), rendering their efforts almost pathetically sublime. Decades since its release, the performances by the three leads continue to exert a raw moral power. Bogart goes full-tilt in a bold, unapologetic turn as the unhinged Dobbs. He exhibits a brilliant level of nuance as he changes from a bum down on his luck to a man filled with paranoia and lust for money. Holt makes a sturdy counterweight to Dobbs' excesses. But it is Huston Sr. who holds his own as the wise old buzzard, flanking Bogart's bravura paranoia. He may have a bit of a wacky side, but that facade belies a capable and wise core. He infuses his character with such energy and charisma that he forces everyone into the background whenever he's on screen.The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a clever study of the essential existential hopelessness and loneliness of the avaricious man. Partly realistic, partly poetic, fully moral, this deservingly canonized behemoth is one of the relatively few films that transcend the medium to become a mandatory viewing experience for anyone that identifies themselves as a human being, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invigorating adventure about the tests of character in the familiar Western landscape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently Paul Thomas Anderson watched this film frequently throughout the making of There Will Be Blood, and I can see how that this might have got him into the necessary mindset ? sweltering desolate landscapes with small pockets of civilisation that sit like mirages in the expanse, the lifestyle of finding your fortune or wait until you die, and the drive of hunger and greed that both films share. This isn't a film about gold so much as it is about the people who seek it and how the fantastical material pursuit affects character. Fred Dobbs is no Daniel Plainview, but both of them travel down a road to the worst of their humanity. Dobbs is a Bogart I didn't expect. This was my first experience of him, and cornerstone of American acting and cultural icon such as he is, the image I had of him in mind was more one of nobility and bravado. The sentiment of Rick Blaine is not welcome here. From the moment we're introduced to Dobbs, he's washed up, desperate, scrounging for meals and for work. But this is Bogart, and he's got a hardened edge to him. In that sharp equine face, there's an eagerness for adventure. But instead of that, he gets conned out of a pay check for doing back-breaking labour in the intense heat. It's an inhospitable world, where self-preservation is the ultimate concern.I like the languid Mexican town, Tampico, which the film and its characters initially dwell in, struggling to find a way out. It's sort of like a Casablanca; not a destination that you choose, but a place in which you end up. Except this little Oasis doesn't have that beating heart of optimism, romance, or solidarity. The only common ground the people find here is their need for their next monetary fix. Dobbs meets another American in the same tired situation as him, a man named Curtin (Tim Holt) who counterbalances his roughness and edginess with a more relaxed, take-it-as-it-comes personality, and when they eventually decide on their quest of gold and shake their hands in bargain, you just know which one of them is going to hold up their end of the deal. But it's how you get there of course, not necessarily where you're going.There's a wonderful saloon brawl early on in the film, when Dobbs and Curtin confront the man who cheated them out of their pay, and it's an uneven and almost pathetic display of flailing limbs and thrown weight that is interesting to watch, because it ignores the standard of a quick and easy fight that usually ends in some cheap retribution, and thereby kind of sets the tone for the film; that in this Western world, things can be unfair and bloody and one has to go to uncomfortable lengths to protect or pursue your interests. The third adventurer, Howard, is a delicious performance by Walter Huston and he plays that wizened yet giddy old man perfectly; he's the type of character that can impart sage advice and dance and click his heels simultaneously, so it's something to relish in. So the three men all provide interesting counter-points to each other, with Howard as a reflection of the hardened selfishness of Dobbs and the compassion and loyalty of Curtin, yet neither entirely either one. He is an old man who has been through more than these two men combined, and still reached this far. He admits at one point that had he been younger he might have actually succumbed to the temptation to betray his partners. Wikipedia describes this as neo-western, and however credible that may be, as these weird categorisations are often convoluted and obtuse, it is definitely not incorrect, as this is not a typical, romanticised Western, where everything hero prevails and everything is right in the world. Yet it is not an 'anti-western' like Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, where there is no hope or unconditional love in the world and everyone's lives are subject to the whims of nature and man, entirely out of their control. This film has a fairly neat, melodramatic conclusion where the characters reflect on preceding events and reach some sort of realisation in their lives (two other films, both of which I love and were coincidentally also released in the same year as this, 'Drunken Angel' and 'Rope', include this type of ending) and the heroes, if we wish to restrict them to a simple title, do prevail, and the bad guys do die, and everyone does, arguably, get their just reward, but this conclusion is earned rather than forced, as there is real human conflict to get there. The actual gold-procuring part of the film in which the three men live on the mountain for however long reminded me, oddly, or not so oddly, of Brokeback Mountain. In writing that I realise that it may seem my mind has wandered to stupid and immature territory, but I like making odd and tenuous connections with things. Both films have their most consequential moments in the isolated natural landscapes of their respective western worlds, in which their characters become their truest selves. In Brokeback, the two men are alone, herding, in these gorgeous sweeping vistas, and they are in the heart of their Western, slowly drawing closer together but realising this can't happen back home. Here, the men are in a rough, harsh landscape and become more suspicious of each other. They elect to kill a man who insists on working with them, because they can't summon the necessary trust as their energies are consumed entirely by their fortunes. The fortune is gold of course, and we realise, in a concise moral conclusion like those at the end of movies released in 1948, that when man reaches gold, the gold often reaches the worst of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Character Actors...and No Stinking Badges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since "Greed," I have loved movies about losers who destroy themselves and others. This is a classic example of the worst of that term as three men try to face off against forces over which they have little control. It's a little like an early "Deliverance" where the paranoia and fear and, yes, greed, conspire to take away what could have been quite lucrative. The performances, for me, of Bogart, and particularly Walter Huston, in a smaller role, make this worthwhile. This is the prototype for the Mexican bandito with his grin and his disregard for human life. The confrontation has become the basis for parody. The concluding scene is priceless with Bogart's facial expressions and the utter dismay it produces. So much has been said about this. Enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John and Walter Huston Strike Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening says it's Valentine's Day, 1925 in hot Tampico, Mexico. Down-on-his-luck and disorderly American drifter Humphrey Bogart (as Fred C. Dobbs) teams up with likewise poor, but fair-minded Tim Holt (as Bob Curtin) for some part-time construction work. Cheated out of their wages, Mr. Bogart and Mr. Holt meet wizened old prospector Walter Huston (as Howard) in a flophouse and are intrigued by his stories. After Bogart buys a winning lottery ticket from pushy young Robert Blake (as a Mexican teenager), the three men head out to the Sierra Mountains and find a fortune in gold. In order to survive and make it out with their claim, the trio must survive Mexican bandits, Native South American Indians and good old-fashioned greed..."The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is deservedly famously for two very big reasons. First, the starring presence of Bogart, one of Hollywood's greatest golden age stars. Second, the teaming of director John Huston with his acting father Walter Huston. The amazing father/son team attracted immense critical acclaim and won most of the industry's "Best Director" and "Supporting Actor" awards for the year. The overlooked third man, Tim Holt, also performed exceptionally...Director Huston's attention is not always on Holt. At times, he is merely told where to walk and stand in the film's frame. One of Holt's stumbles warrants no re-take. Yet, when he acts, Holt is equal or greater to his more illustrious co-stars. The film peaks after Holt's village visit. It unravels with Dobbs' sanity, which may be appropriate. Yet, with no warning, the senior Huston miraculously becomes a highly-skilled doctor. And, we are led to believe indigenous bandits mistake gold grains for ordinary sand being bagged to make animal hides heavier for sale to locals. Still, from the nighttime campsite appearance of interloper Bruce Bennett (as James Cody) to the reading of his wife's letter, "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is sheer gold.******** The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1/24/48) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, Tim Holt, Bruce Bennett</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly a great artistic endeavor, a universal moral tale, to be appreciated by all people from every country, still relevant today. It is also one of my favorite films. Intelligent, extremely well directed, scripted, edited and acted, with some superb photography, plus Max Steiner's score. I rank Walter Huston's performance as one of the best ever. (I also love his Mr. Scratch in "All That Money Can Buy"). His son John was one of the most literate, gifted directors in Hollywood during the 40's and 50's (qualities he didn't seem to keep up later). It is a testament to how efficient Huston's direction and script was that he managed to tell the whole story, with well-developed characters, fights and shoot-outs, travel to a remote place, bandits, psychology and mistrust, human nature, an unexpected intruder, visits to an Indian village, and scenes at a Mexican pueblo, in just over 2 hours. One measure of greatness for me is the innumerable times I'm able to see the film, another the many memorable scenes, shots and details, mostly dealing with Howard: Howard's explanation on the effect of gold in men, the fight at the cantina, the look of Howard when Dobbs and Curtin shake hands and agree to go prospecting for gold, the whole sequence with Howard's dancing when he finds the gold, ending with him pointing to the mountain: "Up there!" (one of the greatest scenes ever); the cut to Howard looking at Dobbs when he first mentions dividing the gold; the boy's revival; Howard looking back when he's forced to go back with the Mexican Indians; Dobbs turning suddenly mad by the campfire; Howard's laugh at the end. Now be advised: this is a man's film, inhabited by tough men, ambitious, flawed, sometimes dumb, who respond to reason but have no qualm to lie or kill if necessary. John Huston's oeuvre has little place for women, and this film is no exception, with no prominent female role, mostly leisure girls, except for the reference to Cody's wife, the classic ideal woman. Even when the 3 adventurers discuss what they intend to do with their money, when it comes to women they keep silent. Be also advised that this film originated a somewhat mythic view in Hollywood of the country of Mexico, as someone else wrote: "The Mexico portrayed in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and then subsequently promulgated in later Westerns is that of a mythic space with four distinctly separate parts, which incorporate the four main stereotypes of Mexico at that time: the city, starkly divided between the corrupt wealthy and the downtrodden poor; the primitive pueblo which heralds simple justice under one person, such as a mayor; the wilderness camp in which no law exists save for guns; and the village, an Eden-like paradise."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps John Huston's most acclaimed film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was a pure and great adventure film. The movie tells the story of two American men named Fred Dobbs (played by Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (played by Tim Holt) who try to find work in Mexico by trying to convince a prospector named Howard (played by Walter Huston who won an academy award for the performance) by mining gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. The film goes on a par with some of the bet adventure films ever made, as well as very entertaining throughout. Director John Huston, and star Humphrey Bogart have came a long way with successes such as The Maltese Falcon, Key Largo, and The African Queen as well as this film the best out of all the films I have seen that they did together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is the master of all genres. He shows a character's strengths and faults so realistically you forget you're watching a movie. In this film his fortunes go from down to up to the ultimate demise. The suspicions of his character Dobbs are almost too disturbing to bear. Good versus evil is evident and shocking. Still Dobbs is human and the viewer can identify with him. The other prospectors are portrayed as almost saintly. The bad guys are shown as savages who don't even appreciate the importance of a lawman's badge. The ending where the good guys end up with nothing for all the trouble they went through is a letdown. Natives are depicted as ignorant of basic medical knowledge and the White Man has to save them. This wouldn't go on in a modern movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's The All-Time Number One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many reasons why this masterwork of art is the greatest film ever made but there are two major ones. First, it is the best combination of creative expression and realism ever put on film. Second it touches on more genres (adventure, character study, drama, murder, psychology, cultures and social values) than any other film. All these genres are wrapped around the central theme of GREED. The other reasons are, of course, named Huston, Bogart, Huston and Traven. The great John Huston outdid himself with both his screenplay and direction in this film which he took many years to undertake and finish. His incomparable scene making is displayed in monumental glory here. Huston insisted on much of the film being made on location in Mexico (extremely rare in Hollywood at the time) and WB was in the end despite the cost, thrilled when they saw the outcome. Huston's dad, Walter was nothing short of sensational in this, his career performance. Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs was perhaps only topped by Capt. Queeg among his many singularly memorable fictional film characters. Huston as the supreme screen writer he was, worked with the book's mysterious author B. Traven and stayed close to the book's story. This film was nothing like Hollywood had ever produced up to that time and was more like an "arty-Euro" film. There were two injustices inflicted on the appreciation side of this amazing film experience. Neither Bogart or Bedoya were even nominated by the academy for their riveting and unique performances. Needless to say, this is the number one "must see" in American film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb movie. Every inch the all-time classic it is made out to be. John Huston doesn't put a foot wrong in a movie that it on the surface a Western- / adventure-epic, but deep down it is so much more than that. It is about greed, and how wealth corrupts, and what is important in life.Even ignoring the deeper meaning, it is an excellent movie. Brilliant plot. Enthralling, not at all predictable and incredibly engaging. You are lead on a continuous, unflagging, adventure, where you care what happens to the characters, but have no idea how things will turn out. Humphrey Bogart didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance, but he deserved one. For once he isn't necessarily a good guy, and his portrayal of Dobbs' descent into paranoia and madness are incredible to behold. Superb performance by Bogart, and possibly his best. Only Casablanca, and maybe The Caine Mutiny, comes close, I think.Good support from Tim Holt and Walter Huston. Walter Huston won Best Supporting Actor for his performance, which would make for a rare feat - a son directing his father to an Oscar-winning performance.Surely one of the greatest movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart's journey as a leading man started with The Maltese Falcon and reached its pinnacle in The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre. That's not just because his performance was so terrific. What's impressive is that Bogie goes from an ultra-cool detective in Falcon and a noble Nazi-killer in Casablanca to a crazy loser in Sierra Madre. He didn't coast by playing lovable heroes. He was willing to look terrible and to play a despicable human being in a character-actor kind of way.Fred C. Dobbs (Bogart) is a jobless American in Tampico, Mexico, begging for food money. He pools what money he has with that of a friend (Tim Holt as Bob Curtin) and they head out with Howard (Walter Huston) for the titular mountain to find gold. Howard has been on many such journeys and knows this isn't going to turn out well. It doesn't take more than few months for Dobbs' paranoia to cloud his vision. Before long, he's hiding his gold and proving he'll do anything to protect his burgeoning fortune.Don't worry, "Badges? I don't have to show you any steenking badges", I haven't forgotten about you! Yup, this is the movie with that quote. People love (mis)quoting the line, but they shouldn't overlook the subtext: there's no law up in the wild Mexican mountains. Then again, the real villain is not a gang of baddies. It's Bogie. Dobbs' alienation of his friends not only proves how paranoid he is, but in doing so, he puts his gold and his life in serious danger from steenking bandits.The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre was highly ranked on both the 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists released by the American Film Institute...and rightly so. It's nearly 66 years old and it holds up remarkably well. Writer/director John Huston made several fine films, but this was his peak. It's one of the best pictures of the 1940s and its dirty influence continues to this day, with Paul Thomas Anderson and Breaking Bad's exec producer Vince Gilligan citing it as highly influential of their recent projects. This one is rough, but for all the right reasons. Great, great movie.If you found some gold in this quick take of the flick, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 38-minute Treasure Of The Sierra Madre 'cast...and many others.

		<shortDescription>When dreams turn to dust blown away in the desert wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desertThree men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here? not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!"A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate? that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.</fullReview>

Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is the true treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.</fullReview>

They fight the elements, bandits, other Americans and even each other to try and make their fortune. This is a plot-focused film, a true adventure. But it steps beyond that: it becomes a character analysis, with themes of greed, betrayal, and suspicion: all in the desert of Mexico. It starts strong, ends strong, and is a bull the whole way through.Like Sunset Blvd., a film from 1950, 'Treasure' is made during the transition period between 'old' and 'new' cinema. There are more cuts and the film feels more dynamic. The film is extraordinarily well made, and is visually fantastic being filmed on location in Mexico, a first. The imposing musical score is also great.I think this is the best Humphrey Bogart film; both in his performance and the overall film. My view of him was turned upside down in this film. The Rick Blaine/ Philip Marlowe character is gone, replaced by a bearded, rugged, unclean bum who asks for money from tourists, and has a really, really creepy laugh. Dobbs. His development is incredible, showing his doubts and delusions without making us have to infer anything. The other two in the treasure hunting trio hold their own next to Dobbsy. Howard (Walter Huston) is an eccentric old-timer, and we are never quite sure what his agenda is, or if he even has one. Curtin (Tim Holt) is the straight man of the three, but is just as grey as them. Together there are three great performances of three great characters in a great scenario. Although I have to say the head bandit is a tad too comical.The plot makes for a great film, treasure hunters in Mexico. There's great dialogue, scenery, fights (fistfights still from the old film era though), and suspense. This western noir has a great pace. There's a lot of character foreshadowing, and then it wraps up with a quietly brilliant ending, though it might not be so astounding today.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was much better than I could have expected- it's a strong, constantly engaging film. The plot is solid and well told, with developed ideas and characters. And a very, very memorable Humphrey Bogart. 8.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although John Huston's directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay, winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that makes "Treasure of The Sierra Madre" the classic film that it is. Beginning and ending with Walter Huston's award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter's portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.When, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Movie About Greed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a film written and directed by John Huston, a feature film adaptation of B. Traven's 1927 novel of the same name, in which two impecunious Americans Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) during the 1920s in Mexico join with an old- timer, Howard (Walter Huston, the director's father), to prospect for gold. The old-timer accurately predicts trouble, but is willing to go anyway.John Huston's 1948 treasure-hunt classic begins as drifter Fred C. Dobbs ,down and out in Tampico, Mexico, impulsively spends his last bit of dough on a lottery ticket. Later on, Dobbs and fellow indigent Curtin seek shelter in a cheap flophouse and meet Howard, a toothless, garrulous old coot who regales them with stories about prospecting for gold. Forcibly collecting their pay from their shifty boss, Dobbs and Curtin combine this money with Dobbs's unexpected windfall from a lottery ticket and, together with Howard, buy the tools for a prospecting expedition. Dobbs has pledged that anything they dig up will be split three ways, but Howard, who's heard that song before, doesn't quite swallow this. As the gold is mined and measured, Dobbs grows increasingly paranoid and distrustful, and the men gradually turn against each other on the way toward a bitterly ironic conclusion. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superior morality play and one of the best movie treatments of the corrosiveness of greed and this darkly humorous morality tale represents John Huston at his finest.Greed, a despicable passion out of which other base ferments may spawn, is seldom treated in the movies with the frank and ironic contempt that is vividly manifested toward the movie.But nevertheless,it has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Huston don't need no stinkin badges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)Two Americans, played by Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt, are reduced to panhandling in 1920's Mexico, meet up with an old prospector and decide to join together and search for gold. They eventually find gold, but must battle bandits, Mother Nature, and themselves in order to keep it. Bogart's character begins to lose both his trust and his sanity, lusting to possess the entire treasure. Holt's charter Dobbs is also unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners. Huston wins the Academy Award for his portrayal of the steadying force that knows a lot about gold mining and even more about human nature.This is a landmark motion picture. Warner Brothers studio head Jack L. Warner stated that it was "definitely the greatest motion picture we have ever made." The American Film Institute ranked this as the #38 Greatest Movie of All Time in their 1997 poll. In 1948 it was nominated for the Academy Award for best picture, but was beat by Laurence Olivier's Hamlet. While Olivier is considered one of history's greatest actors, and Hamlet is among Shakespeare's finest, Treasure of the Sierra Madre has gone on to surpass Olivier's Hamlet to now be considered to be one of the greatest of all movies. Treasure of the Sierra Madre would win the Oscar for John Huston for Direction and Screen writing, and for his father Walter for best supporting role.While I can see how Laurence Olivier won the Oscar for Hamlet in 1948, I have a hard time understanding how Bogart didn't even warrant a nomination. Bogart's performance still stands as one of the signposts that would point the direction that modern acting would follow. Bogart is sublimely adept at moving between being an affable down on his luck drifting panhandler to a dangerously vicious man consumed by greed. Bogart's plays the early scenes as Fred C. Dobbs by showing benevolence, and he is supportive and encouraging by helping stake the others by putting up a larger amount of money, and speaks in a level headed manner at their plight in the world. Dobbs is consumed by avaricious thoughts, and a big red flag appears when he demands that they divide their gains three ways, every night. Soon they are each hiding their loot, with Bogart becoming increasingly paranoid that the others are going to take his gold, as he progressively loses his sanity. Bogart is more than willing to play the despicable mean spirited role of Fred C. Dobbs. Bogart didn't become a star being a pretty face, and his role here is more ammunition that he is still considered as one of film history's greatest actors. Bogart is fearless in portraying Fred C. Dobb as a selfish, pathetic sick man, equal parts freighted and frightening. His leering paranoia is a wonder, and as he grows increasingly surly, watching Bogart is a treat, probably a little too malevolent for some members of his 1948 audience.The performance by Walter Huston is a masterpiece. It is joyful to watch, and a true film buff will be easily beaming with satisfaction that they are witness to greatness, as Huston breathes life into the old prospector. He bestows the old prospector with unbridled excitement by dancing in a way that would be copied countless times by other similar characters, especially old grizzled character actors in Westerns. Walter Huston's old timer Howard has a knowing twinkle in his eye; he knows the ins and outs of prospecting for gold, from the equipment to the best site that would yield a rich bounty. The Howard character knows human nature, and still goes along for the ride even though he is already well aware of what is about to unfold in the hearts of his companions. Walter Huston is flawless in this role. His maniacal laugh when the turn of events is brought to his attention is bombastic, but in keeping with his understanding of his partners psyche, not much seems to surprise the wise old man, he knew this would happen.John Huston stated that working on this film with his father, and his dad's subsequent Oscar win were among the favorite moments of his life. Upon winning the award Walter responded: "Many years ago.... Many, MANY years ago, I brought up a boy, and I said to him, 'Son, if you ever become a writer, try to write a good part for your old man sometime.' Well, by cracky, that's what he did!" It is s crying shame that Walter would die two years later. On seeing the quality of Walter Huston's performance, Bogart famously stated that "One Huston is bad enough, but two are murder." A finer homage couldn't have been bestowed one of the greatest family contributions to a film. It should also be noted that the other actors did a fine job. Tim Holt is more than serviceable having the unenviable task of trying to keep up with Huston and Bogart. Holt is believable as the third of the prospecting amigos, and needs to do little else than provide support here. The Mexican Bandits are a special treat, and leave the audience wanting more. The bandit in the gold hat seems to be an offish simpleton, until he snarls one of Hollywood's most famous quotes: "Badges? We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges." The quote is iconic, being film histories #36 ranked quote according to the American Film Institute. The lasting appeal of these bandits and their infamous quote has passed into the lexicon of movie buffs, as well as into pop culture consciousness.Bottom Line: I would give this film a 95. It is a solid A, and a 95 is indeed indicative of its worthiness as one of films great achievements. It's a fantastic joy to watch the acting, as both Bogart and Walter Huston provide legendary performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is A Real Treasure from the Sierre Madre ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding film with superb direction from the Oscar winner John Huston. His dad, Walter, gave a gem of a performance as the wise, elderly prospector, and he was rewarded accordingly with a best supporting Oscar for this role.The picture should have won for best film but lost to the very dull "Hamlet." I guess that Hollywood wanted to show how cultured they were.The picture is phenomenal because it shows the poison of greed in our lives. Humphrey Bogart gave a brilliant performance as the greedy prospector, who literally cracks up during his quest for gold. Cheated himself by an unworthy employee earlier in the film,Bogart was at his best, especially in the scenes where he is talking to himself.Irony is used beautifully here to show that greediness cannot triumph. Bruce Bennett, Huston and Tim Holt are in fine form as the prospectors who are decent men and can withstand adversity and cruelty from others.Truly a gem of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre may quite possibly be the greatest movie ever made. Yes, it is that awesome.Every element is either perfect or near-perfect (only the limitations of that era would allow an element to be only "near" perfect).The black and white cinematography is gorgeous. Very crisp and clean, with excellent compositions. Its one of those elements that works so well, because you barely notice the camera-work. This is not flashy like a Scorsese movie, this is subtle and effective.Great music. Not the most memorable score ever, but way above average.The story is absolutely timeless - a grinding, unapologetic and philosophical deconstruction of the most base aspects of humanity; and not a very positive one either. Greed, desire, jealousy, vanity, paranoia are all the key words in describing the issues that the screenplay tackles. The movie also deals with some other concepts like the American work ethic, the pioneering spirit, progress, paradise lost and found, etc etc etc. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. This movie really digs deep into the human experience - raw and harsh at its core. Other movies have dealt with these themes, some effectively some with nothing but clichés. The best of them - There Will Be Blood, Network, Wall Street...are all bastard children of the granddaddy of them all - The Treasure of the Sierra Made.Acting. While Bogey is best known for Casablanca and the Marlowe detective thrillers like The Big Sleep, TTofTSM is the pinnacle of his career. That character embodies all that is great about Bogart's acting talents. The grime, the gruff, the bad attitude, the wicked looks...its all there; Bogey at his best. But.... then there is Walter Huston. This actor steals the show like few actors have ever done before. His performance is not only flawless, it almost breaks the 4th wall - its as if the filmmakers are suddenly staring you right in the face and letting loose on you. Walter Huston - his performance and his character define this film; and elevate it to the next level of absolute greatness. Kudos here must definitely go to the writing. The lines that Huston delivers are devastatingly poignant yet savage. He has some of the best dialogue ever put on film; none of it is dated, in fact it is so modern and ahead-of-the-times that is almost seems out of place for a movie in the 1940's. For a movie almost 70 years old, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre can still hold up against any of the modern classics, in fact it still trounces 99.9% of all movies released today. This film should never be forgotten or brushed aside, it should be put on a pedestal as one of the great works of art of the 20th century!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best acted movies ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this gem when in high school, with two other buddies. It was showing at a local college for free, so being three geeks with nothing else to do, off we went...what we saw, was a movie riddled with scenes that never ever leave you, ever!! Funny, that one of my buddies last name happened to be Curtin (like the Tim Holt character), so for weeks afterward's, whenever the other amigo and myself would run into him, we would just have to yell.."Couiten!....Couiten!!....COUITEN!!!!!" a la the unforgettable scene where Bogart is in a panic, trying to find the erstwhile Tim Holt.Another favorite scene is when Tim Holt, who turned in a very believable, professional performance, sees the Gila monster go under a rock, which just happens to be the hiding place of Bogarts share of the gold. Holt starts to turn the rock over when Bogart sees him and thinks he is stealing his booty. While holding a gun on Holt, and calling him a liar and a thief, Bogart starts to nervously reach under the rock, and Holt says.."Go ahead Dobbs, I want to see this!...they never let go do they Howard? Even if you cut'em in half, they hang on till sundown. But it doesn't matter much to the victim, cause he's already dead...." Just a great scene! Suspense to the max!And something about the scene where the uninvited prospector is killed by bandits, and Holt along with Huston, reads aloud, a letter from his wife they find in his wallet. To see these three, hard bitten men, who only minutes prior were planning to kill this man to protect their secret, now saddened by his death, and clearly moved by the letter, is so poignant, and unexpected, it, along with the music, can move one to tears. I could go on, but those who have seen it know what it is I'm trying to say, and those who haven't....just see it! Walter Huston is worth the effort, to see what a real actor is. For you kids who have heard the "No stinkin badges" line, and are brave enough to watch a black and white movie, yes, this is where it came from....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and the Stinking Badges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two penniless Americans (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt) during the 1920s in Mexico join with an old-timer (Walter Huston, the director's father) to prospect for gold. The old-timer accurately predicts trouble, but is willing to go anyway. The film is fictional, but presents a very realistic scenario: By the 1920s the violence of the Mexican Revolution had largely subsided, although scattered gangs of bandits continued to terrorize the countryside. The newly established post-revolution government relied on the effective, but ruthless, Federal Police, commonly known as the Federales, to patrol remote areas and dispose of the bandits. Foreigners, like the three American prospectors, were at very real risk of being killed by the bandits if their paths crossed. The bandits, likewise, were given little more than a "last cigarette" by the army units after capture, even having to dig their own graves first.The film shows the Americans doing just about anything for money: drilling oil, digging for gold, begging and more. And once gold comes into the picture, the men who once claimed they were not greedy see things differently. Bogart actually goes mad, after he gets greedy and paranoid... during which he encounters a gila monster! The most memorable scene of this film involves the bandits, who don't need any "stinking badges". While the line is much more quotable in "Blazing Saddles", we couldn't have "Blazing Saddles" (or "UHF") without this film... just about everyone, even those who never saw or heard of "Sierra Madre", knows the badges line.Humphrey Bogart's best film is probably "Casablanca", but this one features him in a nice, rough exterior. Yes, sometimes leading men have beards and are covered in dirt. Pretty boys do not stay pretty boys after digging in the hills, or at least that wouldn't be realistic. This film does a fine job trying to "keep it real", so we have to commend Huston not only on his directing, but his wonderful location scouting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold Fever-Golden Age Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can be said about this great classic. Anyone who wants to be known as a classic film buff has to have seen this movie. The movie stars Hollywood legend Humphrey Bogart in one of his most famous roles as Fred C Dobbs a down and out American on the bum in Mexico. Through chance he meets up with two other characters played by Tim Holt and Walter Houston and decide between them to take their chance on prospecting for gold. Walter Houston's character warns the other two of the potential for problems within the trio once gold is found and his warning is right on the mark. They have to overcome not only problems from within but from outsiders too, such as the Mexican bandits who cause havoc where ever they go. It is during an encounter with these bandits that we get one of Hollywood's most famous movie lines. Bogart's character asks a bandit to show him a badge if he is a Federale as the bandit claims. The bandit responds, "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!" This is a great movie from Hollywood's Golden Age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Statement About The Power Of Greed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its obvious warning about the consequences of greed, this film is surprisingly relevant today. True, we no longer suffer from the classic problem of "gold fever." Not many people go out free-lance prospecting anymore, but corporate greed is certainly much in the news and the economic collapse of late 2008 had at least partly at its root the problem of greed. This wonderful classic uses a more traditional setting, but manages to portray the same collapse of civilized behaviour and the problems that arise with simply looking out for Number 1. In this movie, that position is clearly held by Humphrey Bogart's Fred Dobbs, an American drifter in Mexico who hooks up with fellow drifter Curtin (Tim Holt) and "old-timer" Howard (Walter Huston). Together they decide to strike out into the mountains in search of gold, in spite of Howard's warnings about what riches can do to people - and gold they find.The three characters each seem to represent a different aspect of human nature. Howard is past the age of being too concerned with wealth, and seems to treat this more as an adventure, Curtin is the honest one who wants to make sure that everyone gets treated fairly, and Dobbs is the one who catches "gold fever" and becomes increasingly greedy and unbalanced as he contemplates the wealth he can now posses. Bogart's portrayal of the man gradually losing his grip was brilliant, and of the movies I've seen him in I'd rank this near "Casablanca" as his best performance. Director John Huston made excellent use of the setting and developed the story nicely, with Dobbs and Curtin starting the movie as victims of dishonest greed, before having to deal with the temptation themselves. There's also some pretty good actions with local bandits. In the end, Dobbs' decision to give into greed robs them all of the wealth they thought would be theirs, and their reactions to their loss of everything were perfectly in character, Dobbs being murdered by the bandits, Curtin realizing that he really hasn't lost anything, while Howard, thanks to an encounter with some local Indians, discovers more than he could ever have hoped for if he had simply kept his gold.An altogether wonderful couple of hours. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the descent into madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By sheer coincidence, I watched this soon after viewing Werner Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. Two films separated by 60 years, one a documentary the other an adaptation of a novel. The common thread is their insightful portrayal of man descending into paranoia and delusion. Timothy Treadwell is a real-life modern day Fred C. Dobbs. Both men seek glory - one gold, the other protection of bears - and in that quest perceive threats and dangers where none exist. Their delusion also blinds them to the very real threats that isolation and mistrust can cause to prey upon the mind.Bogart is outstanding as the tormented Dobbs, while Huston gives a perfect counter-point performance as the seen-it-all senior who knows the demons Dobbs falls victim to, and the futility of trying to fight them. John Huston's directing is exceptional, the oft-quoted pub-fight scene a statement on the anti-glamourisation of violence; dirty, draining, squalid and animalistic. The screenplay is top class, with the minor character bandit leader Alfonso Bedoya truly fleshed out with some of the best lines. Each episode in the second act appears at a brisk pace - the mine collapse, the lizard, the arrival and demise of Cody, the Indian child, the need for Huston to separate, the betrayal, Dobbs getting his comeuppance. It all flows beautifully and never seems forced or unnatural.The Treasure of the Sierra Made justifiably lives up to the mantle of classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Radix Malorum Est Cupiditas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred Dobbs, a down-on-his-luck American living in Mexico, joins forces with two compatriots, Curtin and Howard, on an expedition to prospect for gold in the mountains. The three are joined by a fourth American, Jim Cody, who is looking for gold in the same area. They do not welcome Cody's presence, so they are faced with a three-way dilemma- either to kill him, or to drive him off (which carries the risk that he will inform the authorities that they are prospecting for gold without the necessary permission) or to take him in as a partner. Just when Dobbs and Curtin are on the point of killing him, they are forced to accept him as an ally when they are all attacked by bandits. They succeed in driving the bandits off, but Cody is killed in the gunfight.Although the film takes place in twentieth-century Mexico, it has much in common with the Western. Like many of the best Westerns it is not simply an adventure story, but also an exploration of moral issues and a study in character. The three men have very different characters and represent three different age-groups, Howard being old, Dobbs middle-aged and Curtin young. Howard is the only one with any previous experience of prospecting- indeed, he has spent most of his life looking for gold. His past adventures have given him a rather jaundiced view of human nature, especially where the prospect of sudden wealth is concerned: "I know what gold does to men's souls". Despite his cynicism, Howard has a conscience and his own moral code- he is the only one of the three who objects to the plan to murder Cody.Dobbs, by contrast, has no conscience whatsoever, and openly boasts of the fact. At first he does not believe that he will be corrupted by gold, but when he and his partners start to find it he quickly realises that he will do anything, including committing murder, to keep his share of the loot. Dobbs's villainy arises from a mixture of greed and paranoia. He is convinced in his own mind that Curtin and Howard are plotting to kill him to steal his gold. He has no evidence of such a plot- indeed, Curtin saved Dobbs's life at the risk of his own when Dobbs was trapped in a collapsing mine. Nevertheless, Dobbs feels no gratitude for this act, and his paranoia even leads him to try and kill Curtin. Curtin himself stands somewhere between Howard and Dobbs on the moral scale. On the one hand, he is capable of altruism and bravery, shown by his rescue of Dobbs. On the other hand, he is quite happy to go along with Dobbs's suggestion that Cody should be killed.B. Traven, the author of the novel upon which the film was based, was a mysterious figure, but was clearly a man of left-wing political sympathies, and "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" has been seen as a socialist parable about the power of wealth to corrupt. This impression is strengthened by the early scenes in which Curtin and Dobbs are defrauded of their wages by a corrupt employer, to whom they deliver a savage beating in revenge. My own view, however, is that John Huston here takes a very bleak view of human nature in general, not merely of human nature under capitalism. There is no positive "message" that human nature could be changed for the better with a change in the economic system.Although it was Huston's father Walter who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Howard, for me the performance that really stood out was that of Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs, a man poisoned by a toxic cocktail of avarice and suspicion. Dobbs, however, is only part of a larger pattern of greed, violence and treachery. There are also the swindling employer, the ruthless bandits and their opponents, the equally ruthless Mexican Government forces whose method of enforcing law and order is to carry out summary executions without trial. Howard, one of the few exceptions to this pattern, symbolically withdraws from civilisation at the end of the film, going off to live among a local Indian tribe. There are a number of memorable episodes throughout the film- Dobbs begging from an American tourist (played by the director himself), Dobbs and Curtin's fight with their employer, Howard's famous dance when they discover gold, the "stinking badges" confrontation with the bandits and the scenes of Dobb's final attempts to return to civilisation- all fitting in with the general pattern. The landscape of the Mexican Sierras, shot in striking black-and-white photography, is as bleak as the film's view of humanity. Unusually for a film of this period it was shot entirely on location, and Huston uses this forbidding landscape to reinforce his pessimistic theme.The theme of the power of greed to corrupt- is an old one. It was old even when Chaucer's Pardoner said:- "My theme is always one, and ever was: Radix malorum est cupiditas".(I have modernised Chaucer's spelling to avoid falling foul of the IMDb spell-checker). The Latin tag is sometimes mistranslated as "Money is the root of all evil", but a more accurate version would be "Greed is the root of all evil". This theme has inspired a number of great works of literature, of which "The Pardoner's Tale" is just one. "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", a powerful and compelling work, is one of the best cinematic treatments of the theme. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart's Best Performance in one of the top 10 films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I just couldn't stop thinking about it and what an experience it was to watch such a magnificent film. Humphrey Bogart, one of my favorite actors plays the role he was born to play in his best performance ever, not to mention John Huston's best as well who has shown us his brilliance in directing 'The Maltese Falcon' in 1941. This is a film about greed and how it can drive you over the edge.The story begins with Bogie as Fred C. Dobbs, an American down on his luck; asking people for money in order to eat a meal. He ends up asking the same person three times which happens to be the director John Huston. Bogie then meets Curtin (Tim Holt) when they're both offered a job but doesn't go as planned. They then meet the old man (Walter Huston) who happens to be an expert in gold digging and this gives them an idea on how to get their hands on some real dough, but nothing is as easy as it looks, especially when dealing with strangers, bandits and insanity while looking out for your share of the gold.This movie has such brilliant performances especially from Bogart and Huston and has a script you will never forget. I think this movie is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and it is defiantly in my list of top 10 favorite films. Winning best supporting actor (Walter Huston), best director, best screenplay, and nominated for best picture which went to 'Hamlet' staring Lawrence Olivier who also won best actor that year. Why this movie didn't win best picture and why Bogart wasn't even nominated for best actor will remain a mystery to me forever.I personally envy the experience of someone who gets to see this movie for the first time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that manages to find hope in the human condition amidst the most brutal reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this AGAIN on Turner Classic Movies (August 5, 2006). For me this is a "benchmark" movie, by which, I mean a movie that you see several times over your lifetime, and each time you draw something new.What is for me, currently most revelatory, is the essential humanity of the Huston character. He is wise, yet is willing to constantly retest his wisdom. He knows all the answers, yet still keeps his eyes open, searching for some thing new.What is worthwhile is to compare this film with Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch". So much of "The Wild Bunch" is derivative from "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre". Watch them back to back, and the commonalities will POP! A major strength of this film is its uncompromising realism. Nothing happens in this film that is not honest and plausible.Also, seeing this movie would not be a bad idea for anyone seeking to invest in the stock market. The basic dynamics are pretty much the same.This is a film that manages to find hope in the human condition amidst the most brutal reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed &amp; Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing film, 'The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre' is perhaps John Huston's best film. It certainly contains one of Humphrey Bogart's best performances as bad guy Fred C. Dobbs, who degenerates into a real psychopath when the lure of gold and riches is upon him. Walter Huston and Tim Holt also head a mostly-male cast in this fantastic parable of greed.This must be one of the most entertaining films of all time. I watched it with some friends of mine who are non-familiar with the classics, and are wary of black-and-white films. They loved it. I think the reason it is so appealing is because there's no throwaway love angle, tacked-on happy ending or gloss added to the production. It's a great adventure story that holds the attention like no other. Huston's direction is amazing. One of the most fluidly directed and photographed films you'll see, this a real 'Treasure' for film fans of any age, sex, religion or race. The story is timeless (one of greed, ambition and the degradation of the human race when one acquires too much of those characteristics) and the screenplay breathtaking. It deserves all the plaudits that are heaped upon it.Bogart is excellent in this film. Fred C. Dobbs must surely be one of cinema's most memorable characters and villains. Walter Huston (yes, John Huston's dad) won the Best Supporting Actor award for his fine work here as Howard, a grizzled old hand at the gold prospecting business. But Bogart wasn't even nominated! That I still find hard to believe...this definitely beats his work for Huston in 'The African Queen'. Holt's performance is also good, showing he was worth more than just B-movie westerns. One could call this a guy's film, but as female I must say it works for everyone. This isn't overtly masculine in the terms of a western/action film, this is more of a psychological study of human nature.Absolutely mesmerizing film.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie won some prizes in 1948 but I'm surprised Humphrey Bogart hasn't got even a nomination. I'd take the risk of saying that this was Humphrey Bogard's best performance in his life (okay, maybe the best one was in Casablanca). The movie is about how gold can change a poor but winsome man into a thorough-paced rascal. Three homeless guys decide to make money by digging for gold in Sierra Madre. In the beginning they are like brothers, help each-other, they work together hard, fight against the ruthless nature and Mexican bandits. But as the weight of gold is rising they start to suspect each-other stealing the other's share of gold... Recommendation: don't bother that this is a black and white, old movie, watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture made 55 years ago still holds up today. With Hollywood running out of plot lines, they are going back to remakes. I doubt that they could improve on this original. Walter Huston deserved every bit of his supporting role Academy Award, but I think that Alphonse Bedoya (Gold Hat) should have also been nominated. He stole the picture with his "We don't need no stinkin' badges" line which has since become a classic. There was no sex, no profanity and little violence in "Treasure" (a no-no in 1948), but you got the point. Hunting for gold will bring out the best and worst in people. Great score by Max Steiner enhances the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's 1948 treasure-hunt classic stars Humphrey Bogart, as Fred C. Dobbs, a down-and-out wage-worker in Mexico who stakes his meager earnings on a gold-prospecting expedition to the Sierra mountains.He's soon joined by a grizzled old prospector, named Howard ( Walter Huston, the director's father) and a young, no-nonsense partner, Curtin (Tim Holt), and when they strike a rich vein of gold, the movie becomes an observant study of human behavior.At its heart the film is really just a superior morality play and one of the best movie treatments of the corrosiveness of greed. For instance, the film easily contrasts the characters: Huston's character, has been through it all before. Curtin is the more naive of the bunch and Dobbs' grows increasingly paranoid and violent over the length of the film: the way you see his burgeoning madness unravel-are the moments that make this film so great.The film also has one hell of an ironic ending.The performances are another thing that really make this film a real classic. Bogart was playing against type, he was not playing his usual romanticized character and he delivers quite possibly the best performance of his entire career.But, it is Walter Huston, who literally steals the entire film, he is a weathered man, who's seen how gold can turn men into monsters. That laugh of his is a laugh for the ages. And that gig he does when they discover the gold. Brilliant.Another great performance comes from Alphonso Bedoya, as the Mexican bandit leader, with his line of "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges!" Another cool thing about the film, was some of the cameos throughout the film. Robert Blake as a boy selling lottery tickets, Ann Sheridan as a prostitute, and non-other than John Huston himself as the ' man in white', the rich man who Dobbs' keeps pestering for money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Hustons and Bogart in a perennial story of money being the root of all evils- even in good men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred Dobbs doesn't have a nickel to his name, at least when he's in the small Mexican village at the start of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. But whatever the situation is, he wants what he can get, and if anyone tries to get in his way he'll let em have it. We see this early one when he and Bob Curtain have to beat it out of a sleazy boss at a construction site to get their earned wages. It's then no surprise that the two of them find it the best idea to take on Howard, an old seemingly-by-gone codger who once was a great prospector, on their ideal trip to look for gold in the mountains of Mexico. But then we start to see a kind of psychological head-trip go on with Dobbs, which makes the Treasure of the Sierra Madre that much more special of a film. The main characters aren't against any very dangerous adversaries- aside from the bandits- and it's not Cowboys and Indians. In fact, getting all the gold together isn't even the climax of the picture, which is usually where one might think a conventional picture would take this story. But John Huston, the director, has none of that here. In 'Sierra Madre', Dobbs becomes the "bad guy", but it's hard exactly to call him one. I'm almost reminded of Crime &amp; Punishment, the Dostoyevsky novel, where the morality is very blurred and the character becomes a fragmented version of himself (not to mention trying to reason out in a lack of inner monologue, as Dobbs rambles to himself), and as Dobbs tries to make out with the gold on his own, he meets an end that any lessor Hollywood picture wouldn't dream of going to. That Dobbs then is played by Humphrey Bogart adds, at first, to the initial confusion of the moviegoer. This isn't how it usually happens, is it, least of which since Bogart started playing "good guy" roles. But Huston knows, as well as Bogart does- who may be in a true career highlight here alongside In a Lonely Place- that a character shouldn't be just one thing. Even Howard isn't just a kind-hearted old fella, even as he is that to a large extent (he even admits that he might have been tempted to take the money too, had he been younger). And in a sense Dobbs, through Bogart, is a bittersweet reminder of the American dream, where all one really wants is enough money to get by- but then how much can really be enough? Huston is brilliant in building on Dobbs's character, as is Bogart in showing little by little how his generous and genial personality gets stripped away when paranoia and fear settles into his mind-frame. Like when the men discuss how to divide up the money, or when the 'outsider' American comes in, the one who's definitely not invited- notice the striking body language of Bogart in relation to the other actors. Most especially, even if it's a small scene, when the three men talk about what they'll do with their share of the money- Dobbs's goals are in the short-term, unlike the practicality of Howard or Bob. By the last third of the film, if one were just looking at that set apart from the rest of the picture, one might think it's a flashback to Bogart's 'old days' as a character actor in the 30s. Yet he's the star here, which makes Dobbs's plummet a kind of sad testament to the American dream, so called, and to the corruptibility of goods.But aside from building strongly on the characters, Huston is also a good storyteller, and his Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of the finest 'yarns' of the 40s, albeit subversive as his other great films, the Maltese Falcon and the Asphalt Jungle, were. It's such a simple story, really, but it works because we believe in the characters, the nature of the setting, of the outside influences (i.e. both bandits and the 'common' Mexican peasants). Huston doesn't clutter up his story with any unnecessary moments, even as he uses a lot more bits to build on character than just plot. While Howard ends up being usually expository or with all the information for the other two- as he IS the most experienced like a gold-digging Yoda perhaps- the story never gets clunky. And there's a great sweep to the style of the picture too, with just the right studio score by Max Steiner, and some wonderful desert shots (and shots of the men's varied faces) Ted McCord. And one can't leave thinking about Treasure of the Sierra Madre, aside from considering the performances. Sure, Bogart might be at his best here, both an every-man and every-man-for-himself (plus his own worst enemy), but there's also Tim Holt, who has to carry the most restraint of the three main characters, and he's terrific at it, in what was probably his best remembered role among mostly B pictures. But it's arguable that Walter Huston, John's father, steals the show sometimes from Bogart, or at least gets in enough room to stand right alongside him as a presence to be reckoned with. The character ranges from being wise, to being a cook (like when he laughs wildly at the younger men being tired climbing the mountain), cautious, and always with a sense of truth and honor. Huston probably has one of the more deserved supporting actor Oscar turns here for the part, and if I had to show anyone one performance noteworthy most of all from him it'd be from 'Sierra Madre'. Bottom line, a must-see in the realm of the western/adventure A-pictures of the 40s, with enough to say on the dangers of greed and money to last so many years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huston and Huston Search for Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an engrossing adventure film from then-still-new-to-the-scene director John Huston, that feels like a "B" movie decked out in art-house trappings. At times, I felt that Huston and company were reaching too far in an attempt to make their film "Important," when really they just should have stuck to entertaining us. It's a film that has been lauded by the critical community as one of the best of all time; I don't know about that, but it has much to recommend it.Walter Huston caps off a long career of terrific performances with his scene-stealing number here as the old, wizened prospector who's seen it all. Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are his companions, both slowly undone by their own greed and the siren song of riches tugging at them both. Bogart gives perhaps the darkest performance he ever gave, with perhaps the exception of "In a Lonely Place," but much of it relies more on film tricks than it does acting. Whenever money lust overcomes Bogie's character, Huston shines high-key light directly into his eyes to give them a crazed glitter. There's terrific atmosphere in this film though; the foggy tropical setting is nearly enough to make you break into a sweat in your own living room.Try not to heap too many expectations on this film based on what you've read about it and its appearance on numerous "best of" lists and just enjoy a good old fashioned adventure yarn.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There can be no doubt that as Fred C. Dobbs in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", Humphrey Bogart gives one of his very best performances, and is right up there with his playing in "The African Queen". The film relies so heavily on the acting of the three top stars, and they deliver with all the skill they possess. Walter Huston is absolutely brilliant as the old prospector, and Tim Holt certainly proved in this film that he should have been given many better roles than he received before and after this movie. John Huston's direction was spot on, and the musical score, along with the locations depicted, added a great deal to the mood and atmosphere of what was a brilliant movie. It has stood the test of time and can be seen time and again and enjoyed just as much as the first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to avoid superlatives when writing about your favorite film of all time, so bear with me here if I tend to go overboard. The fact remains, however, that "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" contains what is arguably Humphrey Bogart's finest screen performance in a 25+-year career; one of John Huston's best directorial efforts; AND my favorite performance of all time--Walter Huston as the wise-with-experience prospector, Howard. For this terrific portrayal, Walter Huston won what is perhaps the most well-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar in the history of those dubious awards.By now, everyone is familiar with the story of the three gold prospectors who go into the wilds of Mexico, only to be undone by gila monsters, banditos, and human and Mother Nature. This is perhaps the best (there's that word again) movie ever made on the subject of human greed...including the incredible 1925 von Streihem classic, "Greed" itself. The movie has so many quotable quotes--the "stinking badges" line is just one of dozens--and wonderful, classic moments, including a brutal fight in a cantina; the fight on the train with the banditos; Howard's jig when gold is finally discovered; the Bogart/Alfonso Bedoya conversation before the shootout; Bruce Bennett's arrival in the camp; and on and on and on. My personal favorite moment occurs when Howard looks straight into the camera as a pretty Mexican girl lights his cigar. The expression on his face is absolutely priceless. There is one extended sequence that takes place in a village where the banditos have come to sell their stolen burros. The entire scene is performed in Spanish, which I don't speak at all, but such is the power of the directing and the storytelling that no subtitles are required to understand precisely what is going on. This picture is a true American classic, and a wonderful retelling of a terrific Traven novel (which I also highly recommend). It seems to me that I may have given Humphrey Bogart (my favorite actor) insufficient praise in this minireview. The truth is, the actor's portrayal of a man transforming from a decent and generous human being into a venal and dangerous sociopath is little short of miraculous. This is a much more interesting performance than the one Bogart won his only Oscar for, three years later--as Charlie Allnut in "The African Queen." Go figure. To conclude, "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is that rarity: a perfect motion picture. If you're about to see it for the first time, I envy you; if you're about to see it for the 30th time with undiminished pleasure, then you're like me. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Huston's greatest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre remains my personal favorite John Huston film. The film flawlessly depicts how greed can drastically change a man, and that saying something and doing it are two completely different things. It is one film that can make you think about mankind and what we think is really important to us.Bogart shines again, this time playing down and out drifter Fred C Dobbs. Dobbs and his fellow pal, Curtin (Tim Holt) are both roaming the streets of Tampico looking for work. The two get stiffed by a contractor that refused to pay them and go to a flophouse to get some sleep. It is there that they meet an old prospector. He tells them about gold in the hills and that he's looking for a few men to go up there with him to claim the fortune. Dobbs and Holt agree to accompany the old man (Walter Huston), and the trio set off. After arriving at the hill, they begin prospecting and soon have enough cash to last them a very long time. Soon though, Dobbs becomes very insecure and begins thinking that the other two are scheming to take his fortune. Dobbs, now clearly being controlled by greed, will even resort to murder to protect and gain more riches.It is at this point where we see that it is too late for Dobbs, he is consumed by greed and is now a different man than the one we knew at the beginning of the movie.There you have it. Those who thought that Bogart couldn't pull of playing a villain will be surprised... not only does he pull it off, he plays possibly his best role to date. John Huston gets the message across very clearly about the nature of man. The greatest film of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Bogart's best performance in one of Huston's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston made a lot of good films in his career-"The Asphalt Jungle", "Moby Dick", "Key Largo", "Beat the Devil"-but this film is one of his best, a masterpiece that stands above (along with "The Maltese Falcon" and "The African Queen") not only his other work but also other movies in general. Telling the story of three men who go into the mountains of Mexico for gold and finding greed and madness instead, "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is an brilliant character study that shows Humphrey Bogart's character, Fred C. Dobbs (one of THE famous characters in film history) turn from a ragged, homeless loser into a paranoid monster. Very grim considering the time it was made, "Treasure" is a very mature take (much like "The Asphalt Jungle") on the subject of pathetic people with hopeless, desperate dreams. Walter Huston deservedly won an oscar for his portrayal of Howard, an old coot who is revealed to be smarter and wiser than he appears. His speech about what "gold does to men's souls" is haunting when taken into context. Tim Holt is also strong as Bob Curtin, the young man who hooks up with Dobbs and ends up almost losing his life for it. Come to think of it, there are no slackers in this cast. But, inevitably, it is Bogart who stands above the rest, even oscar-winning Huston. His performance is on another level, watching his transformation is a mesmerizing experience. On the AFI 100 Greatest Movies special, Mel Brooks says Bogart's performance is "beyond Oscars". Well, apparently it is because Bogart didn't even get nominated for this film. When viewing the film you realize just how criminal this exclusion was. The layers Bogart puts on as this character go beyond simple portrayal. Bogart is nuanced in a way that when Dobbs threatens Curtin, he is simultaneously scary and tragic. There is a scene where he grabs Curtin and points a gun at his face, and as you look at Bogart's dirty, unshaven face in the intense firelight you don't see a man, you see the embodiment of mad, the personification of insanity. Huston obviously also had the "genius" switch on for knowing how to frame this movie, how to make the interactions between characters seem so real and original when the subject of the film is something so universal and common as greed. But the strength of Bogart is what makes this film reverberate with meaning and power. He is the engine to this vehicle, and everyone else seems to play off him. No one else can be Fred C. Dobbs. No one else can be Humphrey Bogart. 10/10</fullReview>

Humphrey Bogart is perfect in the role as a down and out American stuck in Mexico with no money. The dialogue in the movie is unique in that certain lines stay with you (i.e. "I don't have to show you any stinking badges" and " 3 times 35 is 105. I bet you 105 thousand dollars you go to sleep before I do" and "Reckon it's a bad sign when a guy starts talking to himself" and many more). Even though Bogie does steal all the money for himself, you kinda feel sorry for him when the bandits finally do him in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a great movie all around, but a very dark tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a sharp-edged study of the effects of greed on otherwise normal men, and one man in particular: Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are down and out and meet up with prospector Howard (Walter Huston). When Dobbs wins a lottery, he uses the proceeds to finance a trip for the three to central Mexico to search for gold. The three have to deal with the lawlessness of central Mexico at the time - bandits were actually on the loose in that country killing anybody with stuff, and taking that stuff. The Federales were a violent solution to a violent problem - killing the bandits after a summary judgement and the bandits having dug their own graves. So our trio not only have to worry about bandits once they strike gold, they have to worry about the darkness of their own souls. In the beginning, Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs is a decent guy who does not take advantage of others. Dobbs only takes his money from the guy that wouldn't pay and he does share his lottery ticket and is generous with his fellow miners, but as greed begins to take root in him, little by little we see his goodness eaten away. It's a great credit to the writing and Bogart's skills that this is done gradually and played out over time. Incidentally, that's director John Huston "staking him to a meal". One of the best director cameos ever (although Polanski in Chinatown is equally great)! Dobbs overestimates himself and the fallibility of human nature. Walter Hustons character freely admits what gold could do to any of them including himself. Dobbs is sure it will never happen to him, but he's never had anything, so he's never faced temptation, and when he falls it's a long way down. This may be Tim Holt's finest performance - it was probably his finest opportunity given he had spent years laboring as a B western star on the RKO lot. Walter Huston as the prospector, minus his dentures and plus a bunch of pounds and with holes in his clothes is not the debonair fellow you are used to seeing in film . If Mary Astor's character in Dodsworth could have thought this was the future appearance of the man she loved, would she have taken her gondola in the other direction? I guess we'll never know.Highly recommended as one of the great character studies in which several characters get studied in detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This becomes such a stunning film with knowledge of the plot a second or even third time round. A context might give us some clues; we might expect Humphrey Bogart to be a bit more nobler, for example. Here it is interesting to be able to pick out select actions that point towards his inevitable demise and downfall. Early on he is drinking heavily and wandering aimlessly in the Mexican oil-town of Tampico, broke, depressed and drowning his sorrows. He targets stranger's patriotism as he begs for a little coin, but he doesn't give them the time of the day to even look at their face, which ends in the rather embarrassing situation of a gentleman chastising him for coming to him repeatedly. Funnily enough, though he acts sheepish and promises not to beg from him again, he is guilty of the same sort of dismissiveness, treated the boy nagging him for the lottery ticket earlier. Fredd C. Dobbs has his eye on the coin from the beginning, and throughout the film we begin to see other little signs of his outward persona cracking and his material greed taking over. It is Bogart of course that steals the screen. Convention tells us that a character talking to themselves with no one else on screen is mad or insane. Is Dobbs insane? We are never quite sure. Bogart's reputation adds a hard, cynical edge to his portrayal, and makes his descent even more difficult to bear - with every softly growled threat or suggestion of camaraderie we are kept on our toes, guessing whether this may be where he falls off the wagon. McCord holds back on the key light in particular moments; most effectively in that campfire confrontation with Bob as his full personality bares its teeth and he rocks back and forth with his knees tucked in, and growls and laughs ferally. His face is almost fully consumed at this point, but for a hint of the key light hitting his forehead and the dastardly glint in his eye. And after he has done the foul deed he lies back beside the fire, muttering to himself about conscience and how it only matters if you feel the need to have one...yet he is contradicting himself by continually worrying about what he has just done. He attempts to sleep for a moment, before snapping his eyes wide back open, full of fear and anxiety...and the fire roars higher and higher and consumes him...perfection. There is nothing wrong with Tim Holt's Bob. He is a good and honest character, and we truly believe him when he says he would treat Dobbs' goods the same way if he had been the one to stay behind. And when he proclaims that the wind will take him to Cody's window out in Texas, we know that he means only good intentions. Walter Houston's Howard is a little problematic. At times he seems to verge along the edge of the maniacal old man, talking less sense and more delusion. Some of these crazy moments show their age considerably; there is only so much frenzied laughter and jig that you can take, even if it is wrapped up in a damning yet poetic ribbon like the gold dust blowing off into the wind. The film works because we all think like Dobbs sometimes. We are cautious of wealth that materialises out of no where, and baffled and distrusting of people who would willingly share with us this wealth. Dobbs does the only thing he knows how; he projects his own insecurities and suspicions weedling under onto his companions, remains blinded of their good intentions, and in the end falls victim to his own vices. Many of us too can empathise with this feeling, of thinking something is too good to be true, and to wastefully sabotage ourselves and lose all sense of rationality. But gold, pure gold, makes it all the more dramatic.</fullReview>

But senor, you can buy 1/20th of a ticket ! Badges ? We don't need no stinkin' Badges !Yes I have seen this picture a few times more than once.Walter Huston doing the "it's up there we have to go" dance. Tim Holt speaking like he isn't an actor at all. The many character actors who populate what is really a three character picture are all terrific. The IMDb says Jay Silverheels has an uncredited role. Will have to watch it again now, as if I needed an excuse ! It looks and sounds and almost smells real. It's dusty and dirty but not bloody or gory. We see no deaths and do not miss them at all.If you have somehow missed this gem, you owe it to yourself to remedy that asap</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ventured earlier that Humphrey Bogart's finest performance was as Sam Spade in THE MALTESE FALCON; after revisiting THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, I stand corrected. THIS is arguably Bogart's best performance. (And will remain so until I stumble across another Bogart classic and come scuttling back to correct myself yet again...) As Sam Spade, Bogart was a fairly ruthless "good guy." As Fred C. Dobbs, he's an outright bastard. Not at first, of course, but, once he's been f---ed over, he doesn't seem to have a whole lot of trouble crossing over to The Dark Side. Although it's not quite curtains for Curtin, Dobbs's attempted murder of him makes Dobbs an unsavory character whose final fate he had coming. Outstanding tale of greed, with three topnotch performances and some brilliant direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing we haven't seen in films since then, but it's still rather effective, its pairing of arc and character and that ends as a tragedy in some ways. In that respect, the final scene is rather shocking and surprising, although if we take into account the time context maybe not so much. The performances are really fine, and Bogart does great in something different than Casablanca (the only other film I've seen him in). The thrills here are well earned, and the story, although familiar, still takes some surprising turns. The directing is also strong, and the cinematography well thought out. Overall, this is definitely must-see for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again, mankind is evil...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is an allegory of the human condition. A powerful glimpse into the murky waters of what motivates the heart and soul of mankind, which is greed and the selfish lust for money and survival.The story concerns three unlucky men who stumble upon the idea to mine for gold, agreeing to split their findings in an equal partnership. It brilliantly conveys the presence of darkness in the lighted garden of mankind's hope for goodness, and how man's inability to sustain it makes him impossible to be trusted. The story also reveals the possibilities of goodness that lie beneath the surface, that in some hearts, the presence of nobility is strong enough to overcome the iniquity that would normally prevail, after a period of trial and suffering has come and gone.Ultimately, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a glimpse across the whole timeline of the human experience, going all the way back to the Garden, when the ground was cursed for the sake of mankind, and every imagination of his heart became evil from his youth. This story is as much a treasure to behold as the treasure it tries to reveal from within, as it shines the light of truth into the corrupted cavern which is the human heart, affirming with tragic reality that despite all his efforts to the contrary, mankind is evil, and subject to the windy, dusty whims of Fate, Destiny, and God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never forget the golden rule - he who has the gold makes the rules.Bogart and Holt are down on their luck, trapped in a post-revolution Mexican hellhole, much like the protagonists from the Wages of Fear. Dumb enough to be suckered out of their honest pay by an unscrupulous oilman their trust in their fellow man begins to gradually fragment. They hook up with old-timey prospector Walter Huston (the director's dad and Sean Connery prototype) and head into the hills to find their fortune. Neither of the young men are cut-out for the effort and have no clue what they are doing while slowly learning from and distrusting their mentor.The real, and perhaps only, cancer in their group is Bogart's Dobbs. His lust for wealth and desperate personality crumbles under the weight of mistrust and the anxiety of outside forces stealing their loot.It's possible to find many morality lessons in John Huston's most famous film, but the main point is to be happy with what you have and if fortune comes your way then so be it, pursuing it aggressively may not lead to a happy ending. There's a lot of tension in the heavy, sweltering Mexican air, and no one feels it more than Bogart, who's performance as a man going to pieces under pressure is one of his best.Not exactly Sunday afternoon viewing, keep it for a Saturday night, watch with the lights off and immerse yourself in the near perfect black and white photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is a down and out American in Tampico, Mexico. He meets Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) at a job, but the town is full of crooks including their former boss. In a rundown hostel, they meet old prospector Howard (Walter Huston). Together the three go off in search for their golden fortunes in bandit infested wild country.This is a John Huston classic and an American classic. It is more than high adventure. It's got the charismatic Bogart, and John Huston's father Walter. It is a character study of Dobbs as paranoia and greed descend. And it's got the great 'Badges' bit although it doesn't have the same gusto as one expects. This has to be one of the great movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally speaking this movie has the favor of being able to captivate almost from the get go.A interesting analysis of human greed. I would have preferred an ending cut on the "good laugh scene", which would have taken forward the real sense of absurdity of this movie, in the good sense of the term that is (cf. Camus, Sysyphus myth). Instead the ending scene with the cactus has a more back to earth, back to nature, which is less consistent with the rest of the movie. Then another reserve is of course the way Indians are depicted; kind of stupid throughout - the white doctor scene, the gold to sand discovery scene- which makes also for lack of plausibility.But still, the movie left me in a good spirit, and I had pleasure watching it. Because of the reserve I mentioned it should end up a 7/10. But something in it, maybe the time, and craft and "moral message" still pushes it towards 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much "treasure" was there, actually?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, toward the end of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, characters state several times that 10 months' of manually chiseling into solid rocks with pick axes, hammering the resulting rocks into dust, and separating gold out via running water has produced a three-man haul of gold dust worth $105,000. Earlier, the price of gold has been pegged at $20 per ounce. Doing the math, this comes out to 5,250 ounces, worth about $10 million now, adjusted for market rises and inflation. No wonder the bandits dumped all of it into the "Norther' winds"--350 pounds is a lot of excess weight for a few half-dead but valuable burros to be carrying! Since it's also stated in the movie that the MAXIMUM yield of this gold vein was 20 ounces of gold dust per ton of ore pulverized from solid rock, this hard-working trio smashed a MINIMUM of 262 tons of rock into dust in just 300 days! That's about 600 pounds per man per day--or at least 60 pounds per man hourly, or a pound a minute when the trio's trips to the village for supplies, hunting, cooking, and bandit-shooting time is factored in. Personally, I think both Humphrey Bogart and John Huston look too scrawny to be pulverizing a pound of solid rock into dust virtually every waking minute for ten months (but that's just my opinion).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Great Film &amp; One Of Bogie's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Casablanca did not exist, this is what I would point to as Humphrey Bogart's very finest performance. What a range he displays here, as he, as miner Dobbs, slowly goes mad pursuing his greed for wealth! Absolutely incredible. World-class. Those who don't yet realize Bogie was among the very best have to see this movie.Yet Walter Huston almost steals the film from Bogie. Father of the brilliant writer-director John Huston (who wrote and directed this great film), he is absolutely brilliant as the savvy and eccentric old miner seeking his one last score.And this is the quintessential gold-mining movie - perhaps the best. Yet it rises above its genre to talk about much more than the Gold Rush days.This is, in the final analysis, about much more. Like Citizen Kane, it is about greed and lust for all things material - and how that corrodes and corrupts the human spirit such that the person infected with it immutably and tragically changes for the worse. And, I guess, this movie, then, is also about human nature.This movie is also unusual, by the way, in that it shows Native Americans in a sympathetic and kind light. They're not the bad guys here, as they so often are in Westerns.(By the way: This is the movie classic Mel Brooks parodies in Blazing Saddles in the scene where the line, "We Don't Need No Stinkin' Badges!" is quoted. You'll see where that came from. And by the way - even the unsung bit-part actors who played the Mexican outlaws in this movie put in great performances.)...And what faces you'll see in this movie (from the Indians to the Mexicans to the Anglos)! Like Fellini, John Huston must have chosen half of the actors for their unusual and emotive faces.(And by the way - if you think the Mexicans are portrayed badly here, you haven't heard about Pancho Villa, who viciously ambushed and killed many Americans along the border - including in present-day New Mexico - well in the 1900s.) Great intense story that never quits, great direction, great acting...this is a must-see movie classic. This movie builds and builds until its brilliant ending. You won't ever forget it.</fullReview>

At first united and friendly, the curse of greed takes hold of Dobbs(despite his initial assurances that no such thing could happen!) when they do strike it rich, but he becomes suspicious and paranoid, which is made worse by the harsh elements and Mexican bandits who threaten them, leading to inevitable tragedy and death... Superbly directed and acted film portrays its remote setting well; though the plot developments aren't surprising, they are told with such skill that it doesn't matter.

		<shortDescription>Trouble On The Trail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated.Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved.Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character.For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind.""Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake."Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.)The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this.Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie.This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then I pick up something old to watch from the public library. I hold Chaplin's and Keaton's stuff in high glory, but I've found stuff preceding Clint's "Dollars" - trilogy to be somewhat outdated. "Magnifecent seven", "Dirty dozen" and "Where eagles dare" are still as kick-ass-stuff as "Raiders of the lost ark" to me, but Wayne's "Searchers" and "Rio Bravo", and Bogart's "Maltese falcon" just feel boring and outdated. Even Kurosawa has been so much re-used that it pales in comparison to, say, "Lone wolf and the cub" to me. So I really didn't have high hopes for "Sierra madre". I thought it'd offer some lame action, lines and situations quoted to death, misplaced Chaplin-gags and not much more. However, I was wrong. From the get-go it just took a grip at me and didn't let go until the end. Action is scarce, but the stuff in-between is STRONG. Dialogue, characters and situations make sense and advance the plot in beautiful balance, and a whole lot of stuff happens in Spanish without subtitles so that you STILL follow the plot so that it makes "Die hard" with its 'bits in German' pale in comparison. To sum this up short: if you're not allergic to old-old school action, try it. Definitely. If "Raiders of the lost ark" is "World of warcraft", this is "Nethack".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Huston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although John Huston's directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay, winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that makes "Treasure of The Sierra Madre" the classic film that it is. Beginning and ending with Walter Huston's award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter's portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.When, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie produces two incredible performances. While the script and director deserve a lot of credit, the performances of Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston are what make this a truly great film.Bogart gives what is arguably the best performance of his career. He and a friend decide to go gold prospecting. They team up with veteran miner, Walter Huston, and head off into the Sierra Madre mountains. After striking it rich, Bogie's greed and paranoia lead him to suspect his partners and plot to steal their gold. His performance is memorable as a greed-fueled descent into insanity. He is paranoid, but at the same time is trying to convince himself they are conspiring against him in order to justify taking their gold.Huston is at his best in this role. As I watched it for the first time, I was amazed at how natural his performance seemed. His portrayal of the grizzled, half-crazy old coot defines how I visualize a miner to this day. In the movie, he acts as a pillar of strength and knowledge,as well as providing a buffer zone between Holt and Bogart. Whenever Holt and Bogie get into an argument, Huston steps in to keep the peace. When he is removed, the two are at each others throats by nightfall. In the end, Huston comes riding in with the cavalry, but is too late to recover the gold. But it seems to barely affect him. In fact, he seems amused. Watching that scene, I get the feeling he didn't care about getting rich, but loved the thrill of making one last big find.</fullReview>

First they run into McCormick in a Tampico bar getting himself smashed with his Mexican lady friend. It's in his trying to stiff both Dobbs and Curtin again that Mccormick gets the living hell beat out of him with his two disgruntled former workers getting their back-pay, $300.00, that he held back from them. That together with Dobbs winning a local lottery for some 200 in Mexican pesos that was enough for them to get the equipment necessary to go gold mining in the Sierra Madre with the old and grizzled American prospector whom they met in a Tampico flophouse Howard, Walter Huston!It's soon that all the hard work the men put into finding gold paid off with them striking a mother-load of it at the bottom of the Sierra Medra which can lead to a fortune for all three of them when their mining the stuff is finally over. But what soon sets into Doggs mind is a paranoid greed in him thinking that old Howard and Curtin are planning to steal his share of the gold and eventually do him in! Something that the both honest and God fearing Howard and Curtin don't have as much as a second thought of doing! Dobbs paranoia gets even more acute when Amercan prospector Cody,Bruce Bennett,joins the trio and demands his share of the gold that's to be mined after the three already split what they dug up! It's both Cody and a group of Mexican bandits lead by the smiling and murderous Gold Hat, Alfonso Bedoya, become involved with Dobbs &amp; Co.in the film that the by now insane with greed Dobbs really starts to lose it! Howard who had saved an Indian boy from drowning had become a top man, or legislator, to the tribe the boy belonged to and decided to live out his life in splendor and luxury as their big chief while both Dobbs and Curtin were left to fight it out for their,including Howard's, share of the gold they dug up. Cody for his part ended up being killed by Gold Hat's gang after they attacked the prospectors looking for anything that they had on them not for once suspecting that they had bags loaded with pure gold dust!***SPOILERS*** It's when Dobbs attempts to murder Curtin in order, in his deranged and paranoid skull, to keep him from doing the same to himself that his entire plan of checking out of Mexico with the some $150,000.00 worth of gold dust falls completely apart together with him! Out in the hot sun with his some half dozen burros and almost dying of thirst Dobbs is confronted by Gold Hat and his boys who make, by sabering Dobbs to death, short work of him! It's later that both Howard and Curtin, who recovered from him being shot by Dobbs, come upon Dobbs mules that it's wise old Howard that realizes that all their work over the last ten months prospecting for gold was in fact for nothing! Gold Hat &amp; Co. who ended up being caught and executed by the local Mexican militia had unknowingly ripped open all of Dobbs sacks filled with gold dust leaving the precious medal to go back,in a desert windstorm, to where in came from!

		<fullReview>I had never seen this classic, despite my 54 years, and I savored the opportunity to see it on public TV recently.I enjoyed "Treasure" a lot -- largely not because of Bogie, but Walter Huston. What a revelation. The depiction of an exquisitely sensitive and wise older person is rare in film and I thoroughly enjoyed his every scene. The Huston character's ability to laugh back at fate and see the humor in man's predicament will be unforgettable to me.I wasn't as pleased with Humphrey Bogart's performance. Sure, he plays a nasty scoundrel who may or may not be paranoid in the end. But I was reminded of how I felt when I saw Bogart in "The Caine Mutiny," feeling that the performance was a bit unpleasantly over the top. It was startling to see how the character played by a star of Bogie's stature meets his end in this film -- with scarcely a whisper and almost completely unacknowledged -- a tribute to the character's nasty legacy.The Mexicans in this movie were particularly interesting to watch, be they federales, banditos, or humble folk who saw the white man as a savior. Who could forget the villain who sneered: "We don't need no stinking badges!" The federales' clinical execution of justice was chilling.The main problem with this film, at least in the version I saw, was its lack of subtitles. There is a lot of Spanish spoken in this movie and I feel like I missed an awful lot. But given the movie's overall quality, this is a very minor complaint.</fullReview>

For one thing it is very well made, with wonderful cinematography and striking locations, and the story which is like a fable on greed and human despair as well as a fun search for gold in bandit-infested Mexico is very exciting. Max Steiner's score is superb, the screenplay is crisp and the direction from John Huston is rock solid. The acting is simply great, and that's an understatement with Humphrey Bogart giving another memorable performance as the drifter Fred C. Dobbs. And he is superbly supported by Tim Holt who plays a young idealist and especially Walter Huston as the gnarled prospector.

		<fullReview>TTOTSM rewards repeat viewing for all the new subtleties and nuances that emerge each time you see it. The repeating storyline of the desperate men who end up working for no pay, the way that Cody's wife's letter expresses what is the 'real' treasure of life and how Curtin(Holt) and Howard(Huston) reaffirm this at the end, and how Humphrey Bogart's performance as Dobbs sets the bar for all the anti-heroes of cinema to follow - not forgetting Alfonso Bedoya's supremely conscience-less bandit chief compared to Dobbs' ultimately evil paranoiac.What is so captivating about this movie is the perfect sense of period and location, even though much is on a sound stage; the scenes of grinding poverty in Tampico and extended scenes in Spanish make no compromise for the average movie-goer expecting any sort of Western, and Walter Huston's character is so convincing, you actually feel that you have learnt about prospecting for gold. Everything that occurs in the beginning has a point; the brands on the burros, the relentless Federales, the 'Norther' turning the earth over, Howard not believing a word of Dobbs and Curtin's denials that gold will corrupt them, and the doomed bargains that are struck before the prospectors set out.No writer, actor or director can watch this without learning something about the craft every time, and no gold prospector should set out without sitting through it at least three times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treasure! Temptation! Treachery!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is regarded as one of the finest adventure films ever to come out of Hollywood. In it, three down on their luck Americans in Tampico, Mexico set out with plans of making their fortune in gold. However, with riches within their grasp greed threatens to undo all of their hard work.Humphrey Bogart is the star of the film and he delivers one of the best performances of his career. Apparently the Academy didn't see things that way, though, since he went unnominated at Oscar time. Walter Huston, on the other hand, won an Oscar for his memorable supporting role. Rounding out the three is Tim Holt, the least interesting of the bunch but not bad, per se. The rest of the cast is acceptable but nothing to write home about.John Huston received Oscars for both his screenplay and his direction. The recognition for directing was certainly warranted but the film is supposedly quite faithful to the novel, so perhaps B. Traven deserves most of the credit for the story. Nevertheless, it is a good yarn. Besides Huston's direction, the film's cinematography (mostly on location) and score (by Max Steiner) are also above average.While I feel that "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a good movie I would hesitate to heap the kind of praise on it that it usually gets. Granted, I vaguely knew how it was going to end so it was kind of spoiled for me but, still, the story didn't impress as much as I would have expected (given the film's reputation). All in all, though, the film is certainly worth watching and I fully intend to revisit it sometime down the road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic morality tale of the dangers of wealth told fittingly as a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that stands out about "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is that it's not gun- shy about its moral storytelling. From the get-go, legendary director John Huston, who wrote the script and directed based on a novel by B. Traven, feeds us foreshadowing about the perils of money and seeking great fortune. In the beginning, the prospector, Howard, played by Huston's father, Walter, in a role that won him an Academy Award, warns us "I know what gold does to men's souls." From there on out we know we're in store for great human conflict fueled by greed, paranoia and the American dream.As a classic Western, "Sierra Madre" is not as exciting or action-packed as it is interpersonal drama and suspense. There are still gun fights and encounters with indigenous people (in this case Native Mexicans), but the focus is on three men, Dobbs (Bogart), Howard (Huston) and Curtin (Holt) who agree in principle to search for gold in Mexico and split the earnings fairly. When they discover gold, the wealth becomes real and paranoia sets in, especially with Dobbs, who cooks up delusional schemes of deception and even threatens to kill without hesitation.Bogart's turn as the dirty, malcontented and often crazy Dobbs is -- in my opinion -- the film's stand-out performance. Huston is written as the complement to that high-strung and distrusting character and that's what makes him noteworthy too. Bogart really pushes our comfort level; he makes us take the film's "who might cross who" game seriously. It doesn't necessarily work without his character putting ideas in the others' (and our) heads. He gives a face to the rotten side of human nature that we're ashamed of but have to acknowledge exists.Huston, most importantly, provides us the sense that these men have honestly nothing else to concern themselves with other than money. Although we want to believe they can take solace in the unexpected friendship they've discovered and inherently trust one another, Huston has convincingly set the stage for doubt and desperation. He's guided by a rigid moral compass in the creation of this film that even manages to express itself poetically once or twice. As Dobbs tries to sleep by the fire believing he has killed someone, the flames of the fire dance brighter to suggest the inner wrongdoing Dobbs is experiencing -- and presumably that he has sinned and is bound for hell.A few scenes felt a bit out of place or unnecessarily dragged out, so "Sierra Madre" doesn't always keep you actively interested, but the inherent human truth that Huston explores that relates so closely to our everyday wants and desires is such a beacon for this film. The shoes of these three men are some of the easiest characters' shoes to step in in all of film because its so fundamental to us. Even as children we make pacts that show we trust others and believe that everything will be fair and equitable. Huston just tells that story from the adult perspective using the trappings of classic Westerns.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put, a true representation of motion pictures...when done the right way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies. The acting, direction, story and morals are ones that will never be forgotten. If you are one of those types that thinks humanity is a perfect race then this movie is a wake-up call for you. It shows that with the desire of material possessions, there can be no communism or perfect society. Man is a greedy species that will go out of their way to gain what they treasure the most. The performances in this movie are great particularly those of Walter Houston as Howard, a man who struck it rich, but was lucky enough to have lived after the consequences of greed. Bogie and Holt are good too and Bogart shows us all that anyone can go over the edge about something. After watching this movie, you will not only have had a good 2 hours well spent, but an understanding that some things are worth more than gold and sadly, greed kills. The true treasure of this movie is in its ability to make us all realize that our world will never be perfect and that the true treasure is resisting material possessions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic tale of greed is cinema gold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston gets career performances out of his three lead actors as well as himself as a director with this classic tale about greed that has lost none of its glitter sixty years after it was made. Two down on their luck Americans form an uneasy alliance along with a prospector in a search for gold in Mexico. Struggling with a forbidding terrain they endure backbreaking work, sandstorms and predatory creatures before striking it rich. Their problems have just begun. Bandits roam the area while distrust of each other roams their minds. As the prospectors Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt and Walter Huston ooze their roles. Bogart's cynical Fred C. Dobbs quick dissent into paranoia is a fascinating watch that might have dominated were it not for Walter Huston's equally magnificent turn as the grizzled prospector/ philosopher. Huston may act absurd (existential?) but his musings and logic keep things from unraveling at the camp site sooner as Dobbs moves closer to the dark side. Holt as Curtin the third prospector has the less flashy character but he ably holds the middle ground together struggling with his principles amid an atmosphere of distrust and greed. Director Huston delivers scene after scene of well paced action and suspense with barroom brawls, menacing banditos, things that go bump in the night and tight close ups that perfectly register the desperation of the trio. Huston refuses to let any of his protagonists off easy and this is brutally conveyed when they all agree to eliminate a diplomatic claim jumper. As decent and deranged cock their pistols Huston coldly informs his audience that everything has its price. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a violent, grimy parable, relentless in its telling as it masterfully peels away the underpinnings of social discourse through paranoia and madness brought about by man's uncontrollable lust for self enrichment. It is a dusty, brutal microcosm of humanity as a whole as well as a cautionary tale with roots that stretch from Pizzarro's genocidal pursuit of gold in the Americas to Madoff's plundering of accounts from a New York penthouse today. Treasure is a treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discover the Treasure of Sierra Madre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't recall exactly where on on which movie I had heard a reference about The Treasure of Sierra Madre, which I thought had spoiled the movie for me. That was months ago, when I was back home in Honduras, now I'm a year in Finland and I'm enjoying the selection of movies at the local library. And the best? Rent's all for free!At first I had trouble with translations and checking for subtitles, but then I found this movie and didn't doubt in taking it. The Treasure of Sierra Madre tells us the story of two American beggars living in a Mexican city, and how they embark in an adventure in search of gold, where they find the wilderness, bandits, an uninvited guest and the terrible greed for gold, which is the movie's main theme.How can human economy be based on something which is not even edible? Gold is useless, but for what it means in our society, it can turn people crazy. As the movie unfolds we watch how the usually heroic Boggart succumbs to his own greed, in contrast to Curtin and the old man.Casting and performances are terrific. Boggart is on his best shape and Tim Holt is on the same level, as well as the Academy Award performance Walter Huston, whose son also won two very well deserved Oscars, for the movie keeps you thrilled throughout its running time and the location filming at Mexico, was a great choice. The town scenes are very tasty and give us the American view of Mexico on the late 1940s, which tends to be stereotypical but portraying both the bandit Zapatist revolutionary and the common good faithed village people.The Treasure of Sierra MAdre is definitely a treasure you should find, in case you haven't discovered it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dobbs and Curtin, two men without any prospects strike a friendship in Tampico, Mexico; they work odd jobs to get by and dream of getting rich one day. That day comes when they meet an experienced old gold prospector and the three set out to Sierra Madre to search for gold. What follows is John Huston's tale about the consequences of greed, adapted from B. Traven's novel.Even after 60 years, this movie manages to remain fresh in its portrayal of what gold lust can do against friendship, sanity and normal human dignity. Dobbs is a case study of a man slowly losing his mind to paranoia, as he imagines his partners conspiring to steal his gold; it also shows the depths of depravity a man can go for money.Humphrey Bogart plays Dobbs and does an impressive job in portraying him as a frail-looking, insecure man with the devil in his eyes. Bogart's transformation into a killer is a joy to watch. The frightening thing is that Bogart shows how Dobbs could by anyone in the right conditions.Tim Holt, a baby-faced actor unknown to me, portrays the more rational and moral Curtin, a man who manages to resist the corruption of gold. This is not to say he isn't interesting; without his moral gravitas to play off against Dobbs there wouldn't be any conflict in the movie. And finally we have Howard, played by Walter Huston in a performance that almost up-staged Bogart's. Howard is the final corner in this odd triangle, bringing in the world-weariness and cynicism of old age to contrast with Dobb's initial optimism.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is not just a great study of greed, it's also a fine example of film-making, without a single dull scene in the movie; not once is exciting dialogue or fast-paced action missing. It's action and suspense all the time until we reach the end and its unique brand of irony, when see to what little human endeavor amounts to in a senseless world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection from John Huston and company...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years I've taken to availing myself of the extensive DVD collection held by the Las Vegas Clark County County Library District and have as a result seen some excellent films, ranging from the latest blockbusters to Kurosawa and more. A recent move put me nearer a branch that's pretty depauperate in their holdings (I can still order DVDs from the main collection and have them delivered to this branch, but sometimes the week is a 'dry' one in terms of what among my requested titles is available) and most of what they do have consists of older titles and television shows. This has lately turned out to be a happy situation, though, encouraging me to look at some old films -- until recently, it'd been a long tome since I'd watched much in the way of films dating from earlier than the late-'70s -- and discovering and rediscovering some excellent work. "Red River," "The African Queen" (pretty sure I went my whole life 'til now without seeing this brilliant piece), "Some Like It Hot," "Father Goose," "The Searchers," and many others, some of which I'd perhaps seen as a kid but that now resonate far more. This film rates right at the top of those old films and, indeed, right at the top of films ranked by ANY criteria.A good thirty or so years ago (man, where does the time go?) I saw this film on TV and I loved it. Stumbling across it in the library yesterday, and having recently seen and loved "The African Queen," I decided to give it another whirl. Good move. I have to say it: John Huston, as with John Ford, Kurosawa, and others, is highly at risk of being overrated by consensus but the truth is that he can't be rated highly enough. The man was a visionary. And the actors he so expertly films are uniformly excellent. Every of the principals turns in a solid performance, nuanced and grittily realistic; this is no mean feat given the highly stylized and theatrical screen acting style that was still pretty much de rigeur even in the late '40s. The acting in this film would not be terribly out of place in a film made 50 years later. This and "The African Queen" reminded me, given that I hadn't seen one of his films in at least two decades, that Humphrey Bogart was more than just the weird-looking little dude with the characteristic voice and overbite; the man could act! The great Walter Huston, of course, steals the show with a portrayal that's both at turns comedic and deadly serious but that is utterly convincing. I like the use of Spanish dialog in the film, too. The film's components blend seamlessly to fairly ooze atmosphere. And, as with many films from the period by such luminaries as John Ford and Howard Hawks, the scenery is used to magnificent effect even within the constraints inherent to black-and-white film (a medium that also, of course, provides some dramatic advantage if used well).This is truly a film for the ages. A ripping good yarn, expertly told and flawlessly crafted. It's over 60 years old now, monochrome, and constrained by the screen censorship of the time, but it more than holds up and remains a true classic for all time. Hmmm...I may just have to see about checking out this other thing, a little film called "The Maltese Falcon," before too long...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you know Humphrey Bogart as a sweet talking man or a detective, you ain't seen nothing yet. You have to watch this movie. Bogart, who commits kind of a sin here a few times, when he talks to himself, to make his feelings heard outside, can just pull that off, without losing his face.But it's not only Bogart who shines in this. It's also Walter Huston, father to the director of the movie John Huston. There might not be many people in the movie, but it feels incredibly real. The story can be read here, but what is more important, is the acting and the things that happen in between. Especially concerning the characters and their relationship with one another. Human flaws get exposed in a way, that make you care for the characters, even if you want to punch them and tell them what's wrong with them.A great movie, that should be viewed, by anyone who likes great drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expansive adventure epic; a pinnacle of cinematic potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a popular story circulating of Paul Thomas Anderson, director of 2007's viscerally wrenching There Will Be Blood screening The Treasure of the Sierra Madre for his cast and crew every single day of the production in order to convey the scope and power of the film he was aiming to achieve. If anything speaks to the genuinely abiding quality of John Huston's 1948 masterpiece, not coincidentally a similar parable of the absolute corruption of greed, it is that Anderson's film, now regarded as a contemporary classic and one of the most powerful films in several decades, showed a level of devotion to the point of almost eerie reverence towards Huston's film, only hoping to in part live up to its near peerless quality and craftsmanship. Such praise did not prove an overstatement either, as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre proves a picture as expansive and full of riches as the mountain which forms the setting for its narrative centerpiece, a pinnacle of cinematic potential which overwhelmingly succeeds on every possible front. On the surface a sprawling adventure epic (and one would be hard pressed to find a film more sprawling or epic than this), the film simultaneously serves as a devastating moral play on the absolute corrupting force of avarice, and the steady reduction of the three protagonists to a near animalistic state in pursuit of lifelong wealth is a truly sickening spectacle. Director Huston's daring (and expensive) decision to shoot the film on location for the first time since the war proved a crucially effective decision, as the film pulsates with the devastating realism of the arid, hostile land, caking its protagonists in grime, sweat and filth to mirror their own moral decay. Yet there is breadth to the film beyond a simple moral play, as Huston's powerhouse direction extracts every possible emotional nuance from the film, from its despairing portrait of an impoverished shantytown, to a harshly realistic barfight to an unnervingly tense mountaintop shootout. Yet there is a positive underbelly to be delved into amidst the grim overtones: Bogart's deadpan one-liners reflecting on his destitute state prove among his best, and the intoxicating joy felt by the three prospectors striking gold for the first time is impossible to resist basking in, while the painfully bittersweet, morally ambiguous ending packs enough of a genuinely flooring punch to leave the viewer in stunned reflection for days afterwards. Max Steiner's ominously soaring musical score seals the flawless deal, adding dramatic punch and devastating emotional resonance to the unanimously impressive final product. And yet, for all of its laudable features, the film could be viewed solely for its acting and still be venerated as a masterpiece. While he may have found his call to fame portraying conflicted, cynical romantics, the subversion of Humphrey Bogart's more wholesome image into a jaded, corrupted prospector stripped of every successive layer of human decency proved legendary, as Bogart delves into levels of alarmingly stark realism and animalistic energy that he could only hope to echo afterwards. Walter Huston (director John's father, in an Oscar winning performance) is similarly fantastic, his gleefully eccentric performance of a brightly cantankerous old prospector breathing real light into the film and setting the bar for decades of stereotypical imitations to follow. If there were any risk in characterisation it would be in the potentially overzealous morality of Tim Holt's good hearted prospector, but Holt overcomes such fears with solid, festering charisma and enough inherent darkness to keep his character a genuine person rather than an idealised heroic archetype. The interplay and chemistry between the three men is truly an experience for the ages, equally effective while comically bantering and joking to breathlessly squaring off against each other for their lives, barely resisting the temptation of murder for personal profit. Few would dispute making a claim for The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as one of the most powerful films ever made, every component from the rock solid directing, raw devastating sets to fierce intensity of acting cementing it as an all time classic, just as exhilarating, harrowing and engrossing now as it must have been come its release in 1948. -10/10</fullReview>

The search for "the big hit" in one's life is still a topic today and will always be worth a story. It's really a masterpiece in every aspect of film-making, about what money (gold in this case) does to people, friendships and the psychological constitution! The film does this in a way, that's ahead of its time and will never be out of fashion (exept for the setting of the story maybe...).It is a brilliant mixture of stylistics that belong to the Action, Drama, Western, Adventure and even a bit of the Comedy-Genre. A gripping tale with funny, thrilling parts, as well as quiet undertones and great dialog that raises important questions and always keeps the viewer thinking! You can watch this movie with your family as well as your girlfriend or a couple of buddies - it has something to give for everyone who is into good movies. I cannot recommend this one higher!!! One of the best films of all time and surely a candidate for the Top 20 here on IMDb!</fullReview>

Dobbs is walking down the street without any money in his pockets.He meets Bob Curtin and they meet an old prospector named Howard.Together they head for the mountains looking for gold.The old man says gold changes a man.And that is true with Fred.He becomes delusional thinking Howard and Bob are after his gold.John Huston is the director of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948).The story is based on the 1927 novel written by the mysterious B. Traven, which I haven't read.The brilliant Humphrey Bogart plays Fred.He does excellent job as the man who becomes crazy over gold.Director's father Walter Huston plays the old and wise Howard.He did his job so well he won an Oscar.Actually both father and son won those awards.Tim Holt is fantastic as Bob Curtin.His father Jack Holt plays Flophouse Bum.Bruce Bennett plays James Cody and he's great.And so is Barton MacLane as Pat McCormick.The villain Gold Hat is played by Alfonso Bedaya.It is the young Robert Blake in the part of Mexican boy selling lottery tickets.Director Huston plays American in Tampico in White Suit.Bogart keeps asking him to help a fellow American down on his luck.This movie was one of the first Hollywood films to be filmed almost entirely on location outside United States.That means the state of Durango and street scenes in Tampico, Mexico.Only the night scenes were filmed in the studio.They didn't get to finish the film on time, making Bogart miss his boat race, but it was all worth it.The viewer gets many moments of thrills while watching this movie.You get the feeling of the burning sun over the mountains.</fullReview>

A couple of tramps persuade a old time prospector to help them search for gold in the far reaches of the Mexican desert. Various adventures follow and in their quest for gold this story illustrates paranoia, greed, desperation, sacrifice and redemption. All the actors give powerful and convincing performances and one can virtually taste the dirt, dust and grime as the prospectors toil for their rewards. The old timer is the real star and he won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance,and justifiably so.

		<fullReview>My dad has told me for years that this is one of his favourite films and he knows a good movie when he sees one. He wasn't wrong! As tough and uncompromising as the mountains from which the three protagonists attempt to extract the gold that will make their fortune, this unconventional, wholly unglamourous but riveting movie becomes almost a masterclass in production. The story engages from the start as do the characters and the situations that overtake them in their quest as they encounter an unwanted carpetbagger, rogue bandits and friendly Indians in turn, all of which significantly affect their respective fates. Bogart, long-haired and wild-looking, is at his best here in an unsympathetic role as the selfish and ornery Dobbs but it was Walter Huston, the director's father, who deservedly got the acting Oscar for his engaging portrayal of the world-weary but still perceptive old-timer who ultimately accepts with good grace the turnaround in their fortunes at the close and in truth is the only one to benefit materially as well as spiritually from the experience. Don't forget Tim Holt either, the little remembered third lead, who acts as an effective counterweight between Bogart and Huston and certainly isn't found wanting in the acting stakes. Huston's writing and direction are of course both of the highest standard, the script displaying an understanding of the motivations of desperate men while his direction prefigures Sergio Leone's predilection for characterful close-ups. He even has the courage to let a scene unfold spoken entirely in Spanish as further testimony to realism. There's also a great knockdown bar-room fight as Bogart and Holt waylay their rascally foreman who attempts to sell them short for wages due, where you feel every blow and fall as it happens. In short, there's little to criticise (perhaps it could have benefited from just a little injection of humour here and there to leaven the narrative) in this very masculine (women barely feature in the drama), very wonderful Hollywood classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure spun gold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a thing of beauty when one sees a film that is, quite simply, a treasure. Of all the great films that have been measured and studied from the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s, this one stands out as one of the best. Humphrey Bogart stands tall in giving one of his greatest performances as the cynical, hot-tempered, and paranoid Fred C. Dobbs who goes to search for gold with Tim Holt's Curtin and Walter Huston's Howard. Huston's son, John, directs and writes the screenplay in much the same fashion as another classic of his, The Maltese Falcon. Once again, Bogart is the key character, but in this one he is much less likable. All performances aside, the story is the true strong part of this film. It plays so smoothly and slowly convinces us that no matter who you are or what you find, human nature and greed will tear anyone apart and destroy any relationship. A terrific film all the way around, and the final image is to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Greed All Nature Is Too Small.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about a shady down-and-outer made crazy by greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is barren and downcast, the nicest character in it dies protecting men who were about to kill him, and the ending is not just a downer but like the universe peeing on the protagonist's hopes, creating a chancy undertaking not as an object in itself but as a determination, sort of a yardstick of its characters. It concerns an ethical disconnect between a foresighted old man and Dobbs, an unreasonably suspicious middle-aged man, with a young man coerced into dividing solidarity. It tells this story with enthusiasm and Huston's insatiable appetite for male brotherhood, and it periodically cracks itself up, sometimes because it's amusing, other times sourly double-edged. It transpires on a high, thickety, oven-baked terrain, mostly desert, save for the three gold prospectors, yet clans of bandits and villages of Indians actualize when needed.The nerve center of the movie takes place on the faces of mountains, which the title names while the characters never do. They are so vulnerable in this terrain that only the old man's seasoned intuition and iffy Spanish get them through. They begin as partners, but the second they unearth real gold, Dobbs grows eager in his greed, submitting they divide their gains three ways, every night. Soon they're hiding their gold separately, and there is a long night when Dobbs awakens in the tent to find the old man gone, and then the young man rouses to find Dobbs gone, until the old man sees the turn has come back around to him and so why don't they get some sleep since they have work to do tomorrow."I know what gold can do to men's souls," Howard says early in the movie. He plays a diplomatic placater, agreeing with Dobbs' unreasonable ideas as he knows they will make little difference when all is said and done: Either they'll make off with their gold, or they won't. Listen to the way the senior Huston talks, bullet-time, without pause, as if he's summarizing an old story and doesn't have time to waste on detail. He does a much talked-about dance when he eventually discovers gold, playing the archetype of a gray prospector, but see how his eyes are periodically quiet even when he's playing the fool. He deduces every situation, knows his choices, tries to slow Dobbs' breakdown.Bogart shows not a semblance of star ego in the role. He plays a character who declines firmly as the narrative progresses. The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart bravely makes Fred C. Dobbs into a lamentable, terrified, mercenary man, so out-of-sorts we begin to sympathize with him. The other two characters get somewhat what they deserve at the end of the film, and with less gratification for the audience. As the stories of the other two men dissolve into formula, Fred C. Dobbs somehow moves to a higher plane of tragedy. Hearing things in the night, despairing for a drink of water, wobbling under the desert sun with the gold he coveted so obsessively, Dobbs is the tragic hero brought down exactly by his weaknesses. There is a merciless, unadorned realism in these scenes that brings the movie to frankness and reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The (1948) **** (out of 4) One of the all time great films has Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt playing down on their luck Americans try to make something of themselves in Mexico. After the two come into some money they decide to try their luck at gold searching with the help of a veteran (Walter Huston). Huston picked up an Oscar for his direction as well as the screenplay, which to me is the key to the success of this film. To me this film has one of the greatest and richest screenplays in film history and that's why this thing turned out to be the masterpiece that it is. I guess it shouldn't come as a shock to read that the film wasn't a success when originally released and that's certainly understandable as I'm sure many people didn't want to see an ugly picture about ugly characters. The whole notion of the story is that greed is evil and gold can turn any man to do bad things. None of this is truer than when it comes to the character of Fred C. Dobbs, the Bogart character. Bogart deserves a lot of credit for being willing to jump out of his safe and comfortable roles and do something quite challenging. There are countless scenes that could have embarrassed the actor but he nails everything so perfectly that you can't help but think of this when discussing his greatest works. The screenplay allows his character to grow, or fall apart if you will, so richly that Bogart perfectly soaks up the craziness that befalls his character as the gold begins to add up. Walter Huston rightfully won an Oscar for his performance, which is among the richest of his career. There isn't a single second in the film where you think you're seeing an actor because Huston is so believable in the role that you don't for a second believe him as a real prospector knowing every step of the game. Holt never did become a huge star, which is a shame because he too delivers an excellent performance. As great as Huston and Holt are there's no denying that the film belongs to Bogart. But once again the brilliant and complete screenplay is where a lot of the credit must go because it doesn't shy away from the dark and ugly nature of man. Huston does a wonderful job in his direction because he holds the three characters together even as they each start to gain and lose portions of their mind, faith and reasons for being on the journey. In the end this remains one of the greatest American movies ever made and its riches are a lot more valuable than the gold the three characters are so desperately searching for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is not good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1925, Tampico, Mexico, Fred C Dobbs is on the bum until he meets and befriends fellow American Bob Curtin. After finding a bit of work with a shifty contractor (and literally having to fight for their hard earned pay), they meet the colourful Howard, an old Klondike prospector who regales the men with stories of gold. After a bit of fortune comes Fred's way, the two men enter into a journey with Howard to mine gold from the Sierra Madre hills, but it's a journey that will not only bring personal pressures, but also interference from outside sources.A contender for John Huston's greatest film, The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre oozes class from every single frame. Boasting top line performances from Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs), Tim Holt (Curtin) and Walter Huston (Howard), Huston's gloriously humane adaptation of the Berwick Traven novel plays out devilishly as a cautionary tale of greed and its pitfalls. This is a film that most have heard about, the word of mouth reputation is well deserved, so I myself don't feel the need to try and sell the picture to anyone reading. John Huston won golden statues for both Best Director and Best Screenplay (one of the best screenplays of the 40s to my mind), whilst Walter Huston picked up the Best Supporting statue to make it one happy day in the Huston household.What is of interest to me is that there was not a nomination for Bogart here, quite possibly his Dobbs portrayal is one of his most effective, yet with it being a veer from the norm I can't help thinking that is why it was sadly ignored. It can't have helped that studio bigwigs were vocal in their displeasure at Bogart playing such a morally challenged character, the public reaction at the time as well was less than favourable, but time has proved it to be a great Bogart show in what is firmly, and rightly so, hailed a classic of classics. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Paul Thomas Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood' a short time ago and loved every second of it, I felt I owed it to myself to watch 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.' Anderson has gone on record to say that he sat down with it every night before he started filming and the influences are all too clear; desperate penniless men scrabbling among dust and rock for a fortune, only to lose their souls when they find it. This isn't the only area that 'Treasure' has seeped into the public consciousness though; that old Texan billionaire that occasionally turns up on The Simpsons? That's Walter Huston's prospector all over. Every person that's turned up at a fancy dress party wearing a Pancho, sombrero and plastic bullet belt while speaking in a ridiculous Mexican accent? They'd be dressed as regular cowboys if it wasn't for Alfonso Bedoya's villainous bandito. The character on the front of Golden Nugget's cereal boxes? That's...well, I'm sure you get the picture by now. 'Treasure' is no mere catalogue for pop-culture aficionados though, it's powerful stuff. A sermon on greed and madness, it has three terrific actors bouncing off each other as the central characters and John Huston, one of Hollywood's all time greats at the very top of his game.That being said, there's still one problem with it. Well, not the film itself per se, more the marketing side of things, as "Storming to a New High in High Adventure" must be one of the most misleading taglines out there. It makes 'Treasure' sound like a ripping, boy's own yarn when in actual fact, it has more in common with the likes of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' than anything else. It concentrates on two destitute drifters named Fred Dobbs (Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Holt) who pitch in with grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) to go on a search for gold in the mountains of Mexico. They throw all their money together and purchase some mining equipment before heading for the hills. Finding the gold seams is difficult enough, but keeping themselves sane facing the intense heat, violent bandits and the growing paranoia proves an even more challenging task. They rot slowly mind. The tension builds at a gradual but constant pace throughout and makes for one incredibly gripping film. It all starts innocently enough with the trio debating on how best to divide up the gold but no matter what, the nagging suspicions keep growing louder the more they dig. Huston handles this with remarkable skill to the extent you find yourself asking what you would in their place as the story unfolds and the results aren't pretty. This lends itself to some very memorable scenes, Curtin stumbling onto Dobb's stash and the ensuing accusations is an early highlight, but perhaps the strongest comes towards the middle of the film when Curtin reads aloud a letter they find in the wallet of a dead prospector. As the lines flow from his mouth, Curtin's eyes betray a deep sense of sadness, the realisation of how far they are slipping playing out on Tim Holt's anguished face. But then this is indicative of the entire film as there isn't a bad performance to be had. Bogart as usual works his surly anti-hero muscles to their maximum effect but it is the Oscar winning Walter Huston who steals the show. His Howard is wise and learned, but possesses a wicked sense of humour that helps lighten the material and stops it being a non-stop gloom marathon.Needless to say, 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is a very rewarding movie and one that demands repeat viewings. The relationship between wealth and happiness fits healthily alongside a central premise of three men risking the fires of hell through their actions. None of them are likely to come out of it with their consciences clean and despite having a surprisingly upbeat ending, you know that some of the scars they've earned in the wilderness will never truly heal. Granted, at 126 minutes the pace does lag now and again but all in all, this is an excellent film and truly deserving the 'classic' tag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people talk about the "good old days" of film-making, they are usually misguided- the same years that brought "The Maltese Falcon" and "Casablanca" brought "Attack of The Killer Shrews" and "Robot Monster". But in this case, it is absolutely true. Many blockbusters today have thin plot, bad acting and great special effects. This film, while already very good with an above-average plot, good music, and wonderful editing and script, really excels in one thing: acting. Every character is perfectly believable through the entire movie, and occasionally (if the movie was filmed without a panning shot camera) you would probably think that is was real instead of simply acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It was made back when they made good movies, with stories and plots. I can see it over and over. There's a scene in the beginning, when Howard is talking about looking for gold and how it changes men. This scene foreshadows the whole movie. The change in Dobbs (Bogart) is gradual, until he is completely insane. It's not just about looking for gold, it's about partners going out and trying to make money. Things are fine as long as you're not making any money, but when you start to get successful, that's when the problems start. This movie is a real insight into human nature. Howards explanation about why gold is valuable is actually quite true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, the period directly after World War II and the years that followed were the true golden age of cinema, producing the best films ever made. In Europe, they cranked out Italian neo-realism and the French New Wave, which followed Franch cinema's romance with gritty gangster films.And what of America? Hollywood moved from studio to location filming, developed film noir (although it didn't know it was doing it) and tackled "realistic" film themes with a vengeance. It gave us "The Best Years of our Lives" and countless other masterpieces, "Treasure of Sierra Madre" is one of them.From the novel by the mysterious B. Traven, this is a seemingly simple morality tale about three Yankees prospecting for gold in the Mexican mountains, fighting off marauding banditos, but more importantly, fighting off their own personal demons and in some cases, losing.Shot partly on location in Mexico and partly on a studio backlot, it looks both brutally real and cheesy at the same time. Brilliantly directed by John Houston, it is today best remembered for Humphrey Bogart's amazing character performance as Fred C. Dobbs, the blow hard drifter whose paranoia eventually destroys him.Bogart, who had spent years in Hollywood in supporting roles, mostly as gangsters and thugs, had risen in the 40s to the spot where he was Hollywood's number one leading man, in part because the mannered tough guy persona he had perfected to play bad guys proved to be the perfect lone wolf image for the 40s. But with "Treasure" he moved into a whole new realm, taking on character roles which would prove the best of his career. They would include his performances in "African Queen" and perhaps his best role, in "Cain Mutiny." But ironically, in "Treasure," Bogie is out gunned by Walter Houston, who deserved the academy award he picked up for best supporting actor. His grizzled, but wise old miner is simply one of those roles that are unmatched in cinema --the culmination of decades of hard work and impeccable craftsmanship."Treasure" is a wonderful movie on so many levels. It is a wonderful example of a real life adventure tale --one that people could have and did actually live.But more than anything else, it is the American experience -- put on film. It is the tale of three men who go to a foreign country to seek their fortune ---and of what the process of getting rich does to each of them. There is no more American story than that."Treasure of Sierra Madre" is right up there on my list of the best films ever made in any era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I've finally watched THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, and I found it to be one of those tough films to comment on, perhaps due to its very excellent reputation. I found Bogart to be very good in the movie, and I also enjoyed Walter Huston's performance and could see how he earned his award. The earlier scenes of the movie - before the men ventured out on their search for gold - actually impressed me more than the main parts of the film did. The classic moments where Dobbs is asking John Huston for a hand out again and again; bitching at the pesty little kid (Robert Blake!); beating the hell out of his "boss" when he tries to pull a fast one. These were my favorite scenes.Once the trio of buddies is out in the heat, prospecting for their gold, I have to say that while the tension and acting was very good, I just guess I had a hard time both accepting and believing that Bogart could actually go THAT nuts, and wind up turning against his friends like that. Paranoia and greed is one thing, but it just didn't sit right with me for this character of Dobbs - especially after we'd seen what a fair guy he is back when he only took his share of the salary instead of grabbing the whole wad of bills from his beaten "employer" (then again, I'm sure the turnabout was supposed to be the idea). It just didn't ring true for me that he could do what he did to his pal. I understand that it was the desert heat getting the best of him, and especially the gold working its ugly spell as the "root of all evil," but it just hit me as improbable and excessive that things would or could go to THAT much of an extreme. Dobbs became a man possessed, and the effect was often more farcial than it was intense.I think director John Huston turned in a fine piece of cinematic work, and for technicality and acting (more than content) I did like this film enough to give it *** out of ****. I thought Bogart gave a very good performance, albeit one that I didn't really want to see happen to his character and one which I had a hard time swallowing actually could. I wouldn't be against seeing it again and re-evaluating it further, somewhere down the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart really shows his acting chops in this one. Sometimes it's more the material and the cool, calm, and collected man that make his pictures great, but here ... Bogart is simply astounding. The pains at which he goes from rags to riches to insanity (so to speak) is honestly one of the best and most subtle performances of the 40's. The film touches on greed and the dark spaces in the human soul down in the trenches. The black and white cinematography adds a rough exterior to the film and its subject matter much like "The Ox-Bow Incident". Ignore any naysayers ... this is one for the top x-number lists!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps fathers and sons should work together more often. I had known The Treasure of the Sierra Madre just as the answer to a trivia question until tonight. (What movie saw father and son both win Oscars?) Now I know it as a classic American film.John Huston won Oscars for best screen play and best directing, while his father, Walter Huston, won the Best Supporting Actor award. Add in Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt and you have a classic. What surprises me is that Ted McCord was not honored for his superb black &amp; white cinematography.SPOILERSThe story is a simple one and one that has been the basis of many movies: greed has the potential to transform trusting friends into ruthless, scheming desperardoes-especially when one of them suffers from paranoia. Two Americans (Bogart and Holt), living as vagrants in Mexico in 1925, meet an old codger (Huston) in a flophouse and are captivated by his stories of prospecting for gold. They wind up forming a three-way partnership with the old-timer-whom the younger men foolishly predict they will have to carry on a backpack-and heading for the hills.They battle bandits, a suspicious American (Bruce Bennett), heavily-armed Mayan descendants and the elements, but succeed in panning more than $100,000 in gold-probably $2-5 million today. Without giving everything away, let me just say that everyone shows his true colors before the end.Huston's direction is excellent, as Fred Dobbs (Bogart) slowly comes unraveled, in one of his best screen performances. (It is a precursor of his excellent work in a similar role six years later in The Caine Mutiny.) Bogy was probably better at playing the paranoid who THOUGHT he was a cool, tough guy (while doubting it on another level) instead of someone who really WAS a cool, tough guy. Holt, one of the great cowboy stars of his day (immortalized in the Statler Brothers' song `Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?'), adds depth and a moral conscience to the film. Obviously the elder Huston does, too. One of Hollywood's (and Broadway's) most respected actors of his era, Huston had been nominated for Oscars more than once, before his energetic work as the cantankerous Howard did the trick in Sierra Madre.McCord's camera work, along with the film editing of Owen Marks, makes this a true classic of the black &amp; white era. The men's faces take on demonic glows in the crackle of the campfire, as they struggle against temptation and greed. Bogart's visage, especially, becomes satanic, as the hell-like flames dominate the screen.While it does seem to bog down just a tad in a few places, this beauty has aged well and still stands as one of Hollywood's best westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We ain't got no stinkin' badges!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, one of the funniest lines in cinema, certainly one of the most famous, is actually (as afficionados know) a misquote. What Alfonso Bedoya, who plays "Gold Hat," actually says, when he and his bandito friends are asked for their badges, is "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!" I wonder if anybody at the time had any idea how funny this would hit audiences.John Huston wrote the screenplay (adapting B. Traven's novel) and directed his father, Walter Huston along with Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Bruce Bennett in this classic from my favorite age of cinema (the late forties/early fifties). Walter Huston won an academy award as Best Supporting Actor in 1948 and John Huston garnered Oscars for his direction and his screenplay. Bogart won nothing, but I have to say he did a great job.It's easy to think of Humphrey Bogart as always playing Humphrey Bogart as he has done in so many movies, particularly in mysteries and especially as a private eye. But here we see a different Bogart, one who is not entirely sympathetic; indeed as the down and out Fred C. Dobbs he is a bit of a scoundrel and more than a little paranoid. In watching this one realizes that Bogart had a much greater range than he is sometimes given credit for. I also recall him alongside Katharine Hepburn in The African Queen (1951) also directed by John Huston, and in The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the former he did win an Oscar, and in the latter, as Captain Queeg, he gave perhaps his most unforgettable performance.This is a tale of greed and the fever that arises when one hunts for gold. Walter Huston plays a crusty old miner named Howard who tries one more time to strike it rich. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are seduced by the wily old miner's romantic tales and the three of them go off into the Sierra Madre mountains near Tampico, Mexico to prospect. Naturally they hit pay dirt, but in-between the growing madness of Dobbs and the Mexican bandits, theirs is an uneasy existence. What happens to the gold and to the three men is fascinating to watch, and we sense a timeless human psychology at work. Bob Curtin expresses part of it this way: "You know, the worst ain't so bad when it finally happens. Not half as bad as you figure it'll be before it's happened."This movie is as good as its reputation, which is considerable, but it's not perfect. Some of it plays a little too simplistically, as when Howard saves the Mexican boy amid the worshipful natives, and some of it is a little silly, as when the bandits mistake gold for sand--not likely! But the almost epic quality of the tale and the felicitous direction as well as many interesting and humorous touches, make this one of the best ever made, and something no true film buff should miss. By the way, the little Mexican boy who sells Dobbs the lottery ticket is a bronzed up Robert Blake.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>SPOILERS WITHIN! BEWARE!Alright, I finally saw it and now I'm a believer! I thought it was terrific! It was well-acted, very interesting, and hilarious! The dialogue was amazing. Lightning fast and very clever. Everybody was good (except that fake-looking little "Hey Seen-yor" Mexican boy) but Walter Huston stole the show! Garrulous, squinty-eyed, and stubbly, he was crotchety but lovable (and loving too). Probably his best scene is when he's taunting Dobbs and Curtin about being so dumb "there's nothing to compare" them to and then doing his little "Eureka-shuffle". I burst out laughing. And I think that little dance (without music) must've been an influence on David Lynch. Though technically not really a "crime caper" this movie follows and creates alot of the conventions of the genre. As the seeds of dissension and greed are growing, we know that at some point this partnership will dissolve and the s*** will hit the proverbial fan. Also, you can't have a crime caper without the good old camp-fire, "What're you gonna do with your share?" conversation. This is most recently reprised in "O Brother, Where art Thou?" (Why is it that, at heart, the true motivation for every criminal is to get some land and start a farm or to open a restaurant where everyone will have to call him "Sir"?) Finally, this old classic has CAUTIONARY TALE emblazoned over every line. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I think Huston makes his message clear without being too preachy. At its core, "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" is a good-hearted celebration of the real treasures in life: friendship, love, and helping people out. True to the format, we see the bad guy (or more accurately: the good guy turned bad guy) Fred C. Dobbs get his just desserts. After he shoots Curtin and leaves him for dead we get his little soliloquy on the peskiness of a conscience. Then, as he lays his head down, we see the camp-fire flames rise (the flames of a hellishly tormented conscience). Finally, after stumbling around miserably (in a very "Twilight Zone" fashion), Fred C. Dobbs gets his at the hand of the despicable, (and really creepy) Banditos. He is beaten, clobbered with a dirt-clod, hacked with machetes, and (more importantly) plundered. He may die with his boots on but, alas, he doesn't get to keep 'em.And the good guys get the goods, right? Well, not exactly. In a painful-to-watch scene Walter and Curtin track down the stolen bags of gold (fruit of their months of labor) only to find that they've been emptied and blown away by a violent windstorm. (This reminds me of the end of "The Killing" where the suitcase full of money is blown away). Of course, their rewards (though only implied) are still forthcoming and, while less financial than they'd initially hoped for, they're still pretty dreamy. Walter will go to be the patron saint of a little Indian village where he will be adored, fed, massaged, and probably end up fatter than Colonel Kurtz in "Apocalypse Now". Curtin is going to deliver the news of Cody's death and hopefully slip right in as his surrogate. (Apparently Cody's wife rejecting a good, sturdy man isn't even a possibility). In spite of its many peccadilloes (and often because of them) "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" has become one of my favorite movies and I look forward to watching it again soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart is Freddie Dobbs, an American down on his luck in Mexico in some run of the mill town suffering from the heat and the bad luck of scrapping for a meal. While getting nearly taken by a contractor, he meets up with Bob Curtin and the 2 overhear a fella named Howard about the classic 'gold in dem there hills'. Howard is a former prospecter and Dobbs and Curtin decide to ask Howard to take them into the hills and find only enough so they can get by. However the experienced Howard knows what gold can do to a man, and still takes them up to the Sierra knowing that even the most decent of men can think of the most evil things once gold is discovered.The film is a classic and has some great scenes as Dobb's literally descends into madness. Howard is a classic character and the heat is certainly oppresive in this film. However, the film I felt was a little lengthy than it needed to be, but it shows what greed can do perfectly. Take heart wall street, and make sure you set your limits and try not to carry all those buros down the hill by yourself. You just might end up with less than you bargained for.Rating 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dusty, grimy film is such a paradox of different moods, it is something to see. TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE is an adventure flick that also happens to explore the depths of human nature in certain situations. Its greatness lies in the performances and double takes the Humphrey Bogart character throws at co-stars Tim Holt and Walter Huston, the great character actor father of the director (John Huston). Bogart plays "Fred C.Dobbs" in a noticeably unique change of pace from his usually slick and fast-talking characters. Greed, gunfights and hard labor are key elements of the adventure which centers on a gold rush that would test any kind of person, considering the conditions. Mexico was no easy bag to travel through in 1925 as the Great Depression was in full swing.Walter Huston turns in what many consider to be his best acting as the "old man" who tries to be both father-figure and referee to Holt and Bogie. Huston is always way ahead of the two rivals during their journey through the plains and mountains. They strike gold, of course, and the film's screenplay takes off at this point. The elder Huston warns us in the opening sequence that "ther's no tellin' what gold could do to a man," and indeed he is right. Bogie is clearly headed towards insanity, while Holt tries to hold his own. Huston is the optimistic, yet cynical centerpiece these guys need.The best scenes take place at night, especially when the three gold-diggers begin a comical trading of places, protecting their share of the gold. Bogart's face is shot in a manner that reveals to us his intentions and his oncoming madness. Director John Huston mixes location and studio shots well to create a relatively realistic gold rush in harsh terrain. Surprise is always in the air. You never know who the good guys or the bad guys are. Greed is the most important part of human nature examined, especially through Bogie's character.TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE falls slightly within the Western Genre as well with Mounties chasing bandits and a one on three standoff over a watering hole in the dirt. The picture is fantastic at entertaining us and moving us simultaneously and Walter Huston is at his best in front of his own son's camera. Who knew best? Father or son? I guess they were quite a team in creating this Action/Adventure film for the ages.10 of 10 - NOTE: Yes, this is where Mel Brooks drew the inspiration for his famous "Badges" scene in the hilarious BLAZING SADDLES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I know what gold does to men's souls."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's 1948 classic 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is one of the most fascinating, thrilling and, above all, entertaining adventure films ever made. Huston teamed up with legendary Hollywood star Humphrey Bogart on six occasions, but never with more success than here, though one could certainly make a case for 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' or 'The African Queen (1951).' The story concerns two young Americans in Mexico (Bogart and Tim Holt) who team up with wizened old gold-digger Howard (Walter Huston, the director's father) to strike it rich in the remote Sierra Madre Mountains. They do, indeed, strike it rich, but human greed leads the group to gradually turn against each other, inevitably leaving them with nothing.Though Bogart began his career playing the sleazy villain, he truly made his name as a cinematic hero, a proud and decent gentleman who we could cheer for. 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' marks an anomaly in Bogart's later work, as we witness the promise of more gold tear apart Fred C. Dobbs' steadfast morals, ultimately sealing his own demise. His transformation is truly unsettling to watch, as Dobbs breaks down into a paranoid, mumbling wreck of a man. After attempting to murder one of his comrades, he tries desperately to justify his actions to himself: "Conscience. What a thing. If you believe you got a conscience it'll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you got one, what could it do t'ya?"Regardless of how brilliant Bogart was, it's been argued that he was upstaged by Walter Huston as the tough and experienced old goldminer who's seen it all before. Huston Sr. won an Academy Award for his troubles, and, with his son winning both for Best Director and Best Screenplay, it was the only time in Oscar history that both father and son had won awards in the same year. Tim Holt, whose film appearances were generally limited to cowboy westerns, is also very good as Bob Curtin, the comrade whose loyalties are never swayed by the temptations of the gold. Also notable is Bruce Bennett as James Cody, a lone American who happens upon the site of the gold digging, and requests to be included in the venture.The film's screenplay, penned by John Huston, is loyally based on mysterious author B. Traven's 1927 novel of the same name. The film preserves much of the original story's dialogue, most notably by including the well-known (and often misquoted) "stinking badges" line, though the exact wording has been changed slightly. Whilst most film-goers erroneously exclaim "we don't need no stinking badges!," the precise wording in the film goes as follows: "Badges!? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinking badges!" The line itself is spoken by Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya, who plays Gold Hat, a Mexican bandit leader.With 'The treasure of the Sierra Madre,' great writing, directing and acting wonderfully combine to create one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of the twentieth century. Filmed largely on location in Mexico ? almost unheard of at the time ? the film has an authentic sense of adventure about it, ensuring that Huston's masterpiece will be remembered for many years to come.</fullReview>

Brilliantly well done adaptation of B.

A superb character study of human nature at it lowest. Bogart, Huston, and Holt all deliver very excellent performances. Won Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay for J. Huston and to W. Huston for Best Supporting Actor. That's Robert Blake as boy selling lottery tickets and John as an American tourist in the beginning of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morality play in the form of a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting is off by a few decades and a few hundred miles, but this is definitely a Western. If you ever wondered how Bogie would have fared in a Western, then here he is. The themes of typical Westerns are here -- a quest for gold in a frontier setting where lawlessness is still the norm. That much of the culture of the Old West is Mexican allows such a setting in a country that still had much wildness left after the American "Wild West" became civilized.We see Frank Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) as a down-on-his-luck American trying to scrape by in Mexico by doing construction work for oil drilling platforms. A few things start going right as he wins a lottery, and he starts craving wealth; Dobbs' worst tendencies, already appearing as 'survival skills', come to the fore: greed and paranoia. He starts hearing rumors of gold, and with the aid of a fellow roughneck Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) and a grizzled prospector Howard (Walter Huston) -- a figure of elder wisdom and modest demands -- goes searching for it while evading bandits.Dobbs gets greedier as he gets more gold, demanding a bigger share than others, and eventually getting more through devious means. As he gets in possession of more gold whatever shreds of decency disappear. Finally he drives off his partners and gets the gold.To avoid a spoiler, let me paraphrase Scripture: "Whatsoever profiteth it a man that he gain the world yet lose his soul?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two American men (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt) go down to Mexico to work for a building contractor (Burton MacLane). After a job is finished and they finally get their money from their suspicious boss, the duo run into an old man who appears to be a prospector (dominant Oscar-winner Walter Huston). He claims there is gold to be found in the hills and all he needs to fund a search is a little money. Conveniently Bogart and Holt have just gotten their pay. The trio then goes and amazingly finds the titled treasure, but what happens next? A story of greed, corruption, emotional fireworks and double-crossing paints a vivid picture of the human condition in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre". Writer/director John Huston (Oscar-winning in both categories) crafted easily his finest movie with this one. The ingenious casting of Walter Huston (John's real-life father) ended up being one of the best decisions ever in the history of film. Bogart, arguably the finest American actor of any era, dominates at well-calculated times and then allows himself to take a backseat to the imperative story and to the stunning performances of his fellow co-stars. John Huston even makes a striking cameo as an American traveler early on. Excellent all the way around. Quite possibly Bogart's second best film ("Casablanca"). 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not everything that's old has aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven.One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious.I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic.There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Treasure of the Sierra Madre", aside from being a great adventure flick, makes for unsettling viewing as we see Humphrey Bogart (having made his name playing tough guys) slowly go insane with paranoia. But the whole movie is like a sick cosmic joke as the three protagonists actually end up finding gold, only to lose it again through avarice, some nasty bandits and just plain lousy luck. It feels like a comment on both the pitfalls of capitalism and the corruptibility of man. It's all well and good until riches come between you and the rest of your crew.But a great trip nonetheless, and a great piece of rugged movie-making.7/10</fullReview>

Dobbs, an American struggling to find a job and meets up with Bob Curtin played by Tim Holt. The two of them eventually team up with the prospector and set out to the Mexican mountains in search of gold. This film is an outstanding character study, the film is appropriate for all audiences and is quite funny.

		<shortDescription>This is a cute movie, but it has stylistic issues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is up with these older movies. There are interesting stories and good cinematography, but I do not get the overacting. Maybe it is meant to compensate for the lack of color in the film or maybe it is the uneasy transition from the habits acquired in silent films where you had to do all your acting with your body. I do not know about that but I know Humphrey Bogart, as one of the main characters, starts overacting the hell out of this film.And the dialogue is often written for that occasion. "Just like I thought" and "I know what your game is" (while making sudden gestures) are the kind of sentences you can hear in this film.It does not get much better in the physical department. There is a scene where a guy is eating near the fire and he is crouching in the most uncomfortable unnatural position no one would ever eat in, unless of course they were posing for a camera, for a specific shot. The movie is not all like this but a lot of it is.Other than that, the composition in the scenes is good. In fact, if this movie was a comic book, a set of paintings or drawings, it would have been a fun experience I bet. And when the actors occasionally stop overacting, it does become a fun experience, but then it goes back to cartoonish.The movie actually keeps going from normal to cheesy to normal to crazy. And the normal makes the crazy stand out even more.But if you do not mind that the movie has a fit every now and then, it is still fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well played drama about a couple of down-and-out American's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/17/2013 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-John Huston): Well played drama about a couple of down-and-out American's in Mexico who come upon an older prospector to help them find Gold in the Sierra mountains. Humphrey Bogart plays the more emotionally unstable of the two, and Walter Huston plays the older experienced slightly crazy gold seeker. The theme of the movie is pronounced by Huston's character early on where he says that gold changes men. Bogart's character insists this is foolish talk, but gradually degrades from a man who just wants life to turn around for him -- to a man obsessed with getting as much as he can once they find their gold. Tim Holt plays the third man in the group and fights to keep his conscience clear despite all the temptations. This ensemble piece keeps you interested as you watch the characters react and change as they mine more of the gold dust. It is also an educational movie, because the process of mining is taught by Huston's character to his two younger students in different parts of the movie. The pluses of this movie are the story by the Director John Huston, the characters, the actors, and the simple pacing without a lot of extra un-needed fluff. Today's moviegoers might have a problem with the lack of booming special effects and fast paced action but it isn't needed for this movie. Bogart, in my opinion, was deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this portrayal -- as his feelings are so evident by his facial expressions. Bogart's rough outward appearance and his ability to portray emotions so effortlessly along with his everyday-man appeal made him a famous actor -- but this was not a popular character and he pulls it off perfectly. This is a very well done drama by a much heralded director and it doesn't disappoint and shouldn't age because of how real it comes across.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema."We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No award for a great performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Treasure of the Sierra Madre" has one distinction that sets it apart form all other movies for all time. It is the only film to date for which a father and son each won Academy Awards. It's a distinction that isn't likely to happen ever again. There have been other father and son Oscar winners the same year, but not for the same single movie.The father was veteran actor Walter Huston who played the old prospector, Howard. He won the Oscar for best supporting actor. The son was John Huston. He won double Oscars for the film, for best director and best writing of a screenplay. The film also was nominated for best picture in a field of very excellent movies. "Hamlet" won the best picture award that year, with Laurence Olivier taking the best actor Oscar for his memorable performance in that film. A somewhat unusual aspect of the Academy Awards that year is that all five of the movies nominated for best picture were dramatic tragedies or mysteries. But only three of five best actor nominees were from this field ? the other two being from a comedy and a musical, respectively. While all the performances in the best actor field were very good, the competition there was not as rigid as was that for best picture. So, the absence of one nominee for best actor is very curious. Many critics I have read think that Humphrey Bogart's role of Fred Dobbs is the best performance ever given or filmed showing the degradation of a character. His gradual transformation occurs in small, subtle doses. Bogart's acting is so good, that we just get hints of the deterioration of his character until near the end. We see a man who has gone from a regular Joe looking for work and scraping jobs together to survive, to a madman made paranoid by greed. The absence of a best actor nomination for Bogart in 1948 stands out as a miscue for Hollywood. What politics might have been at play in Tinseltown that year? Were the Hollywood elite snubbing Bogie for some reason? Were there one or two sentimental choices that edged Bogie out? What was going on at that time that would result in the obvious omission of a nomination for one of the truly great acting performances ever put on film? We may never know ? at least I haven't read any reviews that shed light on books or other sources of information about this. One thing is likely though. Bogart's performance in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" will continue to be studied, held up and emulated in acting schools and training classes for decades to come. That this movie tops all other films for 1948 in viewer ratings and polls says a lot. It's also on most lists of the top films of all time. That's testimony to a truly great film, with two truly great performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic About Gold and Greed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer and director John Huston teamed up again with Humphrey Bogart to make the immortal masterpiece "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" with Walter Huston and B-movie western hero Tim Holt. Huston received Oscars for both writing and directing this insightful study of men under pressure in the wilderness. Huston's father Walter walked off with a Best Supporting Actor statuette, too. Walter and John won Golden Globes as Best Supporting Actor and Director. The New York Film Critics Circle gave "Treasure" their Best Picture award, and Huston received Best Director. Writers Guild of America, USA, cited Huston for writing the Best Written American Western and nominated him also for Best Written American Drama. Like most Huston movies, a group of men are shown doing something big and their relationship unravels as a consequence of their actions. Although this is not a bank robbery heist, Huston treats it like one because our heroes lose the fortune that they have chased like a will of the wisp into the parched deserts of Mexico. The formula in old-fashioned, Production Code-oriented crime movies was that the villains lost anything that they were able steal. Here, our prospectors lose everything which for they have struggled against well-nigh impossible odds to achieve.Unquestionably, "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" qualifies as a classic. This gritty, sweaty, hard-knuckled epic concerns three Americans stranded in Mexico and reduced to begging and sleeping in lice-ridden hotels. Humphrey Bogart delivers one of the finest performances of his career. He starts out like a model American citizen--down on his hells--before the attraction to gold turns him into a murderer. Even in black and white, Bogart's descent into murder is something to see. His eyes glow. Walter Huston makes most of the dialogue and the old timer an absolute treat to watch. Compared to these two thespians, Tim Holt appear dull but solid. Holt makes an earnest enough fellow and he comes closest to winning a model American citizenship award. The setting is nothing grand. If "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a western, Huston and company have confined themselves primarily to Mexico. The story is deceptively simple. Three men plunge into the wilderness and search for gold. Miraculously, they stumble onto a vein of ore. They end up lugging off $35-thousand a man. The older man warns his younger companions about the way that things happen. Since he has prospected for gold many times before and survived the experience, he has the better judgment and tells them what to prepare themselves for every inch of the way. Sealing up the mountain was a pre-politically correct thing to do for 1948. "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" looks stark in black and white, but there is a solid quality to the film that stands out in several scenes. Huston stages the barroom brawl with economy as he does the stand-off scene on the mountainside between our heroes and Gold Hat. Alfonso Bedoya makes a terrific bandit and his "stinking badges" lines are part of contemporary culture. The execution scene when Gold Hat steps out of line to retrieve his errant sombrero is a deft touch. Ironically, it doesn't stay on his head much longer. "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a model of vintage storytelling. Huston lets nothing get in the way of the narrative. Watch out for some of the violence, especially when Bogart gets what is coming to him. Look for writer and director John Huston in a cameo as the American tourist in the ice-cream white suit. He has three encounters with Bogart's adventurer. Barton MacLane has a supporting role early in the film as a crooked contractor and he tries without success to pull the wool over our heroes eyes. My only quibble with "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is that somebody should have recovered some of the gold at fadeout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed + Paranoia = Destruction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know from the very beginning of this movie that Humphrey Bogart isn't the nicest guy. Whether it is panhandling to the same person (without even recognizing the person's face) or throwing a glass of water in a young Mexican boy's face for pestering him about buying a lottery ticket, Bogart's character is instantly recognized for being more than just disgruntled with society. He has every right to get angry when he is ripped off by boss Barton MacLane who hires him for a hard job then disappears without paying him. He's actually honest in spite of all this, beating MacLane up and taking only what is owed him rather than MacLane's entire bankroll. But when he agrees to go panning for gold with quietly moralistic Tim Holt and hyper grizzled old Walter Huston, his true nature comes out. The three all disagree on how much gold they want to collect before cashing it in, but when they come up with an agreement, Bogart's greed, previously just light, becomes paranoiac, and he begins to distrust his pals. Holt and Huston are basically decent men, but their malevolent nature is revealed when Bruce Bennett shows up and wants to get in on the action. Should they: 1: Kill him? 2: Send him away and risk him reporting them for mining gold without a license? or 3: Include him in. They are about to do #1 when bandits show up and they realize they need him.This moralistic tale is confused as a western by some people even though it is set south of the American border. So if you want to call it a "Mexican Western" with its outdoorsy setting, bandits and grizzled nature, it is. But for some, it is much more than that. It could be compared to the 1995 film "Se7en", focusing on one of those seven deadly sins. Each of the three men must face moralistic decisions concerning their own greed, and Holt faces temptation when Bogart is injured in a mining cave-in. One of the reason Holt is often overlooked in this film is that his performance is very quiet compared to Bogart and especially Huston. He is the most moralistic of the three, although Huston is certainly the most likable. From the moment you see Huston's grizzled old geezer, you can't help but adore him. He's a more realistic portrayal of the feisty old men Charles "Chic" Sale, George 'Gabby' Hayes and Walter Brennan played, a character who seems to have caffeine running through his veins rather than blood. Bogart is fascinating to watch as his paranoia increases. Alfonso Bedoya is scarily memorable as the head of the bandits, while Robert Blake ("Baretta") is likable as the persistent Mexican kid.The film gives a varied portrayal of the Mexican natives whose lives are invaded by the three Americans. The bandits of course are presented as evil, not liked by their own people along with the Americans. These men are feared for their ruthless manner, first by robbing a train, then harassing some local villagers, and later attacking the American group. Then, there are the Mexican villagers who plea with the group to help them save a young boy unconscious after almost drowning. Their faith and traditions make an interesting twist in a film already riveting because of the theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold - It's all in the finding.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one film that never ceases to be of interest to me no matter how many times I watch it. The performances of the three main characters are outstanding. I particularly like Tim Holt as Bob Curtin. He has less to work with than Bogart whose paranoia and mental breakdown give him the chance to use all of his physical and vocal quirkiness. Walter Huston is also spectacular as the experienced older man who is wise, jovial, ebullient and serious when the moments call for it. Holt, however, plays a character who is just plain honest and without affectations. Beside Bogart and Huston, you would expect Holt to be the obvious weak link but it is Holt's character that "finds the gold" by the end of the film and Holt's performance is the unexpected gold in the film.Holt portrays strength of character in the face of temptation and provocation. Yes, Curtin thinks about leaving Dobbs in the mine cave-in but he does not. If he was above temptation, the significance of his character would be lost. Apparently, Holt asked for a temptation to do wrong scene so Curtin would not be seen as being without a potential character flaw. What I like about Curtin is that he voluntarily struggles to understand and struggles to do the right thing. In the face of Dobbs' paranoia and twisted logic, Curtin is out of his depth but will not resort to cruelty or violence. Holt's reading of the letter from Cody's wife after Cody has been killed by the bandits is one of the most poignant moments in film. I have heard some people say it was unnecessary but I feel that it is central to the main theme of the film - what is of true value in this world? Curtin's growing realisation as he reads is a tribute to Holt's ability as an actor. He evokes an awareness of his own destiny through the letter because Curtin has already revealed his plan to buy a peach orchard with his share of the gold. He wants to provide an activity for him and others to enjoy as he had done as a boy. Watch for the contrast as the self-centered Dobbs displays only a passing interest in what the letter has to say. His plans for his future wealth are for his own aggrandizement and the satisfaction of physical desires.When all seems lost at the end of the film, Curtin and old Howard weigh up exactly what has been discovered through their experience. Howard already knew it when he started out with his two inexperienced young goldseekers. It is the activity itself that Howard values. He is a prospector and he enjoys using all his skills developed over the years. He enjoys showing others what the whole experience of prospecting is all about. Howard even knows that it entails greed, mistrust and betrayal. I love the look he gives when Curtin and Dobbs shake hands on their commitment to their friendship. He knows it will be tested and fractured by gold. Why does Howard continue with the venture even though he knows where it could lead? Because it is part of the ride. There is a price to pay for prospecting with partners but he is willing to pay it for the excitement and camaraderie. In the end, Curtin has come to understand that finding fulfillment through having a purpose in life is all the gold anyone needs. Sharing that purpose with others makes it even more valuable. A simple truth but what a brilliant exposition of it by John Huston whose interpretation of the B. Traven novel produced a masterpiece.Tim Holt's career as an A grade film actor ended with his performance as Curtin. He went back to playing good guy cowboys in Saturday matinée second feature films. I hope the memory of his performance as Curtin sustained Holt because, in my opinion, every actor needs to know how good they can be at least once in a career. Tim, you were the gold in The Treasure.P.S. Watch for the look Walter Huston gives to the camera as the pretty Mexican Indian girl strokes his chin. He raises his eyebrows as he considers what he might do and then gives a slight shake of the head. No, it's not worth the effort for the wily old Howard. He knows that it is a trap for young players. It mostly doesn't live up to expectations and can lead to all sorts of problems that Howard just doesn't need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sierra Madre, I'm convinced, grows on you the more you watch it. Like Apocalypse Now, the movie shows us crazy characters on the march, moving from one crazy adventure to another. And like Apocalypse Now, these little stories shine with their own brilliance. I can't name and describe the episodes; to do so would hurt the first time viewer's pleasure. Yet I will say this: the episodes stand on their own AND (unlike Apocalypse Now) THEY link together coherently, so that the movie ends not with a whimper, but, instead, with a bang of existential brilliance. Sierra Madre, however, falls short in one area -- Steiner's score. Sometimes it intrudes on sequences better suited for silence. Other times it seems mismatched, introducing a levity that weakens the narrative's tensions. But then, sometimes, particularly the passage when human voices comingle with percussive rhythms, sometimes the score sounds about as good, as appropriate, and as perfect as film music can. Like Welles and Lang, Huston was a genius. Fortunately Hollywood never shut him down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of John Huston, a very accomplished and conscientius writer and director. BUT this is just a simple adventure tale, there's nothing deep about about it or should be found. It's straightforward, predictable, got old cliché morals, it's the more suitable for the kids. It's well crafted alright, but for what it is. And there are adventures, with juvenile tones or not, better, certainly. For people to say it's a summit of the art of the cinema in any aspect is not something i'll say i can't get through my head, fact is these people are talking nonsense, or more likely, don't have a presentable cinematic repertoire.

		<shortDescription>The cinema's best meditation on greed, bar none</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is the cinema's best meditation on greed, bar none. When a film can claim to be the best work of both John Huston and Humphrey Bogart, you know its something special. Absolutely everything about this classic is perfect and it hasn't dated a bit. The themes of loyalty and greed were obviously a huge influence on Sam Peckinpah and those themes are what make this film work so well. It realistically shows how riches can make even the most honest man become scheming and driven to madness. Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs is one of cinema's greatest madmen. The film is one of the few to successfully show a transformation from normality to insanity, showing two opposite yet in tuned personalities of one human.In addition to Bogart, everything else about the film is flawless. The direction by John Huston is exciting and funny and creates one of the finest screen adventures ever. The dialog in his screenplay often achieves a pure poetry, particularly the the cantankerous old prospector Howard's musings. Walter Huston deserved his Oscar for the role. The rest of the cast is great also. Special mention must go to Alfonso Bedoya in one of cinema's most reprehensible villain roles. The score by Max Steiner is his most memorable, and thats saying a lot. Plus, the ironic ending works much better than a more optimistic one would. "The Treasure of the Seirra Madre" is a masterpiece in every aspect and remains one of the greatest of all American films. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it weight in gold!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston and Humphry Bogart collaborated many times and have created many great films together, this being one of the best of the bunch, if not the second best, right behind "Maltese Falcon". This is a superbly made adventure drama, and a highly critical piece of commentary on society, and more specifically capitalistic societies. Within the three main characters Huston and writer B. Traven show how wealth and the desire for wealth corrupt men's souls and ultimately corrupt entire societies. In their blind lust and greed for wealth (or gold in the case of the movie) the plights of others are ignored, courtesy is exchanged for shrewdness and politeness is exchanged for malice. Even foreigners who happen along and want to share in the excess of wealth are ostracized and driven off, to the point of murder if they insist on sticking around. It is obvious that the writers had an agenda, if not to just create an amazingly entertaining film then to point out the ills of a society that is preoccupied with it's pursuit of wealth and it's misguided ideas of privilege. The fact that they are in Mexico seems to be an indictment of the way wealthy nations seem to exploit smaller nations in order to become wealthy. How poor nations are poor because others make use of the resources that they have. The fact that the main characters end up the way they do in the end is a direct result of who they are and the choices they made, but it may seem that the country they stole from finally got it's revenge on one of them, and the others get away with a lesser punishment, mainly they have their 'goods' taken back by the land they took it from.Aside from the political and social commentary by the writer of the book, B. Traven and the screenplay writer, John Huston, this is a wildly entertaining film and adventure. Back in a time when adventure films rarely left the realm of War dramas, this is a refreshing film experience. Huston creates a tense atmosphere of danger throughout the film. We feel the suspense from within the group of main characters to the outside elements that would cause harm to them. As anyone who comes along is a potential threat, to their quest for gold to their very struggle to survive. Huston makes this danger feel very real. Bogart's character is the most vibrant, and probably his best acting role ever! That is saying a lot. Bogart seems to take the viewer on a journey into madness, and when it happens it is shocking. In the beginning Bogart plays a sensible enough guy, just a little down on his luck, but otherwise a normal guy. That makes the transformation he makes all the more spectacular to watch. Tim Holt's character unfortunately falls victim to the madness swelling inside the gold hungry Bogart. Holt plays the average nice fellow, nothing spectacular about his character, except how average and nice he is, even when double crossed by Bogart's character. Walter Huston plays old man Howard, and his performance is marvelous as the crusty yet lovable world weary old man. His portrayal of the experienced gold digger is entirely believable, and very authentic. I cannot imagine anyone else playing that role and succeeding the way Huston does. I can just imagine the directer John Huston reading the book and thinking to himself, "dad would be great in this part!" And he certainly is.This film is like gold, it is worth what it is, cause there are so few films on par with it. It is so difficult to find a truly outstanding film these days, so when I see films I enjoy as much as this one, it is a real treasure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic tale of greed and corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was story about greed and man's ability to achieve an almost divine state of corruption, then this is it. This is a tale of three friends who in a bound of friendship set out to find gold in the Mexican Mountains. This friendship soon turns to hatred as the three prospectors develop an intense paranoia of each other.One of the prospectors Fred C dobbs (played by Humphery Bogart) in the space of two hours undergoes an incredible metamorphosis, changing from a rather personable down-and-outer to a homicidal maniac willing to kill his closest friends.This film was directed by John Huston and shot entirely on location at Jungapeo, Mexico. It cost an incredible $3 million to make, much to the despair of Jack Warner. After seeing a prelude of the film he exclaimed, they're looking for gold alright .. mine. He also did not like the fact that Bogart's character was killed off in the end, he felt it was a mistake. He was proved right as the public in 1948 did not like film, and it became a flop at the box office.The critics though love it and hailed it as a triumph for Huston and Warner pictures. Strangely enough everybody was honoured except Bogart. Perhaps seeing the hero of Casablanca and the Maltese Falcon as the degenerate, murdering psychopath was more than the academy could endure. He was not even nominated for a Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant study of greed...there's gold in these hills...POSSIBLE SPOILER...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart had some wonderful roles in his career--Captain Queeg in 'The Caine Mutiny' and the riverboat captain in 'The African Queen'--and his adept playing of detectives in 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep'. But 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' will always stand apart from all these other roles as his best.Not only is Bogie excellent as Fred C. Dobbs whose lust for gold triggers his descent into madness, but those around him are superb too--everyone, from Bruce Bennett to Tim Holt to Walter Huston--all give fine performances. Occasionally a set will look a bit studio-bound but what is important here is the fine script and the excellent direction of John Huston that brings out every nuance of a complex study of greed and what it does to men's souls.Max Steiner's score is varied and impressive with its pseudo-Mexican variations. The pace is slow because essentially this is a three-man character study of greed. Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat manages to look sinister when he smiles and says, "We don't need no stinkin' badges." The ending is artfully contrived, with the gold dust scattering to the winds.Summing up: A richly satisfying experience bolstered by Humphrey Bogart's greatest performance. It won the N.Y. Film Critics Award as Best Picture of 1948 while the Academy passed over it in favor of "Hamlet", beginning a trend by Hollywood to honor British films for their "classic" treatment of "the classics". They also saw fit to honor Sir Laurence Olivier over Bogart's prospector role. In any event, not to be missed. One of the all-time greats.</fullReview>

Like all the greatest movies, it has something profound to say about the human condition - in this case, greed, vanity, cruelty and fate. I don't know whether, in 1948, black and white was an artistic or an economic choice for Huston, but it turned out to be eminently correct.

My ONLY quibble with the film is Bogart'srapid transformation. His descent into madness is a bit too abrupt. However, I believe I detect the hammy hands of Jack Warner here. I'm certain some of the transition scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Huston's direction is far too assured elsewhere to suggest otherwise. Special mention must be made of Tim Holt's and Bruce Bennett's contributions to this film.

This film stands with the finest works of Steinbeck and Hemingway, the paintings of Thomas Hart Benton and Georgia O'Keefe just to name a few as some of the finest work American artists have offered the world. Based on B. Traven's marxist tome, the film centers around three prospectors encountering greed, betrayal and death while prospecting for gold in the Mexican mountains. I usually despise cynical films for they usually insult and assault the viewer, this instead enlightens and entertains in the truest Aristolitilian sense(bad spelling I know!). The photography, performances (Bogie's finest hour amoung many other fine hours), writing, staging and editing all add up to a most memorable event. I enjoy this film even more than Citizen Kane.

		<shortDescription>An excellent tale of greed and betrayal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's "The treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a great example of what an American classic is. Bogart stars as Fred C. Dobbs, a man living in the town of Tampico, who is always broke and can't find work to make money so begs for quarters on the street corners.One day, Dobbs hears a man asking for another person to go work for him. Dobbs goes but the man never pays and disappears when they get back to Tampico. However, Bogart and his friend find him and beat him until he gives them the money. The two men go to an inn where they hear an old man (Walter Huston) talking about gold and how to get it. This makes Bogart think and after convincing his friend (Tim Holt) to go with him, the two men go see the old man who is called Howard and he agrees without hesitation and so the three men set off to find gold. And so begins an adventure these three men will never forget.As soon as they begin finding gold, you see exactly how gold drove men crazy at that time. Bogart becomes paranoid and loses his trust in his two friends. The three men naturally don't have an easy life up there and you see quite well through the whole movie how the gold diggers reacted to gold at that time. The acting and directing are excellent but if you haven't seen it, you should see it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

Dobbs through the movie, the real story lies with the latter characters, especially in Holt's Bob Curtain.While I normally wouldn't have a huge problem with movie marketing schemes making a lesser character seem larger, the film actually centers a lot on Bogart's character. The problem with that is that Dobbs isn't a very dynamic character and his character doesn't change because of anything we see in the movie, but rather changes for the sake of the story, clearly marking his character as lesser, whereas Holt's character actually undergoes personal conflict which we get to see.The basic story goes that a couple of Americans in Mexico are down on their luck and have to live by begging from other Americans. But they overhear an old prospector talking about gold in the mountains and get themselves, with the prospector, out searching for the treasure of the Sierra Madre. And where gold is involved, there is suspicion, paranoia and, y'know: drama.The overall direction and the acting are good. It's just that the focus of the film is on a dramatically less interesting character, which I feel makes the film a little weaker. I did enjoy the suspense and the morality situations the characters were put in. But the Dobbs character seemed a little artificial and it's hard to stick with a film when its "main character" is written so one-dimensionally.Still, it's not a bad film, just not what I expected because of all the positive reviews and the way the film is marketed. Good, but not up to the hype. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Exactly My Favorite Bogart Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this one time. It was enough for me. For the acting alone - and for Walter Huston - I would give it five stars but no stars for anything else. Maybe it's just me, but watching a paranoid, greedy, whiny person act nasty for an hour toward two innocent good guys is is not my idea of entertainment, whether it's Humphrey Bogart (here, as "Fred C. Dobbs") or Elmer Fudd playing the lead. The only actor I enjoyed watching was Huston, which is no surprise. I always found him fascinating in whoever he played on film. Then again, I might have put up with this story better had it been a little shorter, but 120 minutes of this was too much. I really believe this is one of those movies that critics have made it far more than it really is, meaning vastly overrated. I like Bogart in many films, but not here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Huston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Compelling story, wonderful acting, interesting characters, great screenplay. The movie is a somewhat stagy, but that is offset by one of the best performances ever in a Hollywood movie, namely that of Walter Huston. Mr. Huston is truly the star of this movie. He is without a doubt the actor who transforms this movie from just another two-guys-down-on-their-luck-Western into a cinematic work of art. Tim Holt and Humphrey Bogart also give excellent performances, but this is Walter Huston's movie. This movie does for Walter Huston what The Westerner does for Walter Brennan. Whether deliberately intended or not, in both movies the topped billed actor is out-shined and out-acted by the other actor who's not the main star. In this movie Humphrey Bogart is the topped-billed star, but it is Walter Huston who really stars. And let's not forget Alfonso Bedoya as the bandit. Then again, in this movie who ARE the real bandits?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So how many actors can hold the viewer while he acts - alone - on screen? I don't know how many can, I only know that Humphrey Bogart can and did in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," a 1948 film directed by John Huston and also starring Walter Huston and Tim Holt. Bogart is just one of the treasures you'll see in this magnificent film about the power that gold can have over men.There's no sense in repeating the story - three men go into the hills to pan for gold. Howard (Huston) an old timer who has been there, done that, warns the other two, Fred C. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Bogart and Holt) that if they find gold, it has the potential to ruin both of them. While Howard is easygoing and philosophical, and Bob manages to remain loyal and honest, Fred C. Dobbs begins to show signs that he's one sandwich short of a picnic early on. He becomes suspicious and paranoid as their bounty grows larger.Bogart's last scenes are monumental - he gives a soliloquy - and he deserved the Oscar for this. Walter Huston is fantastic as an old man who doesn't want for much and takes life as it comes. Handsome Tim Holt gives a wonderful performance as an inherently gentle, generous and sympathetic person. His reading of the letter from a dead man's wife is quite poignant.The end of this film is satisfying, honest and funny, giving us an important moral: "Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, patriotic men, are better than gold."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Literature has three basic plots: man against man, man against nature and man against himself. THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE features elements of all three plots. Its central character is driven insane by greed (man vs. himself). The treasure hunters face bandits (man vs. man). The journey is a constant struggle against the elements (man vs. nature). The film's characters are constantly struggling against insurmountable odds.The movie moves in threes: three plot elements, three men searching for treasure, a three-stage journey (getting to the mountain, getting the gold and trying to carry it back), the treasure split three ways and three separate fantasies about what to do with it. Each of the film's three acts can even be sub-divided into three smaller acts.The plot centers around Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart). He's a penniless drifter in Tampico, Mexico. Three times (there's that number again), he begs a "fellow American" for money. (The white-suited American is played by director John Huston.) When he has cash, he immediately spends it. We see him buying cigarettes, a lottery ticket, a haircut and meals at a restaurant. We know that if he does find gold, he'll quickly squander it and return to begging. He's mean, too; when a young boy tries to sell him a lottery ticket, he snarls and throws a drink in the boy's face.Dobbs and his companion, Bob Curtin (Tim Holt), take jobs at a local oil field. After a crooked manager cheats them out of their wages, they assault him and take what he owes them. They team up with Howard (Walter Huston), who has excited them with stories of prospecting for gold. Howard has spent his life digging for gold in the mountains of Mexico. Pooling their wages and Dobbs's lottery winnings, the three men set out on a treasure hunt.Eventually, the three men find a mountain with a rich vein of gold. Most treasure hunt stories end with the heroes finding the loot. THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE takes the story through its next logical steps. We see the conflicts that arise between the men as they are mining their gold. The conflicts deepen as the men try to return to civilization with their treasure. The perennially poor Dobbs obsesses over his share, becoming convinced that the other two are plotting to steal his gold. Greed and paranoia combine to drive Dobbs insane. The bandits, the federales (police forces), the elements and Dobb's insanity combine in one of the most elegant, complicated and ironic endings in movie history.I prefer black and white to color film. Black and white is more visually expressive. Here, it makes a harsh, gritty landscape seem that much harsher. We seem to see every rock, every dangerous creature, every grain of blowing sand. The Sierra Madre is a barren mountain range, a land seeming set on its edge. Color would soften this landscape, making it seem less intimidating. In black and white, it seems tough and unforgiving, even deadly.In the Sierra Madre, human life is cheap. Water can be more precious than gold here,since men can die of thirst. Bandits try to murder travelers for the clothes on their backs. Federales perform summary executions. Poisonous reptiles hide under rocks. Sandstorms of epic proportions sweep across the land. Death can strike without warning.The failed quest is a common theme in John Huston's films. In THE MALTESE FALCON, the characters fight over a supposedly priceless sculpture only to discover that it's worthless. In THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, two men set out to rule a country only to have its inhabitants turn against them. In this film, the main characters risk their lives for gold and end up recognizing their true desires. At the end, they haven't realized their dream, but they know what would truly make them happy. That's the real treasure of the Sierra Madre.The teaming of Humphrey Bogart and director John Huston is one of the greatest success stories in Hollywood history. During their 17-year partnership, they made six films together. Five of these are considered classics: THE MALTEE FALCON, THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, KEY LARGO, THE African QUEEN and BEAT THE DEVIL. For nearly fifty years, Huston was one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers. He announced his retirement several times, but he never retired. John Huston lived to make movies. Only death could stop him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very best handful of movies have the ability to involve you in their world. They are so real and so alive that for several hours you are totally present, real, and alive too. You react to what is happening on the screen as if it is happening in your life. You can get angry, fearful, and happy as part of the process of viewing the movie; and the outside world is temporarily absent from your consciousness. "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is one such movie. The movie captures your all-out attention by the use of compelling images, and brilliant dialog, delivered by fabulous actors, all coordinated by a one-of-a-kind director. Few movies are so compelling so as to involve the viewer (the viewer still has to let it happen) like this one, but several others are "Shane", "Taxi Driver", and several other Bogart movies. Bottom line is: "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a true masterpiece that relies on a great adventure story, masterfully acted and directed, to immensely entertain from the first minute on, and to interestingly portray a valid side of the human psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Treasure of Humphrey Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1941 Humphrey Bogart and John Huston formed a bond. They were to make six films together as an actor and director team. A team that would rock the foundations of American cinema The Treasure of Sierra Madre was the last of the collaborative films of Bogart ands Huston, and it is the best. The Film excels in many levels, holding its place as one of the best films of the 40's. It is a Classic for a reason.The Treasure of Sierra Madre geniously tells a tale of obsession and greed. It begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Bogart), a very poor man. So poor that he is forced to beg for money from strangers to afford a simple meal. He finds a job, but he is gypped of getting paid. The then he meets Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) and Howard (Walter Huston), and is informed of gold just waiting to be prospected in the mountains of Sierra Madre. Howard warns them of the danger of gold, and how it can eat away a mans soul. But Dobbs ignores the warnings, and they head out to Sierra Madre. They strike gold, and their fortune and friendship grow at first, but paranoia and greed follow, which endangers all that they have gained.The direction of The Treasure of Sierra Madre is first rate. John Huston achieves that sense of greed and obsession in a masterful way. For instance take a sign near the beginning do the film after the trio has discovered gold, and each has hidden their share. Dobbs wakes up to see that Howard is not in his bed, so he goes to investigate. Howard returns, but Dobbs stays to check his share has not been stolen. Then Curtin awakes, sees Dobbs gone, and goes to investigate. Dobbs returns, but Curtin checks his share. The way Huston shows the greed in these men, and how gold drives them to hate, and insanity is fascinating. He uses simple shots, and simple dialogue (for he wrote the movie), to let the impact of greed sink in deeper. But what is most fascinating in The Treasure of Sierra Madre are its characters.Yes it is characters that drive The Treasure of Sierra Madre to greatness, and this is due to wonderful acting. Humphrey Bogart's smooth, yet sullen look is perfect for the of the greed stricken Dobbs. He strolls about, always as if he is bothered by something, as if he is only half human, and because of this he is the one to finally reach insanity in the end. And then there is Curtin. He is good looking and calm, nothing much bothers him, and is able to resist temptation. He is honest, hard working, and tries not to make a fuss of things. He is a very lighthearted person, but knows when to take things seriously. Lastly, but definitely not least, is Howard. Walter Huston won an Academy Award for his acting, and it was rightly deserved. His performance is the best in the movie. He plays the seasoned gold hunter, and has searched for gold, and struck it, more than once. He is old, and slightly crazy, but is honest and wise to the greedy nature of man because of his years. John Huston was right to cast his father in the movie. It is these characters, and their dynamic that drive The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Right through its two hour, six minute running time, which boils down to one of the greatest endings in cinema history.Overall The Treasure of Sierra Madre is one of the best movies ever made. Its character dynamic and bold direction catapult it into greatness. A definite must see. It is essential for Humphrey Bogart fans. No, not just Bogart fans, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Characterizations, a Very Good Story, &amp; More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With masterful characterizations, an interesting story full of action, and many other strengths, "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" might be the best movie ever made on the theme of greed and its effects on human personalities and relationships. There are other movies that have masterfully portrayed the negative effects of greed and materialism ("The Little Foxes" and "Greed" come to mind), but here the contrasts set up amongst the characters do not merely describe and condemn greed, but also offer a way out.The three main characters are very nicely defined and are also well acted. Walter Huston is just right as the eccentric but wise older prospector, who takes both success and disaster in stride. Huston gets some fine scenes that establish his character and his perspective, and even his occasional over-the-top moments fit in well with his character. Next, the role of Fred C. Dobbs, whose better nature is gradually eroded by his greed and selfishness, is hardly one of Humphrey Bogart's more likable characters, but it's one of his finest performances. Bogart's dry, no-nonsense approach works perfectly in the role, and his style does a much better job of bringing out what is really inside negative characters like Dobbs than does the pretentious emoting that is so overused now in such roles. Finally, Tim Holt plays the youngest of the three prospectors, and while he has much less of a presence than the other two, that is how it should be, for his character reflects the choice that must be made between the attitudes offered by the other two.The story of their search for fortune, with all the hopes, successes, and crises that come their way, is not only a fine backdrop that reveals what is inside the characters, but is also interesting and sometimes exciting in its own right. Quite a bit happens, with a lot of twists and turns, the kind of story that rewards careful attention. It's an excellent movie that delivers both substance and entertainment.</fullReview>

Probably because he hates them so.It's funny quirks like this that makes John Huston and Humphrey Bogart's Treasure of the Sierra Madre so enjoyable. It's so human, something a lot of movies back then lacked.

After he and another beggar Curtain got swindled by an crooked scumbag they decide they decide to go panning for gold with the help of Walter Huston, an old prospector who lives in a boarding house they had spent a night once.Soon they come up against the darker side of Human Nature: GREED! Can they survive the terror and horror this five lettered word causes? Can they remain friends? Can a person like you enjoy this movie?The only answer I can give you without spoiling anything is that you must go and find out for yourself. Go watch this movie!

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sierra Madre, I'm convinced, grows on you the more you watch it. Like Apocalypse Now, the movie shows us crazy characters on the march, moving from one crazy adventure to another. And like Apocalypse Now, these little stories shine with their own brilliance. I can't name and describe the episodes; to do so would hurt the first time viewer's pleasure. Yet I will say this: the episodes stand on their own AND (unlike Apocalypse Now) THEY link together coherently, so that the movie ends not with a whimper, but, instead, with a bang of existential brilliance. Sierra Madre, however, falls short in one area -- Steiner's score. Sometimes it intrudes on sequences better suited for silence. Other times it seems mismatched, introducing a levity that weakens the narrative's tensions. But then, sometimes, particularly the passage when human voices comingle with percussive rhythms, sometimes the score sounds about as good, as appropriate, and as perfect as film music can. Like Welles and Lang, Huston was a genius. Fortunately Hollywood never shut him down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a great movie with brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Walter Huston, director John Huston's father. The story concerns three American bums down on their luck in 1920's Tampico. After winning a lottery, they decide to go in search of gold in the Mexican mountains. What follows are varying degrees of luck, hard work, and eventual deep distrust of one another. Throughout all this Huston directs masterfully. He shows a bum's life and how a bum sees the world; he presents Mexico and Mexican life convincingly and beautifully; and he presents a striking portrait of male camaraderie, human nature, and greed.Bogart contributes an excellent performance as the distrusting Fred C. Dobbs, one of the great movie characters of all time. Walter Huston reached the pinnacle of his career here; his portrayal of a grizzled prospector is one of the finest pieces of acting anywhere.John Huston is not one of my favorite directors -- I often find him overrated -- but this is one hell of a great movie. No one could possibly be disappointed; it's exciting, humorous, intelligent, engaging, believable, and incredibly entertaining. (Great score, too!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film good in so many ways, one hardly knows where to start. When this film was made, Hollywood studios competed to see who could do the worst job of adapting good books to the screen, often ripping the vitals out of the books they adapted, removing every trace of realism and intelligence from them. Huston made Traven's book with style and faith to the author's sense of irony beyond tragedy. With incredible performances and that wonderful visual style that characterizes all Huston's films, Sierra Madre only falls short for me in a couple of places. As much as I love Max Steiner's scores, I'm not sure he was the best choice for this film, and the occasional taint of Hollywood schmaltz creeps into the script, but for the most part the movie transcends its era. A metaphor for every endeavor men (and women) undertake together, a study in the way things fall apart around the imperfect center of human souls, and a great adventure, Sierra Madre is a narrative masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are two Americans down on their luck in Tampico, Mexico who manage to acquire a temporary job working for Pat McCormick (Barton MacLane) but don't get paid for their efforts as McCormick does a disappearing act with the money. Dobbs and Curtin catch up with him later in a bar and after coming to blows manage to get the money that was owed to them. A young Mexican boy (Robert Blake) approaches Dobbs who reluctantly buys a lottery ticket from him. Dobbs and Curtin spend the night in a flop house where they meet Howard (Walter Huston) a grizzled old timer who tells them stories of the times he went prospecting for gold in the mountains. They are both quite interested in this but don't have the necessary funds to purchase the equipment they would need. Next day the young Mexican boy comes to find Dobbs to tell him that his ticket has won some money in the lottery. It is not a fortune so he decides to invest his winnings in some tools and equipment so that Curtin and himself can team up with Howard to search for gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. Greed and distrust inevitably take hold of Dobbs and he gets increasingly suspicious of his two companions and becomes more and more paranoid as the days go by. A group of bandits led by Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya) come across their camp and try to rob them of the gold but with the help of James Cody (Bruce Bennett) they manage to fight them off.Some favourite lines from the film:Bogart (to John Huston): "Hey, mister, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?".Bogart (to Tim Holt): "The way I see it gold can be as much of a blessing as a curse".Walter Huston (to Bogart and Holt): "Water's precious. Sometimes it can be more precious than gold".Bogart (to Bruce Bennett): "Tonight you're our guest. Tomorrow morning look out - no trespassing around here, you know, beware of the dog - get it?".Alfonso Bedoya (to Bogart): "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges!".Bogart (to Tim Holt): "Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean".Writer/Director John Huston played a cameo role at the start of the film as an American tourist ("White Suit") who Bogart approaches for money (three times!). It is said that Ann Sheridan also played a cameo role in the uncredited part of a streetwalker. Robert Blake was the small boy who sold Bogart the winning lottery ticket. Blake later went on to appear in many feature films such as "In Cold Blood", "Electra Glide in Blue" and "Tell Them Willie Boy is Here", and also starred in the TV series "Baretta"."Treasure of the Sierra Madre" won Oscars for best director (John Huston), best supporting actor (Walter Huston) and best screenplay (John Huston). The film was also nominated for Best Picture but lost out to Laurence Olivier's "Hamlet". This was yet another marvellous performance by Humphrey Bogart and proves once again what an outstanding actor he is when given the right material. 10/10. Clive Roberts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, But Still Interesting To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all.But it was.THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich.Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed.THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance.Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene.The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him.If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment.I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B)(This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

		<fullReview>This is a movie with a solid cast and a good story but for an adventure movie it really isn't always being adventurous and entertaining enough. I found this movie quite hard to watch at times, cine not always an awful lot good or interesting was happening and I just never really could get into this movie.It isn't always the best told movie and with its style and pace the movie even comes across as a bit clumsy at times. This is a problem I often have with early John Huston movies. I'm pretty sure of it that the movie would had been a much better one had it been made later during Huston's career, when he had some more experience as a director and storyteller. I also think this is a sort of movie that would had worked out way better had it been done in color. It would had made the adventurous and entertaining aspect of the movie come across much stronger. It now instead is more of a dark movie, almost film-noir style like. Perhaps John Huston was practicing for his next movie "Key Largo", which also got released in the same year as this movie. I absolutely love basically all of Huston's film-noir but problem with him seemed that he tried to do everything as a film-noir, even when the movie was in a totally different genre.But no, of course this movie remains far from an horrible movie. It still has a very fine concept in it, as well as a story that in itself has plenty of layers to it. You can watch and interpret this movie in many different ways, which perhaps also makes multiple viewings essential.It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie, in which the three main characters are the essentials. Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going. They are three totally different characters, which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film. Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt and John Huston's own father Walter Huston play these roles. Both father and son also won an Oscar(s) for their contribution to this movie. Quite an unique thing.Surprisingly enough not as great as expected but it still remains a more than good watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexplained scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scene that intrigues me in the movie is the shot that shows the ledger being carefully filled out when supplies are being purchased in the Mexican village. The camera focuses on the ledger without explanation. I think that the significance of this brief episode is to show the rather archaic civility of the villagers who live in a small, isolated, and somewhat remote village. The lettering in the book is done with deliberate care as would all the work in the town, or village, be done in contrast with the rootless expedience of the prospectors and the still more desperate rapacity of the bandits. Most civil of all though are the Indians who come to the old prospector to ask for help. This is a very moral story, well portrayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director John Huston's award winning morality tale of three men in search of gold. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt) team up with old prospector Howard (Walter Huston ) because he says he knows where the hills are full of gold. The three of them start out with good intentions but after they find the gold everything starts to unravel. Not only do they begin to fight internally but they have to deal with Gold Hat the Mexican bandito who delivers the famous movie lines "Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any steenkin' badges!" Everything is good about this film. Walter Huston won best supporting actor and John Huston best director and screenplay. The Treasure of the Sierra Madres is #30 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOGART, need I say more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, more than any other, showcased the talents of Bogart. He was fantastic, and stole every seen of the movie. I am convinced that nobody could have pulled this role off, like Bogart did. It is also nice to see, a legend of his time take a role playing the bad guy. Unfortunely today, there are very few big time actors that would be willing to play a truly bad guy, being afraid it might hurt there image. With all that being said it was a fantastic movie. The camera work, music, and acting (aside from Bogart) were all first class. The plot was very interesting, showcasing greed, deception, and paranoia, all from Bogart's character. Anyone that will question Bogarts place, as the "Greatest of all-time", just see this movie and your question will be answered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll bet you $105,000 that you fall asleep before I do!" &lt;Bogart as Dobbs&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really lucky. This newly-released DVD set is available from my local county library and I was one of the first to borrow it. After 'Falcon' and 'Casablanca', I was curious to see Bogart in a different role. Set in 1925, the title refers to the quest of three American men, common only by their being almost broke in Tampico, Mexico, now heading to the mountains to prospect for gold. And they find gold, but the story is not really about that. Far from it. The story is a morality play, a study of how greed and paranoia wrecks what might have become a fast friendship between the three men. It fully deserves its place as one of the better films, and Walter Huston (dad of director John) richly deserved his supporting Oscar as the grizzled and wise old prospector. The DVD set is also rich in extras, a huge bonus for fans of classic films such as this one.The rest of my comments contain MAJOR SPOILERS and should not be read by anyone who has not yet seen 'Treasure of the Siera madre.'Dobbs is down and out in Tampico, decent work is hard to find, and he often hits on apparently wealthy fellow Americans, pleading for a peso so he can have a meal. Director Huston has a small but key role as one of those Americans, and the third time Dobbs hits on him, tells him to quit begging and learn to support himself. Dobbs and another American get hired to go off and work with a crew, with a promise to be paid later. But the boss is a scammer, skips out, they later find him in a bar, beat him up, and take the money owed to them, nothing more. Then, in a flophouse meet up with the old prospector, after conversation about gold in the mountains, the old man offers to lead the prospecting if they can put up enough money for supplies. A winning lottery ticket sold to Dobbs by a street boy days earlier provides the rest of the money they needed.They get to the mountains, the old man finds gold, they build a mine and a water trough to recover it. They spend a total of 10 months, with no plan of how long they would stay there or how much gold they would accumulate. Shortly they decided to split up the gold as they found it, and each keep his own in a secret hiding place. Dobbs' greed and paranoia increase as the gold inventory does. He accused the others of plotting to steal his. In a complex series of events, Dobbs ends up going down the mountain by himself with all the gold, banditos intercept him, kill him for his boots and hides, never suspecting that the 'sand' in the bags was worth anything. When the other two American prospectors arrive later on the scene, wind is blowing the open bags of gold dust and scattering it into the desert, blowing it back to where it started. The old man began to laugh, then the other, "What a joke on us", they had spent ten months working hard and now all the gold was gone, but they were alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Times Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently started re-viewing films with an eye toward earnest evaluation, as much for self-examination as anything. By selecting this film, I wanted to find something special. So it is with regret that I post a negative comment amidst a field of glowing praise. I can only think that the difference is that tastes have changed -- more, the bar has been raised. And that's sufficiently interesting to report. Why doesn't this movie work for me, and probably would have 35 years ago? (In fact, I think it did!)What we have here is good acting by Howard and Gold Hat, a book as source with an adventurous theme for the time, and clear but not artistic cinematography. By today's standards, the sets are cheesy, Bogart's acting isn't real, and the story is scattered.About Bogart's acting. This was right before Brando (and many since) changed our expectations of the art forever. I never lost the awareness that the lines were written (they were just too clean) and that Bogart was acting. His affect was never real. Imagine Harvey Keitel, or even Tony Hopkins in the role, and you'll see what I mean. We've evolved a completely different standard of acting. We seek more immediacy to the emotional bone, more intimacy with the soul. For that matter, look at the `modern' acting of John Huston in `Chinatown,' to see how thoroughly even he changed his ideas about acting.About the story, can you imagine a scriptwriter today spending so much energy on events which neither advance the story nor increase definition of the characters? The real story setup is the `prisoner's dilemma' where what's best for an individual in a group trumps the best interests of the group (and hence all its members). Fairness fights paranoia. The lengthy prologue of being cheated could have -- with work -- supported this setup. But it doesn't! So many things could have been mutually supporting (like the letter to the wife, the rescue from the mine that wasn't really a rescue). But the standard of the era didn't require this. So the story appears scattered, unconnected to a contemporary audience.I believe that the film continues to be ranked high based on rememberance that it DID work when new, that it WAS important in its time, and that we wish to honor a past that has passed. Oh, that and the `stinkin' badges.'A classic is timeless. This film is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does it really matter who you are when you are in search for "wealth"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a story of two young pauper Americans fitting together with an old-timer to prospect for gold in a time on which scattered gangs of bandits terrorize the countryside.The two young guys want to have lots of money while the old-timer thinks it's worth the money and adventure to settle for a peaceful old age period.Before being in search for gold they think "gold" cannot really change their soul or heart but when they really find a small gold mine in the remote Sierra Madre greed and voracity sets in between them especially because of the oversuspicious, wicked, down-trodden loser named Fred C. Dobbs.The more they find gold the more mean he becomes and he starts do become suspicious of his partners he even starts to show indications of losing his mind.It's a nice plot which is superbly acted.Besides if you saw a couple of old movies you would probably notice "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was one of the first Hollywood films to be shot almost entirely on location outside the U.S., although the night scenes were filmed back in the studio." Based on that I can say it is much easier to produce a movie like "Maltese Falcon" than to create one like Sierra Madre. But I can't help saying I would love to see a Technicolor version of the movie.When the gold is in question black and white doesn't fit in there.You have to use your imagination to presume what you see in black and white is not sand but actually gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining adventure with Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this adventure with Humphrey Bogart extremely entertaining and fascinating. Bogart (as Dobbs) as always solid as a rock and Walter Huston (as Howard) was acting at his best I reckon as well. Tim Holt (as Curtin) had an okay role too.*SPOILER* The men in question are basically all rolling stones as the movie begins and not much stuff is up. However as the two younger ones (Bogart/Holt) meet the old timer (Huston) one night in a little shack they start to talk about gold mining. Huston knows a lot about it since he's a professional gold miner and has been for decades all over the world. That's why it's name is The Treasure of the Sierra Madre... *END OF SPOILER*Overall an incredibly entertaining flick to watch in peace and quietness. I can recommend this to all who wants a classic adventure a rainy day in, say, October.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a psychiatrist and having viewed this movie many many times I can perhaps say something of interest. First where was Ann Sheridan in the movie? Big mystery for me, finally I found out that she was the prostitute that passed Bogie and went up the stairs just before John Huston appeared to be dunned for some money. Finally I found her. The one thing that always bothered me was the fireside scene. Curtin being aware that Dobbs was dangerous supposedly just sat there watching Dobbs until he had to fall asleep. Why didn't he just tie him up? An annoying logical lapse in the movie. Then Dobbs supposedly shot Curtin in the back and then after he fell shot him again, according to Curtin. But if you listen to the shots they were fired very quickly so here was a mistake. The shots should have had a space of time between them, they didn't. Here are the insights caught by a man watching this movie so many times. A fine movie for all time. Among the ten best ever made. And don't forget, Robert Blake stole the cup Bogie was drinking from when he had the scene with the lottery ticket. I guess you could say speaking as a psychiatrist that Blake showed his larcenous and later suspected murderous character when he took the cup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart remains one of Hollywood's most acclaimed stars, and "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" shows why. Bogart plays Fred Dobbs, a prospector in search of some gold with Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) and Howard (Walter Huston). On the quest for the gold, all three men get progressively more paranoid and start double-crossing each other.As you can see, the movie deals with greed. Among other things, "TTOTSM" added to our cinematic vocabulary the phrase: "Badges?! We don't need no stinkin' badges!" (actually, the real quote was much longer). But anyway, this is one movie that, aside from being a classic in the real sense of the word, will truly stick with you.Oh, and the guy who played Pat McCormick? That's Barton MacLane, who went on to play Gen. Peterson on "I Dream of Jeannie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this is rated at 8.5. Whatsamatter wiv everyone? Well, we know what the matter is and that is the non thinking response of received ideas, IE. 'this is black and white, this is old, there is a famous actor in it and some famous director who's also renown for something or other I've no idea what but his name is familiar and therefore it must be good, mustn't it?' Personally, I'm not interested in any famous this and that or age or whatever. I wish to be entertained. This doesn't do it. The film starts off with a little promise and you expect to be drawn into a drama full of intrigue and the human condition with a lot of philosophy and conflict. What we actually get is a 2 dimensional 'Boys Own' style clichéd drivel all fragmented plot lines going nowhere. It felt as if the script was written as they went along and hardly any of it seemed to make any sense. There was no drama, just endless amounts of bad acting where the famous actor self consciously and unprofessionally keeps looking at the camera by accident. Basically this film is written for a five year old and insults your intelligence. 2 stars for period nostalgia and the clothes. I'd pass on it if I were you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those films that hasn't aged well. Despite that I cannot say that it has anything to do with the actors. They actually make the most of a film that is just too long and too boring. The thing with this film is that it isn't gripping, thrilling or exciting (as an adventure SHOULD be). It's not funny either. It is just (excruciatingly) long, full of unnecessary scenes and dialog, filled with a majestic score that doesn't do the film justice and some scenes that are somewhat painful to watch. It's not that I do not like films from the 1940's (heck I saw The Maltese Falcon last week and gave that one a 7 out of 10), but that this film has written old-time Hollywood production written all over it. I was really amazed at this and at how different this film was qualitatively from The Maltese Falcon, since they had the same director and the same star attached. The Maltese Falcon is a classic motion picture, but if this one is a classic, it must be a classic sleeping pill.4 out of 10</fullReview>

I have a limited tolerance for drama and arty fluff, although I do like films that respect my intellect.As a result, like many people I'm afraid of the classics, because some of them are just so BAAAAAAD unless you've got the refinement or film school training to appreciate the subtleties. I don't.I rented "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" partly out of a sense of obligation to see a classic, and partly because I was wondering if this was the original "Indiana Jones" film.It's not. Do not see this film if you want an adventure. The film is really a drama containing very little suspense or action. In fact, the pace was so slow and the ending so transparently obvious that I'd be surprised if even drama lovers liked this one.I believe that a film's rating should reflect its impact on the modern times in which the rating was given. My guess is that the high rating this film has stems mostly from memories. Well, I have seen this film recently and give it only a 4 out of 10.Who should see this film:-- Arty types who want to study films from the 1940s-- Drama lovers with nothing to do on a rainy day who takean interest in Humphrey Bogart.</fullReview>
