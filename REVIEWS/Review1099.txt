		<shortDescription>Stunning film deserves to be ranked among Hitchcock's greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is always brushed aside as "minor", and "an experiment that failed", EVEN by Hitchcock himself. I can't let that mistaken judgment stand.I have seen it many times over the years and always found it moving and disturbing but never analyzed why it had this effect. On viewing it again tonight immediately after watching To Catch a Thief, I became aware that Rope remains brilliant whereas the other movie was merely a pretty and lightweight, average 50's period piece.The really strange thing is that Hitchcock's movies fall into certain distinct periods which have been written about at length (from early British to late Hollywood; from suspenseful dramas to macabre comedies), but this does not fit into any of them. It is a forties movie, like Saboteur, yet it is shot in colour so it looks like a much later film. To everyone, forties equals black and white. This is a stage play and takes place all in a one room set, but there is the remarkable effect of the huge window which shows the sun going down in real time over the course of the movie, over Manhattan buildings. This is of course done carefully with special lighting effects, but it gives the perfect illusion of the sun setting. It is just that there are fewer skyscrapers there than we would see today.Some of the slang is dated (but charming), and such elements as a cigarette case could never play a part in a movie made today, but even with these few period references it seems to be a very modern film. The subject matter was horrifying and shocking for 1948, but is rather less so now, as we are unfortunately used to seeing gore and mindless violence. The homosexual subtext would now be played overtly, but the way it is filmed gives it a more ominous atmosphere than movies which have everything spelled out.This is a movie filled with suspense from the first frame, without any extraneous footage. All the dialogue sounds genuine, not "stagey" as most plays generally do when made into movies. Examples: Glengarry Glen Ross, Oleanna, Boys in the Band etc. All good movies, but all scream out "filmed stage play - actors emoting!" whereas this movie simply draws you into its scenes of gradually dawning horror. I doubt if any Hitchcock film contains more pure tragedy and pathos, or a stronger moral message.It is a powerfully modern film and yet it is 52 years old. Even the dinner party repartee is filled with wry comments that would not be out of place at a dinner party today - about such topics as the astrological signs of movie stars.Yet under the witty dialogue is an undertone of tragic irony as the two hosts play an elaborate and secret prank on their guests, simply for their own smug satisfaction.But it isn't simply the two hosts being in on it together; they are at odds, they bicker, and we are kept on edge because (as Hitchcock wants us to) we are forced to empathize with them to a degree, as well as hating them; we are fascinated by their quirks, played out in subtle nervousness. In taking us into the minds of the criminals as well as the minds of the innocent bystanders, we are left in torment for the horrifying state of humanity, until finally we are forced to take sides.There are so many brilliant touches in this movie that I can only list a few (without giving anything away). Jimmy Stewart idly setting the metronome in motion as Farley Granger plays the piano, making him play faster and faster while he questions him. The preoccupied worrying of Sir Cedric Hardwicke as he looks out the window hoping to see his son, who is late, as the others chatter; the gradual coming together of the estranged couple who were hostile about each other's presence at the beginning; the unbearable tension as the plates and candles are being cleared away by the housekeeper while the guests and hosts are heard conversing off camera.The devastation in Jimmy Stewart's face as he realizes that his careless armchair philosophy has fed the imagination of two unstable minds and therefore he too is guilty.I can't say enough good about this film. It is underappreciated, never on any list of Hitchcock's greatest, but the time is long overdue for it to be appreciated as a masterpiece of suspense and art.It has none of the irritating Hollywood production glossiness of otherwise great movies such as Vertigo and North by Northwest, none of the blatant psychological mood shots of films such as Marnie. It doesn't have the simplistic filmmaking style of the forties and yet it springs from that era, not fitting in with anything else from the period, decades ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! The most underrated of the Hitchcock/Stewart collaborations is still as fascinating and entertaining as ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed so many brilliant movies that the best known ones like 'Rear Window', 'Vertigo', 'Psycho' and 'The Birds' overshadow equally worthy films like 'Shadow Of A Doubt', 'Lifeboat' - insert your personal favourite here - and this one, 'Rope'. It was the first Hitchcock movie to feature James Stewart and it is easily the most underrated of the four movies they made together. I think Stewart was brave for taking this part, which was much darker than the usual characters associated with him, and it's difficult to imagine him being able to play Scottie in 'Vertigo' without having done this movie first. Stewart is excellent in the movie, but equally good are Farley Grainger (who subsequently starred in Hitchcock's 'Strangers On A Train') and John Dall as the thrill killers. Dall gives the best performance in the movie. I'm surprised that after making this and the Noir cult classic 'Gun Crazy' he isn't better known. The technical "gimmick" of 'Rope' is usually mentioned more than anything else about it (Hitchcock wanted one long continuous take, which wasn't possible at the time, but compromised by using several long ones, a very innovative approach at the time), but there is a lot more to it than just that. Considering the strict censorship of the period it was a daring look at homosexuality. The word is never used at any time in the script but a sophisticated audience would have no doubt what was really going on. I've only seen about a third of Hitchcock's output but every movie of his I watch or rewatch makes me marvel at him all the more. The greatest and most influential director of suspense movies was also one of the greatest directors of ANY genre ever. 'Rope' deserves to be mentioned in any list of his ten best movies. 55 years after it was originally released it is as fascinating and entertaining as ever. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Just a Technical Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1948 Hitchcock film is mostly noted for its technical achievements. Hitchcock filmed this story, about two well-to-do rich kids who decide to commit a murder for the fun of it, as a play. Which, it in fact, originally was, though based in London and not New York. Technical limitations did not enable his original vision of making the entire picture one continuous long shot. Instead it is made up of several 8 minute continuous shots. This was the length of film that fit into one reel. Using some very inventive cutting techniques the film appears as if it was filmed all in one take. This is more impressive when you see the actual size that color film cameras were during this time period. They were absolutely enormous, bigger than a man standing. To move the camera in and around the small stage space, many of the set pieces were set on casters and rolled about to keep out of the way of the camera. Some of the actors were noted in saying that they worried every time they sat down, that there might not be a chair for them to fall into. Another achievement of the film is in terms of lighting. The apartment that the entire film is set in has several large windows overlooking the city. As the movie is more or less uninterrupted from start to finish we see the lighting change as the sun begins to set and night falls. It is a testament to this achievement that upon first viewing you don't really notice the effect. Yet, the filmmakers took great pains to get it to look realistic, staging numerous re-shoots for the final few scenes.Though the technical achievements are quite wonderful, it is a shame that they have overshadowed what it really a very good bit of suspense. It seems the two high society murderers have planned a dinner party just after the murder. They store the corpse in a wood box that is featured prominently in the midst of the dinner. This creates an excellent mix of suspense and the macabre. Throughout the party the murderers become more unraveled even as they are enjoying their little game.All of the acting is quite good. The two murderer (John Dall and Farley Granger) do a fine job of playing intellectual, society playboys, with a desire for excitement. It is slightly annoying watching their excited, nervous mannerisms (especially some stuttering by Jon Dall) but it is fitting with the characters. Their former instructor, Rupert Cadell, is played magnificently by the impeccable James Stewart. This is a bit of departure from Stewarts typical roles. Here he is a tough, cynical intellectual. This was his first of four collaborations between Stewart and Hitchock and it is hard to imagine his role as Scottie in Vertigo without having first played in this movie.The story unravels in typical Hitchock fashion. The suspense is built, then lessoned by some well timed comedy, and then built again to a final crescendo. Hitchcock was excellent as a technical director and allowed his actors the breathing room they needed for fine performances. In the end I left the picture feeling more excited about the superb storytelling than any particular technical achievement. It is a testament to his craft, that Hitchock allows you to leave a picture being enamored with his story over his technical achievements. Some of the greatest effects are those you don't notice because they seem so natural and real.Alfred Hitchock manages a triumph of technical brilliance and suspense in Rope. It's influence in the technical realm of cinema far outshines any effect the story has on future movies. This is a shame, for the story being told is one of suspense, macabre and excitement.Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Film; Hardly Gimmicky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is one of the finer films that Hitchcock made. Philosophy, sociology and psychology are contained in equal parts. The plot is simple, the characters are complex and Hitchcock's treatment of the Leopold and Loeb parallel quite deft. The final soliloquy from Jimmy Stewart's character, Rupert, is not only one of the finest examples of Stewart's acting abilities but also of film-making.On the subject of filmmaking - Hitchcock filmed this in as much of a single take as possible. I believe there are only five edits in the whole thing. I can wholeheartedly tell you that it was no gimmick on Hitchcock's part. The play's plot requires that a certain amount of tension be maintained. Tracking shots are used for this purpose and quite well in my opinion. Timing, position and prop movements alone are to force us to stand in awe of a logistical challenge. All the actors are played superbly. The dialogue is natural and flowing. The finest bit of timing involves a swinging kitchen door, the rope, and the fear of discovery.In short, this is a fine film that cannot disappoint. Highly recommended and will be well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitckcock's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spellbinding. It's about two (purportedly) gay men, Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) who strangle a friend to death for the thrill of it. They then hide the body in a trunk just before a dinner party they have which include the victim's family and friends. They also proceed to serve the food on the trunk containing his body. They also invite a headmaster they had at school together--Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) a very cynical individual. As the party progresses Cadell realizes something is very wrong--and is afraid he might be responsible in an indirect way.Absolutely fascinating. Hitchcock's first color film was also shot in 10 minute takes--Hitch thought it might provide a seamless flow of narrative. After all this was adapted from a play. I think it works very well--it's not distracting at all and the film does move very smoothly. Also he purposedly had the color toned down--he didn't think bright Technicolor was appropriate for the subject matter. Purportedly Dall, Granger and Stewart's characters were all gay. It's never made clear but it DOES seem like Dall and Granger are lovers (and both were gay in real life) and the script was adapted by a gay man (Arthur Laurents). Also it's based the Leopold-Loeb murders in which two gay men killed a young boy for the thrill of it in the 1920s. So there is a strong gay subtext in the film.Also there's plenty of black humor throughout. After the murder there are lines like "Knock 'em dead", "killing two birds with one stone", "I could strangle you" and "these hands will bring you great fame". They're actually quite funny and frightening at the same time. With two exceptions all the acting is good. The two bad performances are by Sir Cedric Hardwicke (he seems to have no idea what he's saying) and Farley Granger. Actually Granger is so bad he provides some unintentional humor! The best acting is by Dall who is absolutely chilling and Joan Chandler (who Hitchcock kept tormenting on the set) as Janet Walker. She has some great lines and gives her all to every one of them. Best of all is Stewart--he doesn't pop up until the film is almost half over and he's incredible. He plays a very cold, cynical intellectual--this is unlike anything he's played before. His acting is very toned down (until the end) but you can see all his expressions through his eyes. This is easily one of his best performances. He hated making the film. For the 10 minute takes Hitch had to design a set which could accomidate the huge cameras. When the camera moved the set walls were designed to go flying up (off camera) so the crew could move from room to room. It distracted Stewart a lot and he couldn't sleep nights.There's also the VERY impressive cyclorama background of NYC where we slowly see day turn into night.This is basically all talk but every single line is fascinating. Stewart's lines especially are great and the philosophy described is intriguing. And the gay subtext adds another layer to it--see the looks Dall and Granger exchange once in a while. Actually Montgomery Clift was approached about playing Granger's role but turned it down. He was gay too but wanted to keep it hidden and that role was just a bit too risky.All in all an absolutely fascinating picture. A definite must-see! It's short too (only 81 minutes). Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an unusual Hitchcock film... such a small cast, and the whole film consists of long takes. Before seeing this, I had heard enormously positive things about it... most of them coming from my father, who hadn't seen it for about fifteen years. I had high expectations for the film, but I must say it exceeded them. Though there are only a few cuts in this film, meaning the camera is running almost non-stop, Hitchcock makes great use of it; he manages to fit in many of his trademark angles and closeups in, without it seeming forced. At one point, the camera focuses for a minute and a half on an inanimate object with only one visible character moving back and forth near it, and he manages to drench the cut in suspense, leaving even the most calm and collected of viewers at the edge of their seat, biting their nails. Only the fewest directors could make that sequence work, and luckily Hitchcock is one of them. The plot is great. It's interesting and it develops nicely. The pacing is perfect. I was never bored for a second. The acting, oh the acting... John Dall is excellent as Brandon, the intellectually superior and very smug main character. Makes me wonder why he didn't get more roles in his career. Stewart is great, as usual. The rest of the acting is very good as well. The characters are well-written and credible. For such an unusual film, and despite the heavy feeling of watching a stage play rather than a film, it's very entertaining and effective. If for nothing else, watch this to enjoy Dall as the cold, calculating and manipulative psychopath. I recommend this to fans of Hitchcock and Stewart. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Dead Body in Search of its Killers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was a lover of the dark and the perverse hidden beneath smiles and complacency and in his relatively sparse ROPE, perversity runs amok and at times seems ready to burst itself at the seams. Based on the Leopold-Loeb murders, this is a pretty simple premise with no shock tactics, no surprise ending, but it's all mounting tension.John Dall and Farley Granger play college students Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan -- lovers even though it's all implicit -- who kick the first scene strangling another college mate, played by Dick Hogan. The instrument they use is the title of the film and will make its appearance on more than one occasion which will at one point send poor Morgan over the edge as he is consumed with guilt and fear. Nevertheless, they have planned a dinner party over a trunk holding Hogan's body, and as the guests arrive, they begin an increasingly dark game of cat and mouse and at one point it seems they actually want to be discovered, but it's all a ruse. Shaw, the Machiavellian of the piece, admires writer and thinker Rupert Cadell played by James Stewart and has materialized Cadell's bleak thoughts by committing an act of murder. What he doesn't know is that Cadell will force them not only to confess to the murder, but to surrender to justice.ROPE is an interesting film in the way it treats its homosexual subtext. Hayes Code aside, you don't have to see an actual physical contact to know that Shaw and Morgan are lovers and that Dall is clearly the dominant male to Morgan's almost effeminate, weaker, submissive male. There also seems to be some unexplored subtext involving the blind admiration Shaw feels for Cadell, who's wife is never mentioned and who's books told about the 'darkness' of the world. This is not implying Cadell is also homosexual, but the message is certainly clear due to the fact the script had it that Cadell had had a fling with one of the students. Why else would Shaw talk to Cadell with puppy dog eyes, and go to such lengths to impress him? At a time when being gay was unspoken of finding each other in itself was anything less than a miracle, especially if this someone had some deep thoughts which were mutual. Natural for Shaw to want to catch his eye, win Cadell's approval, not knowing he had twisted his work and made it ugly.Technically, again, the Director proved he knew his "ropes" in terms of how he wanted us to see his picture. The suspense he creates doesn't lie in will the killer be revealed -- had he not included the opening shot of David's murder we might wonder if they actually had done the deed or were merely trying to shock their guests -- but how long will it take for their murder to be revealed. Long takes make us see the trunk at all times, never forgetting that despite the jokes and witty banter about astrology, there is a corpse waiting to be found. Along the way, Hitchcock allows his actors to talk about murder and play with the "where is David" motif until it's certain something must happen, and then, finally, it does, in the form of Jimmy Stewart's deft handling of the scene in which he unmasks the boys. Suspenseful, funny, and ultimately tragic: this sums up the experience of watching ROPE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock broke boundaries in the movie making industry. He overcame the odds to create not just film, but works of art. He could tell a story like no other and it has been copied ever since. Horror, thrillers, crime, and mysteries were his specialties. His unique sense of how a film should look is unparalleled by any other. One of the most creative and interesting to watch has got to be Rope.Rope is the story of two young men, Brandan and Phillip (John Dall and Farley Granger), who come together to perform the perfect murder. They're only motive is that they are superior beings like Nietzsche says. So why do they kill they're friend David? Are they really that much above everyone else? They seem to think so, and they're old school master Rupert (James Stewart) gave them the idea in the first place. It seems that Brandan and Phillip have taken it too far.After strangling David with a piece of rope, they must prepare for the party they are throwing. The food is set, David is placed in a chest in the parlor, and the guests will be arriving soon. One more change is needed to really make this a work of art. The food is moved from the dinning room and placed on top of the chest where David is resting in peace. Mrs. Wilson, the maid, doesn't seem to understand but it is not her job. Now everything is set. All that are needed are their guests, including David's father!Their friend Kenneth, David's girlfriend/Kenneth's ex-girlfriend Janet, David's father, Mrs. Atwater, and Rupert all arrive and begin to eat. Phillip is in a daze because of the whole situation before hand. He still hasn't quite settled down yet and is very uneasy. Branan on the other hand is quite chirpy, stuttering with so much excitement. The party includes some musical accompaniment from Phillip and talk of David's whereabouts, for he was supposed to be there...alive. He can't believe that he actually pulled it off. All that needs to happen is for the guests to leave and off to the country-side to dispose of David.Hitchcock has taken Patrick Hamilton's play and made it into an absolute masterpiece. Hitchcock had to take out some elements to the characters of Brandan and Phillip, mainly their homosexuality. Originally on stage the two are homosexuals but because of the time in which the movie was made in, it had to be adjusted to suit American standards. Europe already had addressed the issue in movies, but the US hadn't made it that far yet.The real standout of this picture has got to be the cinematography. The entire movie is basically filmed in one continuous shot. The camera moves around with the characters over the apartment. It is made to look like you would see it on stage. You see everything going on and hear everything, just focus your attention on the characters that are speaking of moving around. The only time Hitchcock would stop the camera was when a person would walk by it would zoom in on their back for a second of two, just so the whole movie wasn't filmed non-stop, and made editing very simple. There is only one setting for the whole movie so you know exactly what is going on everywhere at all times. You can feel the suspense thickening as the men's secret is close to being exposed.Rope is a perfect film and couldn't have fallen into better hands than Alfred Hitchcock. His vision to make a movie based on a play surpasses all other attempts at making this conversion. The film runs only 80 minutes but nonetheless is exhilarating from beginning to end. Unfortunately due to the homosexual references, the movie didn't do as well as it should have, but left its mark in cinema history. Don't let this one get away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naturally, Alfred Hitchcock, could not resist the temptations of confined time and space in which to spin his spells? One of his more interesting attempts was in his first color film, "Rope," made in 1948.The story was about two young socialites, John Dall and Farley Granger, who strangled a college friend just for kicks and hid his body in a chest in the room to which his parents were coming to a cocktail party? Among the guests was James Stewart, who sifted out the truth before the evening was over? One could imagine what Hitchcock would do with such a situation ? but in fact he did a great deal more? For a start, he played out the drama in the actual time of the story: 80 minutes on a summer evening in that New York skyscraper? He dispensed with the usual cutting techniques and, for the first time in history, shot in ten-minute takes, with not a single interruption for the different camera set-ups...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovation can't quite make this a masterpiece - but it's still worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rope', as many reviews here point out, is shot in a "real time" format. The movie lasts 80 minutes and takes place over a period of 80 minutes - with 10 8 minute takes spliced together smartly (such as switching when focused on a back) to give the appearance of one long take. Even current "real time" dramas such as "Nick of Time" or "24" use cuts - and perhaps justifiably."Rope" is about two college students - the slimy Brendon Shaw (John Dall) and his friend and sub-texted-gay-partner Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) who murder an old college mate and then, minutes after, host a dinner party to prove their calm, intellectual superiority and their "right" to kill off the lower echelons of society - they believe they are exempt from common morality. Central to this is their smug desire to show off their theory to their old mentor, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who is attending the party, and to get him to agree with their theories.As the movie is essentially confined to one room, and one take, there's a definite "play" feel to the movie. While this worked wonderful with "12 Angry Men", the script and character interaction isn't quite smart enough here to sustain it. There's a lot of pontificating by Shaw, and some fine retorts by Cadell but there's a sense of forcedness about it at the same time. Only 3 of the characters are drawn with enough conviction, and it is only Cadell who we can really admire (Granger's Morgan seems to be too much of a nervous twitching type to add much to the movie). The script does allow us to gape with incredulity at the Nietzsche-esque theories of the "superman" espoused by Shaw, and the gay subtext is amusingly, and cleverly, done but there's an inevitability about the whole story - we know what will happen, it does, and this creates an ultimate lack of tension (when compared to, for example, Hitchock's "Vertigo").The direction is, as would be expected, smart and - naturally - innovative here. The camera drifts about from character to character, as Hitchock tries his "one cut" approach, and there's some nice background detail (such as Hitchcock's flashing neon signs) to show the passage of time/current theme. Overall "Rope" is well worth seeing - it's not quite a failed experiment, nor a successful one. It's a "curio" which is worth appreciating for realizing why it was never really emulated since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of an "eye"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I place this one in my list of films anyone should watch. That is, in order to understand some fundamental issues on film-making and films in the last 50 years.What i'm least interested in here are the technical innovations. Those represent today a curiosity, a museum fact, worth being remembered and credited to those who worked for them, but just it.I'm also not so interested in the underlying taboo subjects, namely those regarding the homosexuality issue. In respect to that, i even think the whole film construction, from casting to scene writing threw away many things. I'll get morecontroversial. I think Hitchcock in fact despised those messages (the writers were worried in exploring them, not Hitch), he was not after meanings or controversies, he was after something far more ingenious and influential. I'm talking about his camera eye.Before this one, all Hitch's work was something between a classical construction and some exploration of the camera as carrier of a character's (and the audience's) emotion/feeling/sensation. The library scene in 'Shadow of a doubt', for example, is the perfect example of what i'm talking about. Anyway, that will Hitch had of making the camera follow around characters, sets, and reveal what a character (or "god") had to reveal was already notable. In here, he made that the theme of the picture. One single set, very few characters, a clear as water story (which he made even clearer by not throwing any doubt about the destiny of the murdered boy). The sexual issues also go to second importance issues. The apartment is at once simple enough to solve the technical difficulties of filming it, and large and divided enough to allow the camera to explore it, searching for elements, for dialogues or for actions. The camera has curiosity, it is almost a character, a character called audience. Years later, in different molds, Hitch would place Stewart behind the camera and definitely assume it as a physical character in the plot (Rear Window). In here what we get is fully a camera that moves to the whishes of the director. The curious, ever searching camera that dePalma would reinvent and Polanski master shows up here.I believe the work of dePalma, in a way Polanski, Chabrol and even some Godard (Le mépris is filled with this) all derive from what happened here. Hitchcock would probably hit the top with Rear Window, but here is where he becomes an inventor.My evaluation: 5/5 . one of the cinematic manifestos</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compromised mostly of dialog but always fascinating, a film experiment that never feels gimmicky. One of Hitchock's most unfortunately overlooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope" is one of Hitchcock's most unfortunately overlooked films. It doesn't have the depth of some of his other works (such as "Vertigo" or "Psycho"), but its just as engrossing and entertaining. Hitchcock could take such a seemingly simple premise and effectively stretch it out to a feature length and have none of it seem like filler. "Rope" is one of the most innovative film experiments of the decade, and it never feels gimmicky. Hitchcock, the master of suspense, is at the top of his game here. The film may be mostly nothing but dialog, but its always fascinating.The acting is very good, as usual when working with Hitchcock's skilled direction. John Dall is absolutely spellbinding as one of cinema's scariest villains, an intellectual whose disregard for human emotions and morals verges more on fascism than the sub-Nietschze philosophy he proclaims. James Stewart is also superb as the voice of reason throughout the tension. The rest of the cast is good if occasionally awkward in delivery, but both Dall and Stewart turn in phenomenal performances.Another interesting aspect of the film is the homoerotic subtext. I'm surprised it made it past the censors of the day, but to modern viewers its obvious there's something more to Dall and Farley Granger's relationship than just roommates. "Rope" is an absolutely fascinating film from the master of suspense, and even if its not his masterpiece, this is probably my personal favorite of Hitchcock's next to "Vertigo". (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw ROPE for the first time in a widescreen theatre in Manhattan about 1989 or so. It is rare to say that one saw for the first time any film by a movie titan like Alfred Hitchcock, but ROPE was not released to television like NORTH BY NORTHWEST or THE BIRDS or SHADOW OF A DOUBT or even THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. It was released late, presumably due to copywrite problems (similar problems keep many films from public viewing), so it was a movie that most people had heard of, but never watched. Many may have read of it in books like Francois Truffaud's book on Hitchcock. They may have been aware that Hitchcock decided to conduct a filming experiment: ROPE was a stage play by Patrick Hamilton (best remembered for his thriller ANGEL STREET...better remembered as GASLIGHT), and Hitchcock shot the film in a series of long takes of 9 to 11 minutes each, not moving the camera from the set (except for a few brief moments when the number of actors were reduced and concentrated in a different direction of the set). The content or story was barely noticed.Hitchcock, being an intelligent director when choosing his properties, made sure there was some element of the story that would hold the attention of the viewers. And normally his film stories were interesting (though some were not quite as interesting as he believed - witness his film of 19th Century Australia UNDER CAPRICORN). His choice of ROPE was good for it's story, based on the Leopold-Loeb case (see COMPULSION). As for the experiment, it is interesting the first time you see it, especially in Hitchcock's attempts to make the long takes flow effortlessly from one to the other. But once you see the film, all further viewings are handicapped by the experiment. It is too static: one wishes to see more camera movement (especially as it is already static from being a one set melodramatic play).The actors are able to alleviate this somewhat, as when Jimmy Stewart explains his theory of permissable homicide to Constance Collier. John Dall's sneaky, vicious persona aids in the film, his venomous little strokes usually followed by his "philosophical" explanations as to why they are acceptable for society's supermen - and Farley Granger's fretful and nervous behavior is a perfect balance to it. The three leads manage to carry the film very nicely. But they just barely make one forget the static nature of the film experiment.The film, as mentioned as above, is based on the Leopold-Loeb case of 1924, although here the film seems to be set in the late 1940s. Also it is set in Manhattan, in an apartment. Bobby Franks was killed in an automobile, and his body dumped in a culvert in a park in Chicago. However, it is interesting that here we see the murder (at the start of the film) unlike in COMPULSION. The film shows David Kentley (the victim) strangled by Dall and Granger. The murder weapon is a rope both of the killers grabbed and tightened around David's throat (thus linking them to each other in the murder). His body is put into a trunk, and the trunk (which is in the apartment's living room) is carefully set with a tablecloth and dishes for the guests coming to see Dall and Granger. The rope is used throughout the film, even somewhat sadistically by Dall towards David's father (Cedric Hardwicke)when Dall uses it to tie some books David lent him together, which are handed back to the victim's father.The real interest in the story to most viewers is the homosexual relationship of the two killers and their connection to Rupert (Stewart) who was their teacher at prep school. Rupert's relationship is possibly closer.Was he also gay? It is never quite settled. But the attitude Dall shows Stewart (somewhat defiant) suggests that he feels that the latter fully accepts his (and Granger's) actions and lifestyle as acceptable for the elite Stewart's superman theories support. But Stewart does have a sense of responsibility that overcomes his twisted Nietzchean ideas. In the end he will not cover up for his two students, and fires the pistol shot that will lead the police to come up to the apartment to find the dead body of David and arrest his two killers.The Nietzchean theme is part of the Leopold-Loeb Case (and appears in COMPULSION), but Hitchcock plays with it a bit more here, in such pieces of business as Stewart's conversation with Collier, and in Dall's determination to stage manage the dinner party he has invited everyone to in the apartment (not only the Victim, but his parents - although David's aunt comes and not his mother - the Victim's girlfriend and her former boy-friend). Dall does all this to watch Mr. Kently increasingly worry about David's failure to show up, and to watch David's girlfriend and her former boyfriend squirm in this unexpected reunion. As Dall (apparently a bi-sexual) was also a former boy-friend of the girl he is doubly gratified by this squirming, reassuring the nervous Granger that he only means to be bringing the girl and the former boy-friend together again. John Dall's career in films was short due to his premature death at an early age, but he was a very good actor who should have left a larger mark in film had he lived longer.ROPE is not Hitchcock's best film, and the experiment is far from a success, but it is a worthy movie to watch. Not top-draw Hitchcock, but in the second tier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>81 minutes of sheer Hitchcock fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time this year. I was amazed. Alfred Hitchcock does an absolutely amazing job of making the audience cringe. I read reviews about this movie saying that it wasn't well accepted by the audience when it first came out. But that is understandable because a lot of great classics aren't accepted when first released. One big example is The Shawshank Redemption, which didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. That doesn't make the content or the worth of the film any less. Rope was the twisted story based on the real life murder case of Leopold-Loeb. Two college students commit the "perfect murder" and invite the friends and family of their victim over for dinner. The acting is superb, especially from everyone's favorite, James Stewart. The fear builds slowly as this movie keeps you interested by morbid discussion that everyone has thought at one time or another. This movie really did creep me out, and although it might not be as thrilling as Rear Window or North by Northwest, it will not disappoint. You will be biting your nails for sure waiting to see what happens to the seemingly "perfect murder". I would easily give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Hitchcock Film From The 1940s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These "stage plays" made into movies usually bore me to death but this one was a notch above the tedious and too-talky Alfred Hitchcock films of the 1940s.John Dall, who went on to "cult status" fame with "Gun Crazy" (a.k.a. "Deadly Is The Female) two years later, was the most interesting character in this film. He played "Brandon Shaw." His partner-in-crime, "Philip Morgan," played by Farley Granger, was the annoyingly-wimpy guy who cracked under the pressure. The biggest name actor in the movie is James Stewart but these other two guys are the main stars. As people know, this is about two smug, college males who think they have pulled off the perfect crime because of their supposedly superior intellect and elitist attitude. It's based on a true-life event, famously labeled "The Leopold and Loeb Case." No sense going into more details since other reviewers have done that, and done it well.Suffice to say, this is well-acted, has a good amount of black humor with the dialog and has people that are easy to root against. Two things that are different from normal film fare of the day: it's in "real time" and it's in color. Some criticize the famous director for using the real-time method, but I give him credit for trying something new and bold. That "gimmick" certainly has worked in the successful TV series, "24.""Rope" is definitely worth a look if you've never seen it, just to see what happens to these arrogant punks. I found subsequent viewings less appealing as more and more of the characters in here (i.e. the old lady who preaches astrology, the annoying young woman, etc.) became unappealing. Stll, I think this is Sir Alfred's best work of the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taken to the logical conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Rope was his first film in color and the first film in color for James Stewart unless you count the last few minutes of Ice Follies of 1939. The part of Rupert Cadell, prep school teacher and house master and iconoclast was certainly the most unusual role Stewart had done up to that time.The original play, Rope's End, was written by British author Patrick Hamilton and first presented on the West End in the twenties. It was americanized and updated by Hitchcock. Because of the change in locale, I'm sure the film is not a true adaption of the original play. I'm wondering how much of a change was made for Stewart's character to fit the part.Rope is one of the few films that actually begins in its first seconds with a murder. It opens with John Dall and Farley Granger murdering acquaintance Dick Hogan. We see the last gasp of breath coming out of Hogan as Dall strangles him with a piece of rope. They hide the body in a large cedar chest and then proceed with a small party for some friends of their's and the deceased.Dall and Granger are based on Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold. This killing was done for no reason except for some twisted kicks. And they credit Stewart with being the real author of the murder. It seems as though Stewart has some interesting Nietzchean ideas about some folks just not being bound by ordinary laws and conventions. He's told them as much in class and has an influence on these two that he can't imagine.Stewart of course is invited to the party and bit by bit as the other guests wonder what might have happened to Hogan, Stewart suspects something is afoot. Especially with all the sly hints Dall keeps dropping. Two of the guests are Hogan's father and aunt played by Cedric Hardwicke and Constance Collier. Hardwicke is a gentle man with a sick wife at home and his concern for his son turns to a quiet, understated anxiety. For myself I think Hardwicke has the best performance in the film. When he leaves the party, your concern for how he and his wife will take the eventual news goes right with him.Of course when everything is discovered by Stewart, he's in shock. He cannot believe that his offhanded quips about murder being justified for some superior people has been taken to its logical conclusion by Dall and Granger. A lot is registered in Stewart's voice and facial expressions, he knows that morally if not legally he's got to bear some responsibility here.Rope being done by Hitchcock after World War II with the discovery of the Nazi death camps and that superman philosophy being put into real practice in the running of a country served as a timely reminder and a warning to those who would countenance such views. It's in fact a photographed stage play with all the action taking place in the Dall/Granger apartment. But the direction is smooth and the players are as capable a group as you'll find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confined? Hardly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film based on the principle of a one act play - don't know whether Hamilton's was or not. To criticise it for remaining within the apartment and lacking suspense strikes me as rather superficial.It would be hard for the film to find a reason to leave the apartment (it doesn't need to) and the suspense isn't so much to do with the act of murder, but whether Jimmy Stewart's character will confirm or betray the amoral stance his protégés claim to have learnt from him.The dialogue is rather stilted but no more and probably less so than much of the scripting of the time - indeed Stewart's own, initial, lightheartedness offers an instructive counterpoint to the formality of the rest of the cast and could be seen as deliberate as he is the only guest not to be fooled.There is a plausible homosexual undercurrent here and I agree that there's certainly a huge amount of ambiguity but let's not forget the whole 'Janet' issue and Stewart's interest in the housekeeper. To boil the whole film down to an "are they/aren't they?" argument may be hugely fashionable but I think it would be a disservice to a full understanding of a rich film accessible from a variety if angles - you could just as easily go S&amp;M with the rope or Marxist over the housekeeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one of Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope, the fifth film I have seen from Hitchcock, is possibly my favorite of his yet. It is cleverly written and masterfully directed to perfection with amazing suspense. Of course, many already know that it revolves around few cuts and involves really long camera shots, and while I am certainly that many dislike this gimmick, it never once failed to engage and entertain me. I found that it just absorbed me into the storyline more, possibly more than the other films I have seen from him for this reason. John Dall gives an amazing performance, whose character is insane yet very modernized and effective in his approach towards superiority. Farley Granger and James Stewart are also incredible, and the other several characters also enhance the realism. Technically, the film is of course amazing and the film certainly looks like it was made in the 70s or 80s, not the 40s. Overall, Rope was a brilliant film, like I said, possibly the most effective of Hitchcock I have seen so far (which are Psycho, The Birds, Rear Window, and Dial M for Murder) and it also brings up a very interesting moral dilemma. Hitchcock has done it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This excellent Hitch's film deals about two young man(John Dall and Farley Granger) who murder a pal.Then ,they are inviting a dinner party to familiars(Cedric Hardwicke) and friends(James Stewart, Joan Chandler among others), to their flat and the corpse is hidden into a large chest.Of course an intelligent guest(Stewart) is growing suspicion but there isn't one perfect crime.The movie contains suspense,tension,intrigue and plot twists.The picture packs long suspense set pieces with continuous intrigue maintained throughout and suspenseful ending .The film displays superb performances by main characters and supporting roles.Besides has a literately witty dialog by screenwriter the actor Hume Cronyn and based on a Patrick Hamilton playwright that after was adapted in films as Compulsion(Richard Fleischer) and Swoon.The picture is visually interesting and mostly involving and mysterious.The movie is shot in eight sequences of ten minutes and is his first film in color by Joseph Valentine and William V. Skall.Exceptional James Stewart in the first of the four movies which filmed with the master of suspense.The couple inspired on true characters-Leopold and Laub in Chicago the 1920s-is magnificently played by Farley Granger(played for Nicholas Ray) and John Dall(1918-1971, a theatre actor who only made eight films).Cameo Hitchcock as man walking in street after opening credits. Essential and indispensable watching for the Hitch lovers although he says in the famous interview with Francois Truffaut he wasn't proud but he considered a stupid experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmakers have all sorts of problems when selecting material, and that's compounded when there's a book or play involved. And its particularly difficult if you are an intelligent filmmaker, interested in twisting cinematic narrative. When you see the final product, its often great fun to know the original and how the filmmaker changed it.(I decided to re see this after learning today that Harry Potter's Dumbledore is gay, and how that will reinvent what we know.)The original story is about two rich, gay college students who live together. Their homosexuality is a secret. One partner is assertive, the other dominated. There is a college professor, also gay, with who the dominant kid had an affair, now past. This professor is considered to be a sort of superman by the now spurned boy.Meanwhile, to cover the truth, one of them had a girlfriend who subsequently left and is now engaged to another, the boy who turns up murdered. He was apparently going to out the pair and so they kill him early in the movie, the first few seconds in fact. All this was in the original, though I have it from remarks by the screenwriter.This is what is behind the flaunting of the secret, a sort of closeted secret. It is why the games with the professor and the former girlfriend are entangled. Its where the tension comes from and why the weak man breaks. Its why the original ending meant something.Hitchcock was disappointed in this because I think he made compromises early in the game to take out all the queer dynamics and just stick with the more generic morality of the thing. There are some cinematic tricks he pulls (that light through the window at the end), but he's highlighting something that has been eviscerated. Well, knowing what you do now, maybe you'll appreciate this more.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Horrible Film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I was appalled at it. These two friends decide to kill a third friend just for the thrill of it. Not only that, they put the lad's still warm body in a trunk, serve a cold buffet from it and invite the poor boy's dad and aunt. I couldn't believe how ghastly the subject matter was. This is a horrible film, I thought.But that is exactly what Hitch wants the viewer to think. Perhaps I'm too emotional but the portrayal of the lad's dad by Cecil Hardwicke was exemplary and had me feeling upset for him too. The callousness of Brandon, the way he lords it over the party cum wake, the way he manipulates his (patently obvious) boyfriend who genuinely regrets the whole business. I hate him to death!If you have a strong conscience this is tough meat to digest but very, very worth it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on DVD right after i saw psycho. to my surprise, rope was the better movie. it's very well made with 10-15 minute cuts, it seems more like a play than a movie. you have to be in the right mood to watch rope because it is a little boring, although the plot is pretty macabre when you really think about it: 2 young men (some fans say their characters are gay partners) murder someone, just for the sake of experimenting if they can get away with the perfect murder. they invite the guy's relatives over for a party, along with other people, and serve the food on the same cabinet where they stored the dead body. gross. it may seem like i spoiled it, but this all happens in the first 20 minutes. the title screen is misleading because it starts off with peaceful music, then shows the 2 guys strangling the other guy with a rope. it it also very impressive that this movie is in color, unlike all the other movies made in the 40's. most of the movie takes place in one room, the same room where the corpse is. the room has a large window in the background, where the icing on the cake is watching the sun slowly set, as this movie all linear. psycho is good, but this is just a bit better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock was a philosopher of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock is settling accounts with the united States in 1948, with the social Darwinism that has always been rampant, and in some period triumphant, in the USA. Fundamentally it is the idea that only good human beings, honest human beings succeed in society because they are chosen by God, hence they are superior in ethical values. In this film, there is no mention of God, right through to the final three minutes, but one young man decides to get rid of another young man for reasons we do not know, but as the result of a reasoning that states that superior people have the right to kill inferior people. It is in fact the good old ideology that excuses the master of a slave when he kills his slave because the slave is an inferior being. In 1948 the slave-masters are the rich and that young rich man believes he can kill another he considers inferior, except that he does it out of some challenge to provoke his own society. The killed young man is a member of that top society. And the killer and his associate, his accomplice throw a party just after killing the other and hiding him in a chest that is going to be used as the table for the buffet. Hitchcock finds it extremely funny to play on words and to create situations that become qui pro quos for us. But He also brings in an old teacher of these young men who had philosophically taught them that the superior people have the right to dominate, in a way or another, the inferior people in our society. Bringing this man in this party was the supreme achievement, and the supreme danger, for the killer because he is known as a suspicious and curious and scrutinizing and inquisitive mind that can read between lines and find out the truth even where it is not present. He is a conjurer of the truth. He is helped in doing that, in that mission of his by the maid who gives him the hat of the dead boy when he is on the point of going instead of his own. Then he will come back and confront the two killers and find out what they have done and manage to bring the police for the punishment of these two indecent beings. But that's when Hitchcock twists the whole story into the harshest accusation he could invent with this simple question: "Do you think you were God, to decide who was superior and who was inferior?" The twist is within a good protestant approach: if one really knows who is inferior, they would in that reasoning have the right- to kill the inferior ones. The Catholic approach of the problem that says that no one has the right to take a life because that life was given by God and God is the only one who can take it away or back is not even hinted at, which justifies then the conclusion from that teacher that society was going to make these killers pay for their crime in some kind of balanced declaration that implies one eye for one eye and one hand for one hand and one tooth for one tooth. Retaliation. With the distance of time that old film becomes a tremendous denunciation of killing other human beings, be it for some passion in the heart or mind of the murderer or be it for some retaliation from the society against that murderer: if one crime is unjustified, the retaliation to that crime is just as much unjustified. Both have to be equal for the second to be the retaliation of the first, hence both are murders. The Britisher was speaking there in Hitchcock, since Great Britain was going to be the first country in Europe to ban the death penalty in 1965. But that tradition of being ahead of others is an old habit in England who banned cruel punishments in its Bill of Rights in 1689.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At The End Of Their Rope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently inspired by the real-life 1920s murder case of Leopold and Loeb, the story's theme must be interpreted subjectively, since the moralistic Production Code in 1948 forbid any mention of homosexuality. At the film's very beginning, the two main characters, Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger), use a rope to strangle their friend David, and hide his corpse in a cedar chest in their swank NYC penthouse apartment. Brandon and Phillip are gay lovers.To add an artistic touch to their crime, they invite several guests over for a party, with finger food placed on top of the cedar chest. That's the film's setup.Based on a stage play, "Rope" is set almost entirely inside the penthouse. The script is heavy on dialogue, but because it is so clever, it never seems talky. As guests arrive, chat, and eat, they keep wondering where David is.The film is mostly a character study of Brandon and Phillip, and how they react under pressure. What's fun is trying to figure out whether these two will be found out, at the end of their little rope trick, so to speak.One problem with the script, aside from Production Code censorship, is the change that comes over Phillip. He agrees to the murder, but afterwords gets scared. Also, given Phillip's nervousness, why would Brandon still insist on having friends over?Even so, it's an interesting film, with its claustrophobic setting, the unusual setup, and the clever dialogue. James Stewart is miscast as the mentor of Brandon and Phillip. But other actors of that era apparently did not want the role, owing to the story's homosexual theme.The film displays some technical wizardry with the camera. But it's not obvious to viewers. One very effective scene has the guests just off-screen discussing their worry over David's puzzling absence, while the camera focuses entirely on the housekeeper as she clears off the top of the cedar chest in a perfunctory manner.That the Production Code had such power over film content in the 1940s is truly unfortunate. The result here is that the entire film seems a little off-kilter. The relationship between Brandon and Phillip is never talked about. Yet, "Rope" is still an excellent film, mostly because of the two main characters' audacious gambit and the script's terrific dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rope" is an Alfred Hitchcock film based off of a theatrical play and it shows tremendously. We follow the story of Brandon and Philip two men who have just committed murder on a friend they knew for the thrill. They go on to throw a party with the victim's relatives and friends, not knowing that the victim, David, is closer than they think. The camera-work in this film is brilliant, taking slow pans and wide shots building tension. The editing takes a less is more approach which makes it feel more like a play. The pacing is perfect for the movie's tone, along with the music as well. "Rope" is very well acted, and the script is genius. As the film progresses, we feel tension from conflicting emotions of what we want to happen. We want them to not murder again because, obviously murder is wrong, but we also don't want them to get caught. The film progresses as drama heightens as they believe their former College professor, named Rupert is onto them. It all leads up to an amazing climax, and great message of morality. This is my favorite Hitchcock film. My Verdict: 10/10: Brilliant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece whose very form defines the content ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Hitchcock film invites for rich debates full of open interpretations and absolutely none can be intellectually or emotionally assimilated in one viewing. "Rope" is not an exception, although it's exceptional.The movie is notorious for being one of the first to be shot in real time, featuring as few editing as possible to provide a sense of fluidity and continuity within the plot. The film is set like the very play it was adapted from, hence respects the unity of space, time and action with a remarkable precision. But beyond this technical achievement, "Rope" elevates itself to other cinematic levels, never is the experimental novelty used as an end but much more as a way to build a powerful psychological suspense. In other words, the editing serves the story and doesn't reduce it to an exercise in style.The movie opens with a shocking scream immediately followed by the last breath of David Kentley (Dick Hogan), tightly held by Brandon (John Dall) while Philip (Farley Granger) strangles him. But regarding Hitch's refined cynicism, the real shocker comes with the aftermath: Brandon puts the corpse in an antique wooden chest in the middle of the house, and light a cigarette for relief while Philip doesn't look quite enthusiastic. Hitchcock was said to shoot murders as love scenes, and love scenes as murders, while the murder's aftermath clearly has some sexual undertones and a sort of 'we done it' effect, I think relying all the interactions between the two villains on that aspect is just ignoring what I consider to be the core of the film.Endless threads have been posted about "Rope" homosexual undertones and while I understand this positively contributed to the movie's fame as the first to cover some controversial material, I don't think it plays a significant part to the plot in the very context of the film, regardless of all the peripheral elements that went probably unknown by movie viewers in 1948. This is why I feel like cheating by knowing that Brandon and Philip were a couple and that their admiration toward their ex-headmaster Rupert (James Stewart) confined to a more intimate form of appreciation, because it has nothing to do with the movie and Stewart's performance and it distracts from the real beauty of the character study which is Rupert's redemption. I'll get back to that.Now, so many people focus on the Brandon-Philip duo and Rupert but there's a character in this film so unfairly overlooked: it's the murder itself. Through the body hidden in the chest, improvised as a dinner table when the guests come to the house: David's father, his aunt, his fiancé Janet and her ex Kenneth, they're all discussing about the reasons of David's absence and our knowledge makes the whole setting particularly disturbing and adds a level of poignancy and subtle sadness that doesn't get much attention. While Brandon amusingly leaves some hints of the murder, Philip drowns his sorrow in alcohol and from his tormented conscience, we feel the presence of the murder, and Rupert the headmaster will be our guide to the macabre discovery.What makes the murder so cinematically fascinating is how fully cynical it is. Beyond the whole setting that makes the table look like a sordid altar, the reason behind the atrocious act IS the real groundbreaking thing about this film. Brandon 'the brain' and Philip 'the tool' did this to validate the very idea that some superior men have the right to decide who deserves to live and die among inferior human beings, believing in the idea of 'supermen'. These Nietzchean conceptions have been inculcated by Rupert who, during one of these discussions, materializes his theories about the triviality of killing. His words, spoken with a sort of calculated cynicism, rings in Brandon's heart as true words of wisdom while it shocks David's father who intelligently refers to Hitler.The ambiguity, yet the fascinating aspect of the murder, is in the way it contradicts itself. Brandon kills to prove his control and superiority over David and all the others. He acts like a puppeteer that brings all of David's relatives in the house, playing the matchmaker between Janet and Kenneth. He's so confident that he deliberately leaves clues and hints, as if he unconsciously wanted to lead Rupert to the truth, what Philip foresees and tries to hide under many drinks of champagne. Rupert wants to provoke his mentor's admiration, for the student who finally made the words reality. And as the movie progresses, the secret is in danger of being unveiled especially in an endless shot where everyone discusses about David's absence while the maid is cleaning up the chest? but the twist doesn't happen here, not even in the genius part where Rupert puts the wrong hat and realize it features David's initials.The twist is symbolical, as the most important development lies in Rupert's morality. His horrified reaction when he discovers the corpse is the pivotal point where he reconsider all the ideas he believed in. All his life toying with the ideas of supermen, inferior and superior, Rupert underestimated the extent of his charisma and the way he transmitted extremely dangerous ideas, his character's arc is achieved when he redeems himself by punishing the two killers and calling the police, after a passionately hateful speech, where part of the hatred seems to be aimed toward him. The movie ends silently with the three men waiting for the police to come, each one carrying a part of guilt, the one who held the victim, the one who strangled him, and maybe the most guilty of all, the one who communicated the hatred.How pointless are all the debates about the sexual orientations when the film is so intellectually rich. The best in "Rope" is in the cold and sophisticated murder and its hideous but spectacular unmasking, while the rest is simply film-making at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock once said that his movies, "went from being failures to being masterpieces without ever being successful." Perhaps none of his films deserves this description more than ROPE, made in 1948 as the first project for Hitchcock's own (short-lived) production company, Transatlantic Pictures. On its initial release, ROPE was received with overwhelming hostility, either derided as nothing more than a stunt and a gimmick, or actually banned outright in parts of the USA, the UK and Europe due to its exceptionally disturbing subject matter, of which "homosexuality" is the least important. Of course, it was a box-office failure. As a result, ROPE was removed from circulation for 25 years after its release by Hitchcock himself (who personally owned the rights), and only became available for viewing in 1983 a few years after the director's death. It was unavailable on video until the 1990s, and as a result gained something of a reputation as a "lost" film. Only now is ROPE getting the recognition it deserves, and its presence on the IMDb "Top 250" list is one of many indicators that ROPE's time has finally arrived. I will not comment on the film's extraordinary technique or on the homosexual innuendo, as so many others have already done so. Instead, I wish to discuss only the film's themes. Set entirely within a luxurious Manhattan apartment, ROPE depicts the downfall of Brandon (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger), a pair of thrill-killers who murder their school chum David (Dick Hogan) because they believe that they are "superior" beings who have the right to decide who will live or die. Unlike any other Hitchcock film, the murder occurs within the first 60 seconds, and we spend the remaining 74 minutes of the movie wondering whether and how the killers will be caught. In an act of supreme arrogance, Brandon and Philip have planned the murder to coincide with a party which will be attended by the victim's father, aunt and fiancée, among others, and even go so far as to serve a buffet-style dinner on top of the very chest containing David's dead body. ROPE is one of Hitchcock's most disturbing films because it implicates the audience in the murder and then forces us to side with the killers - bizarrely, we do not want them to be caught and most of the film's extreme tension and suspense result from this psychological dilemma. You will be on the edge of your seat during one scene where the camera just sits there while the housekeeper clears away the dinner remains off of the chest - you just KNOW she is going to open it, and you actually breathe a sigh of relief when she is stopped at the last moment! Furthermore, ROPE operates at some level as a critique of upper-class manners and morals (or the lack thereof) - Brandon and Philip seem to be exemplary members of the US upper crust. One of the party guests - Rupert Cadell (a badly miscast Jimmy Stewart, in a role which was refused by a number of stars beforehand) - eventually begins to suspect something strange, but even he cannot bring himself to believe that his former students have actually done what he fears, because David Kentley's death becomes his fault. Rupert Cadell is a type easily recognizable to anyone who has experienced the hell of graduate school in an elite Northeastern university - gifted, but glib, facile, and espousing fashionably nihilistic theories based on complete contempt for the entire human race as a means of amusing others, inflating one's personal reputation as an "original thinker" and rising on the social ladder. Isolated in his ivory tower, Rupert seems completely oblivious to the truth that ideas have consequences. Like the 1990s American PSYCHO, ROPE raises some serious questions about the morality of the American elite - these are not ghetto gang-bangers, but the best and the brightest. Just a few months ago in the real world, a handsome, educated young medical student became known as the "Craigslist Killer" due to his slaughter of a masseuse he met online. The newsmedia were full of pundits who were shocked beyond belief that an attractive youth from a "good" background could in fact be nothing more than a callous killer. This kind of thinking equates an attractive appearance and a moneyed background with moral rightness. ROPE is a masterful critique of this brainless American mindset in which reality and appearance are one. America seems to be suffering these days from an epidemic of arrogance in which money and power are believed to be the same as virtue and decency. In ROPE, Brandon never questions for a single second either his own presumed "superiority," or the notion that this putative superiority gives him the power of life and death. Even more importantly, Brandon kills to please an authority figure, Rupert, who until the night of David Kentley's party, professes fashionable nihilism and misanthropy as a "philosophy of life." ROPE is a powerful critique of all those who believe that their membership in any elite group gives them the right to decide who will live and who will die. It becomes more thought-provoking and disturbing with each viewing. I have been to parties in New York where the conversation has revolved around such subjects as the astrological signs of movie stars, and every time I watch ROPE, it makes me look at those around me in a new and disturbing light. This is why I think ROPE is actually the most frightening film Hitchcock ever made - its world is so recognizably our own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some commentators miss the point of the 10-minute takes, etc.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen several negative comments about the eight 10-minute takes and three fade cuts that comprise this film, and many of them seem to miss the point. For example, bob the moo said, "but I don't understand why he didn't just accept that he would have to make do with 10 [actually, eight] different shots instead of trying to hide the edit. Each time he does it by zooming in on a black jacket and then pulling out again after the edit."The whole idea was to build the suspense and make the action appear to take place in "real time" by not having the camera appear to blink. Thus the 10-minute takes (and three fade cuts at approximately 20-minute intervals); and I think it works very well. It also makes one appreciate the excellence of the acting. It is extremely difficult for actors to execute a film flawlessly in only eight 10-minute takes, and the three principal actors did a fantastic job under very stressful circumstances.I think the reason the film was not a big box-office success is that people were expecting the usual Hitchcock action (think of earlier Hitchcock films such as Saboteur, Foreign Correspondent, The 39 Steps or The Man Who Knew Too Much). But any serious film buff should not miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch makes suspense with us knowing something that the majority of the characters don't...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often, Alfred Hitchcock's ability to create suspense comes from the audience sharing the same amount of knowledge as the main character, and not knowing what's coming. In this respect, "Rope" shows that he can make even more suspense from the audience knowing something that the majority of the characters don't ? that there is a dead body in a chest in the centre of the living room. The only two people that do know this are Brandon and Philip, who killed the man in the chest, and then invited his family and friends to a party, in some ways showing off to the audience how clever they are. The two are fantastic creations ? we constantly despise Brandon, but somehow feel for Philip, and gasp throughout when they're almost found out. It's strange how he gets you to empathise with the killers at some points.The party plays out fairly normally, with intellectual conversation and various arguments between characters. It's slightly amusing how philosophy and astrology are mentioned within the same conversation, but this allows us to learn more about the invitees ? how two of them used to be romantically involved, and one is now the fiancée David, the dead man. The greatest part of the story is watching James Stewart's character, Brandon and Philip's old teacher, figure things out from the hints given. The interrogation of Philip, set to Philip's piano playing and Rupert's (Stewart) messing with the metronome, is a perfect psychological study of the character, as he gets more and more nervous. When the party is over, it seems like they're both safe until Rupert returns, having left something behind. The film ends with the three of them in the apartment, with a really great fade out ? the sound of sirens getting closer.Outside of plot, the film is a technical experiment. It's not only in real time, but shot as if it's only one long take. Cuts are cleverly disguised by moving the camera into somebody's back. The sense of continuity adds to the tension of the story, as we know we're seeing everything that's happened. The lack of cutting between characters faces in a conversation means that we know we're constantly watching the most important thing. The single setting is used really well, and the moment where Brandon is putting the eponymous Rope in a kitchen drawer is a heart-in- mouth moment, as the swing door reveals everything, but only to us. Where the film succeeds best is in marrying the fascinating character study with the genius cinematography, in a way which doesn't detract from either. It's both a masterpiece in storytelling and filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now the fun begins!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a tantalizing little Hitchcock thriller that explores the concept of right and wrong and whether the 'intellectually superior' have an inalienable right to act outside the boundaries of accepted human morality. The film remains true to that premise even if some of the scenes on the way to the finale stretch credibility. Particularly in the way the titled 'rope' was portrayed as intending to be a definitive piece of evidence setting Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) on his way to solving the crime. It was after all, as Brandon Shaw (John Dall) described it, an ordinary household object, and it didn't convey to me that it should have been crucial to the story's outcome.What does work in the picture is the way Stewart's character insightfully picks up on miscues from Brandon and his partner Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger), and capitalizes on those moments to trip up the duo - "You're quite a good chicken strangler as I recall". What becomes clear throughout the story is that Phillip himself never fits the bill as one of those intellectually superior folks who fit into Brandon's stereotype. I began to wonder why he wasn't the one in the cedar chest.Where the suspense is at it's best occurs as Mrs. Wilson (Edith Evanson) begins clearing the makeshift party table, each object taken strips away another layer of secrecy threatening exposure of the crime. It was an effective prelude to the cat and mouse tension provided by Rupert's return to the apartment. At the same time though, it was clear that Hitchcock's resolution required a certain suspension of disbelief, beginning with the 'lost' cigarette case ruse. It would have been easily noticed by Brandon that the top of the chest was empty before he placed any books on it. Even more unclear is why Rupert would have turned his back on the boys after the discovery of the body was made. The desperate pair should have been able to immobilize the older man without too much trouble. Could it be that by this time, they felt their own intellectual inferiority was in need of punishment?It's for those reasons I find some of Hitchcock's early American films hard to accept, as certain elements seem forced to fit the outcome. I have similar reservations about 1951's "Strangers On A Train" and 1954's "Dial M For Murder". Yet on another level they work as entertaining murder mysteries, as long as you watch them without being too critical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A party that *has* gone down in history...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been interested to see Hitchcock's ROPE, mostly because I've read about the real-time technique, amply explained in other reviews, that Hitchcock used in order to lend some real, sustained suspense to a story. Because of the way the 8 different ten-minute sections of film are spliced together, one could almost believe that the entire film was shot at one go. This does mean, of course, that ROPE as a film comes off almost as a stage play, since the action is confined mostly to the one living room, with some incident strolling off into the hallway, the dining room and the kitchen. Still, I don't think ROPE would work half as well as it does if simply transposed onto the stage: some of the tricks Hitchcock uses because of the technique he has chosen are very clever, including one shot in which Brandon Shaw (John Dall) enters the kitchen, and as the door swings out behind him, we see Brandon gleefully dropping the rope that killed David Kentley into a kitchen drawer. Another compelling shot is when Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) re-enacts the murder he suspects might have happened; the camera tracks all the different spots and items Rupert mentions. In other words, Hitchcock's direction is truly first-rate, as usual and as expected.What problems one might find with ROPE really come from the story and its treatment of the topic it has chosen (murder). It's not a bad one, by any means. In fact, it is hardly dated at all, and the screenplay could easily have been filmed today and still made appealing to modern audiences. To its infinite credit, ROPE isn't played for horror-movie shocks, although the subject matter it deals with could easily shock people as much now as I'm sure it did then. How could one not be horrified by the callousness with which Brandon carries out his little supper party, with his murder victim comfortably esconsced in a chest which he then cannot resist using as the buffet table for his guests? As if it wasn't evident enough by that last measure that Brandon was a very disturbed man--to put it mildly, his guests, of course, include David's father (Cedric Hardwicke), David's fiancee Janet (Joan Chandler), and his old prep school teacher Rupert. Brandon also makes David's father a gift of some first-edition books, tied with, yup, you guessed it, the murder weapon. It's quite hard to get any more perverted than that, even by today's standards.So the story and the characters work--Brandon's chilling and cavalier attitude to human life is actually an accurate precursor to Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, just as Philip (Farley Granger) represents the easily-influenced section of the populace, serving as the moral juxtaposition to Brandon's own amorality. Granger is especially effective when he breaks down through the course of the evening--his pasty white face, beaded with sweat, in the last fifteen minutes of the film is very convincing. Aside from the murderers, however, we've also got James Stewart in his first Hitchcock venture, twisting his amiable screen persona to make the character of Rupert Cadell a creditable one... not an easy task, considering the slightly shoddy handling of Rupert's final, supposedly rousing speech berating his students for taking his words and lessons far beyond his own intentions. Stewart does an excellent job with the speech, as can be expected from an actor of his talent and skill. However, it doesn't help that the words and motivations of Rupert remain somewhat hollow. (Though that could arguably be the point, since Rupert is, by his own admission, the humane version of Brandon and has thus been leading his life under the same intellectual illusions, but without the same root disregard for human life.)All in all, ROPE is an excellent piece of film-making, particularly since it is a great showcase of the real-time filming technique. Its script doesn't sparkle as NORTH BY NORTHWEST does (though the in-joke thrown in referencing Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Hitchcock's 'Notorious' is a hoot), but it does provide characters that have interesting psychological depths well worth exploring. Not 100% a classic, but well worth the watch nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It surprises me that i might read a negative review for this film anywhere on the internet, let alone imdb. If you dislike the picture that is of-course your right, but allow me to highlight some of the lighter moments of the film.The film is shot in eight takes of almost ten minutes each, some takes cutting to other positions in the scene, most zooming in a dark area (i.e. back of someone's jacket) and then pulling back into the new take.The film watches very much like a theatrical play might, one continuous scene. We begin with the murder itself, in the very first scene. We follow as the murderers justify the crime (for our sake) and outline their attempt at social elitism by inviting the victim's family for dinner over the deceased's resting/hiding place.The lighting and sets are wonderful. Watch for the subtle changes in the backdrop through the apartment window, updated each time for each take bringing us through late afternoon into early evening. Watch for the lingering camera on the chest as the maid gradually removes items from the chest in order to store some books (we know something will prevent her, the story must go on, but in Hitchcock fashion we are kept on the edge of our seats). And almost as importantly listen to the dialogue. Dozens of witty references are thrown about, none the least of which is the homosexual reading of the film and the dialogue ("You are so queer", "I felt nothing at all, until the body went limp... at which time i experienced a sense of jubilation", you get the picture... it's delish).I truely consider this one of Hitchcock's greatest, truely an experiment that came off, and a must see (and study) for fans of Hitch.</fullReview>

Farley Granger is fantastic as weak Phillip Morgan who can't handle the guilt of killing their school mate... and John Dall is excellent as the confident and opinionated Brandon !!! But by far the best cast actor in that film, is the ever wonderful James Stewart as Rupert Cadell !! his whole attitude and manner are absolutely fantastic, and his finishing speech after discovering the body is definitely worth a listen !!!I would certainly recommend this film because it's brilliant, a wonderful Hitchcock film which deserves a lot more praise that it gets !!!a must see !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent psychological thriller by Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This obscure movie has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films. In my opinion, it marks the beginning of the golden era of largely flawless Hitchcock films that runs for 15 years through the release of "The Birds" in 1963.The movie is based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, inspired by the Leopold-Loeb case. The film follows two young men, in one apartment, on one night, as they throw a dinner party for a bunch of people that were close friends of both themselves and a third young man they have just murdered for no reason other than to have experienced the act of doing so. For the added thrill, they throw the victim's body into a chest from which they serve their guests their buffet dinner.The dinner guests include David's father, who is making constant references to how he is worried about how his only child is missing when David doesn't turn up where he is supposed to, and how his wife, David's mother, is most consumed with worry. Janet, David's current girlfriend, is also invited, as is Janet's old boyfriend. These two interact very awkwardly, to the delight of their murderous hosts, until the end of the party. Janet explains to her old flame how she took up with David because of love, not because of his money, and when her old boyfriend sees that Janet genuinely cares for David, the two reach a truce. The point of all of this conversation at the party is to show that David - as is true with all human beings - isn't some inferior lab rat that the two murderers had the right to exterminate as a means of spending an otherwise boring afternoon. He is a human, as important as any other, who has people who care about him and will obviously mourn his death.James Stewart is great as the murderers' former teacher, Rupert, who solves the mystery that the two killers have pretty much dared him to discover and solve. Hitchcock was always able to direct James Stewart to play just about any role he could dream up without letting Stewart's "every man" quality get in the way of the quality and believability of his performance. It is interesting to note that at the end of the film, from James Stewart's final speech to the two murderers, that we assume the pair will be tried for murder and executed. Some people don't know that although Leopold and Loeb - the inspiration for this film - were sentenced to life in prison for their crime, that Leopold was released on parole in 1958 after serving 33 years, and lived another 13 years in freedom before his death. Loeb was killed by another inmate in the 1930's, otherwise he would have likely been paroled eventually, too. Since Leopold and Loeb killed a child rather than another adult, we can't really be sure what would have become of Hitchcock's two murderers had this been a real life situation.The one thing that did surprise me was on the DVD commentary, when it was mentioned that the two murdering college students were homosexuals, and that Hitchcock pushed the envelope on innuendos on this subject just as far as he thought the censors would let him. Maybe I'm just dense, but I never got that vibe out of the movie at all, until I was told that it existed in the first place."Rope" is just a little over an hour long, and is performed entirely in one room of one apartment. It is a psychological thriller, not one of Hitchcock's action thrillers. It's definitely worthwhile for any Hitchcock fan, but it might disappoint someone who buys this without knowing the movie's format and is expecting something like "The Man Who Knew Too Much" or "North by Northwest".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't do as I say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope" can probably claim to be the darkest of all Hitchcock's catalogue, probably pipping "The Trouble with Harry" and "Psycho" to the post. Taken on by him partly as a cinematic challenge in its use of extended scenes (an exercise he renewed with lesser returns in the succeeding "Under Capricorn"), here the showiness of technique is put squarely at the service of a grimly dark story, based on the infamous Leopold and Loeb case of the 1920's. It almost certainly had to be based on a real-life precedent as its theme of murder as intellectual exercise is otherwise so abhorrent and unthinkable that no writer could dream it up, certainly in austere post-War Hollywood.Tightly condensed into its 80 minute time-frame and eschewing background music completely, the film starts provocatively with the emotionless strangulation of the "inferior" David Kentley (in fact, young Kentley seems highly regarded by everyone else in the cast) by the Nietzche-inspired pairing of John Dall and Farley Granger. The underlying (and daring) theme of homo-eroticism is manifest between them from the start, with, ahem, dominator Dall's post-coital drag of his cigarette immediately the deed is done and his description of the murder as an almost orgasmic experience.The murder itself is not enough for the nefarious duo, they require to play out a macabre feast scene at a party to which they invite the victim's family and new girlfriend, with their college-master role-model, at least in theory, James Stewart also in attendance, seemingly seeking an audience and in particular from Stewart's Rupert Cadell, vindication and even appreciation for their handiwork.Watching the film, superbly captured in luminous colour in Hitch's first colourised film, although mildly distracted by the fade and restart devices necessarily required to change the rolls in the cameras of the time, the viewer's ears are rewarded too for the razor sharp dialogue, all brought masterfully to the boil before Cadell confronts his own part in unwittingly inspiring Dall and Granger's actions before relieving the tension by shooting the gun he's won from Granger into the night sky.The tension is built up brilliantly, the pacing surely handled and the acting excellent throughout. One can imagine "family guy" Stewart balking at playing such a flawed character and can sense his awkwardness early on but he grows into the part and is convincing by the conclusion. Dall is brilliant as the controlling instigator of the situation but Granger too is fine in playing the weaker link of the two.The use of the extended takes does of course play up further the film's theatrical origins, but the way Hitchcock inverts this disadvantage (instead of the customary opening out of the action, he here condenses and intensifies it) shows his mastery of his métier.This is a difficult film to watch, wholly to do with its unsavoury subject matter, but Hitchcock makes it compelling and skilfully avoids imbuing Dall and Granger with anything more than surface charm. They , not the doomed Kentley are the inferior beings and rightly end the movie hoist with their own petard, outcasts from the society they see themselves raised above, with only the hangman's rope ahead of them. One wonders if the unflinching Dall might still derive a kick from that impending event, I shouldn't be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a well-done special effects movie, (yes they exist) Rope relies on more than a technical gimmick. It was done almost entirely in one shot, save a few cheats and for characters blocking out the camera as it was reloaded. This makes for an interesting experiment, but what really stands out is the disturbing study of good and evil.The acting is stifled at first, until Jimmy Stewart shows up. Hitchcock cleverly sneaks in Stewart rather than giving him the flourishing entrance of a star. Stewart plays a much darker role than usual, a morally ambiguous teacher who has unknowingly inspired his students to commit the perfect crime. The conversation about cases of acceptable murder starts out comical but becomes darker and darker, especially when it turns to Hitler. So close after WWII, it must have been like discussing Bin Laden today.The 'one shot' moves towards one of Hitchcocks's darkest and most troubling endings, up there with Frenzy and The Birds. I am someone who does not often think highly of any movie made before 1967, (save Citizen Kane and a number of Hitch's movies) Rope resonates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misconceived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is generally regarded as one of Hitchcock's failures, but many reviewers on this site have attempted to rescue its reputation. I find their arguments interesting but not convincing. There is too much wrong with this picture. The source material is weak, the screenplay is inadequate, the casting is hopeless and Hitchcock's technical experiment is misconceived.I have never seen it, but Hamilton's play probably ran about two hours. Hitchcock has trimmed it to a brisk 75 minutes. However, this undermines his decision to 'preserve the unities', because the whole party scene is now unrealistically abbreviated. It also means that information is given in such a rush that very little of the sub-text is actually on screen.The play is based on a classic 'folie a deux', where two people form a bond against the rest of the world and egg each other on to do something that neither would have done alone. In this case, the killers' antagonism is partly rooted in their sense of rejection and isolation as homosexuals in a censorious society.It is also about a schoolteacher's moral crisis as he comes to realise that his cynically playful philosophical speculations have been taken seriously, with tragic results.However, by beginning the story with the murder the actual relationship between Brandon and Phillip is never really explored and the homosexual undertones are so deeply buried as to be effectively non-existent. Instead, the relationship and its consequences have to be explained retrospectively though stolidly expository dialogue. Similarly, Rupert's background, character and former relationship with the killers is hardly touched on and he has barely expounded his cynical views when he is forced to recant them.The focus of the story, therefore, shifts from the characters and their relationships to Rupert's suspicions about what has happened. Consequently, the suspense is mostly to do with whether the killers can get through the evening without anyone discovering the body in the trunk.In short: the movie is interested in the inherent suspense of the situation, rather than in how that situation came about, or how it affects the people involved.This would be OK, except that much of suspense lies in the verbal duels between Rupert and Brandon, but they are not very well written. The dialogue is generally very flat and prosaic. There is a lot of it, but it is strictly functional and there is scarcely a line that really sparkles with wit or menace. As a result we get no sense that Rupert is an aloof armchair philosopher who enjoys outraging convention with his wild free-thinking, or that Brandon is a clever, bitter psychopath. A psychopath, yes: but clever?This is not helped by the casting.Jimmy Stewart was a competent actor, but clearly miscast. He is too folksy to play a character like Rupert. We believe his shocked denunciation of Brandon at the end, but not his earlier pseudo-Nietzchean speculations. The part had been turned down by Cary Grant (who would also have been a disaster) and should probably have been offered to someone like Ray Milland, Frederick March, James Mason or George Sanders.At 30, John Dall seems too old for Brandon. He comes across as arrogant and rather stupid. The screenplay saddles him with an irritating stutter which he uses throughout. He would have fared better if someone had simply told him to use it more sparingly (only when under pressure) but nobody did.Farley Granger was a limited actor and it shows. He plays Phillip all on the same note and his continual panic is both wearing and implausible. We never believe in his relationship with Brandon because it has effectively broken down by the time the movie begins. How he came to acquiesce in Brandon's murder plan is a profound mystery. We can only speculate how things might have turned out if Montgomery Clift had accepted either of the two main parts.Nobody else registers.To make these performances work, despite the miscasting and the inadequacies of the screenplay, Hitchcock needed to spend a lot of time with the actors, but his attention was elsewhere.This was not the first play he had shot. In the early Thirties, he had filmed Juno and the Paycock in a very conventional way. Here he wanted to do something different: to shoot it in 'real time' with a single camera and no editing. He could have elected to have his camera tracking up and down outside the set, shooting through the 'forth wall' and simply recording the actors, but that is not how he liked to work. At heart, Hitchcock always remained a silent movie maker. He liked to tell a story visually and manipulate the audience's response through his choice of lenses, camera angles, framing and lighting of shots, tracking, panning and editing.In Rope he wanted to discard editing but retain everything else. This would have been feasible if he had access to a Steadicam, but he didn't. What he had instead was a massive Technicolor camera dollying through the set in eight or nine minute takes. This was a huge logistical challenge that occupied all of Hitchcock's attention and energy. He managed to achieve some striking and revealing set-ups, but the camera has to plod ponderously from one to the other so that the overall pacing is noticeably draggy.Meanwhile, his actors are left struggling with their inappropriate and underwritten parts, trying to give engrossing performances while stepping over cables and watching an army of stage hands pull the set apart in front of Hitchcock's lumbering Technicolor juggernaut.Rope usually gets a mention in any overview of Hitchcock's work on the basis that it is an interesting experiment. In fact, it is an uninteresting experiment. There are great Hitchcock pictures, good ones and not-so-good ones, but he only made a handful of boring movies.Rope is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut Claustrophobic Hitchcock at his most cutting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in Rear Window, the drama of Hitchcock's under-appreciated psychological thriller 'Rope' unfolds in an apartment and the stifling setting seems to heighten the tension and the increasing paranoia of Farley Granger's disturbed Philip. As Roman Polanski realised years later, putting character's in a tight setting can lead to all kinds of madness, even murder.Adapted from a play (and based on a real case), the film is driven mainly by the superb dialogue and interactions which offer not only startling pictures of psychosis but also cruel social commentaries and savage discussions on Nietzsche's theory of the 'super man'.Unlike many Hitchcock films, the suspense does not rely on startling images or Bernard Herman's dramatic scores but rather the unravelling of a supposed 'perfect murder' in real time. Hitchcock's decision to shoot the whole movie with lengthy takes was ground-breaking with scenes lasting up to 10 unbroken minutes.Some critics have suggested that this added pressure contributes to the edginess of Dall and Granger as they become more and more jumpy and nervous throughout. James Stewart is brilliant as a cold yet principled Rupert Cadell who is horrified by the sadism of his former students. He is unusually understated and his character development over a short time period is immense and tragic.Overall, this is one of Hitchcock's most under-rated works. It is certainly one of his most thought-provoking and shocking. The acting at times is slightly theatrical (probably due to the play-like format). Nevertheless it is worthy of the great director</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire movie takes place in a living room but unlike Carnage (2011), 80 min movie pass quickly because of the climate of tension that gradually growing. The two protagonists Brandon (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger) kill David Kentley (Dick Hogan) just for the pleasure of killing someone and offer a feast to friends and family of the deceased. The charm of the plot is that a dining table is where the body of the deceased and thereafter suspicions about party hosts begin to emerge. The film is engaging to the point you cheer for the anti-heroes avoid detection. The film loses some points because, despite its climax be engaging, the outcome of the work is a little forced and emotionless. 8/10 by:pinhaocozido</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rope is best known for its innovative technique of using long camera shots and limited editing, this is done very well and feels as if you are watching a play where the curtains never close and it never fades to black. Though this technique didn't catch on after Rope, it still is an impressive accomplishment especially considering the size of the cameras they were using. Though it is often overshadowed by the filming style, the story in Rope is engaging and still holds up to this day. Jimmy Stewart and John Dall give excellent performances, and though Farley Granger overacts in several scenes and feels like a stage actor, which adds to the film's play like atmosphere.The film also features excellent dry humor from Jimmy Stewart and manages to be filled with suspense even though you already are pretty sure how it is going to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rope is an Amazing Film and a step up for film at the time of its release.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is based on a play which is based on a true story about the murder of Bobby Franks, a 14 year old boy who was strangled in 1922 by a duo called Leopald and Loeb. Hitchcock called this film an experiment that failed. But it will go down in history as the pre-cursor to the Spanish horror film The Silent House and Its inferior American Remake.The story follows Brandon, a genius, and Phillip, a neurotic wussy boy who strangle a man to death and hide him in a table. They then invite a bunch of people over including James Stewart's Rupert Cadall. A House Master that is a threat to Phillip as he thinks Rupert is going to find the body.This is a work of art. The film has a max of 10 shots. Each ranging from 9 to 15 minutes long. The film is one of the first to take place in real time and it works quite well for its age.James Stewart is one of the greatest things about Rope. His performance is fantastic as Rupert. This character is also written very well as he finds holes in the two's murder plot making him one of the smartest characters of the 40's.The problem I had with this film, is that the movie is only 80 minutes long. I think Hitchcock's imagination is limited here because its an adaptation of a play of the same name. But if his cleverness could of made 10 more minutes with an epilogue saying what happened to Brandon and Phillip, then it would have made the movie better.This is a film about dialog. Lots of it. They do not change the setting one bit. It is the same room for the next 80 minutes and they use it well. If you look hard enough, you can actually see some cameos by director Hitchcock himself. The film is written by Arthur Laurents and does a fantastic job with the screenplay. It must be really hard trying to get 15 minutes of footage in one shot.Rope has become a classic like other Hitchcock films over the last half century. Its techniques, its plot, its characters are all strongly amusing and will not keep your eyes off the screen. It is one of the classics. You can find this movie to buy and rent on ITunes for 3-4 Rental.96/100 A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intrusive thoughts like: "what if I drive into oncoming traffic" are actually fairly common and almost everyone has them. What is less frequent is the initiation of these usually irrational thoughts and acting on sudden urge. It is always fun to provoke deep discussions with friends and engage in higher thinking, but too much illogical experimentation can be dangerous. We have all wondered, in hindsight, how certain situations would play out had we acted differently. The "perfect" murder has been plotted in numerous movies, including Hitchcock's thriller "Dial M for Murder." Yet in every movie, the killer always manages to collapse due to a flaw. Whether it be a weak accomplice, lack of attention to covering up evidence or just a bad pokerface, conditions before and after a murder always seem to affect the killer in unpredictable ways. The problem with Brandon was his hubris. He considers himself a superior being all the while rejecting Hitler and other ruthless dictators' views. This hypocrisy and fallacious logic, combined with his excessive pride, results in his downfall.Planning and executing the "perfect" murder is one thing. Celebrating it with oblivious family and friends of the victim is another. Murder for the sole reason of pleasure and superiority is almost worse than killing for revenge. Thinking one person is beneath another or worth less is a tragic flaw in society, and one that is evidently exposed in this masterpiece by Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Top 3 Personal Favourites By Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most innovative films of its time, Alfred Hitchcock's Rope introduces a number of filmmaking experiments which, even today, remain widely unexplored in the world of cinema. It is an immensely captivating tale of two men who strangle one of their acquaintances, hide his body in their apartment, and then throw a party to determine the perfection of their crime.Filmed in a manner that gives the illusion of being shot in a single take, the biggest strength of this film is how effortlessly it manages to engage the viewers in its expertly crafted plot &amp; sustain the tension throughout its runtime even when the audience is aware of how the movie will end. The direction by Hitchcock is an absolute class &amp; the camera-work simply adds a new chapter to the manual of filmmaking.On an overall scale, Rope is a masterfully directed, deftly scripted, meticulously crafted, tightly edited, wonderfully photographed, tensely scored &amp; strongly performed cinema which also works as one of the finest examples of its genre(s) and, without a shadow of a doubt, remains a remarkable achievement in the glorious career of the legendary filmmaker that still hasn't aged a day.A timeless classic. A genre masterpiece. And one of my absolute favourites from the 'Master of Suspense'. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's underrated experimental movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An underrated Hitchcock thriller from the 40s. Two college students played by John Dall and Farley Granger murder a classmate just for the sake to prove that they are intellectually superior and that they can get away with the perfect murder. They store his body in a box and invite the classmate's family and friends along with their teacher played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart. For its time this movie was innovative in a few things: one is that the movie is shot like a single take making it look continuous, finally the setting takes place in one room and stays there for the rest of the movie like a stage play which is not surprising since the movie was based on a stage play which was based off a real life murder of a college student. The plot was complexity at its best and never let up. The performances were great all around but the one who stole the screen the most was John Dall as Brandon with his coldness, lack of regret for the murder and smugness 9 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosophy lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film that takes place entirely in one room of an apartment (besides the room we have access only to the foyer and a glimpse at the kitchen), keeps us restless during it's 76 minutes, has by virtue to be a good movie. Farley Granger is particularly good on the role of making us feel the tension in the air, of living with him his fear of being caught and his lack of conviction in the crime in which he took part and what it should represent. In this film we are transported to the dichotomy between the world of ideas and the world of actions. To what extent does our belief in a philosophy, an idea, is likely for us to live with it when it is turned into action? Rupert Cadell (James Stewart's character) is the representative par excellence of this dichotomy, when minutes before, when the sun still came through the window, had claimed to be in favor of crime as the prerogative of superior men, but when the sun goes down and he discovers the "ugly crime" that had been committed, immediately his ideal collapses as the books of philosophy which are placed upon David's grave when Rupert eagerly opens the lid of the chest. His appalled face screams to us that he also feels guilty, but at the end of the film, sitting in a chair with his back to the viewer facing the scene in front of him assuming our role as observers, takes him away from its responsibility after telling Brandon (John Dall) that it was given to his words a meaning they did not had.There was much more to say about this movie but the dissertation may be long and become boring. I just hope it helps you to see this movie from another perspective, not just a movie you will see with a popcorn bucket. It's Hitchcock after all... I want to end by saying that if i already was a great fan of James Stewart, in this film he won me over completely. He is proficient in his role, for me the best of Stewart so far. This is one of the few films that gave a 10 ... is brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true fan will be fascinated by Rope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every director, no matter whether famous or not, should have made at least one experimental movie. Hitchcock has Rope, a movie even he was a bit ashamed to put on the big screens for some time. It's probably safe to say that this is one of a very few attempts that 'didn't work out' in his long and marvelous career in filmmaking. However, its remarkable unconventionality in the sense of play-like editing technique and the way its storyline is build should be sufficient enough to make it worth a view.The story starts with a brutal scene, which may be considered a spoiler that in result kills all the suspense and mystery. However, throughout the whole story only the viewer knows what happened, so that the effect of a spoiler accounts only for the outcome, but doesn't relate to the events that occur in-between. Two homosexual students (John Dall and Farley Granger) fascinated by the nature of a 'superior being' strangle (with the titular rope) their friend, who they think is worse than they are, and put his body in a grand trunk in the middle of a room, where they later throw a party for a few guests. One of them is their professor Rupert Cadell (James Stewart).Not knowing that a corpse is in the same room all the time, everybody is trying to have a good time. However, they are wondering why David, the killed boy, isn't here yet and the overly mistrustful professor begins to suspect that something strange is going on. Phillip, one of the boys, starts to crack up a little. There is one fantastic scene, where Rupert is questioning Phillip, while he plays the piano. With every next question he seems tenser and plays along faster than before. Yet Brandon, on the other hand, is in control of the situation and enjoys the whole set-up like it was some kind of a pleasurable game. He uses intelligent word play to talk a bit about David's absence. Then it all goes out of control, as Phillip isn't able to take the pressure any more and starts to think that everyone already knows of the gruesome murder that the boys committed.I've always been amazed by Hitchcock's ability to render the element of suspense in such a jaw-dropping manner, that even when the viewer is fully aware that the dead body is lying in the piano for the whole time, he is still feeling the mysterious aura and experiences it along with the characters.Due to the fact that Hitchcock wanted to make it look like a real time play he had to shoot it in 10 few-minutes-long sequences and put them together, so that the whole movie would look like a one long shot. Unfortunately, this experiment didn't work out as well as it was supposed to, and the movie wasn't able to generate much attention in the process. Even though even James Stewart wasn't very fond of the movie himself, I still think that everyone, who wants to know the true Hitchcock, has to watch Rope. It doesn't loose any of the director's mastery of suspense and mysterious atmosphere, and definitely provides for a thrilling ride without leaving a single room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rope is both a technical and philosophical achievement and among Hitchcock's most underrated work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much left for one to say about the achievements of Alfred Hitchcock. Easily the most prolific and respected director of all time, you'd need at least a third hand to count on each finger all of his classic films. Unfortunately though the popularity of films like Psycho, Vertigo, and Rear Window has overshadowed many of Hitchcock's lesser known films in the passing decades since his death. This is a damn shame, because it turns an amazing film such as this one into a forgotten gem.Adapted from the popular stage play, Rope is both a technical and philosophical achievement that ranks up there with many of Hitchcock's other classic films. The film is more then just a murder/suspense film, it's a meditation on what exactly drives a man to kill, and the justification of it in the eyes of the murderers.The two murderers/main characters are completely different people. Where Brandon (Dall) is egotistical and confident in his belief that he is a truly superior human being, Phillip (Granger) is nervous, unsure of himself and easily manipulated by Brandon. The acting from both Dall and Granger is top notch stuff, with Dall specifically shining as the cunning "mastermind" of the murder.James Stewart is his usual amazing self (the man could literally do nothing wrong in my eyes) as a former professor of the two men, and a strange sort of inspiration for the murder itself. It's obvious that Brandon in particular idolizes Stewart's character, taking a conversation the three of them had years prior about Nietzsche's "Übermensch" (or Supermen) and the so called art of murder as a tool to express superiority as inspiration for the killing.The entire film takes place in one room, and yet it never bores you. You're gripped into this story from the opening murder to the ending credits. Rather short even by the standards of the time, the film clocks in at 80 minutes and is required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a fan of Hitchcock. His direction is top-notch as always, specifically a sequence in which Hitchcock and the camera take us around the apartment as James Stewart describes how he would murder someone and how he would get away with it. The finale of the film in which Stewart calmly walks around the apartment, trying to coax a confession out of the two is a textbook example of how to build a suspense.Many philosophical questions are raised in this film on the subject of murder and superiority. Another interesting point to the film is the relationship between the two killers, and how relevant it is even today. They reminded me very much of the case of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the two boys responsible for the Columbine shootings. One was brash and angry, nearly nihilistic, while the other was timid, weak-willed, hurt and confused, easily manipulated.Can murder be justifiable? Are some lifeforms truly superior to others? Is murder technically an art form? You'll be pondering these questions for days after viewing this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rope: Simply a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the directors of whom just about everybody has heard, Hitchcock's name appearing on screen caries with a concomitant reputation that is, suffice to say, daunting to the viewer. Held almost unanimously as one of cinema's true greats, one feels obligated to be blown away by the film to follow. Such was my mindset going into my previous two Hitchcockian viewing experiences: The Birds and Rear Window, both of which I found enjoyable but saw as little more.Opening with the murder of the young David by former classmates Brandon and Philip, Rope follows in real time the party thrown by the latter two whilst the body remains hidden in their apartment. Desiring to commit the perfect murder and subtly flaunt their success, the invitees include David's father, fiancée, friend, aunt, and former housemaster?as well as that of the murdering duo.Rope's much discussed and most evident feature is the longevity of its shots. Aiming to create and maintain the illusion of constancy, Hitchcock makes a cut only once every ten minutes, every second one of which is masked by a zoom in to the dark back of a jacket, or chair. The single setting of the film includes a window displaying the Manhattan cityscape, the sky behind which slowly evolves from day to night as the film progresses. No doubt a challenging effect to effectively manage, it adds further authenticity that might have been lost if the curtains had? as they quite reasonably might have?been drawn. The film has the feeling of a play (it's adapted from one), its unbroken continuity doing much to captivate the audience; it's not long before you forget that you're watching something at all and not a guest at the party yourself. Hitchcock bears the enticing sobriquet "The Master of Suspense", and it is this mastery which Rope demonstrates beautifully. Though merely a party scene in truth, the film carries an undercurrent of tension far more suspenseful than most of its ilk. In tandem with the more nervous Philip, our hearts begin to race at every mention of David and his mysterious absence, particularly those mentions made by the disconcertingly calm Brandon. Discussions of murder, the concept of the "übermensch", and the reasoning behind using a book chest?inside which the body has been deposited?as a buffet table keep us wondering whether the pair will get away with their crime, and if we want them to. The intimate nature of the film is absolutely key to this tension, and is carried out with a graceful perfection. Never before have I experienced apprehension maintained so well in a calm setting?a moment in which the camera focuses on the maid slowly clearing the chest and bringing over the books to put in it done with such subtle aplomb as to be nailbiting in the most passive manner. Watching this is a marvellous experience, aided along the way by strong performances by all, especially Jimmy Stewart as the sole suspicious?and horrifically so?party guest.In Rope, I came to understand the acclaim bestowed upon Hitchcock. Perhaps the most beautifully crafted feelings of tension I've experienced in cinema, the film utilises the camera in the most exceptional manner to direct our attentions, control our expectations, and accelerate the pace of our heartbeat to almost dangerous levels. A fascinating technical as well as dramatic achievement, Rope is simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Happily Unrepentant Sociopath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is built on a fascinating situation: two young men murder a classmate at their apartment, hide the body and invite people for dinner. Their purpose is to prove their superiority and intelligence in the creation of the perfect crime. Brandon and Phillip are two college graduates who believe in their superiority over other people and so think they have the right to kill people.In the course of the dinner they entertain an old teacher, Rupert (played by James Stewart), who may have had some fault in giving them such a weird idea. As they discuss their ideas with him, it becomes obvious that he doesn't condone murder at all and in fact become suspicious that something is wrong, while the two graduates become worried that their crime may not be so perfect after all.The movie is shot in the same space for all its duration: the apartment's living room. It's also shot in very long takes, as long as technology permitted at the time, and the lack of editing not only emphasises the dialogue and relationship of the characters, which is the movie's main strenghts (being based on a play), but also provokes tension and a feeling of oppression.James Stewart is good in this movie, but if I had to choose a performance that stood out, it'd be Joh Dall's. He plays the amoral, smug Brandon perfectly: contempt for people just drips from his words and demeanour. He flaunts himself as smarter and better at every turn and enjoys the situation he's created, like a man enjoys watching a car accident. Cinema seldom portrays such remorselessness, and Dall captured it very well, I'd even say that he was so seductive in the exposition of his ideas that they became dangerously pleasant.When lists of villains are made, Brandon Shaw is always left out. But next time you look at Anton Chigurh or The Joker, remember John Dall played the nihilistic, amoral sociopath many decades earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A technical and suspenseful mastery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two friends commit a murder in their apartment and stash the body in a cabinet, all the while preparing the perfect party to celebrate.From the master of suspense comes another cleverly woven murder movie that captures a provocative and dastardly scheme that is constructed beautifully into arguably the finest cut film from the British director.Opening with a pleasant street scene and a comfortable playing song, we are mislead through some marvellous psychological tricky. As soon as we see the credits finish we emerge into a flat where two men have a man hanging from their rope.This shocking murder and ability to construct a whole 80 minute film out of is truly impressive and the reason to see this film.As the two classmates converse about what they have just done and how the future is going to affect their lives the plot trickles around the ideology of life, the fabrication and laws which abide by our ability to commit murder and the terrible concept of right and wrong in the aftermath context.After the terrifying shot of bundling the body into the cabinet the film takes a back step and starts conversing with the heavy script and ideologies of right and wrong, of the ramifications of their activities. This is a film for the attention to detail type of person, a film that exploits all things to deadly to contemplate. There is a heavy amount of scripting, with minimal action if any worth noting and for this reason alone we could suggest this is one of Hitchcock's best.What baffled me about this 62 year old film is its ability to keep the intrigue going. The fact there is so much talking and so little action it goes to credit the director and screenplay how tense and exciting this really feels. It is staggering.However this is not the main reason why this film is such a marvel. Somehow the film runs for eighty minutes and uses around four or five cuts. How on earth this was accomplished is unthinkable. This is a film to which I had never seen anything like it before. You are expecting there to be a cut at any moment, anticipating the camera cannot possibly hold on and an actor would forget their lines but no. Technically this is an achievement to which Hitchcock mastered beautifully.Speaking of which, I missed his cameo which was a shame as they are quite joyous. He again has conjured a mastery of suspense and anticipation and encoding the concept of murder suspects and death it is typical styling with a little extra thrown in.Whilst there is no denying the sheer genius of this production there are a few notes of negativity. For one though gripping the script can overindulge us with its information and the performances of some of the cast are dry.But regardless these are almost insignificant in a picture that has shocked cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Guest Who Couldn't Leave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a classic form of the whodunit known as the "locked-door murder", where a body is found in a sealed area with a number of possible suspects who can't get in or out. "Rope" offers one such instance, with a decided Hitchcockian twist: This time, while the characters are free to come and go, you are the one trapped.The sealed place is a swank Manhattan penthouse where prep-school pals Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) do away with their old friend David for the sake of a thrill kill. Then, to put what Brandon calls "the inspired finishing touch" to their "exhilarating" crime, the two throw a party for several carefully chosen guests, including the victims' parents and girlfriend, while David lays inside a chest where dinner is served."The Davids of this world merely occupy space, which is why he was the perfect victim for the perfect murder," Brandon says as he helps himself to a post-homicidal cigarette.They don't even lock the chest because, as Brandon observes, it's much more dangerous that way. Needless to say, the pair play things a little too cute for their own good, especially when they invite their former prep-school teacher Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who is suspicious.Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of movies about murders, but few rub the viewers' noses in the fact of the crime quite like this one. Shot in ten long single-shot intervals with oft-disguised cuts, "Rope" is a masterpiece of tension-building, the camera keeping you in the center of action as both witness and accomplice, its cranes, pans, and zooms tweaking and clawing at you as you both wish for and dread the moment of discovery.The acting is stiff, sure, in part because of the unique demands of filming and in part because Dall and Granger were not good screen actors. Yet they work as jaded preppies precisely because they behave so awkwardly, kids with half a clue who think they know it all. It could be a case of "subversive casting", like Peter Bogdanovich observed was the case with Robert Cummings in "Dial M For Murder". The rest of the cast suggests characters in a J.D. Salinger story, except less literate and more chi-chi. But they help to build an exquisite mood.Stewart is wrong for the part of Cadell. He's supposed to be a cynical nihilist, yet he makes his points unconvincingly and you have no doubt his inherent decency will come to the fore in the end. As many here note, James Mason would have made for a more ambiguous figure that way. Yet Stewart acquits himself admirably, moving from scene to scene with a fluidity that matches the camera, the one non-wooden presence in the film. A total pro, as if it needs saying.Like most Hitchcock movies, "Rope" is not a deep film. There's unspoken subtext about the homosexuality of Phillip and Brandon (in all of Hitchcock's films, only Bruno Anthony in "Strangers On A Train" is more obviously gay), and some philosophical prattle about Nietzsche. It's subtle, but not particularly profound, just interesting from multiple angles.One notable problem Theo Robertson points out in his November 2005 review is why Brandon involves the unsteady Phillip in his crime. The way I read it is it's clear there's a sadomasochistic strain at the heart of their relationship, in Brandon's willingness to slyly torture his friend with the possibility of discovery that hints at both their transgressive sexuality and a sickness at the heart of Brandon the "perfect" murderer. He not only foregoes a lock for the chest, but ties the rope used to strangle David around a stack of books he gives David's father, leering at Phillip all the while. Of course, he is also leering at the audience, furthering our involvement in the foul deed.Many of us find ourselves trapped in parties, wishing we could leave. Nothing is holding us back from the awful soiree of "Rope" except our curiosity, which Hitchcock knew how to tap into better than anyone. In its unusual, claustrophobic way, "Rope" pulls off the art of murder with a flourish Brandon and Phillip could only envy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the tangle of lies, there lies a tangle of rope...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some call this film Hitchcock's best, but when released in 1948, most of the critics hardly bothered to revue it. In some place in USA, it was actually banned; in others, it had to be severely cut before it could be shown.It was Hitchcock's first colour film, at a time when film noir was only done in black-and-white. And, it was Hitchcock's first attempt to use the long take and, when viewed, it appears to be one continuous flow, with no cuts, wipes, dissolves or fades. However, it was filmed as a series of long takes of between 8 and a half and 10 minutes each, and then cleverly spliced to give the continuous effect. And it works. You have to be eagle-eyed to note when those cuts are managed, however.Why did Hitchcock go to such trouble to produce that effect? According to one source, he did it "as a stunt", simply to see if he could pull it off (in that regard, Hitchcock's desire with the production parallels the fictional evil murderers' desire to pull off the perfect murder). So, for the discerning viewer, this is a very technical movie that required very precise positioning of equipment and rigid placement of the actors and props, all of which then had to be rehearsed endlessly before attempting a ten-minute take. Despite those self-imposed restrictions, Hitchcock finished the movie within a month. No mean feat, in my opinion...Be aware, though: when you view this movie, you are transfixed as though you are in the apartment with the two murderers all the time. When I saw it, as a boy, over fifty years ago, I was mesmerized; watching it again on DVD today, the same effect applies, but with a PAUSE button, I can interrupt the flow now. However, the fascination is still there, and like no other movie from Hitchcock.This is a movie that relies upon dialog for the story, with great lines and much double entendre ? resulting in macabre humour. The visual creates the suspense, however, the most effective piece being when the maid (Edith Evanson) takes away the dinner dishes from the top of the chest with the body inside, and you just know that she will try to open the chest to put some books in it. It's a long sequence, and the dinner conversation is chattering on, and all the while the moment when she will want to open the lid gets ever nearer. Aaaah, it's excruciatingly good... What will happen to stop her?That's the nub of this narrative: from the very outset, you know who's dead, and you know who did it. What you don't know is how it will all end, and you don't know that until the very last second of screen time. So, it's worth seeing the movie for that alone. I know I'll be watching the movie again and again, simply to take in the astuteness and precision of Hitchcock's direction, the best of its type I've seen.You can quibble about the quality of the acting all you wish, for this is not an actor's movie (although the acting is, for the most part, superb). It's Hitchcock all the way: he's showing us just how well he can do it, and he succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was fantastic! I had seen it when I was much younger and remembered it being good, but having just re-watched it I was struck by how much it felt like a filmed play. The very long shots helped establish the real-time aspect of this thrilling story and Hitchcock's brilliant directing really shines. Great performances all around and with any Hitchcock picture, every moment feels like it was carefully thought out and executed for the greatest effect. Watching Jimmy Stewart (Rupert) piece together the evidence was as exciting as watching John Dall (Brandon) and Farley Granger (Phillip) try to keep it together. I've read that Hitchcock wasn't particularly fond of this film, and I'll grant that he certainly has created better films, but I'd take an evening of Rope over an evening of Final Destination 3 any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>us here. He is the professor of Farley Granger and his friend, John Dall, two precocious graduate students. This was supposedly a theme based on the Leopold and Loeb case, which occurred in the 1920's in middle America. Hitch is brilliant as ever.The double standards of the time are covertly expressed. As Stewart is introduced to the resident jilted female, she says- ..."has he done me justice?"... Stewart replies: ..."Why?. Do you deserve justice?"... Great. Subliminal and real.The story is a bit talky, but analyzes why people do what they do. Hitchcock was a master at this, and also at getting his actors to project the certain image, the certain impression. Do not miss this film. 10/10.</fullReview>

There is very little that can be said about this film, without giving away some of the plot, so I will refrain as much as possible. Suffice it to that the action takes place at a dinner party, which is being hosted in an apartment where a murder occurred only moments earlier. The question is... Will the guests find out?I highly recommend this classic nail-biter, with one caveat... if you have kids, then you might not be comfortable with them watching this film.

		<fullReview>This telling of a famous murder case is best known for Hitchcock's use of long takes, with the camera tacking all over the the single set which serves as the apartment where the murder and the subsequent dinner party takes place. Stewart is a professor who tries to solve the murder but the most interesting characters are Dall and Granger as the thrill-seeking murderers. Granger is good as the reluctant murderer but Dall is the star of this film. An underrated actor (see Gun Crazy), Dall is excellent as the more aggressive of the duo, conveying just the right mixture of charm and cold-blooded bravado. The initial setup is interesting but the script seems to eventually run out of steam. Not one of Hitchcock's better efforts but worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene will say it all. I like the way Hitchcock introduces the two distinguished gentlemen, in my opinion, as "cocky". This film rates very high on my list of Hitchcock favorites, as this film introduces a young Jimmy Stewart in one of his earliest films, not to mention one of his best. I also like the way Hitchcock uses the murder item for other applications!!!, as well as where the body is hidden, I think that the two gentlemen never expected Stewart to catch on exactly what they did and why, that's the beauty of Alfred Hitchcock's twisted way of thinking, always keep you guessing and always makes you bite your fingernails in sheer suspense. I can safely say Rope will make you love Hitchcock. If you like suspense films don't just watch it, buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest aspect of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is how suspenseful it is. It is not his usual murder mystery or a story about strange phenomenon/person. I love his continuous 10 minute film shots and the dynamics he has created between the characters in the movie. I was really impressed by the role James Stewart plays in the movie. I like Stewart, but I've seen him in too many lead roles in Hitchcock movies. I love how he plays a crucial, but secondary character in this movie. I really like watching this movie, because the climax of the movie builds from a very shocking opening scene and keeps getting even more visually suspenseful from there. It's obvious that Hitchcock's use of props and visual elements are very, very important to the progression of the movie. Even from the title itself, you can only guess how a rope would play a part in an incredibly suspenseful, dynamic, and disturbing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Hitchcock's greatest film of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a shame "Rope" has always been such a massively underrated thriller. It was a flop back in 1948 and even though audience has learned to appreciate it in a completely different way over the years only few are willing to admit that it's among Hitchcock's greatest and at least his best project of the 40's. Of course this was something that nobody had seen back then and even from today's point of view "Rope" is a very unique movie. But it's terrific, oh lord, it's excellent. Jimmy Stewart makes a fantastic performance as Rupert Cadell - teacher who's students probably take some of his words too seriously. Dead seriously I might add. However my favorite character of the film is perhaps still John Dall's Brandon Shaw. Dall is just one of Hitchcock's many actors who never became a huge star. He had a rather short career since he appeared in only eight films but as we all can see when we watch "Rope", he's just utterly wonderful. If you haven't seen "Rope" you're in for a treat. Get ready to experience the magic of Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily one of my favorite Hitchcock films. It's very underrated, perhaps because it is one of his few films that actually takes a moral stand on an issue. Also, the underlying current of homosexuality may put some people off, especially considering the time this film was made. If it were released again today, I feel it would be better received. Anyways, this film is wonderful. Very experimental in its using a single long take throughout the film (yes there are three "unhidden" cuts in the film, but everyone knows what Hitchcock's intention was). My only gripe is Stewart's character. I LOVE Jimmy Stewart's work, but I feel he doesn't quite fit in this role. In fact, Hitchcock originally wanted Cary Grant to play this role, but Grant refused (probably because he didn't want to be associated with the homosexual undertones of the film). Stewart just didn't convince me that he really believed it was okay to kill inferior people, and it made the conclusion of the film seem a bit too easy for my tastes. Other than that, though, the film is amazing. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie so many times, one thing occurred: The only reason Brandon had the party was to prove his own brilliance. Brandon concealed Rupert's invite from Philip, until he casually let it out (the cheeky devil). He thought he was so composed, until Rupert showed up, then he was filled with fear and mischievious delight. Rupert caught on, eventually, coming back with an obviously made-up excuse, arousing Brandon even more. When Rupert made the final discovery, however, he gave the boys a tongue-lashing. Philip felt bad for listening to Brandon, who felt bad he disappointed Rupert. Rupert's harmless fiction turned into dangerous fact. He hated it so much, that he vented his self-disgust at the boys. He fired three shots out the window: Death to himself for conceiving it, to Brandon who planned it and to Philip who held the rope. I'll never get tired of the scene, where it looks as if Philip is serving David's flesh from an out-of-frame cabinet onto the dinner guest's plates! Hysterical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is amusing to note that almost all viewers are entranced with Hitchcock's technique of using the full film magazine for each shot in ROPE. However, we are so used to seeing film cut, (and we are so absorbed in the storyline) - that no one comments on the fact that when Warner Brothers re-released this film about 10 years ago, onto VHS, they either had no idea what Hitchcock was up to, or the editor had (in von Stroheim's words) nothing on his head but a hat, because there are several real-live, honest-to-goodness cuts in the body of the film, as it now stands. Yes, those famous transitions (jumpcuts when there are no people in the frame, totally black frame caused by a character's jacket obscuring the camera, etc.), but if you look carefully there are at least two cuts to different camera angles. The film begins with a tilt up from the street, and cuts to the closeup of the murder, and that is intentional, but the other cuts occur well into the picture.</fullReview>

Even without the technical innovations (as the critic Donald Spoto said, Rope was `probably the boldest technical experiment ever attempted'), this movie is amazing. Like Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, Rope's Brandon and Philip have been poisoned by their abandonment of human compassion for cold intellectualism. Rope presents a very moral exploration of these young nihilists and their professor. Brilliant direction, wonderful acting by all of the cast, and a provoking premise make this film one of the best I have ever encountered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Directing, cinematography, script.Cons: James Stewart's character.Rope is Alfred Hitchcock's technical masterpiece that deals with the themes of whether all human beings are made equal. The film is brilliant to watch as it progresses in real time. Shot in a series of eight minute takes (that was how much film the camera could hold)joined together almost seamlessly as the whole film feels it was filmed in one long continous shot. Even the view from the window was outstanding because it wasn't real but it sure looked like it (even the lighting sceme was perfect as the sun went down). John Dall and Farley Granger are prfect as the murderous duo but I had a problem with Jame Stewart character. He partially is to blame for the murder of David because he preaches that murder should be necessary in solvingsociety's problems. He then recants his views rather quickly as soon as his doctrines are practiced in life, probably because he can't face the music. Nevertheless an underappreciated Hitchcock masterpiece about the importance of a human life.Premise: Students murder to prove their intellectual superiority.Rope wasn't nominated for a single Academy award but was nominated for an Edgar.Grade: 9.5/10 (Top five hitchcock).</fullReview>

Here he played the murderers' former teacher, who starts to catch on to the murder as the killers become more and more arrogant, therefore making more and more mistakes. The character has a dark sense of humor and a morbid outlook on life, and although it isn't the usual Jimmy Stewart character, he plays it excellently anyway. I also felt that the two co-stars, John Dall (the arrogant killer) and Farley Granger (the nervous killer), did well. Dall is obviously a stage actor and he does indeed emote like one. This might be distracting for some, but I actually enjoyed it. And I really loved the experimental directing by the great Alfred Hitchcock. Those ten minute takes can't be easy, but they are all extremely well done. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a Hitchcock fan.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the very opening frame of the film, a man is strangled to death by his two friends. The suspense of the film lies not in the answers to the usual questions of who and why, but strangely enough in how and when the crime will be detected. The crafty director narrates the story in almost real time, dispensing away with the traditional grammar of compressed film time. There is no visual relief too, in the form of a change in scene ? it is entirely shot inside an apartment, or more specifically in one room ? thus giving it a claustrophobically intense feel. The verbal jousting ? it is compelling on the ears ? keeps the viewers absorbed, though some may not stomach the morbid humour. The fluid camerawork, though minus the trademark Hitchcockian angles, is a reminder that it is cinema and not a play. A minimalist film without the usual trappings of the thriller genre; yet manages to hold the viewer's eyeballs till the finish. Watch it to see how Hitchcock manages to pull it off!</fullReview>

Not that the story isn't good....it's a take on the Leopold/Loeb murder of Bobby Franks.....the actors are decent, well, not all of them....it's the self conscious long take experiment that he tried with this film. (There is always a controversy as to exactly how many cuts there are in the movie, but if you watch carefully, you can count them.) If this technique was an experiment, it didn't work, and he didn't repeat it (except for the very long tracking shot in "Frenzy"). Now, about the acting.....I apologize to all those Jimmy Stewart fans out there but I thought he was totally wrong and seemed pedantic in the part. Farley Granger, who Hitchcock used again in "Strangers On A Train" is an acquired taste. This was only his third film. John Dall,predominately a stage actor, emotes like one.....a little too much for the screen. Watch him in "Gun Crazy" to get a better sense of his acting abilities. The homosexual nature of the relationship between the two protaganists is well done, in a time when it was a taboo subject. The film, despite it's faults, is really worth watching, as are all of Hitchcock's works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This is what you wanted: somebody else to know. Someone else to see how brilliant you are, just like at school."Hitchcock tackled the idea of "the perfect murder" quite often in his films, &nbsp;both directly and indirectly. Rope is the fourth movie of his that I've seen where the murder IS the story, or in this case, the murder's immediate aftermath and repercussions.The movie opens with two young men murdering an acquaintance in an apartment, and hiding him inside a chest. They did it for no other reason than that they could, and they follow the philosophy that their innate superiority over inferior men such as the victim gives them the right to do what they did. As the icing on the cake for their murder, they have a dinner party planned immediately afterward, where the hiding place of the deceased will serve as a macabre dinner table for his father, aunt, girlfriend, and others.Rope is at its best when the uncovering of the misdeed of the duo seems imminent. James Stewart plays an authority figure from the pair's younger days, who is partially responsible for their warped ways of thinking. He slowly begins to become more and more suspicious, as the two killers each make revealing mistakes in their own ways, and the usually punctual victim remains nowhere to be found.This isn't among my favorite Hitchcock movies, but it's likable enough. It's set in one location like Rear Wondow and Dial M for Murder, and it's always interesting to see Hitchcock work within the confines and challenges of that scenario. The movie is also quite tense at times, as it becomes clear that it's only a matter of time before the secret is outed. See it for the interesting premise, if nothing else.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon and Phillip are a couple of thrill seeking Harvard bachelors who murder an old schoolmate, hide his body in a trunk in their living room, and then host a dinner party. One of the guests however, the eminent Rupert Cadell, begins to suspect foul play ?Adapted by Hume Cronyn from Patrick Hamilton's play Rope's End, loosely based on the notorious Leopold and Loeb murder case of 1924, this is one of Hitchcock's experiment films (see also Lifeboat, Rear Window and The Birds) and also his first in technicolor. He liked to set himself challenges; here it was to make a movie with no cuts, and to a very large extent he succeeds. Technically, it's dazzling, with smooth tracking shots, cleverly designed breakaway sets, intricate sound work, and an exquisitely painted cyclorama backdrop by which we unconsciously measure the passage of time. To any director who thinks you need to cut every five seconds, it's a revelation in how plot can be told and suspense and drama generated by any number of means, not just via editing. Hitchcock's real achievement however is that you either don't notice or forget this - the story may be slight and the ending predictable but you cringe with a mixture of horror and relief all through the movie. Film is an art, and you can break all the rules Hitch does here, but only provided you have a clear vision of what you're doing, as he almost always did. Dall and Granger are creepily perfect as the conceited, soulless killers and Stewart is a shrewd protagonist; note how it's Rupert's unspoken reactions to Brandon and Phillip's behaviour which tell us much more than anything he says or does. Chandler and Evanson add a dose of humour to the otherwise grim material as the sassy glamour girl and the gossipy maid respectively. I guess this movie is kinda slight but it really works, and every time I see it I still end up white-knuckled and sweating - it's a great little thriller. If nothing else, it showcases the absurdity of the lazily made TV pap we put with, where there are more cuts every minute than Hitchcock employs for this entire film. A dark little gem.</fullReview>

Without being able to resort to typical film conventions, Hitchcock is still able to create a tense and nerve-wracking thriller. The actors are also all terrific, as they all had to nail their performances in each shot due to the long take. Stewart is predictably solid, but the two guys at the heart of the story are even better and thus drive the film. The ending is a bit weak, but everything up to that is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcocks bid for independence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock thought this would become the way of the future - to have a film seem like one continuous shot. What it became was a rather interesting but in the end crippling experience for all involved. The actors must have gone through agony because if one of them blew a line they would have to do the 8 minute segment all over again (8 minutes being the length of one roll of film).The film itself feels somewhat static and that's understandable since it took an enormous amount of effort to even move the camera. The subject is rather ingenious. Like Hitchcock's later "Strangers on a Train" it deals with totally self-important characters who think they are the smartest in the world but you almost hope they succeed because you know that they can't. John Dall is the ultimate smarmy character who thinks that what he does makes other people look like raving simpletons. But even better is Farley Granger who plays the jittery one who we are just waiting for to crack up. Between these two is James Stewart's character who served as kind of a mentor to them.Any film that implies homosexuality which was made before the mid-60's was bound to rub a lot of noses but Hitchcock somehow never goes over the line and that is a testament to his brilliance. Anybody who can spot an outwardly homosexual reference in this film is a genius.The end is kind of predictable and it is dragged out too long for us to care anymore but other than that this was a fairly good experience although it didn't have to be in color.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rope tells the tale of two disillusioned young fellows who, convinced that they are somehow superior human beings, decide to practice the art of murder on a fellow student whom they perceive as inferior, for the thrill. If we ignore the first 10 minutes, we will see that there is tremendous potential for suspense during the entire movie, in which we merely hear the two fellows talk about their murder, but we never see it. Finally, there is a great sequence when James Stewart approaches the coffin to see what's in it, but any suspense cannot really be upheld at this point given the first 10 minutes, because we have been shown the murder in the opening scene -- which I have no idea why Mr. Hitch decided to go that route. I can only imagine a lot more suspense and intensity if the viewer was not entirely sure what to expect when Stewart lifts up the wooden coffin.Rope was not a big hit when it came out. It is not as polished as some of Hitch's later masterpieces that I have seen, but it's still worth a look, if only to witness the impressive long takes (which motivated me to check it out).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unloved Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stayed up late last night to watch another Hitchcock movie. It's pretty easy to stay up watching Hitchcock because he keeps you so engrossed. Last night I watched his intellectual suspense drama called Rope. It stars James Stewart and Farley Granger, both of which starred in other Hitchcock movies as you'll remember when you see it.First off, this was a bit of an experimental picture for Hitch. It was a color movie from 1948 and it also tried to capture the film as if it were one loooong camera shot. There is no switching from camera to camera and the camera follows them across the apartment, the only set of the picture. The most amazing thing that you don't notice the first time is that Hitch allows dusk to happen gradually throughout the picture, showcasing light sources being illuminated throughout the movie and new light angles that make it interesting, especially by the end when all that is really left are the colorful neon signs lighting the set.Stewart is of course fabulous in this one. He's the only actor I've ever known that can keep you riveted with only himself on screen (if you've never seen The Spirit of St. Louis about Lindbergh, go watch it). When he is on stage, we see the wheels of his mind turning as he tries to unravel the mystery (no pun intended on the rope).The main aspect about this one is Hitch's belief that evil can be disguised as two good-looking prep students. In the first five seconds, we see them strangling a man with a rope. What becomes truly evil is that we see they did it as an experiment on murder and hold a party to celebrate, all the while the dead body is in a chest in the middle of the room.When evil looks like the kids next door, that they are getting away with it, that is truly evil. This is an excellent picture and worthy of a major recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the best movies of Hitchcock's, and yet I had never heard of it. It reminds me of "Lifeboat" where the action takes place in a confined area with a limited cast. Yet it never gets dull due to the secrets the audience knows, the excellent characterizations, the dramatic, changing skyline out the window of the apartment, the different groupings and relationships of the characters and of course that crazy camera work.Jimmy Stewart I thought was a particularly poor choice to play a nihilist, but the other actors were superb, believable, even creepy in many cases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock meets Rube Goldberg...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've got to hand it to Alfred Hitchcock; no one enjoyed a challenge more than the master, even if he had to concoct the challenge out of thin air. Known for his extravagant camera angles and complex traveling shots, he also tried his hand at low-budget documentary-like film-making (THE WRONG MAN) and B-movie exploitation (PSYCHO). And he was not above taking a gimmick and working to make it seem more like creative genius. With REAR WINDOW, virtually all the action happens within one room or within the sight of a wheelchair bound man in that room. In LIFEBOAT, everything happens on that small craft adrift at sea. With REAR WINDOW and LIFEBOAT, Hitchcock made the gimmicks work because the restrictions actually made sense within the context of the stories being told. With ROPE, Hitch is on shakier ground, because the gimmick isn't justified within the context of the story. Though Hitchcock didn't give himself enough rope to hang himself, he did come up with enough to tie his own hands. ROPE is basically a filmed stage play (not unlike the live TV dramas of 1950s). The action, a murder mystery, takes place approximately within real time. Hitchcock's self-imposed challenge was to make it seem like it was all filmed in one continuous take with one mobile camera -- not really possible since movie cameras couldn't film more than 8 to 10 minutes at a time. Hitchcock contrived to hide edits from one take to the next by ending and beginning scenes with the shot passing over a dark or neutral surface.Hitchcock further complicated the entire affair by having the story unfold before a panoramic window with a cityscape in the background, thus forcing his crew to duplicate the timing and imagery of moving clouds and a setting sun. As such, ROPE is less a movie than an elaborate cinematic Rube Goldberg gadget. It is a series of mechanical devices and clever bits of trickery that ultimately don't amount to much to a casual viewer, but which gave Hitchcock the joy of building an elaborate toy. ROPE's story isn't all that compelling, though it does have it's moments. In a Leopold and Loeb twist, the story involves two supposedly brilliant college students, Phillip and Brandon (Farley Granger and John Dall), who believe themselves to be superior individuals to the point of being above both the law and common morality. As such, they feel they have the moral right to kill anyone who, in their view, is an inferior. Thus (in possibly the most unconvincing murder you will ever see in any movie), they strangle a college friend just moments before they hold a small dinner party in which they have invited a few of the young man's friends and relatives. Their private joke is that the young man's body is hidden in a chest that the two killers use as a buffet table for serving their guests. The dinner party is also a ghoulish wake. This is a pretty macabre story, more in tune with the "Alfred Hitchcock Presents..." TV series than with his films of the era. While the murder victim's girlfriend, aunt and father sit worrying about the whereabouts of the missing man, Dall's Brandon makes jokes about his victim and taunts his guests with vague references to his crime. For some reason, Brandon thinks tricking a man into unknowingly eating a meal off his own son's coffin is a supreme joke and the perfect way to prove his intellectual superiority. It would be hard to find a criminal more coldly amoral than Brandon.Behind the storytelling gimmick and beyond the sick joke of the dinner party, Hitchcock does tackle some pretty daring stuff. It is, for one thing, something of a commentary on the fascism of Hitler's Germany (though Phillip and Brandon apparently think they are even superior to Hitler's Aryan nation). Also, to play the part of Prof. Rupert Cadell, Phillip and Brandon's mentor, the man whose theories they take to the extreme, Hitchcock uses Jimmy Stewart, Hollywood's all-American boy. Was it Hitchcock's private joke to make the boy-next-door Stewart the character who voices enthusiasm for acceptable acts of murder, or was it Hitchcock's commentary that such amoral ideas could even come from a boy-next-door. Either way, it is more creepy than amusing to hear Stewart suggest an organized method for killing off undesirable individuals. (Instead of killing head waiters, landlords and tap dancers, imagine him suggesting killing Jews, gypsies and the mentally disabled.) One suspects that Hitchcock was also challenging himself to see just how far he could go in exploring homosexual themes. It is made obvious that Phillip and Brandon, and possibly even Prof. Cadell, are gay. This may just be because the film is patterned after the crimes of Leopold and Loeb, but more likely Hitchcock was attracted to the material more by the characters' deviant sexuality then by their deviant morality. On the one hand, Phillip and Brandon's relationship is obvious and accepted without question by the small group of intellectual friends they entertain. Yet, there is the inescapable implication that their homosexuality is somehow intertwined with their contempt for basic human values. Even the discussion of the murder has sexual overtones. Perhaps that is how the film got past the censors; it seems that homosexuality simply underscores the characters' evil.Despite Hitchcock's puckish desire to play around with and even contradict his own theories on film-making, ROPE doesn't really work very well. Perhaps revealing its theatrical roots, the basic story seems contrived and unconvincing, just as its attempts at humor seem forced. Hitchcock may have been so absorbed working out the complex logistics of filming the story that he didn't notice that the story itself was undeserving of all the commotion. A bigger problem however may be the acting. Dall's villain quickly takes on a Snidely Whiplash quality and Granger's tendency toward theatrical hysterics doesn't supply a suitable counterbalance. And Stewart (in a role originally offered to Cary Grant, though more suited for James Mason) is just simply miscast. ROPE is what it is and what it was meant to be, a stunt. As such it has little value to a casual viewer who just wants to see a tidy little thriller. But for film buffs, who understand Hitchcock's self-imposed puzzle, it has a unique curiosity factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Experimental thriller from Hitchcock. Not really a successful experiment, either.... but interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's first colour movie - and his first with James Stewart as leading man - comes in the shape of "Rope", a 1948 thriller that has ceaselessly generated debate and division since its release. The film is a highly experimental work which finds Hitchcock far more engrossed with technical possibilities than with his story and actors. Hitchcock ambitiously tries to make the entire film as if it is unfolding in real time, telling the story without any cuts in the action. In actuality, the film is divided into eight ten-minute takes (a movie camera could only hold 1000 feet of film at that time, which equates to ten minutes of footage), but at the end of each take the camera zooms in for a close-up of an object or a person's back, then zooms back out and continues to track the action, giving an impression of non-stop fluidity. The idea is interesting but not particularly cinematic, and there is a definite flavour of filmed-theatre hanging over this film that some viewers may find irritating.College friends Shaw (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger) ruthlessly and motivelessly strangle another college buddy David (Dick Hogan). They commit this awful crime as a psychological exercise, chiefly to see if they can get away with it. The next phase in their twisted psychological game involves hiding the corpse in a trunk in their apartment, then proceeding to throw a party while the body is in the room. No ordinary party, mind you, but a party in which all the guests have an association with the victim. Among the guests are David's fiancée Janet (Joan Chandler), his father Mr. Kentley (Cedric Hardwicke), and a lecturer named Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) who formerly taught Shaw, Philip and David. As the party progresses, the murderous duo grow in confidence and they begin to slip clues into the conversation regarding what they have done. At one point, for instance, Mr. Kentley is given a pile of books bound together with the very rope used for the murder. Will the killers get away with their hideous crime, or will their tasteless audacity be their undoing?"Rope" is exciting in some ways, though disturbingly much of the excitement comes from subconsciously rooting for the villains. Only when the film is over do we realise that Hitchcock has manipulatively made us a player in Shaw and Philip's horrifying game. Throughout the film, we have cleverly been made to become part of their game - we KNOW their dreadful secret, yet are helpless in alerting the characters who do not. As a result we unwittingly become the "third murderer", and consequently hope our secret is not uncovered. The film's theatrical nature is unusual, but it's hard to say if it improves the story. It certainly generates debate (e.g. is this a film of claustrophobic brilliance, or perpetual tedium??) and makes the film memorable, though not necessarily for all the right reasons. "Rope" is an important film from one of cinema's most important directors, in the sense that he is given an opportunity to experiment with the very principles of film story-telling. It might not be a hugely successful experiment, nor even an entertaining one, but it is at least interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curious experiment that falls far short of Hitch's other films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope (1948)I have now watched this movie for the fourth time. Once, as a college student, and then once every ten years or so since. And I've never liked it.First, I must say I am a Hitchcock fan. Or worshiper. Something extreme. I even like the artifice in his work that turns off some younger viewers. The visual intelligence, the smart development of psychology as well as raw plot, the feeling of suspense and surprise (which has to do with when he decides to tell us certain things), and so on. He's unparalleled.But there are so many things wrong with "Rope" I can never get to the point of seeing it Hitch's way. Or the way so many others have who really love it.First, the acting is stiff, and maybe even debilitating. John Dall is just over his head with this kind of theater drama that requires genuine angst (his limitations are perfect in "Gun Crazy" two years later). The other young lead, Farley Granger, seems to be well cast (based on "Strangers on a Train," where he's perfect), but he stiff and unconvincing. Only James Stewart makes the movie really rise up (bit part actress Joan Chandler is really good, but briefly). Second is the play, which is turned into a screenplay of some economy here. Are people really taken by the logic of a murder that is for fun? Certainly the Leopold and Loeb story has more intensity. The games (and dialog) of the actors around the main thrust (getting caught), are just awkward and clumsy. I'm really puzzled that other people don't see it that way, and I would love to grow up and see what is special here. Even a movie like "The Bad Seed" approaches the nature of murder in a more reasonable way. Finally, the notion of making it seem like a single long take is a thrill, on paper. But the movie is tied down visually and kinetically, and in part this is because he wanted it to be continuous and real time. Great idea, but don't expect the lively, beautifully unexpected photography of his other films. So back to artifice, since there is no doubt that we have to see it as an experiment. You do wonder what the original play, "Rope's End," might look like on a stage. I think it might be better?and as a Hitchcock devotee, I am crossing a line here! The famous undercurrents of homosexual "charm" are never quite palpable. One last point?the extras on the Criterion disc are really worth it. Give it all a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nobody commits a murder just for the experiment of committing it. Nobody except us."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ROPE is a film that takes place in real time mounted so that makes unique when fitting the other staff. Director's experiment in Technicolor. I'm sure of one thing. This movie is intriguing. At the very beginning of the film takes place the cause of the story, and then the continuous stage we are waiting for the outcome. If the casual and elegant atmosphere add tension, it can truly be called an experiment.The philosophy guided by the idea of the ?super human" can cause relationship perfect murder and perfect victim. Murder as a kind of art has no justification. Hitch made sure that at no point does not deviate from the topic (which referred to the murder). Rope dropped very coherent, "continuous" action and duration in a given time and space. The viewer has the impression of the show, which is really noticeable, and at first sight, we know for certain directors wiles or not.Thus, the film is contiguous whole. I'm not talking about the quality of this unit, which is in my view questionable. Overall the film lacks action, and the story, although intriguing, is quite monotonous. As if I'm forced to listen to the dialogue, which I basically do not care, even though it implies something that is just what happened. The climax of "opening the coffin" came too late. Okay, it was time to look at what was inside.John Dall as Brandon Shaw is aggressive and unpleasant man, full of contempt, which carefully and confidently takes the lead. The alpha male in a covert relationship that not only the camaraderie, calms the "friends" who hides his fear increasingly frequent peer review in a glass. To celebrate the act in which themselves prove its existence as superior beings who are exempt from social norms, organized entertainment ... Farley Granger as Phillip Morgan is the complete opposite of his partner. Desperate, anxious and fearful. See interesting to see two completely different characters together into one act.The more advanced the first quarter of the film shows James Stewart (Rupert Cadell) and from that moment on, steals the movie, to say the least. In his presence, the hosts are afraid. His acting is the least remarkable through inner knowing yourself, ardent detractors of everything, but cynics charmer, because the circumstances it turned into accidental examiners and inspectors and ultimately, a man deeply disappointed their former ideals, especially with the effects that they had misinterpreted by by two young wealthy. Although melancholy and relaxed, Stewart was brutally dominant.The intriguing and interesting movie with darker themes, crisp dialogue on the verge of humor and lack of action and tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's "one shot" masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that it is almost a shame that this movie is one of Hitchcock less popular movies. It isn't much worse than Psycho, for example. Made after a theater play, it was almost intended to be played/shot in one take. So Hitch did it.Even though it is made of 8 film reels, Hitch makes it look like one single shot, thanks to flexible camera. It's about two men, Brandon and Phillip who strangle a friend to death for the thrill of it. They then hide the body in a trunk just before a dinner party they have which include the victim's family and friends. They also serve the food on the trunk containing his body and invite a headmaster they had at school together--Rupert Cadell, a very cynical individual. As the party progresses, Cadell realizes something is wrong and is afraid he might be responsible in an indirect way.Also you feel the tension all the time, and the dialogue is nice. Hitch's first film in color and a masterpiece of Hitch/Stewart collaboration!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice concise Hitchcock play adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally a play, and a very Edgar Allan Poe-inspired one without giving too much away, this Hitchcock starts off right in the thick of it all. 'Rope', the very title's symbolic artifact, is the first thing we see on screen. The two young protagonists' parts are played particularly well, while Stewart may seem a little too obvious, at times over-played to some viewers in this one but certainly gets the job done with the veteran presence he provides both on the set and in the story. There's enough story and characters to have this very singular concept at the core of the plot thrive in a fertile environment, while never appearing to be too present, despite its absolutely central primacy. It all certainly makes for a very entertaining viewing, and so much weight and emphasis are being put on that darned 'chest' and what's inside it. The dialog is very good, and hidden references are constantly being implied through witty puns and such, and overall this play certainly has aspirations of posing some great philosophical questions while also supplying an answer to the main, cynical one which this piece is at all about. Directing wise, some of Hitchcock's work here seems a bit cheesy and self-indulgent, giving the sentiment he tried to be creative and clever with very little to work with and it certainly transpires (the constant zoom into people's backs as transitions, the camera following the characters' descriptions...) - a little too obvious and easy occasionally.A very fun Hitchcock to enjoy, certainly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's suspense at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope" is one of Hitchcock's more ambitious films. To this day, it remains as one of the most interesting experiments ever put in a film. The long takes edited together to make it look like a consecutive take was very interesting. I am an enormous fan of long takes, and I like seeing them in films. I expected that I'd really like this film for that reason. I was right!After 2 young men named Brandon and Phillip strangle a classmate named David who they believe is inferior to them, they put his body in a wooden chest and have several of their friends over for a dinner party to test the perfection of their crime. They put the food on top of the chest and they use his grave as a centerpiece. As Brandon says hints about David's disappearance, one of the guests, Rupert, begins to suspect that something is up with them.This film was shot to make it look like it was filmed in 1 consecutive take (minus the opening credits). Hitchcock wanted to film it in 1 take without any interruptions. However, he could only record 20 minutes at a time. To get around this issue, Hitchcock tried to hide the cuts. For example, the camera could zoom in on a jacket, stop and start recording again, and zoom out so it looks like the movement happened at the same time. Some of these cuts were noticeable and could've been hidden better, but most of them were hidden decently enough. Also, Hitchcock had a backdrop of a city in the window behind their room. Every time a cut happened, it would look like time was moving along in the film as the sky would slowly get darker, changing from evening to night. It wasn't until 2002 when "Russian Ark" became the first and, currently, the only film to be shot in 1 unbroken cut.Suspense is a trademark of Hitchcock films. He's made many suspenseful scenes in the past which have worked very well. As the party guests continued to get more suspicious of Brandon and Phillip, tension kept on rising. There is a man who keeps on getting more suspicious and questions both of them. There is a woman who has to open the chest later in the night to put books into it. I'll argue that out of all of Hitchcock's films that I've seen, this is his most suspenseful film. There are large portions of the film dedicated to keeping the viewer on the edge of their seats. Also, there are some added touches to certain scenes. For example, the movie had a metronome ticking as one of the characters questions one of the perpetrators, causing him to feel increasingly uneasy. Also, one of the characters could be visualizing how he thinks the crime would've went down as the camera moves around the room, in accordance with his theory.However, the long take actually helps the suspense factor. In order for the suspense to work, the viewer had to be positive that the chest remained in the room for the entire film. That way, the viewer would be certain that his body hadn't been moved out somehow during a jump in the time. The fact that the film looks like it's filmed in 1 take reassures the viewer that the body hasn't left the room. If a character tries to open the chest, the viewer feels a lot of tension, because they know for a fact what that character will find. Top this off with some very solid acting from John Dall (Brandon) and Farley Granger (Phillip), and you get some firm, well-done suspense.The dialogue is one of the highlights of the film. One of the perpetrators, Brandon, continues to give hints about the crime throughout the discussion. When one of the characters asks if he's throwing the party because of a birthday, he says that it's the exact opposite, implying David's death. When the character he said it to gets confused, he says that it's a farewell party. At one point in the film, a character asked Brandon a question. Brandon paused for a few seconds before giving a normal answer. It's almost like he was trying to think of a hint to say. Also, there are other scenes such as when Joan, one of the party guests, says that she could strangle Brandon as an exaggeration. Also, there's the discussion when all of the party guests briefly discuss murder, and Brandon tells a story about Phillip choking a chicken. I picked up more hints from the dialogue on my 2nd viewing. I'm assuming that there's a few more lines of dialogue that I could pick up on if I watch it a 3rd time. The dialogue slightly contributes to the films' suspense as it's a factor in what causes Rupert and the other guests to become suspicious.Since the film has a lot of suspense, the 80 minute runtime feels a lot more like a mere 40 minutes. As I started to approach the ending on my 2nd viewing, I felt like it was over too quickly. I would've liked to see more of it as it was engaging me from beginning to end. Also, since suspense is a main driving point of the film, a lot of it is gone after you watch it a 2nd time. However, this is present in all suspenseful movies. The first viewing is always the best one as I'm not sure how the film will end.In conclusion, this was a very suspenseful film. From what I've read, Hitchcock apparently called this an "experiment which didn't work out". It may not be one of Hitchcock's best films, but it's a really good film at showing us Hitchcock's suspense at its finest. It accomplished a few things pretty well, and I'm glad that I watched it. It was a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Translated with Google:The two cohabiting students Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) are sure it exists; the perfect murder. An act that is performed without a trace or evidence of the perpetrators. They see murder as an "intellectual challenge". They are inspired by the lectures of their philosophy professor Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), on the theme of "Art of the perfect crime". The two young man decide to kill David (Dick Hogan) in the living room. After the fact, and with corpse in an old wooden chest in the living room, want the murderer to savor as the "Coronation of their success", their triumph and invite friends, fellow students and professor Cadell to a party. The buffet of morbid Party is even served on that chest, in which the dead man is. The absence of reliable David distressed meanwhile those present. Brandon's arrogant behavior aroused suspicion at Rupert. He interviewed guests about inconsistencies. Phillip responds to questions Rupert panicked and tried to avoid him, remarked Rupert that Phillip him seems to hide something...Hitchcock wanted to make it seem as if the film was produced in one piece. "Rope" is like a big one scene which is interrupted only a few exceptions, of a section, if there is no other, namely, when the then maximum run time of the film roll (which were 10 minutes) was achieved. The was for the actors, of course, quite heavy! The film ultimately counts five hard cuts and five invisible cuts, therefore only eleven settings! Hitchcock 80 minutes Crime affects all of a piece, even if you then still well recognize the hidden cuts from today's perspective, when we look on it the way it was also the first color film of him.What I also really liked the simplicity of the film; only 3 rooms and 8 actors in the entire film, a film we talk about even after 68 years!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon the Leopold and Loeb case and "the crime of the century", this little gem really got me hooked. All the way from the establishing shot, depicting ordinary things like a woman with a baby carriage, the tracking shot culminates in a mid-shot of the two culprits doing the thing which ultimately is the premise, and sets the stage, for the entire film. What follows is a spectacle that incorporates a lot of elements and themes: What is human? Inhuman? What is the perfect crime? Is there a Nietzschian superhuman concept? Everything contained within a living room, in one single shot, and neatly packaged with fine actors (especially James Stewart) and quick paced dialogue. The climax and denouement are so unraveling that it makes up for some of the "chatter" before the "point of no return". Having seen Farley Granger in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, I was really looking forward to see him here. He did an OK performance, as the more androgynous and anxious part of the two "partners in crime". Thus, it is not a classic whodunnit - we know who the culprits are two minutes in the film. Moreover, it is an effective piece of having the viewer knowing more than the persons on screen. The result is: SUSPENSE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Rope' is an enthralling 80-minute thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's films are one that film enthusists love to debate about. They're multi-layered, well-acted and usually well made. Considering a movie channel that I like to watch is airing a bunch of Hitchcock's movies over the next week (around 15, the same number in the "Masterpiece Collection"), I'm going to watch these films and review them for your pleasure. The first film I'm going to review is a film released in 1948, based on the 1929 play of the same name created by Patrick Hamilton. This film is most notable for being done in a "single take" (actually around 10 shots cleverly hidden by passing people or objects). So, let's see if this film is truly as remarkable as some say.Rope follows two college friends who kill their "inferior" classmate in the "perfect murder," and then invite the classmate's friends and family to a dinner party in order to challenge their "perfection." Rope is honestly a thrilling film, which you wouldn't expect someone to say when the majority of the film is just conversations. But, what makes the film so thrilling is the constant fear that someone is going to figure out what these two men have done. The acting from everyone involved is marvelous. John Dall and Farley Granger play the two men who kill their classmate, and they both do a great job. One is the cocky arsehole, who tries to get others to notice what he's done, and the other is the scared man who's unsure of what they've done. James Stewart also does a stellar job as a prep-school housemaster, and friend of the two killers and the classmate. The other actors, in their somewhat limited roles, turn in good performances as well.Perhaps the thing most people will remember about this movie is the fact that it looks as if the entire film is shot in one long take, when in fact it takes about 10 shots for the film's entire 80-minute runtime. The movie's camera-work is stellar, moving closely into scenes where you're supposed to feel desperation, and constantly moving throughout the house and focusing on different characters as the scenes go on. One of my favorite examples of this is toward the end of the film. No spoilers, but there's a monologue and the panning shot during it is absolutely brilliant.The overarching story is fairly simple, yet brilliantly complex, and the best parts of the film definitely come from the screenplay. The screenplay, written by Arthur Laurents, has some fantastic dialogue and several scenes where the dialogue is the only thing that carries it. The production design as well is great. One of the greatest trivia things to notice is that, since the film runs in real time, the background windows in the main part of the apartment will dim and it will become night. That's one of the coolest things about the film, if you ask me.Now, do I have any problems with the film? Yes, two. One, the music used at the start and end of the film are decent, but not as enthralling or engaging as I would have hoped. Two, the "The End" sign at the end of the film bothers me slightly, as if the film had closed with no music and credits or something different, I feel the weight of the film's meaning might have resonated a little bit easier.Overall, however, Rope is a thrilling film that manages to make you think. While the music choices and 'The End' title card are a bit disinterested, the rest of the film's plot, acting, technical achievements, screenplay and direction overall are just fantastic. If you've overlooked this film, or haven't seen it, please do, as it's worth it just for the fascinating technical work and the stellar acting from the three lead men.9/10. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched a Hitchcock movie in a long time. If you read my list of filmmaking influences, I'll tell you that Hitchcock was the man who inspired me to become a filmmaker. 5 years later, I decided to watch one of his films again. So I chose this one. After 5 years, It's actually even better the second time. Why do I like it? Well, let's tell the plot first.Brandon (John Dall) &amp; Phillip (Farley Granger) had recently strangled their classmate, David (Dick Hogan) and stuffed him in their chest. Now is a great time to say that those for the faint of heart shouldn't watch this. In Brandon's words, he just committed 'the perfect crime' because he wants to prove that they're both superior than the rest of the world. So in order to test the perfection of the crime, they both set up a party for David's friends and family. However, they've become a bit worried about David's unusual 'absence'. Their tutor, Rupert (James Stewart), is also invited and while the party's going well, he begins to suspect that something could have happened to David. But the biggest question is: Did they really commit the perfect crime? It's up to you to find out.Now normally, I would give out multiple reasons why I love the movie, but it's a first here as I'm going to give out only one reason why I love the movie. I will admit, it's interesting to see long takes and the performances are decent. But that's not why I love it. The reason I love it is that...It's more character-driven than you think. Rope may look simple in terms of visuals, but if you dig deeper, you start to find more under those 10-minute long takes. The dialogue is the part that relates to the story the most. It says everything about potential futures, problematic pasts, relationships, reflections, fear of going to jail, obsession with superiority, etc. This isn't a crappy 2014 blockbuster that just likes to say stuff instead of dialogue, This is a play-turned-movie that explores themes through dialogue. Most movies will express them through visuals, like Old Boy, but it's an accomplishment for a screenwriter to write dialogue that actually relates to something to do with the movie. To create dialogue that is interesting to listen to and something to think about sets a new level for writing a screenplay. The dialogue says everything about our characters and how they feel and with the long takes, they become raw and interesting. Especially with the parts where Rupert describes what would happen if David got murdered, where Ms. Wilson cleans up while everyone discusses David's disappearance and where Phillip sees the rope used for something and becomes afraid. That's really good story-telling and tells us more about our characters without becoming over-dramatic and becoming truly suspenseful to watch and with those final frames, you'll start to wonder how truly haunting this is. Rope is more than a technical achievement, it's also a storytelling achievement. In just one location, the screenplay explores themes that are expressed through dialogue and visuals. They work simultaneously to tell the most haunting and the most character- driven story Hitchcock has ever told. Everything is perfect from the camera-work to the dialogue. I give congrats to Hitchcock for his direction and screenwriter Arthur Laurents for his superb screenplay. It's a film I would be more than happy to watch again. This is one that deserves to be seen by any film lover and one who wants a deep psychological thriller. Go ahead and take a shot! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating exercise in storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a NYC apartment, Brandon Shaw and Philip Morgan strangle their classmate David Kentley and stuff him in a chest. Brandon is the more daring killer and considers David an inferior. Brandon is excited about the planned dinner party with David's parents as well as Janet who wants to be with David and Kenneth who wants to be with Janet. Philip is much more hesitant and scared of being discovered. Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) was their housemaster at their prep school who is the root of the men's idea about committing murders.The long takes and continuous flow of the movie offers an unique viewing experience. It puts the audience inside the party. Stewart delivers the tension which does fade from time to time. I think there needs to have a constant visual reference to the murders whether it's the rope or the chest. The tension picks up whenever those items have screen time. There is much commented about the homosexual subtext. It would be so much more compelling if the subtext could be brought out into the open. However the moral code of the era wouldn't allow it. This is a fascinating exercise in storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This precursor to Psycho is an absolute gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most influential filmmakers of all time and no doubt a master of the craft with many movies under his belt including Psycho, Vertigo, Strangers on a Train and Rear Window. Indeed he made many movies and of which many are imprinted in the popular. But with so many movies of course there are one or two movies that are easily forgotten including this movie Rope. It's a no holds barred movie that will leave you breathless throughout the viewing experience.Right at the beginning, it already tells you that is a story of two men who had committed a murder for the sake of proving it is an 'art', the perfect crime. The story's thrill is not whodunnit but the thrill comes from the question: will the killers be caught and if so how? That is the ultimate question. The actors John Dall as Brandon and Farley Granger as Philip played excellently as two partners in crime with the former being a psychotic superior who revels in trying to search for applause and the latter being submissive. Brandon thinks that only superior individuals are the ones that can commit murder and thus it's a privilege to the select few. The two actors performances were superb in expressing what kind of relationship both has and it is obvious that there is homosexual connotation in this relationship. Having said this, it appears that Alfred Hitchcock is fascinated in the dark recesses of the human psyche and it felt that this movie is a precursor to Psycho. James Stewart plays as the protagonist who had suspected that something is up and he played really well in this role. Without spoiling too much, Stewart appears to be the viewer in the screen as he tries to discover the truth.It's not the performance that I truly enjoyed but the technical aspect of the movie is the one that I truly marvel. Hitchcock was a pure genius in making every shot counts and making subtleties in shooting the movie in seamless continuous shot (it was technically impossible at the time so there were cuts but the camera goes behind a person to 'fade away'). The continuous shot is what made this movie impeccable because there was no break given to the viewers which for me left me literally breathless until the end of the movie and hanging by a thread. This technical trump card was enhanced by the excellent dialogue that are both compelling and thought-provoking to present the theme of morality and logic and Nietzschean philosophy. The themes were enhanced by the setting, lighting and props that complemented each other to create a suspenseful mood.Overall I love this movie because of the subtleties to express the theme of morality of murder raised in this movie which was in turn questions raised from the real life trial of Leopold and Loeb (from which Brandon and Philip characters were based upon). Indeed while Rope is not sophisticated and heavy on philosophy, the dialogue and subtleties in lighting, acting and props wave these themes for audiences to consider. These things are what made me admire Hitchcock even more but most of all the genius use of continuous tracking shot to leave the audience breathless was an absolute genius. I couldn't even emphasize this more. Rope is indeed an underrated gem in all Alfred Hitchcock filmography and filmmakers could learn many valuable things from the movie from lighting to props, dialogue and shooting. I praise Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More proof of Hitchcock's innovative genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I've always wished for more artistic talent. Well, murder can be an art, too. The power to kill can be just as satisfying as the power to create."With the aftermaths of the effects of World War II, Patrick Hamilton's play seemed like the perfect choice for Alfred Hitchcock's next film. A plot which centers on two highly intellectual men that decide to commit the perfect murder. The victim being one of their classmates who they consider to be inferior to them. This concept of superiority is handled pretty heavily as there are several discussions about it through the film, and it is easy to compare it to Hitler's ideal of the superior Nazi race. Rope isn't subtle at all, but the film is still engaging and perfectly executed as a criticism for such a dangerous concept at the time. Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger) aren't satisfied with having murdered their friend, David. They want to celebrate their perfectly executed plan by having a dinner party with David's father (Cedric Hardwicke), his Aunt (Constance Collier), his girlfriend, Janet (Joan Chandler), Janet's ex, Kenneth (Douglas Dick), and their former tutor, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) as their guests. Brandon is convinced that no one will suspect that they murdered David for the sake of experimenting, and it would be great to have his body hidden there while his relatives and close friends dine next to it. Phillip on the other hand is a nervous wreck and thinks that inviting Rupert is a terrible idea and that they are going a bit too far with everything. Of course the first thing that comes up when talking about Rope is the way that Hitchcock decided to film it as if it were one continuous take. The film is actually shot in 10 long takes, and the audience can easily spot those moments (it isn't subtle as in Birdman) but for a film made in 1948 it was a feat to pull off. This is by far Hitchcock's most theatrical film and shooting the scenes as if they were taking place in real time was a way for him to approach the material in a different way. He had to build the suspense without relying on the score or parallel action scenes. Rope has a very exciting climax, but it is very predictable for audiences today. It is also a very wordy film, but Hitchcock never misses an opportunity to include his morbid sense of humor. I love James Stewart, but in this film his character has several flaws, one being the way he rationalizes murder at first during a conversation with the rest of the guests and later the character seems to take a 180 degree turn. I still have to give Hitchcock a lot of credit for trying something new with Rope and continuing to innovate in his films. Beside the experimental element of Rope there is a strong underlying homosexual vibe between the two murderers although it is never referenced directly by anyone. They are going to travel together to the country and they use that as an excuse to invite their friends for a farewell party. The performances are all strong in this film and it is by far the most stagy film in Hitchcock's career. He may have just been playing with the concept, but there is no doubt that he also inspired future filmmakers to do the same. Rope is another rich legacy from Hitchcock. The performances in the film are solid and Farley Granger plays a very different character from the one he went on to play in Strangers on a Train. James Stewart was obviously the star at the moment, but he doesn't appear until almost thirty minutes into the film. His screen presence does elevate the film once he arrives at the home. John Dall plays the main villain very well, but it was his only collaboration with Hitchcock. I'd probably rank Rope around the middle of Hitchcock's filmography, but it sure was ahead of its time.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Rope is a Knotty Affair!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an intriguing challenge the principal characters in Rope - the dominating Brandon and his weakling homosexual partner-in-crime Philip - place upon themselves. Having just executed the carefully premeditated 'thrill' murder of one of their classmates in their lavish upstate New York apartment, they stash his body in an antique chest occupying a prominent place in their living room, and with remarkable dispatch, attend to last-minute preparations for a cocktail party they're giving for a select group of guests shortly thereafter? all without any of them knowing his tragic fate. A maid oblivious of the ghastly deed arrives soon after the murder and prepares a feast, serving it all at the beckoning of her employers on the very piece of furniture that houses the still-warm corpse. An air of engagement hides subtle suggestions that there is gloom hovering over one of the killers, but the other stimulates their collective dialogue with thinly veiled riddles that act like dangling bait. Some crimes are committed out of desperation, others for reasons of unfathomable frivolity. The two male dilettantes that set the events of Rope into motion find a disconcerting median between those two extremes: they believe that murder is a right given to the privileged, and victims are chosen based on a perception of inferiority. But here is a film that does something deeper and more malicious: it confronts that notion head on, and does so with a chord of rectitude that doesn't diminish the actions with guilt or forethought to consequences. The audacious gentlemen have undertaken this odious act entirely for the thrill of danger, but the finality of that moment plays like mere foreplay to a lengthy and tense night of social interaction, and dancing on the line of discovery is, we suspect, their real payoff.Inspired by Chicago's infamous old Leopold-Loeb murder case, there is a great stroke of craftsmanship at work throughout the film. Shot in ten long takes, the movies creates an elaborate illusion that there is no cutaway from the action, as if to indicate a quiet observer is present in the room for the whole duration of the story instead of a mere movie camera, resulting in perverse, provocative entertainment. However, none of this might have worked in hands less capable than Alfred Hitchcock's. His obsession with telling a story without resorting to the usual methods of montage results in a film of unusual technical brilliance, whose chilliness almost perfectly suits the subject. Hitchcock is less concerned with the moral dilemmas of his characters and focuses entirely on the overall spectacle of how a perfect crime goes wrong. What is oddly fascinating is the way Hitchcock's sly cheekiness forces us, through the suspense, to side with the killers.Rope remains one of Hitchcock's underrated masterpieces ? a movie where he married an intriguing screenplay with witty, insightful dialogues with almost fiendish execution. While doing so, he sure walks a tightrope (pun intended), but with astounding buoyancy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces you will see the absolute creativity in every minute of Rope's 80 minute which has been filmed in 80 minutes the camera didn't stop and you won't see darkness from the beginning of the film till its end, he represented the complexity of the characters' psyches in such a simple way easily you can discover the evil soul of Brandon that always beg for a philosophical idea that can support its "contempt for humanity" as Mr.kindly the David's father named it , David is the poor guy who was the victim of Brandon's psychic Pride that made him kill David his classmate in association with his home partner Phillip who you will discover from the beginning his weak character that made him charmed with Brandon and see him as his leader so both of them kill their classmate David with a Rope and make a party on his body inviting in it David's father, friend and girlfriend making it too far when Brandon put the dinner above the chest where David's body lie ,as the party begins Rubbert Cadell arrives their teacher and Brandon's godfather who have the idea of "Purge" or the right of superior individuals to get rid of the inferior ones that Brandon brought it into a real act in his crime, Rubbert is a smart man with high strength of observation who will notice the "wrong" thing that Brandon didn't predict that he committed it as he named his crime the "immaculate murder" then after the party ends he come back again by a motive of shame and internal feeling of indirect responsibility of the crime so he opens the chest and see the lying body and after then he opens the window and fire three shots so that police will come and the film ends with a wonderful scene as the three men in the crime scene Brandon's drinking champagne, Philip playing on the piano and Rubbert with the gun in his hands sitting beside David's body with his head down and his hand with the gun above the chest here we can say that Rubbert cadell is the murderer as he is the one who taught the theory of purge ,the one who convinced his students of the intellectual and cultural superiority of some human beings above the others . .

		<shortDescription>Brandon is one of cinema's scariest villains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young men strangle their "inferior" classmate, hide his body in their apartment, and invite his friends and family to a dinner party as a means to challenge the "perfection" of their crime. Brandon and Philip are two young men who share a New York apartment. They consider themselves intellectually superior to their friend David Kentley and as a consequence decide to murder him. Together they strangle David with a rope and placing the body in an old chest, they proceed to hold a small party. The guests include David's father, his fiancée Janet and their old schoolteacher Rupert from whom they mistakenly took their ideas. As Brandon becomes increasingly more daring, Rupert begins to suspect. Roger Ebert wrote "In an ordinary movie, closer shots indicate more intensity, longer shots are more objective. Camera movement helps establish mood. Closeups punch home dramatic moments. Cutaways, or "reaction shots," make it clear who is reacting, and when. Although Hitchcock tried to choreograph his 10-minute takes so that the camera would be where the drama demanded it, there are moments when it seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that trunk spends so much time in the foreground that we wonder why it's not the immediate center of attention." The acting is very good, as usual when working with Hitchcock's skilled direction. John Dall is absolutely spellbinding as one of cinema's scariest villains, an intellectual whose disregard for human emotions and morals verges more on fascism than the sub-Nietschze philosophy he proclaims. James Stewart is also superb as the voice of reason throughout the tension. In short, this is a fine film that cannot disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic that a script like this remains original after all these years. Hitchcock, just the way he liked, delivers to us a very macabre movie. The premiss is simple, two friends decide to murder someone, and hide the body in an old chest, then they invite some people (all related to the deceased) and throw a party with the chest as a centerpiece. Simple, right? No, because between all this we have complex dialogs debating if murder can be justified or not and also a lot of black humor. - "Oh, it isn't someone's birthday is it?" - "It's, uh, really almost the opposite." James Stewart just like we are used to delivers a good performance as well as John Dall (who I didn't knew). I'm sure who likes Hitchcock will also like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wondrously Experimental and Intensely Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Master of Suspense, so well known for his MacGuffin and the tension built upon the suffering of audiences, delivers something deliciously uncommon in ROPE. Compared to REAR WINDOW by some Hitchock fans, ROPE echoes certain mainstays of the director evoking his most fertile theme (murder); yet, stands on its own as an experiment which, paradoxically, after almost 7 decades appears to work out anyway. The most stagy Hitchcock's movie which might resemble more a play than a thriller was based on a Patrick Hamilton play and a Leopold-Loeb murder case and may appear boring at certain moments. However...Pamela Hutchinson in "The Guardian" rightly points out that this movie is the most "audacious" of all Hitchcock films because what practically remains in the backdrop of the story is the very confrontation with the ideology that poisoned the world a few years before. Here, we do not have the context of Germany of the 1940s where people talk of superior man, the Nietschean philosophy built upon one of the most serious violations of human dignity and, above all, equality but these are two young people in New York. Consider the homo-erotic overtones between the male protagonists, similarly to STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock made a few years later. But above all, what emerges is the mastermind and perfect murder. One character, Brandon (John Dall) is the coldest in his deed of murder, the other, Phillip (Farley Granger) is more subverted to murdering but the evil act driven primarily by ideological affiliations is at the very center of the movie. Seemingly, it is good will combined with hesitation that is bound to give way to evil anyhow. And here comes the camera...With us who know from the very beginning who the murderer(s) is/(are), the tension is based on our perception and our waiting for it to be revealed. The stagy set of the entire movie (a New York apartment with the Manhattan visible through the windows behind) aids the atmosphere considerably. Colors contribute to the senses as well with the sunset. The murder might be revealed at any moment during the party breaking, in the very Hitchcockian fashion, the idyll of the public event. However, it becomes a party with the most gory background and the truly hidden motives that we know but never identify with. There is not much to discover in ROPE but there is a lot to feel, a lot of out senses to activate. Much thanks to the camera experimentation. Roger Ebert in his review on the film (1984) observes that "camera movement helps establish mood." In that case, ROPE is one of the most wondrously experimental films.The intense entertainment revolves around sheer brilliance of performances, including John Dall as the wicked Brandon, Farley Granger as hesitating Phillip, Sir Cedric Hardwicke as an ideal of an old English gentleman and a father, Constance Collier with the theatrical but memorable performance as David's aunt and James Stewart as insightful Ruppert. His scenes and role are absolutely different than those in VERTIGO, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, REAR WINDOW but high worth considering as a skillful handling of a personality. The performances are witty, indicative, very well executed.A viewer might associate the movie with a different title, for instance BOX but some perfect details clarify a lot to the characters and us, viewers, why it is titled so simply yet engagingly as ROPE. With the lovely novelties, it is still a highly worth seeing film as the Master of Suspense's historic experiment. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets me in a certain mood whenever I watch it, it's quite hard to describe but it's a comfortable cozy warm feeling. I think it has to do with the movie taking place in one place, following the two lead characters in one long take as they move around in the apartment. Additionally a certain feeling of exciting suspense is present throughout the film, as only the audience and the lead characters know the grueling truth about the missing person at the party they throw.Excellent film that, for me, has a unique suspenseful atmosphere. John Dall is playing well as the narcissistic lead, and the suspense builds exponentially as James Stewart enters the scene and tries to decipher what can be the cause of the two lead characters peculiar behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Murder is a crime to some, but a privilege to those who are intellectually superior."Rope, is a lesser known Hitchcock movies, but that doesn't make it any worse than his well known ones. In fact I could easily argue that it is just as good as his most popular ones. It is so easy to see how he got his reputation as the master of suspense with this film. It has outstanding acting (including a very different performance from Jimmy Stewart which further demonstrates his acting diversity) and a fantastic script. The most interesting part of the film is the cinematography. It is not like the "art" of Vertigo or Notorious, but it is very intriguing. For years directors have done "long" shots in film, but here Hitchcock takes this concept to a whole new level, a level which no director has ever reached since. He films the entire film as if it was done in one take. Well, the truth is he wanted to film it in one, but in that year of 1948 it was impossible to do with the technology. Instead he films it in what I believe is 10 takes, each ranging from 5 minutes to 12 (the maximum amount you could do with film). It is this tactic which makes you appreciate the film's acting even more. It would truly be impossible to do today with the ADHD style of the directors and audiences coupled with the obvious limited talent of many actors. Nevertheless the technology is there if someone ever was to try for this style again. Holds up greatly after multiple views. This film was obviously years ahead of its time. *Also once you've watched the film take a look in the trivia for some funny events that took place during set as a result of the cinematography.</fullReview>

The idea is logic but definitely passionless. The theme itself is very complex yet the movie is very simple and I would say adorable too. And the best part is, it's inspired by a true story. We have a saying, "Alfred Hitchcock always done it" in my book and yes, he done it again in this movie. James Stewart's performance is subtle and beautiful as a supporting yet very commanding. The two main actor is kind of annoying but it is understandable since they are quite the villain in the movie. The gay theme is ambiguous but people nowadays can definitely see through it(I know I can). I totally recommend it if you are tired of a very long and tedious movie just to prove a point. This movie with running time 80 minutes is definitely the opposite and give more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the Hitchcock films I've seen, this one is my favorite. I'm not saying it's his best film and I'm not saying it's superior to any of his other films (Well, maybe one or two but since I don't want to ruffle any feathers, I'll just go back to what I was saying).There's something about this movie that I can't quite put my finger on, that is to say why I love it so much. It is by no means perfect but it is well done. I think it's the premise that engages me so much. It's not like it's original. Some young adults get it into their head that they can get away with the perfect murder then challenge the perfection of the murder by subjecting it to the scrutiny of others, including an esteemed professor.It's a slow movie and I think what I like best is the way the young men respond to the pressure of the situation. They each begin to crack but in different ways. One gets more confident, one starts to panic. It's a very interesting idea and one that you see echoes of in most cop dramas, especially Law and Order. It really explores the idea that killers WANT everyone to know about what they've done. They NEED someone to know. They need that recognition or else it just becomes a figment of their minds and its a lot of pressure: to brag or to break.All in all, it's not a flawless movie but it's one I really enjoyed. I gave it a ten because, in my opinion, it's best as it is. Messing with it or (God forbid) making a remake is just stupid. It works better because it is imperfect. If it were the pinnacle of perfection, I don't know if I would have liked it as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to other Hitchcock films, Rope is a bit odd. It seems to be filmed in almost one consecutive shot, a pun on the title, and uses subtle cuts hidden behind the backs of actors. More than that, the entire film spans less than 90 minutes, and takes place in three rooms of one house. In short, Hitchock's "experiment" comes off as a theatrical performance, and the film suffers for it.Still, the story is incredibly bold and intriguing. Immediately, we are presented with murder, and the dialog to follow rivals that of Shakespeare. James Stewart, as always, provides an incredible performance, but it is difficult to say his is the most compelling. "Brandon" and "Phillip" are complex, Nietzschean characters difficult to present in a believable way.The film makes use of time, homoeroticism, props, sound, and lighting in a way that most of its time could have never dreamed of doing. Were it not for the oddity of the film, I would have given it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That 'Rope' is a great 'experimental' movie -- that, many of us agree upon. But could it be that -- because of what has been said or written or repeated about it, throughout almost SEVENTY years -- could it be that there were some obvious cuts (such as we normally find in most movies), towards the end of the movie ? If you watch it very carefully, you may...... SEE.......what I mean. Don't get me wrong : I do like that movie a lot ! And I must admit that, for years, and years (on occasional viewings) I was really convinced again and again that there were only the clever 'illusion' that the whole movie was filmed as if it really consisted of ONLY ONE long continuous take or shot. I say 'clever illusion' because many have already pointed out how Hitchcock's camera found ways to avoid and camouflage the 'cuts' -- for instance, by having the camera getting very close to 'something' (somebody's back, the cover of the chest when opened, etc.), thus creating a brief 'blackout' moment which was immediately followed by the camera pulling back from whatever the 'something' was. I put my question to any fan of this great movie, hoping for some echoes. Just watch it very carefully......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the oldest film I've ever recommended, an Alfred Hitchcock film from 1948 starring Jimmy Stewart. But despite its age it's definitely one of Mr. Hitchcock's most suspenseful films, right up there with Rear Window and Vertigo.Behind the drawn shades of an upscale late 1940's apartment, while the rest of the city carries on about its business in blissful ignorance, college students Brandon Shaw and his best friend Phillip Morgan have just done the unthinkable. They've just gotten finished murdering their classmate and supposed friend David Kentley by strangling him with a length of rope. After finishing up and stuffing the corpse into a convenient antique trunk in the living room, they open the shades and begin preparing to host a dinner party, which, in a way, the dearly departed David will be the star of. To attend will be David's father Henry Kentley, his girlfriend Janet Walker, best friend Kenneth Lawrence, and the three boys' own professor, Rupert Cadell.Brandon and Phillip, you see, are homicidal maniacs. Or at least Brandon is. They've committed the murder and are arranging the party as what they consider an intellectual exercise. The two are believers in the concept of the "supermen" as proposed by Friedrich Nietzsche and taught to them in school by Rupert in his philosophy class. They view themselves as superior to other people, and want to prove it by committing the "perfect murder" and getting away with it. Brandon sees the party at which all of David's friends and family will be attending as the "finishing touch" on the crime, seeing it as a means of flaunting his cleverness right under everyone else's noses, complete with serving a buffet off of the top of the trunk holding David's body, despite Phillip's misgivings and increasing unease.Phillip is concerned Rupert (who the duo view as being a fellow "superman") will catch on to what has happened. Brandon is counting on it. Since Rupert is the one who taught them all about Nietzsche's philosophy, he is eager to impress the professor, partly, it seems, because, to him, Rupert's approval will justify the murder. He never says this outright, though.The guests begin arriving and of course everyone notices David's absence. Especially Rupert. As the evening wears on and the party grows more and more tense, thanks particularly to Phillip drinking a lot more than he ought to in an effort to steady his nerves, and Brandon becoming increasingly more and overt in the little hints he keeps "cleverly" dropping, it begins to look like things are building towards an explosive climax. But what will happen? Will the two killers get away with their crime, or will someone find them out...?Rope was a film that suitably impressed me the first time I saw it (on YouTube of all places!). Very gripping from beginning to end and it must've been quite daring at the time to have the killers be the protagonists, and have them be strangely likable (if utterly unsympathetic of course). The structure is also unique to me. We know who the murderers are, as well as the how and the why, and even where the body is hidden. We, like Brandon and Phillip, are one step ahead of all of the other characters. The question consequently becomes not "who killed David" but "how will they get caught?"The arrival of Jimmy Stewart as Rupert amps up the tension, since he is just as smart and clever as our murderous duo and it becomes a subtle and weirdly polite battle of wits between him and Brandon as we watch Rupert start to slowly unravel what we already know. I think this just might be my ultimate favorite Hitchcock film besides North by Northwest and Vertigo.Much has been said of the fact Rope is done in only a few shots. I wanna discuss how Stewart enters the picture. Most of the other guests are shown arriving via the front door, but not Rupert; the camera pans over during a wide shot of the living room and he's just suddenly there, as if he materialized out of thin air. It's subtly jarring in a way and helps set him apart from the other party guests as Brandon and Phillip's nemesis and also helps underscore how his relationship to them unfolds - he is expected but unexpected; they know he's coming but he just shows up out of the blue in a slyly startling way, and although Brandon is expecting (or hoping) Rupert will solve the mystery, Rupert's reaction to the revelation is the last thing Brandon expected.People have said Jimmy Stewart was miscast as college professor Rupert. I totally disagree. He has a laid back, lazy, subtle and sly aura of what I can only call "benevolent menace" to him (if that makes any sense) and it helps keep the audience (as well as Brandon and Phillip!) guessing as to how much Rupert knows. His end speech is one of the most utterly powerful and emotional performances in his career I think. John Dall as Brandon deserves special mention as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you take a close look at the "funny uncle" in Hitchcock's favorite film of his own 53 features--SHADOW OF A DOUBT--and you couple it with the Bruno character in a film released shortly after ROPE (STRANGERS ON A TRAIN), and you tie this together with the boys club, dead poets society, or whatever the circle of ill-repute is labeled which is led by James Stewart's character in ROPE (American Conservative Values professor Rupert Cadell), it is clear this director took an especially dim view of non-heterosexuals. Actor Farley Granger, who appears here as the pensive pianist (say THAT 10 times fast!) Phillip--and who is essentially typecast reprising this role as the pensive tennis player in STRANGERS--embodies all of the stereotypical ear-marks of the tender gay killer explored more thoroughly by and about Truman Capote during the real life murder case spawning the films IN COLD BLOOD and CAPOTE. Phillip's friend Brandon, as the murderous instigator in ROPE, personifies an equally cardboard-cutout stock character: the ruthless, inhuman, totally cold-blooded gay thrill-killer. While riveting, ROPE leaves the bitter aftertaste reminiscent of too many of history's actual Hollywood witch hunts against anyone "not normal." (Who is?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This twirling story of "the perfect murder" goes wrong in all the right ways. The cold, systematic and charming Phillip, his unstable, guilt- plagued friend Brandon and the unsympathetic philosopher Rupert really make this movie into a thriller ride anyone will enjoy. The camera-work is superb, choosing long shots of the faces people should look at -not necessarily who is talking during that scene. with the exception of some of the fade-in's and out's, I quite enjoyed the viewing. Although zooming into something to zoom right back out again for the next scene might be a nice touch once, if you do it more than twice it becomes distracting. Otherwise great screenplay, the way the set was made, with the body in the chest and the food literally being eaten off of the victim's grave.. Quite a grim image, and it makes it all the more exciting. The ending was spectacular. As Rupert slowly untangles the strangeness of the night, he begins to pry at Brandon's unstable mind, unhinging him completely. Slowly but surely even Philip gets shaken. I'm a bit unsure about the ending-speech given by James Stewart. I personally thought it to be a bit preachy, although I agreed with its contents, I had the feeling that Hitchcock was laying it on too thick, like he was talking directly to the audience through J. Stewart. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie very much. 9/10</fullReview>

It's amazing that a film can be set in one room, with just a handful of actors and seemingly filmed all in one take (although that was apparently not the case) yet the suspense is still there in a big way. Although I'm no production expert, I found myself thinking on more than one occasion about how clever a particular scene was. It's something I rarely consider with modern films.

		<shortDescription>A Minor Masterpiece By Hitchcock's Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is a thriller based on the play Rope by Patrick Hamilton and adapted by Hume Cronyn and Arthur Laurents. It features James Stewart, John Dall and Farley Granger together with Joan Chandler,Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Douglas Dick.It was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.The plot concerns two implicitly homosexual college chums Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan .Their heads filled with Nietzschean philosophy by their kindly professor Rupert Cadell,they kill a third friend just for the thrill of it. The boys hide the body in an antique chest in the middle of their posh apartment, then perversely arrange to hold a dinner party around the chest, inviting the victim's family, friends and fiancée, as well as their intellectual role-model Stewart. As the guests wander obliviously around the sealed chest, the killers make snippy, veiled comments about their deed and never going so far as to reveal the existence of the body nor their involvement in the murder. As all the guests file out, however, professor Rupert Cadell begins to suspect that something is amiss.This is Hitchock's underrated classic that contains some of the most unique film making of it's time.He attempted the daunting technical challenge of filming the entire picture in one long, seemingly uninterrupted take. Actually, there are several edits in the movie: since a reel of film was divided into two ten-minute mini-reels back in 1948, the internal reel-breaks are "fudged" by having a dark object briefly obscure the camera lens, sustaining the illusion that no editing has taken place. He was so far ahead of filmmakers back then and so far ahead of a lot of the filmmakers today.A minor masterpiece but Hitchcock could turn out brilliance even when he considered himself to be simply playing around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rope" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's, "Rope," is one of the more interesting films I have seen. It deals with the theory of the superhuman. Meaning "what if" people had the right to eliminate beings they believe to be inferior to them. How we could become a super species if these weaker strings no longer existed. Another theme the film deals with is the value of the human life. Who really has the power to judge, who lives and who doesn't. The film handles these themes with great care and real opens up discussion.Directing is really where the film shines. Alfred Hitchcock gives away exactly what happens and who does it, but creates tension with characters and the fear of being discovered. He created a very real environment with real characters. The film progresses naturally and the editing is the highlight of the directing. There are only so many edits and the ones that are there are incredibly hard to notice. A lot of the shots are done in one take and it is credit to the director and actors to be patient and not losing character or flow because one mess up could have caused them to start over again. One scene flows into the other so seamlessly and adds to the feeling of actually being in the apartment with the characters.Acting is fantastic and the characters are great with a lot of depth. The main characters are Rupert (Stewart), Philip (Granger), and Brandon (Dall). Rupert is the suspicious former teacher of Philip and Brandon. He suspects something is wrong and begins to snoop around. Stewart plays the character with class and a level of sophistication. Philip is the nervous wreck, who fears of being discovered for their crime. Granger is good as the character, he's nervous and his body language only adds to the character. The highlight of the film is Brandon, very smooth and intellectual, who believes he is a genius beyond compare. Dall is the character, he fast talking and sly. A lot of double play in what he says and knowing he is a murderer, he's very likable. The rest of the cast is great at what they do.Overall, "Rope" is a great movie with fleshed out characters and wonderful writing. The characters are interesting and the acting is superb. The director adds the right amount of drama and tension to each scene and the editing immerses the audience into the event that is unfolding. The film also has incredible depth opening up discussion for future viewing. I give the film a very strong 4.5/5, strong characters enhanced with great direction, acting, and script."Fetch Status"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rope' is Hitchcock's film that tells the tale of two young men who murder a fellow student by strangling him and stuffing his body in a chest in their apartment. The story is based on the real-life case of Richard Loeb and his best friend Nathan Leopold who murdered 14 year old Bobby Franks in 1924. 'Rope' is a fabulous film with tension and suspense as you wonder if the culprits will be caught or get away with murder. James Stewart makes his first Hitchcock film appearance as the professor who taught the murderers the Nietzche theory of superior and inferior beings. The rest of the cast is an interesting assembly of people with John Dall and Farley Granger as the two culprits Brandon Shaw and Philip Morgan, Sir Cedric Hardwicke as the victim's father and Joan Chandler as Janet Walker the victim's fiancé. If you want great suspense then check out this film and be prepared for an amazing conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am self proclaimed Hitchcock aficionado so I have been a bit embarrassed that I have never watched Rope from start to finish. I finally decide it was time to sit down and give this film the attention it deserved.Phillip (Farley Granger) and Brandon (John Dall) conspire to kill one of there classmates (David) from college for no reason other than that they believe he is inferior and they want to experience what it is like to kill someone. After they strangle David with a rope they hide his body in a large chest in their apartment. Believing they have committed the perfect crime they decide to throw a party at the apartment. They invite over David's parents, his girlfriend, and there old headmaster from school Rupert Cadell (Jimmy Stewart), then they server dinner on top of the crate that is now his coffin.Rupert notices that Phillip seems to be a little bit twitchy and begins to suspect that something may be wrong. He tries to put the pieces together before Phillip and Brandon can figure out that he is on to them.Rope is a dark, sinister movie even by Hitchcock's standards. Most of his movies despite being about murder and mystery, usually have some moments of levity. With exception of a few lines from one of the guests, Mrs. Atwater (Constance Collier) Rope avoids these trappings. The best comparison I can think of is one of Hitch's later works Frenzy.There are some really good performances in Rope. John Dall is standout as the cold calculating killer and James Stewart does a good job in what is an unusual role for him. His character is pretty morose and sarcastic. I read that Stewart didn't like his performance in this movie and felt as though he was miscast. Apparently, Hitch originally wanted Cary Grant for the role.Of course you can't talk about rope without mentioning one of the things that makes it famous. Supposedly Rope was done in real time in one continuous shot. IMDb debates this claim however and claims there are several conventional edits in the film.Some other interesting bits here? The opening sequence that you see in the park in the trailer was actually cut from the movie.The movie was banned in several American cities because of the implied homosexuality between Brandon and Phillip.It is based on a true story.I have to admit this is not going on my list of favorite Hitchcock films but it is still a really good movie and definitely a must watch for classic film, and Hitchcock fans.Like what you see here?

		<shortDescription>Nail-Biting Film The Way Hitchcock Liked It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.Based on the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder case, "Rope" was transformed into a gripping, but very engaging story by the legendary suspense director, Alfred Hitchcock, about two young, intellectual college students Philip and Brandon (Farley Granger and John Dall) take the liberty of killing another chum named David just to break the monotony that has took its toll in their lives. To further extrapolate their devious initiative, the deadly duo goes as far as to place the corpse hidden into a chest while serving their dinner party guests and lavishly decorating the top of the chest. One of those misfortunate guests include their philosophy instructor Dr. Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), David's parents, his fiancé and he ex-boyfriend. The progression to the story concerns Philip as a slowly begins to become anguished about getting caught as questions starting swerving as to David's disappearance. However, Brandon seems more passive about the situation as he feels they can outsmart and literally get away with murder."Rope" further demonstrates the ways in which civilians are separated into two distinctive groups. Those who know the differences between right and wrong and behave in a more appropriate manner are often dismissed as inferior to those surrounding them (Philip). The other civilian who feels to take the liberty to act on their own behalf regardless of what has transpired in the short amount of time were deemed as superior individuals (Brandon). Therefore the homicide depicted here is in more favor to the superior by trying everything to usurp the inferior by depending on his way with words as a cover-up to the evidence that they committed the murder. The story reaches its ultimate climax when Dr. Cadell who taught the two gentlemen the theory that an extreme form of skepticism denies all existence begins to believe that these young scholars have followed what he has been lecturing that lead to the motive behind David's murder.The shooting for "Rope" is rather unique in that it utilizes eight; 10 minute reels as a way to capture the sceneries of one continual take. It gives the audience the opportunity to savor the dialogue from the performers and add involvement so that every man and woman from audience that feeling that they too are in on this murder and metaphorically invites their audience as guests to their dinner party. The film is also not all that serious either as there is plenty of dark humor provided that is saturated with clever puns, tongue-n-cheek humor and it's quite involving to see Dr. Cadell become the Achilles Heel behind the scheming young scholars in a little cat-and-mouse game. Even for an 80 minute film, the characters are rich in development and depth.It's a shame that "Rope" is one of the more underrated and lesser known of the Hitchcock's array of classic suspense films. Even Mr. Hitchcock himself dismissed his masterpiece as a low point in his illustrious career of making its audience, tremble, question and play games with our minds. And it leaves us with plenty of questions to take into consideration. One that crosses my mind is it true that a teacher's lectures can influence a student to commit things with them oblivious to what they're saying might be right or wrong? Or where is the line being drawn to doing right or wrong? What motivates us instinctively to do the things we do whether good or bad? These questions are for the audience to take into account whether they want to or not.</fullReview>

The beautiful view coming from the built-in solarium depicts the New York skyline and it progresses from daylight to twilight to nightfall during the course of the film. Everything takes place in one room and seems to have been taken in one uninterrupted take, although you can see when the camera focuses on an object and that's when the cast paused for a break.

		<shortDescription>My First Hitchcock Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time seeing Hitchcock's Rope and the first Hitchcock film in which I have seen in it's entirety. Yes, it's a shame, but I have only seen snippets of his others films, like Rear Window and Psycho to name a few.Here is Rope a film about two men who murder someone and hide the body within the house. To make things interesting they hold a dinner party, the guests being friends and family of the victim, just to see if they can get away with murder. When I first heard this set-up, I was immediately interested and hearing praise for Hitchcock but never really seeing a full film from him I did not really know what to expect.I HATED IT!!!!! Just kidding, I really enjoyed Rope. What initially stuck out to me was the long takes Hitchcock used. The film plays out in real time and uses very little cuts, which both work well and kind of hurt the film. For those of you who grew up in the 90's and are use to the Michael Bay/MTV style of cutting every 3 seconds, you may find yourself bored to death here. Also the entire film takes place in one room, some may be confined and not comfortable. I found myself more interested in the story and how it was being told. Dollying into the backs of the characters and back out again to 'cover' the edits was interesting, yet a tad overused.I really enjoyed Stewart's performance as the curious professor who questions the intentions of the party. Every little bit of tension in the film word well, the rope tying the books together, the maid putting the books where the body is hidden. All are suspenseful and work well for the film. All these scenes play well into Stewart's inquisitive notions throughout the film.I found myself liking Brandon more then Phillip. Brandon was more confident and sly, whereas Phillip, in his nervous and child-like ways got on my nerves. I kind of wanted them to get away with it at some points, but then Phillip would speak and I would want them to get caught again.I don't really hear much about this film when people talk about Hitchcock. It's more about his more 'popular' films, like Psycho, Rear Window and the Birds. I don't know why, but I think Rope is indeed an extremely well made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One my favorite Hitchcock films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this is amongst Hitchcock's Top 5 films, along with Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho and Strangers on a Train. I have a fondness for real time movies, and movies with long takes, so perhaps it's inevitable that this would be one of my favorites.What Hitchcock has done is taken a stage play, and used his trademark camera-work to get the most out of the setting and the story. The acting in the film is uniformly good - my only criticism is that the long takes sometimes force the actors to deliver their dialogue very quickly (I suspect to get it out while they remember it), however, among the actors James Stewart is the standout - he's simply excellent as the suspicious mentor of Bradon and Phillip.The lighting of the skyline backdrop is brilliantly done, and effectively creates the sensation of time passing (even if, as I read under on the trivia page) it has the effect of making the viewer think the film is longer than it is. Overall, 'Rope' is a brave experiment, which works because of excellent direction and good acting. I'm glad it's found its way into the Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Killing for the sake of killing"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a 50,000 word novel called Gadsby without once using the letter E, a type of work known as a lipogram. In Rope, Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock imposed upon himself the rule of shooting in continuous long takes, with only three deliberate cuts. By denying himself use of the editing process, Hitchcock was hereby creating his own cinematic equivalent of a lipogram.Hitch had already done something a bit like this in Lifeboat, which also takes place in a restricted environment, but focuses strongly on characters so as not to draw attention to the smallness of the space. Rope is exactly the sort of story that would have attracted Hitchcock ? straightforward domestic murder with a casually morbid tone ? but perhaps he felt an adaptation of a fairly minimalist stage play required an extra gimmick. After all, he was now at the point where he considered the most exciting part of film-making the planning, and he perhaps felt this was an ideal opportunity to set himself an extreme challenge in motion picture design.Hitchcock still goes for the effect of alternating between close-ups and mid-shots that we might see in any thriller, but thanks to his scheme he is forced to move into them by dollying and tracking. It often looks very smooth although there must have been a considerable degree of complexity, especially with the changing positions of actors as the camera moves on and off them. At other times the camera prowls around the set, homing in on this or that object, albeit in ways that Hitch might do anyway in any other picture. As always, his aim is to introduce ideas to the audience in the right way at the right time. For example whenever a situation arises in which the murderers might be found out, the camera shifts and David's makeshift coffin comes into view. Eventually we become familiar with the space and the characters and it is possible for dialogue to continue offscreen while the camera shows us something else. For example we more and more often see James Stewart's face while others talk as he begins to grow suspicious.An added challenge for Hitchcock is that this was his first picture in colour. The colour scheme is fairly muted, until the dramatic tension builds up and he goes all out with the vibrant, flashing neon. The pattern though is fairly general and simplistic, and there is little subtlety or careful balancing of shades ? probably because he was inexperienced with it, and perhaps also because he spent more time planning the movements of camera and cast."Simplistic" could also apply to the acting performances in Rope. There was rarely much depth to the acting anyway in Hitchcock pictures, but here I particularly feel that the performances of John Dall and Farley Granger are one-dimensional. Granger's fear is constantly out in the open, far more so on the screen than in the script, and we do not see his character trying to hide his unease or blank it out. Had he done that, the impact would have been greater when he inevitably cracks. James Stewart is also distinctly average in Rope ? he is only really up to his usual standard when delivering that final speech. For the most part his mounting suspicion is conveyed through how the camera focuses on him at key moments. This is the trouble with Hitchcock ? he is so confident in his abilities to convey thoughts and feelings with cinematic technique, he forgets that the actors are there to do the same thing.As with the novel Gadsby, the self-imposed restrictions of Rope do not add anything to the picture's effectiveness. It is testament to Hitch's care in construction that it does not take anything away either. It would be equally entertaining had he shot it conventionally. Like the novelist Ernest Vincent Wright, he appears to have done it for the intellectual challenge, and to prove that it could be done. Although it is certainly interesting in this respect, like many a Hitchcock thriller it is bound to lose impact on repeated viewings. However there is certainly plenty here to enthral the first-time viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Rope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times and it is always exciting, it is fast becoming my favourite Hitchcock movie, if not one of my favourite films of all time. It is just cinematically perfect! The way in which it is edited to look like one continuous take is very clever, and almost seamless. Hitchcock manages to build tension almost effortlessly, at one point just by focusing on a wooden chest for over a minuet has viewers on the edge of their seat! The acting is incredible, I love films that are set in a single location (Resevoir Dogs springs to mind, being shot mostly in a warehouse, as well as Japanese film 2DLK which is all set in an apartment) because it feels so personal. Within Rope you can see the characters develop in front of you, as you really feel like you have been stuck in a room with these people for just over an hour. The quality of the acting really comes through without the distraction of changing backdrops.I think the script is just brilliant, it is very clever, there are lots of little off-hand comments made throughout that on a first viewing can be easily missed but, on a second or more viewings it is easy to notice that often Brandan directly refers to what he has done in a way that we (the audience) can understand but the other characters do not - very smart.I find the relationship between Brandan and Phillip very interesting, they are obviously very close, even though Brandan eventually pushes Phillip over the edge. They have certainly shared a long past together. It wasn't until I found out the two murderers this film is loosely based on, Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, were gay - linked with the fact that Hitchcock often commented on homosexuality within his work, that I came to the conclusion that they are probably lovers. This gives a whole new spin, and depth to their relationship, and makes their interaction with each other all the more interesting - See if on a second viewing you can interpret a homo-erotic reading between them, I certainly could. This movie is full of sinister suspense, and will keep anyone on the edge of their seat throughout. A brilliant way of showing just what Hitchcock can do! It highlights many of his Directorial trademarks, such as misogyny, in the form of the nagging old house keeper, comment on homosexuality as previously mentioned, and the presence of an academic. Also contains two Hitchcock cameos - if you look really hard!! In my opinion one of his very best works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film in a theatre a long time ago, during a Hichcock/Stewart retrospective in Philadelphia. I did not particularly like the film then but decided to watch it again at home and see why I did not like it. As many commentators have said, Hitchcock went through several periods, and I thought maybe this could be my problem - that I did not like his "1948" period. After all, there were not very many good movies made in 1948, by anybody. Perhaps they were all worried about what television would do to them. I don't think the "period" theory works here. Hitchcock made several movies where he seemed to be on a very tight budget, where he apparently tried to get away with producing it if it was a play and not a movie. I think this is one of them. The background sky scene out the window showed the progression of time all right, by the way the sun changed, but otherwise it looked too fake for me. I got the same impression with "The Trouble with Harry", "The Lady Vanishes", and a few others, more recent, so this issue seems not to be related to when in Hitchcock's career the films were made.I can say I did not like some of the characters and actors, but not the same ones other people disliked. I thought Sir Cedric Hardwicke played his part excellently - a father confused about why his usually reliable son has not showed up for this party. If I had been stupid enough to do what Farley Granger's character did, I probably would have acted just as irrationally as that character did - so Granger did fine, in my opinion. Brandon, however, was a piece of work. I found him revolting, even without his murder plot. He is one of those people who think they are so superior, but aren't, but want to keep proving to people how superior they (think they) are. This was played to perfection by John Dall - too perfectly. Brandon's stuttering was a dead giveaway that he was guilty of something, and anyone casually acquainted with him should have figured it out - not just super sleuth as played by James Stewart. Another character who did not fit was the aunt - did not seem like she was her brother's sister at all. Constance Collier (I think that is her name) is so irritating she should only play villains - she was miscast here and just took away from the story by being irritating.Finally, big disappointment - not a McGuffin Movie. There was a love interest, but the plot drove it rather than the other way around. Joan Chandler's character could have skipped the party and it would not have made much difference. Brandon could have found something else to be obnoxious about. What her presence does do, in my opinion, is prove one thing - this is not a film about homosexuals. All the boys seemed to be interested in her, including Brandon (at least he apparently was once, judging by one or two lines). Although the reasons for her breakups with both Brandon and David (both mentioned very briefly in on-screen conversations) could have been because she found out they were gay, it seems to me not to be the case, but I am only going by her behavior. I don't think all the surface evidence of homosexuality is valid, because things were different in those days. Two guys living together, even with one dominating the other, and all the other clues, could be more or less innocent. But my friends say I can be terribly naive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! This movie just gets better with age....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is an excellent example of why Hitch IS the master of suspense. Filmed in almost one room, Hitchcock tried to keep the same feel as the stage play it was based on. The effect is nothing but wonderful! The story takes place over one evening, the setting is a simple dinner party which isn't really simple at all. Past school chums (and now roommates and partners), Brandon and Phillip, take their former professor's words to much to heart and set out to pull off one of the most brazen acts imaginable - the perfect murder. They decide to kill their friend in cold blood and then have a dinner party with his family, his girlfriend and their former professor (Jimmy Stewart) - concealing his dead body within a trunk in the living room. When their college professor starts questioning one of the boys' inexplicably nervous behaviour, Brandon's 'perfect murder' just might not be as perfect as he once hoped... The cast of characters is excellent and each one is given great attention and careful detail - a real testament to the flawless script! It's a shame movies today feel the need to treat the viewer like an uneducated simpleton, spelling every single detail out for you. In Hitchcock's Rope, things are implied but it's really up to the viewer to get involved in the film and with the characters to discover what's really going on. The subtlety is so refreshing! All in all the suspense, perfect acting, great dialogue and amazing cinematography make for one superb little film! I wholeheartedly give this 9/10 and recommend it absolutely goes on your 'must-see' Hitchocock list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Interpretation of the Leopold and Loeb Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two intelligent men murder their friend David just prior to a dinner party, and hide his body in a crate used as the table during dinner. When he apparently doesn't show up for the party (though, of course, he's already there) the other guests get concerned and begin to suspect foul play.What is so great about this film is something that will hardly be noticeable to the average viewer: Hitchcock used as few takes as possible. If you pay attention, you'll notice some of the longest scenes ever filmed -- at least for its time. Along with this, some clever camera angles that would make any modern director jealous (notably the scene where the maid is clearing the dinner table off while the men converse off-screen). Beyond that, it's simply a good story: two men, like Leopold and Loeb, who justify their murderous actions by invoking their intelligence, claiming that the superior humans (them) have free reign over the lesser of their kind. Unlike Leopold and Loeb, at least to my knowledge, is the inclusion of Nietzschean philosophy... aptly summed up in its most base of interpretations. James Stewart is good as always, here playing the suspecting friend who unravels a plot, though he's unclear what plot it is. Of note is his portrayal, along with the two main characters, of what appears to be homosexual lovers. While never clearly stated, it comes across as implied... and again, going back to Leopold and Loeb, the backstory only heightens this implication.The Internet Movie Database has included this film in the top 250, which surprises me somewhat, but not too much. It truly is one of the great films of the 20th century, and in light of some of the rubbish that makes it on that list, you might expect this to appear higher. Hitchcock today may be seen largely as a crime, mystery and horror director... but this does not change the fact his films are simply great regardless of genre. Watch them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>top notch movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie and the amount of courage it took for Hitchcock to make it. The only problem I have this movie is the acting done by the actor playing Philip. I think the performance could have been better, but other than that the rest were spot on. The actor playing Brandon held the movie together and in the end made the movie. James Stewart once again was perfect and gave some stellar deliveries that only he could have done. The directing was something to be remembered and it amazed me that there was only 10 cuts in the whole movie. This is totally unheard of and I have never seen it pulled off so well. The lack of music was also nicely done. Extremely well written and put into any other directors hands it would not have been so suspenseful. I liked how this movie was straight forward and was only a movie about one thing, but surrounded the scene with great actors and great characters. At no point does any of the plot feel forced, and I love how the suspense was built from nothing more than some great dialog and some meaningful glances. I like how it was Brandon that gave all of the hints and how Philip was just a source of confirmation of any suspicions. Overall a great movie and could not recommend it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to be overlooked and not really mentioned as much as the other films Alfed Hitchcock directed. I didn't even know about this film till I did Film Studies in college and this was introduced to me.This film is clearly based in some way to the murderers Leopold and Loeb. John Dall (Brandon Shaw) and Farley Granger (Phillip Morgan) think they are one of the select view who are superior in intellect and they are more value to society than their victim David. Right from the start, Brandon shows a very malicious and warped character who doesn't seem affected by the fact he has helped to take a life. With Phillip, he seems to be more shocked and can't get over what he has done, maybe realising that his feelings about the murder and the murder itself are different now that he has killed David. Clearly Phillip is a sheep who is bossed around by Brandon. I must admit I wasn't aware there was gay undertones, it shows how clueless I was in that aspect.Brandon is very cruel. He is entertaining himself and seems to get a delight out of pushing the boundaries of the situation more: He puts his dead friend in a chest and then serves food from his grave, he invites his friends and family to the party and then uses the rope he used to kill his friend to tie up books to give to his dead friend's father.I don't think Cary Grant would have been as good as James Stewart in the role of Rupert Cadell. He plays a type of cat and mouse game with the killers. He seems to be suspicious from the very start and keeps trying to get one of them to admit their sins and yet he is shocked when he sees the dead body and the nastiness of what they have done with David's body and the way they have treated David's family and friends. You can see Stewart taking in every bit of information and see him genuinely scared of what Brandon will do.The film feels very claustrophobic and doesn't seem to have any breaks but I read somewhere that there was breaks and to keep the film going without the cuts, they came up with a technique where they would zoom in and out of objects and people. The camera is the eyes for the audience particularly when Stewart is telling the guys how he would get rid of David and the camera follows around, giving the audience an idea of the events leading up to the audience seeing David dead at the beginning of the film. It is very spooky and has me on edge when I see that scene as you are waiting for someone to react to what Stewart is saying.Alfred Hitchcock makes good use of his actors, the space he has and the camera angles. He builds and builds the tension up throughout the film and when all the guests are leaving, you think that Brandon and Phillip have got away with murder till Stewart turns up again and you know the guys are desperate and that Brandon has a gun in his pocket so for the rest of the film you have a sense of foreboding and hope that they don't get away with murder and that Stewart doesn't get killed. Hitchcock never lets up on the pressure till the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Tell-Tale ROPE"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is to film as Edgar Allen Poe was to stories of fear and terror in the nineteenth century. It is no secret that Hitchcock is the master of suspense and clearly uses Poe as a major inspiration throughout his life's work but this is most obvious because of the clear aspirations towards Poe's most famous short story, The Tell-Tale Heart. Two men murder another man for no reason whatsoever and one is driven crazy from the guilt of being able to laugh and have a party with the friends, parents, and fiancée in the same room as the carcass and crime scene of the murder victims body. This movie is just as genius as the ending scene of a tell tale heart when the man cannot deal with the Heart beat of guilt he hears in his head. Although not one of his greatest this film is one of the many that secures Hitchcock's place in the ages as one of the greatest directors and how he can take an average story of murder and turn it into a vile terribly thrilling piece of art.This was Jimmy Stewart's and Alfred Hitchcock's first film together. Someone asked me the other day if Stewart made Hitchcock or did Hitchcock make Stewart. The answer is neither, the two teamed up hear to make a cult classic that soon turned into a team that made many classics together for the next decade or so. It was as good a team as Scorsese and DeNiro or Burton and Depp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glad i picked such a great film for my first comment on this site! Although i am young (15) I have become quite a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock since i saw Rear Window a few months ago. To me this film is underrated its a classic in my books. Very anxious and nerve racking from start to finish. One interesting fact is the whole movie takes place in one room, like rear window, but Rear window at least has views of outside. This is Hicthcock at his best and is a must see for any fan of Hicthcock or just movies in general. Another bonus is the run time only 85 minutes. And of course you cant leave out Jimmy Stewart, such a great actor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock's Recomposition of The Leopold and Loeb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope(1948) is an Alfred Hitchcock film notable for its single location covered in what appeared to be one continuous shot. When I saw it, I was very surprised at the single location. What single location means is that Alfred Hitchcock decided to imitate a requisite of the play. Therefore, when I watching this movie, I felt that I was not actually watching a movie, it felt as if I was watching a Broadway play.Talking about the small piece, its cyclorama was much better than I expected. Cyclorama presented day and night very well, if I wasn't watching it intently I would be fooled into thinking that cyclorama was real New York skylines. And refrigerator, do not have a freezer not like now. Plus who buys cigar cases in 2006? Only in 1948 was it possible. Anyway, if 'Rope' actors costume look 2006 style, can anyone distinguish very easily this movie's release date from now? Let's get to the movie, Brandon's(John Dall) behaviour reminds me of bloodless Nazi major(Sorry. Germans). He intentionally flirted with Jan(Joan Chandler) to pretend to not commit a crime, subtly drops hint throughout the party about the murder of David, and begins a discussion on the art of murder.In this movie, John Dall's acting as great as Jimmy Stewart. May be Hitchcock cast Jimmy in order to use his toll of being a celebrity. Anyway, Hitchcock's movie always expected me to see a masterpiece. 'Rope' wasn't an exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great experimental Hitchcock movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big strength of ROPE (1948) is that it manages to be Alfred Hitchcock's possibly most experimental movie ever, while exploring one of Hitchcock's favorite themes, guilt, at the same time. It's experimental, because Hitckcock wanted ROPE to have no cuts in it whatsoever, which he almost succeeded in achieving. There's an invisible cut every tenth minute (the camera zooms in on a character's black suit while the cut takes place) which was necessary, because 35mm film rolls only lasts 10 minutes, and there are three visible cuts, which were necessary for practical reasons, because back then, cinemas replaced the film roll three times during a movie. Hitchcock's artistic reason for the not-cuts-allowed rule was to melt the actual time and the fictive time together. The story lasts 105 minutes, and so does the story. Just as with Lars von Trier's Dogme95 rules in IDIOTERNE (1998), the rule helps tell the story. The lack of cuts gives the movie a theatrical feel, which is ironic, because Hitchcock believed that movies were to be told trough images, and not dialog. On the hand, Hitchock has many times disproved this theory, as a lot of his best movies are dialog-based.Storyline: The two young upper-class intellectuals Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) carry out a vicious plan to strangle their old friend/classmate in their apartment, hide his corpse in a old chest, invite guests over for a party, and use the old chest as a dinner table. While Brandon sees their plan as art and likes playing with fire, Phillip already feels an enormous amount of guilt. They both start getting nervous, as the guests starts wondering where David Kentley (the classmate they killed) is. Their old role model and philosophy teacher, the very intelligent Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who is also among the guests, senses that something is terribly wrong, as he sees all these little hints that support his theory that David is dead.ROBE is one of the most underrated Hitcock movies. It's interesting, suspenseful, and James Stewart is as great as in VERTIGO. In the documentary on the DVD the writer says that he thinks Hitchcock shouldn't have shown the two men strangle the friend, because he thinks that the suspense lies in that audiences don't know whether there really is a corpse in the chest or not. I don't necessarily agree. I think that would be unnecessary, and suspense for the take of the suspense, with no meaning behind it. It would remove focus from the Hitchcockian guilt and moral themes. Another (almost) idea left out of the movie was the homosexual theme between the two men, although you still sense that the undertones are there.Highly recommendable, especially if you're a Hitchcock fan. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This black comedy holds up well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly sixty years later, &gt;Rope&lt; proves an effective black comedy despite having a predictable ending. Two privileged young men (but certifiable sociopaths) (John Dall, Farley Granger) have strangled another young man to his death, and they stage a party in which the casket in which they have hidden the body becomes a table for serving guests. All of the guests but one are fooled, and one guest even leaves with what would be physical evidence (the ROPE within the title, the murder weapon, is used in tying together some books that a guest takes with him. A palm reader reads one of the killer's hands and proclaims the hand 'likely to do much good'. Even some of the dialogue, as in "the best Americans die young in war", fails to shake the killers.The reason for the killing? The men think that they can get away with it, proving their distortion of some claptrap supposedly by Nietzsche that the best and the brightest have the right to kill the stupid. (It could also be a swipe at recent Nazi practice in the "euthanasia" program, practiced by people who had their own perverse interpretations of Nietzsche). Otherwise there is no reason for the killing. But one of the guests is the college professor (Jimmy Stewart), whose teachings the men have distorted into an excuse for murder. To say more about Stewart's role and the inevitable ending -- the question that Hitchcock leaves us is not "if" but "when" is to introduce a spoiler.Hitchcock masterfully exploits a flashing neon sign in the background to set the mood at a certain stage. Color is faded to pastel shades; whether this is Hitch's intention or the fading of the original print is very much a question. Remember, of course, that this movie is filmed in a standard format, so make sure to set the screen for a 4:3 screen ratio.It is a thoroughly enjoyable black comedy and psychodrama with few obvious parallels. You will surely loathe the two villain characters -- which is intended -- and especially their perverse elitism.Definitely not for children, though. The grim jokes are all perversely funny as well as intelligent.Is it watchable nearly sixty years later? Sure. It will look old</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three crucial figures who are mentioned in the film who are, I believe, crucial to understanding the film. We hear of Freud, then of Nietzsche (misrepresented via the Nazis; Nietzsche wasn't vindicated before at least the 1950s), and, by way of reference to Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky. Those three correspond to the three ways in which the film can be understood.First, and most obviously, the reference to Nietzsche and the idea of a race of supermen is presented to us as the theoretical backbone of Brandon's and (perhaps) Phillip's actions: there are some people who are beyond the normal bounds of good and evil, and thus can create their own morality. This is obviously a crucial element of Nazism, and of course the film, made in 1948, would force the connection. As expected, the theory is soundly shot down at the end, by Rupert, in a speech that seems too forced by now but is always refreshing to hear (and would have been, I'm sure, deeply appreciated by an audience that just three years earlier had seen pictures of the Holocaust for the very first time). I think this point is so obvious that the film speaks for itself on this count. (Could the name of the victim, David, be another reference to the Holocaust? I think so; the wounds of WW2 were too fresh in 1948 for at least some not have noticed).Secondly, regarding Dostoevksy, although Crime and Punishment is about the exact same thing (the film, and the play it is based on, cannot but have been deeply inspired by the novel), I think we can use it to approach the film from a different perspective, not ideologically, but psychologically. Most of Crime and Punishment deals with the punishment of Raskolnikov, and that punishment is mainly psychological. Thus with Crime and Punishment, and so too with Rope. We see two representations of the response to murder. In Brandon, we see someone who is able to cope with it. In Phillip, we see someone who breaks down under the pressure. Even the reference to the chicken is a throwback to Crime and Punishment; following the murder, Raskolnikov dreams of a horse he saw as a youth that was being brutally beaten. Sensitivity to the past event indicates sensitive to the current situation. When Brandon begins to exert control over Phillip, and finally expresses this by an act of violence (by slapping Phillip), it shows the self-consuming effects of murder. When Rupert tells them that they will die, it shows just how far this goes: they too will be killed, just as they killed David.Lastly, regarding Freud, there is obviously a sexual undercurrent prevalent throughout the film, and it is obvious, I think, that Hitchcock hints (vaguely) at a homosexual relationship between the two murderers as a means of further emphasizing something that they have committed that is socially not right. At one point, Brandon says something along the lines of the people not knowing what they (Brandon and Phillip) have been doing. We think of the murder first, of course. We also think broadly of an act they have engaged in that must be kept hidden because it is immoral and wrong. This last point is perhaps more obvious to us now than it is to the first audiences (though plenty of people would have gotten it with ease). I don't think it's an accidental by product of Hitchcock's masterful creation of suspense and mystery, though.Added note: another sexual relationship exists between David, his girlfriend, and her former boyfriend. There might be a third: why did Brandon invite Rupert? He says at one point that Rupert is one of them (Brandon and Phillip). The fact that he proves not to be is what destroys the two men. From a sexual perspective, are we to read this as Brandon's attraction to Rupert being thwarted? I'm not exactly sure Hitchcock would want to have this overemphasized, but I have little doubt that the generally sexual undercurrent might extend to their relationship (or lack thereof) as well.This is to my mind clearly an outstanding film, and yet another confirmation of Hitchcock's status as one of the greatest artists in cinema.P.S.: Notice Hitchcock's adherence to the three unities (of time, space, and action). The neoclassical dramatists and critics would have lauded him for it. Racine would have been appreciative :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining film but it was too short...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope/1948/***1/2Main Stars: James Stewart John Dall Farley Granger Joan ChandlerThe Master of Suspense: Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is a very entertaining character study, like most of his films is. It concentrates mainly on the two main characters who are the ones who commit such an act of violence. The two- Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger)- are the ones who commit the act with THE ROPE. Basically they kill an innocent guy just know what it feels like. Pleasant, eh? Wehehell, these guys are tasteless, they are. So what? Is that the whole movie right there? No, no, no. The movie is very short having been filmed without cutting away to anything else. It was supposed to all be one shot which was another brilliant plan by Alfred Hitchcock. However, I did somewhat suspect something. I think they did cut away in a few scenes by (when people turned their backs) zooming in on his or her back and then zooming out. That way the screen is dark when the filmmakers are zooming in on someone's dark jacket. Alfred would then say cut and they'd put a new role of film in and then say action again and they would zoom out from where they left off when they cut it. It's all very simple because I've done it many times. But you were supposed to think they did it all in one shot. So how are these sick people supposed to celebrate David's (the character that got killed played by Dick Hogan) first "deathday"? By inviting people of course. They're going to have a party for this person's killing. I think that is THE nicest thing someone has ever done. Oh yeah but what if someone knows he's hidden SOME PLACE and finds out? Then where do you think you're gonna go? Back then it wasn't as harsh but it still was when you committed first-degree murder! What the characters did isn't the best part. The best part is listening to the interesting characters which are interesting in all Hitchcock films. Either they're very loud, or soft-spoken, or nervous all the time or always having something to do. In this there were all sorts. And not just the main characters but the minor ones that just showed up for the party and they all kept asking a certain question I would obviously ask if I didn't know where a CERTAIN person was. The tensions are higher. Phillip gets nervous. However, Brandon (called a sly little devil by Janet Walker (Joan Chandler) who is the main woman character) is not nervous but rather pleased with what he did and how he did it. He thinks the whole thing is gonna work and that NO ONE will find out. The people at the party were actually kinda clueless but still fun to listen to. The one person who was not clueless was Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) who is the spy of the group. Cynically watching and in deep thought about the two professional killer wannabes. I mean who do you think is the one that's more nervous than his partner and is always so uptight? Well that would be Phillip. He kinda makes it obvious with his nervous reactions to what people say and is never having a good time. However sick his partner Brandon is, Brandon shows that he is having fun. I'd say they're both sick because they both committed the murder. However sick this movie might be when you think about it, it was (1) based on a play and (2) it's fiction and (3) it's a Hitchcock film and when it comes to those they're always good no matter what story it depends on.

		<shortDescription>"We've killed for the sake of danger and for the sake of killing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the first film that James Stewart made with director Alfred Hitchcock, "Rope" is a most interesting phenomenon. Hitchcock boldly decided to give this thriller as much a resemblance of a stage play as possible, so he shot the picture on a single set in lengthy ten-minute takes, which give the somewhat eerie effect of continuous action. (Please DO NOT read any further if you have not yet seen "Rope.") The story is about two young men named Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Philip Morgan (Farley Granger), who murder one of their classmates, named David Kentley (Dick Hogan), just for the sheer sake of committing a murder! Then they bury his body inside an old wooden chest and invite some of David's family &amp; friends to a dinner party at their residence, all the while using the chest as a buffet table! One of their dinner guests is their former schoolmaster Rupert Cadell (Stewart), whose ideas about the few superior individuals being privileged to murder inferior human beings are what triggered Brandon &amp; Philip to strangle David with a rope.My favorite moments from "Rope" include the following. Upon discovering David's body in the chest, Rupert has a pained expression on his face as he angrily lectures the two murderers, claiming that they twisted his Nietzchan theories into something he never imagined beyond his wildest dreams. (But this film raises an interesting point: Is Rupert just as guilty of the murder as Brandon and Philip?) When Rupert describes how he would theoretically do away with David, the camera pans around the apartment in relation to what Rupert is saying. While the guests are discussing the possible whereabouts of David, the camera remains still as it focuses on the housekeeper Mrs. Wilson (Edith Evanson) removing all the items on the chest; if she's not careful, she may inadvertently reveal the dead body! Brandon and Philip know they're in serious trouble when they see Rupert, whose suspicion has deepened throughout the party, holding in his hands the rope they used to strangle David! David's aunt Mrs. Anita Atwater (Constance Collier) reads Philip's palms and, in anticipation of Philip's upcoming piano concert, confidently tells him, "These hands will bring you great fame." And finally, on a lighter note, Brandon relates a story to the guests (while they are eating) about Philip's technique as a chicken strangler! "Rope" was not the happiest filming experience for James Stewart. He seemed a bit uncomfortable in front of the cameras, particularly at the end, and the technical challenges of filming lengthy takes supposedly gave him nightmares. Alfred Hitchcock may have had his doubts as well; in retrospect, he claimed that "Rope" was just a technical stunt and that he didn't know how he could have thrown himself into such a project. But fortunately for Stewart and Hitchcock, after the disappointment of "Rope," they would together churn out three of their greatest pictures from the 1950s: "Rear Window" (1954), "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1956), and "Vertigo" (1958).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another great film by Alfred Hitchcock! I think that this might just be one of his best ones. It's certainly one of the cleverest ones. It's set only in one room, and that's extremely clever, how did Alfred Hitchcock think of that? There have been movies that I've enjoyed slightly more than this one, for example Vertigo or Psycho, but This one was fantastic too. I think maybe it got a bit boring in places because no one ever really does anything much, but the acting is very good which keeps you engaged in the film. So, apart from that, there's very little to criticise.This film will keep you guessing until the end, "Will they discover the body?" And the ending was brilliant too.So, overall, I really liked it.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's famous "experiment"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To many critics, "Rope" is nowadays a film praised as an experiment that Hitchcock attempted with results that were slightly better than expected. Sure, the gimmick of the "one-shot" movie was an ambitious and challenging experiment that Hitchcock handled the best he could giving us a movie that manages to look as if had been shot in one continuous take. However, "Rope" is more than a gimmick, and while the technical aspect of the film will always overshadow the rest of the movie, it is without a doubt one of Hitchcock's best films on its own right.Based on Patrick Hamilton's "Rope's End", which was loosely inspired by a notorious case of murder; "Rope" is the story of two men, Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger), who murder ex-classmate David (Dick Hogan) just for the thrill of it. Brandon, who is so satisfied by his "perfect crime", decides to host a party with David0s body hidden in the old chest that serves as table. Among his guests is David's family and his girlfriend, as well as the man that apparently has influenced their lives the most: their professor Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who will try to discover what are his former students hiding."Rope" is a film that includes so many elements that to label it as a "gimmick film" would be a criminal injustice. The most notorious of this elements is the disguised homosexuality latent in the film. While the play was obviously a drama between gay men, Hitchcock and writer Arthur Laurents had to take a subtle approach to avoid studio censorship. The carefully developed screenplay by Laurents is a work of art on its own merit, not only as an adaptation of an existing play, but as a different take on the subject.The cast is superb, and since the cast is formed by only nine persons, Hitchcock makes sure that we know them and sympathize with them. Dall and Granger are superb as the couple of murderers; Dall gives Brandon a sophisticated look that contrasts with his twisted morale and Granger is perfect as the nervous pianist Phillip. James Stewart gives his typical Hitchcocknian interpretation in a low-key performance that serves as the oil that makes the film work. His character works as the detective that must solve the mystery before the party ends, and in fact is a more complex person that what it seems. The rest of the cast complete the picture with legend Cedric Hardwicke and Edith Evanson shining in their small but important roles.Hitchcock makes the movie flow at a good rhythm, something essential for a movie with a small cast and set in a limited space (the entire movie occurs in Brandon's apartment). It has been said that the Master of Suspense planned the movie "as a play", and I must say that he succeeded making "Rope" work even better than a play would do. I don't want to talk too much about the "one-shot" technique because it has been discussed a lot previously, however, I still feel compelled to praise Hitchcock superb work with the camera. Along with "Rear Window", this film captures the voyeur experience and makes the audience part of the party, a witness and accomplice in Brandon and Phillip's crime."Rope" is one of those films with no apparent flaw, as everything works like a clock, with all its parts in perfect harmony. If a flaw was to be found, it would be the now-obvious series of cuts that Hitchcock makes to hide his "trick". Definitely, one is left to wonder on what would Hitchcock do with modern technology.The excellent screenplay, the top notch performances of the cast, the masterful direction; all these elements make "Rope" more than a gimmick film. In the end, the "one shot" trick Hitchcock devised becomes unnoticeable as the plot is so captivating, but that's probably what the Master intended. He wanted "Rope" to feel like a real time representation of a murder. And once again, he succeeded. 10/10. Classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Hitchcock is capable of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Declaration of Independence, it says that all men are created equal, but in the eyes of Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger). They believe that intellectuals such as themselves are superior to everyone else and it is their responsibility to eliminate those who are "inferior" in their eyes. In Alfred Hitchcock's movie, "Rope," Brandon and Phillip commit murder "for the sake of danger and for the sake of killing," said Brandon. The movie opens with the two protagonists strangling their former college roommate, David Kentley (Dick Hogan), to death. Brandon is absolutely thrilled with their perfect murder but Phillip, however, regrets doing it from the moment after it happens and it very uneasy throughout the movie. Brandon is also throwing a party that night at which David is supposed to attend just to add to his fun. He has invited David's parents, his best friend, his former college professor, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) and David's wife-to-be. This movie is based off Patrick Hamilton's play, "Rope's End," and the movie runs like a play. It appears as one elongated scene and only has one setting, Brandon and Phillip's apartment. With creative cuts and excellent directing, the movie could pass for a play. The acting in this movie pulled the viewer through the movie despite a predictable ending and kept it interesting and somewhat suspenseful. Even though this movie was made in 1948, it has the test of time and is a decent time-filler if you have 80 minutes to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accomplished Hitchcock play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is a captivating and intelligent little film that is basically a play, not a movie. It's well paced and utterly absorbing, Hitch giving the impression that it's being shot in one long cut. The plot is superb. Two blokes decide to strangle their chum as part of a supreme game. His corpse is bundled into a chest which is then used as a table for a dinner party. The game centres on the murderers not being caught, the exhilaration of the perfect crime their oxygen. They invite pals over to have a perfectly normal little party and revel in dropping hints over the missing man. James Stewart grows wise to the ploy and eventually uncovers the horrible truth, but along the way we get to see some tense, will-they, won't-they find out routines. Numerous clues etc are dropped, all to great dramatic effect. My favourite scene is when one of the murderers takes the rope and blatantly walks past the maid with it! Glorious. Made in 1948, this movie is still as brilliant now as ever. Worth a look.</fullReview>

They invite people over for a going away party. Most of the film is talking. People talk to each other, while the hosts try to hide the body from the guests. There are some thrills, such as the time when the maid is cleaning the chest, but the film still lacks interest, but still has disappointment.I expected more. Sorry, but that's just my opinion of the movie. Maybe I will give it a second chance. Until then, I will give it? 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great idea for transitioning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Alfred Hitchcock's film 'Rope' is a thrilling movie. The suspense of the murder starts in the beginning and keeps going until the end. I definitely liked the technique of making the movie that looks like one long continues shot. Only using 10 transitional cuts throughout the whole movie is unheard of. It is a good example of how to use cuts and making them almost unnoticeable. Using each one sparingly gives the movie a continual flow rather than breaking up time with montages. Using Brandon or Phillip's back as a transition for most of the shots is a great idea and is hardly ever used in a movie or documentary. Also having the actors come to the camera rather than following the actors to different locations is cost effective but gives the movie style. 'Rope' gave the movie the idea that the apartment was society, which Brandon and Phillip were trying and felt like they were superior to their quests. David Kentley just had one scene in the movie, to be strangled by Brandon And Phillip. Brandon and Phillip were classmates that seemingly were friends with David but the biggest question that was never answered was, 'what was to be gained from murdering David'. They talk about being apart of societies elite, the superior class god given right but no immediate gain like money, etc. Brandon and Phillip just talk about they have the right to be smart enough to kill just to kill for the sport of just killing. It should be just reserved for the superior individuals. To murder the inferior above the moral concuss, to just hang the fools and idiots to rid society of the wasted life. Brandon says, 'Humanity, It seems is for the weak and weary. Later that evening they have a party almost giving the impression to gloat. The people they think are inferior and love David the most are the quests of honor. Brandon and Phillip drop hints and clues that they murdered David and the guests slowly pick up on the clues and then decide to leave out of frustration.Mrs. Wilson, the housekeeper played a troublemaker is a sense. Divulging information to peak Rupert's suspicion even more. Like letting Rupert know that she thinks Brandon and Phillip have gotten up of the wrong side of the bed, being short towards her and taking half the day off. Rupert, a former teacher of Brandon and Phillip's also knows they are acting funny and questions Phillip about what is going on, to get no reasons looked guilty of something to Rupert. Rupert finally deciphers the murder of David. And suddenly feels an over whelming disgrace, ashamed of this own theories on humans and murdering people is a superior right. That changed Rupert's view from here on out. He decides to let society choose the fate of Brandon and Phillip. I have seen this movie 'Rope' several times and each time I see 'Rope' is just as enjoyable as the last. Alfred Hitchcock is over of America's great auteur's and his work like the 'Rope', 'North by Northwest' and '12 anger men' plainly speaks for it self. All 53 of his movies have great mise se scene, personality and inner meaning. I think as a film major it is mandatory for a good education to discuss Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine photography, rich color, careful casting, and fluid camera movements all contribute to this imaginative production. Yet its being filmed in eight ten-minute takes is what marks this work as historically unique.There was "The Thief" ("not a word is spoken") and "Lady in the Lake" ("subjective camera") -- and now with "Rope," the closest thing to a filmed play on celluloid.Certainly Patrick Hamilton's play as source helps in the adaptation by Hume Cronyn (assisted by Ben Hecht and Arthur Laurents). The reported ten-day rehearsal period really paid off in achieving a smooth, nicely flowing presentation. Aside from the leads, copious attention to each supporting character is evident, and they rise to the occasion as the camera pans in for numerous closeups. Cedric Hardwick adds stature to the proceedings, and Farley Granger's uneasiness helps sustain the suspense. It's also a good day for James Stewart, who anchors the rendition.Lastly, Alfred Hitchcock is credited with taking a bold and unusual gamble. Less than enthusiasticaly received at the time of its release, "Rope" is much more appreciated today. All in all, a fascinating variation on the Leopold-Loeb case--well mounted and cinematically original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under-rated Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first Hitchcock movies I ever saw was this one, with James Stewart, a great actor who I became a fan of when I was only 12 or so (this was in the 80's). I had been a great fan of It's A Wonderful Life, so I rooted through my parents' Beta tapes for more old movies and discovered this gem.The thing I like most about this movie is the way it runs as if you were watching a play. Everything takes place in this one upscale apartment, everything you need to know about the characters and the plot is skillfully presented. In fact, most of the film seems to be an attempt to make as few cuts as possible, utilizing long track shots, pans, and surprisingly few zooms. When there is a camera movement, it serves to tell the viewer something, almost as if the camera were a part of the plot itself.As for the plot, I quite like the idea that these two pompous upperclassmen decide to strangle and kill a man just to see if they can get away with it. The film opens with a blood curdling wail, and then you see the two men choking the life out of their former classmate. The deed is done, and this is only the beginning of the journey.They are (or at least one of them is) so confident in their moral superiority and societal positions, that they not only believe that they are able to pull this off, but that they are actually doing the victim a favour by killing him, since he is so obviously inferior. Not only that, but they also believe that have created so perfect a murder that they can hold a party in the victim's honour, after his death, and no one will be the wiser, even with him stuffed in a wooden chest in the middle of the room, which they eventually use to serve food from. The word 'diabolical' springs to mind.To counter the arrogance of one of the murderers, the second of the pair, you can tell, immediately regrets what they have done, and begins a breakdown of normalcy, that carries on through the movie. He appears nervous and anxious, and begins to even sabotage their own plan. Every time someone asks what's keeping the guest of honour, he gets worse. You almost begin to feel for him, and wish he would get away. If you are expecting to see action or any of the horror that was present in The Birds or Psycho, then this may disappoint you. This turns out to be a talkie for most of the movie, concentrating on the philosophy of murder. In fact, during the party, it becomes the main topic of discussion, other than the whereabouts of the victim / guest of honour. But there is the Hitchcock signature suspense, as James Stewart's character begins to sense something is up, and begins to investigate in his own subtle way into the circumstance of the missing man. I like this in a way, in the same way that I like Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: You know whodunnit from the start, you are just waiting for the capture.You want to watch this movie for the interaction between the characters and their agendas, the superb acting of Mr. Stewart, and the anticipation of the ending. There are several twists and turns in this movie that will make your heart jump, if you let it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock, brilliant as always, continues to amaze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, of all the Hitchcock movies I have seen, there is only one I felt was a legitimately 'bad' movie, and that was Spellbound. He was a genius in not only the plots of his films, but also the brilliant cinematography. I plan on going into film as a director/writer, and one of the thoughts I had a while back was that it would be pretty cool to shoot an entire movie in one shot. What gave me that idea was hearing Spielberg talk about how he shot one of his Jaws scenes by having people pass in front of the camera instead of cutting closer to Roy Sheider. Well, as I watched Rope I realized that, "Oh my gosh, he's doing it!" The brilliance of it was that it was so subtle you almost didn't notice, at least, I almost didn't, he crafted the shots so well that you felt like the scene was cutting to different places even when it wasn't, and all this took place inside on apartment!Now, for my praise of the story itself, and be warned, in praising it important details will be given away, at least, important to anyone who knows zilch about the movie.Leave it to Hitchcock to analyze the intellectual side of murder, what might compel someone to commit the seemingly senseless murders we hear about so often. Jimmy Stewart, as a prep-school teacher, has taught his students superiorism, that all people are not equal and, if the 'elite' feel it, everything, including murder, should be allowed them. Well, two of his students take his teachings to the logical extreme and murder a fellow classmate, simply for the intellectual thrills of it. Then, as a finishing touch to their work, they throw a party and serve the food on the chest where the dead man is. Unfortunately, they make one mistake, inviting their old teacher who, as the night goes on, begins to suspect. (Spoilers ahead) As he realizes what they've done, Jimmy Stewart pressures the weaker of the two students who finally begins to break. In the climax of the film, where the professor returns to the apartment after everyone's left, their two views, that the students think to be the same, come head to head, and Jimmy Stewart is faced with the brutal mistakes he himself has taught.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary experiment of filmmaking, really worth watching *minor spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's tension is not based on the plot or suspense but more on the contrast between the rules of the classic drama (unity of place, time and plot) and the modern techniques of filmmaking. The set is build like a theater stage and the acting is theater-like, too. While the whole movie is made in a few shots, which are linked smartly, theres still a lot of movement and very good "camera-acting". That shows, how clever Hitchcock has prepared every detail for the view of the camera (e.g. the kitchen door that swings back to show us Brendon putting the rope into the drawer.)The script is very well written and the dialogues are witty and always to the point. Only the references on Nietzsches philosophy seem to be somewhat trivial and reducing the philosopher.There are several hints for the homosexual subtext of the movie - this shows two things: On the one hand it surely was a taboo in the fourties to show homosexuality in the movies - on the other hand Hitchcock manages not to draw too much attention onto this fact, because the relation between the two boys is seems to be completely accepted by the other characters.Often the movie makes "literature" and "film" a topic of the discussion, and I think the scene, where they talk about the new cinema releases and the musical, really is brilliant. The fact that they talk about Cary Grant, whom Hitchcock wanted for this movie actually, is typical for the irony of hitchcocks movie...The acting is very good, especially Farley Granger, who plays the nervous flatmate of Brendon, is convincing.The DVD-Comments show that Hitchcocks doesnt "dare" to let the tension grow until the end, but wanted to show the murder in the first scene too make the audience an "accomplice". Surely that takes a lot of the tension, but now, a few days after watching the movie, i think it is even better this way. Because now you can concentrate on HOW the thing gets discovered: the psychological development of the characters, the relation of the characters to the chest and the mechanisms of the arrogant and unscrupulous game, that Brendon plays.Though not Hitchcocks best movie, I like it a lot: the macabre situation, the snobbish boys, the peculiar party, the dialogues, the colors of the cinema in the fourties, the idea of a "one-shot"-movie...8/10</fullReview>

Besides, I also notice that there are still chances for the crew to stop and rest. The scene is blocked by the back of the actor several times. Those are the spots where the crew were allowed to have a break. Because the actor's suit is black, the scene is seen going spontaneously with only one shot. That is what I found out.</fullReview>

It centers around this two guys who want to commit the perfect murder, that seems to be a theme in hitchcock movies but of course these two do not fool James Stewart, who sort of plays a mentor to both the young men ( I really hate this guy) and he is on to them like white on rice. of course when they do confess to him they expect congratualtions but instead James like a cop-out turns them to the police and of course immediately recants his philosophy. But apart from that its not really the plot that makes me enjoy the movie, it is the way the movie is filemd, if i am correct in 8 minute increments where the camera does not break scene. Rumor was that Hitchcock wanted to film the whole movie like that but opted for this because the camera couldn't hold that much film. This filme represents want i like about Hitchcock, his style. Only Brian De Palma can match this guy in stylish filming and De Palma barely comes close. He is always groundbreaking in his films and thats why i give rope such a high grade.Pros: Directing, Visual style, Dialogue.Cons: One word, James StewartBottom line: Very good Hitchcock Flick.</fullReview>

The suspense lies in their efforts to hold a dinner party while the corpse remains in the flat.

		<shortDescription>Fair-to-Middling Hitchcock film, but the DVD has great extras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible not to admire anything Alfred Hitchcock did, and if you are a fan of Jimmy Stewart as well, "Rope" would seem to be a must-see. Unfortunately, the film is a flawed effort, worth taking the time to view if only to marvel at the camera angles Hitchcock used and the brilliance of the color cinematography -- this was Hitchcock's first use of technicolor.What redeemed the film for me was the extra feature on the Universal Pictures DVD: "Rope Unleashed." This is worth the price of the DVD all by itself. It is a background documentary on the film, with numerous still photos of the production process. It is nothing less than awesome to see the size of the camera with which Joseph Valentine and his crew worked, and to imagine the effort required to plan and execute scenes that required that camera to move about. The documentary does a great job of describing the way in which Hitchcock pulled this off, beginning with the meticulous detail with which each scene was planned."Rope Unleashed" provides two other valuable insights to the movie as well. First, it describes how Hitchcock made the film into a personal directorial challenge, as he chose to shoot it as if one were watching a play, with 10-minute takes on the set. Second, we learn just why the movie itself is somewhat dissatisfying, as we hear how hampered Hitchcock was by Hollywood's homophobia in 1948 (a problem the playwright of the British original did not have to be as concerned about). It is also clear that Hitchcock and the studio's choice of Stewart as the "name" actor was most likely ill-chosen, since the views of that character simply do not fit with our conceptions of what Stewart should be like. This in turn forced the inclusion of the preachy monologue at the end of the film, when the former teacher renounces the beliefs that led to his students' tragic poor choices.I give this a 7/10, though my vote is certainly biased upward by my love of both Hitchcock and Stewart. Were it not for that bias and the inclusion of "Rope Unleashed" I would probably knock the rating down to a 6, and that only because of the awesome achievement of cinematography.</fullReview>

It is an interesting experience having the murder happen first, so we know 'whodunnut', but the suspense instead comes from the question, 'will they be found out?'

		<shortDescription>Another good Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rope' is a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, that is, it carries the same suspense, mystery, and feel that most Hitchcock movies have. 'Rope' was originally a play, and hence has a simple set and background. Except for a brief segment at the start of the film, the entire show takes place solely in one environment (specifically, an apartment). Basically, this film is about a murder committed by two young men who (just after committing the murder) host a party, and see if they are smart enough to get away with it. Brandon Shaw (played by John Dall) is a character that is a little insane; He is convinced that some people are better than others, and so (as he reasons), murder is acceptable in certain contexts. The 2002 motion picture 'Murder by Numbers' (directed by Barbet Schroeder) is a show based on a similar idea as 'Rope', there are key differences in between the two films, one being that 'Rope' is an all around better film. James Stewart takes on the role of a former teacher of the murderers, but early on in the show he figures that something is going on, and as such, act more like a detective and tries to figure out what Brandon and Phillip have been up to. Personally, I could tell early on in the movie how it was going to end, but knowing that did not make the film any less interesting or enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a very big fan of old movies, this film surprised me. Of course, back in 1948, they had a different idea of what 'thrilling' and 'suspenseful' were than we do today. The film was loosely based on two young men from the University of Chicago and the actual murder they committed. Perhaps the reason why Hitchcock experimented with the long takes was to depict the story as being more realistic. The two men in this film killed only so they could see what it was like and to experience the exhilaration of taking a life. Hopefully this wasn't the reason for the actual murder case! You don't really realize that the movie is filmed in entirely one long shot until you think about it. I think this technique was well executed and did create some sense of suspense. The viewer almost feels as if they are there attending the party with the smooth camera movements and the sense of real time. The transitions that took place when the film reels were changed were kind of cheesy, but not that noticeable. It was quite clever actually. Some people claim that towards the end of the film, the camera actually does cut to a different shot. I guess the only way to find out whether or not this is true is to watch the film over again in extreme detail. The fact that the story takes place in only one room and over the course of one evening is quite out of the ordinary. The entire movie is about a dinner party. It sounds pretty boring at first, but the twist is that the guest of honor, in which everyone is readily expecting, is actually dead inside a chest where the dinner is being served from. This whole idea is creepy in itself. The guests constantly wonder where he is and eventually leave the party, never knowing the he was actually there the entire time.There were some scenes where the guests came a little too close to discovering the dead body. These scenes were a little nerve-racking because if the body was discovered, their whole plan would come to a halt. I really enjoy when a film gets the audience involved, but that was expected here since almost all Hitchcock films do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock film carried by quality acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock is of course known for his suspenseful movies but his films are also known for their cross country pursuits (THIRTY NINE STEPS), dark humor (THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY), action climax (TORN CURTAIN), blond heroine (REAR WINDOW) and special effects (THE BIRDS). Rarely is the film carried by the strength of the actors. ROPE is one of Hitchcock's few films that ignore most of the typical attributes mentioned above, except for some dark humor, and allows the actors to carry the whole story. There is no mystery in this film for the viewers as we witness the murder at the start of the film. The suspense is generated by the actors as they deal with the absence of the murder victim from a party thrown by the two murderers. The family, fiance and friend of the victim, who don't know he has been killed, become increasingly upset at his absence from the party. The maid helps fuel the tension as she gossips while conducting her duties. The former headmaster of the school the murder victim, the two hosts and the other young male guest all attended puts the pieces together. Meanwhile, the two hosts try and drop as many hints as they can that the missing party member has been killed and that they did it. For one of the hosts it seems to fuel his own idea that he is superior to all his guests and that if they were his equal they could figure it all out. The other host can barely keep it together as he experiences doubt and regret about what he has done and worries about being caught. Rope boasts some big named actors such as James Stewart and Sir Cedric Hardwicke but also brings some less known actors such as John Dall and Douglas Dick. The mix works out fine. Stewart, who breaks from his "down home-everyman roles, is perfect as the philosophical headmaster who with his abstract ideas that he passed on to his students really is responsible for the killing that takes place. I really enjoyed watching Joan Chandler as the soon to be fiance of the murdered man. It was a treat to see Hitchcock use a brunette instead of his standard blonde for this movie. I find her role to be in some ways the most complex. She has dated 2 of the men at the party and has now moved onto the murder victim. Behind her sophisticated image is a woman who has been unhappy and for the first time is really happy and looking forward to a future with the murdered victim. The movie never indicates what happens when the party members, other than the headmaster, discover that the missing party member has been murdered by his friends and we as viewers are left to our own ideas as two how they will respond. I suspect the fiance had a huge mental breakdown and either never recovered from the incident and spent her life single and unhappy or she married the other male guest whom she used to date and they still show signs of caring for each other.This was Hitchcock's first color movie and the set is beautiful. The view of the city from the killers apartment is so life like it is hard to believe that it is a manufactured setting.Lastly, the DVD for this movie also includes the trailer. The trailer is the only time the viewer gets to see the murder victim alive and it adds some backdrop to the relationship between the victim and his soon to be fiance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is one person superior to another? Does that person deserve to live more than a person who is considered inferior? Brandon (John Dall) seems to think so. Believing a philosophy learned from his headmaster (James Stewart) at prep school and making it a reality by killing a fellow classmate (David) with his accomplice Philip (Farley Granger). What would make this situation even more intense? How about having a party right after the murder with the corpse stored in a trunk that is used as the buffet table for the supper party. To top it off, just for the shear thrill of it, invite the murder victim's father and fiancé to the party. That is exactly what Brandon and Philip have done in the film Rope.Brandon's character is an arrogant thrill-seeker who pushes the limits throughout the film. My favorite example is when Brandon uses the rope (murder weapon) to tie the books together that he is giving to the victim's father. From this bold move, Philip becomes disgruntled to the point where their former headmaster (James Stewart) is becoming aware that all is not right in the formal pupil's apartment. Brandon is able to maintain his composure but Philip becomes a nervous wreck who uses booze to suppress his feelings which makes him look guiltier as the night progresses. Some interesting facts pertaining to Rope are the long takes that compose the film and the film being Hitchcock's first colour creation. The structure of Rope is comprised of continuous action with no breaks in the story that takes place between seven-thirty and nine fifteen at night. Technical aspects that created problems were keeping the background realistic for the time of day it was by adjusting the lighting. Also, having to switch from one camera to another without disturbing the scene was solved by a close-up of a character's back while the camera was switched. The next reel would begin with the same close-up of the character's back. The approach to shoot the film in continuous reels was daring for Hitchcock, however, the final product turned out to be very effective. After shooting four or five reels Hitchcock noticed the colour of the sun was too strong forcing the crew to re-shoot the first five reels. To avoid physical obstacles while shooting, the furniture was on rollers so it could be moved out of the camera operators way. The props were moved so quietly with the help of a special floor and a direct sound track was used from the shooting. The camera positions were marked by numbers on the floor that followed the sequence for shooting the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hitchcock Gem, and my favourite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not Hitchcocks best, this is my personal favourite. I love the continunity of the film. Hitchcock loved to work within confines of the studio, and this along with Rear Window one of the most impressive of its kind.At the time of making it Hitch believed that a play should be filmed like a play, without interuptions. But if one is to film a play as a play, it would become quite boring and ridget. Instead there is great movement in this, the actors move around a lot from the lounge to the hallway to the kitchen, the camera moves with them. I'm sure he saw it as an adventure, trying to get the whole thing to work. The collasping set walls, the furniture on casters, the city lights in the background etc... But, if no-one had told you about the 8 minute sequences and continous shots without cuts, you'd hardly notice them, its all done so smoothly.Hitchcocks facination with murder continues; this time he poses the question; if under certain circumstances it may be acceptable to kill , but in the end relucantly comes to the conclusion that it is wrong.It would be interesting to know which charater Hitchcock saw himself as. Brandon seems to get the most screen time and the camera seems to linger on him longer than the others. His, is certainly the most enjoyable performance. The awful Farley Granger is in it again, how did he end up in two Hitchcock films, he's one of the worst actors of all time. Stewart, Hitchs' favourite leading man gives a typical Jimmy Stewart performance.Another of Hitchs' favourite tactics is the dishing out of information, or letting people in. In this movie he tells the audience everthing, we are flys on the wall. Some of the characters know whats going on, Brandon &amp; Philip. The rest are unaware. Hitch was facinated by the idea of the audience knowing more than the characters. This builds in real tension, will the guests find out, will Brandon &amp; Philip get away with it, will Cadell respect/admire their actions.Hitchcock was very brave in attempting what he did; to stage a play on film, and proves that the cinema is much more entertaining than the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of hitchcock' best of the 1940's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i loved this movie. the plot's about two young men that killed an ex-classmate in their apartment to prove nietzche (how do you spell it?) theory of the superman (it's based on a true case). the brain of the operation is the psycotic brandon, wounderfully played by john dhall, and the guy who actually commited murder named philip, played with touch by farley granger in what i believe to be his best role ever in his career. the really sick part begins when brandon decides to make a party there, where the corpse is. to make things worse he invited the corpse father and aunt, his ex girlfriend, his best friend and the college proffesor (james stewart). things begin to get out of hand quiqly and philip begans to get nervous and drunk, brandon seems worried and the proffesor suspects something is happening. the movie goes along some time until the final climax scene which is marvelous.acting is great especially john and farley. the only dull one was james stewart. the camera innovation works perfectly and i love this totally new way of filming, i love when some director experiments with his work (for example christopher nolan in "MEMENTO"). special mention of how philip changes his look from a normal-nervous guy to a pale-broken down-drunk-agressive punk. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disguised Cuts vs. Direct Cuts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hitchcock filmed this, 35mm movie camera magazines held 10 minutes of film and so there is a "disguised cut" (like on the back of a man's jacket) every 8 or 10 minutes. However, the reels of film on 35mm movie projectors hold 20 minutes of film. Hitchcock knew that it was useless to try to disguise the changeover from one projector to another when the film was shown in theaters, so every 20 minutes there is a "direct cut"--a change to a completely different camera setup. The most memorable of these "direct cuts" is when Philip (Farley Granger) says "That's a lie!" responding to Brandon's tales of Philip's chicken strangling prowess. The next shot is a medium shot of James Stewart's face responding to that outburst. (There is also one direct cut not related to changing reels--at the very beginning, when the title sequence ends, the camera pans to the exterior of the penthouse window, and then cuts to the inside of the penthouse.)</fullReview>

Hitchcock had a very good way of doing that. It doesn't matter if the film was made many years ago, it still have this affect of triggering certain emotions.An interesting note I think was that the reason why the guys got caught was due to their 'inferior moral' characters. They got caught because in their own terms, they are limited, obligated by their human morals. If they were not restricted in this sense, I don't think they will get caught.A very interesting movie. 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why this is not rated higher. This is easily one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. Yes, the camera work was experimental but it worked. The suspense is definitely there and the humor doesn't disappoint. John Dall stuttering is classic (and would be later used in Psycho). The camera work is what makes this such a great movie though. Listen to James Stewart describe what he thinks happened in the movie and watch the camera follow his thoughts. Just that scene alone is fascinating. I will say this is a very talk-y picture though as it was just shot in one location. But don't listen to me or any of the negative reviews, decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging thriller but the ending fails to convince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's nemesis - poor endings strikes here again. but for a few movies like Vertigo, 39 steps and Marnie, most of Hitchcock's films tend to have predictable and straight-jacket endings that do not leave much to be pondered about. Rope which is tremendously gripping and captivating for most of its 80 minutes cold have been an absolute masterpiece if it had been just a little shorter and had the movie ended differently.that having been said, the performances of almost everyone is brilliant. the script is very taut and the lines are a total treat for lovers of dry wit and humour. apart from offcourse the interesting cinematic style - the real time narration, the long shots and so on.the movie as terrific as it is fails to become a masterpiece because of it's, as i said before, predictable ending.here is my take on how the movie "could" have been a masterpiece.*******SPOILERS HEREIN******Rope's ending could have been so much more powerful had it been a little more intriguing. my take is that the movie should have ended before rupert sees what is inside the chest. he does not know for absolutely sure what happened, but there is a tacit suggestion that he has a very good clue, especially with the "rope" in his hand and with brandon's expression. rupert leaves the house then and the movie ends. what happened? maybe rupert went and informed the cops. maybe he did not, maybe brandon got away. or maybe rupert went away to plot brandon's downfall in his own evil way. this open ending would have left it open and upto the viewer to take a mind-trip. the beauty of art!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Experiment in Color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on a crime that took place in the 1920s, Rope(1948) focuses on two students who kill a third as a test to their intellectual minds. The two students named Brandon and Phillip commit the crime out of an interest to impress a former professor. They invite him over for a party with other guests as a way of playing an intellectual game on their part. Needless to say, things end up not turning out as Brandon and Phillip planned.First film Alfred Hitchcock filmed in color through not a very successful attempt. One problem Hitchcock had in using color for the first time in a film of his was sometimes certain colors did not photographed well in certain situations. Alfred Hitchcock after Rope(1948) continued to use his accustomed black and white photography until six years later when he used the color process with more expertise on Dial M for Murder(1954). Technicolor in Hitchcock's work from Rope(1948) to his masterpiece Vertigo(1958) would undergo a improving process until perfected in Vertigo(1958) as a way of describing different psychological states.Homoerotic relationship between Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan is subtlely implied in the story. I found Rope(1948) compelling because the emotional states of the two students are played as if they are a male-female couple who disagree with each other a lot. Hitchcock displayed a more interesting treatment of a homoerotic nature in the male characters of Strangers on a Train(1951). Rope(1948) in a way was ahead of its time in the inclusion of the homoerotic nature of Brandon and Phillip.Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train(1951) expands and improves on ideas the master of suspense used in Rope(1948). Strangers on a Train(1951) also includes people obsessed with committing the perfect murder. Farley Granger plays basically the same sort of person in Strangers on a Train(1951) as in Rope(1948). Finally, Strangers on a Train(1951) as I mentioned earlier also is fascinated with the homoerotic nature of its two main performing actors.For every Hitchcock masterpiece...I.E., Notorious(1946) or Vertigo(1958), there is at least one good but flawed film the director has made such as Rope(1948) to name one(no such thing as a perfect film director). The flaws are in the film's acting, story. and to a lesser extent the cinematography. Still, Rope(1948) succeeds as an experimential feature film with some new techniques used on a film in late 1940s Hollywood. Not a masterpiece or a total failure but an open minded attempt at filmmaking.The initial of four film Alfred Hitchcock did with actor, James Stewart. Probably the least successful acting job by James Stewart in a Hitchcock film. From Rope(1948), to Rear Window(1954), to The Man who Knew too Much(1955), to Vertigo(1958), the performances of James Stewart improved on an emotional as well as a physical level. James Stewart and Cary Grant are two actors that best represent the everyman ideals of Alfred Hitchcock.Main premise of Rope(1948) is the stride for committing the perfect murder as planed by two students. The premise featured in this story was a recurring theme the master of suspense focused on his entire career. Many master film directors are marked by personal thematics that dominate their films or film career. Alfred Hitchcock was no different from other great filmmakers whose career is based on one or more themes.Filmed in the style of a one set play, Rope(1948) has the feelings of psychological claustrophobia. The one setting device was an interesting aspect of Rope(1948) which can also be found in a film from the same year known as Key Largo(1948) by John Huston. One of the rarest films in that period to be filmed in real time. I believe the next motion picture to use real time effects was the Fred Zinnermann Western, High Noon(1952).Final scene is the sore spot of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope(1948) because it goes against what the film was about in first and second act. The director should have done an ending that fitted in perfectly with the rest of the story. Rupert Cadell's behavior in the last scene contradicts his behavior earlier in the movie. The ending seen in Rope(1948) was one typical aspect of Hollywood films in those days.The writing is a mixed bag of good and bad plot ideas. Wonderful reference is alluded to Hitchcock's masterpiece, Notorious(1946) during a conversation between two female characters. Montage of this picture is average at best with few moments of brilliance. Rope(1948) is an important Alfred Hitchcock feature because it began a new phase in his film career.</fullReview>

The acting is great for the most part, especially by Stewart, but the two younger co-stars are not as interesting to watch. Hitchcock did an excellent job directing this film, his first colour feature. This is a short film, probably the shortest feature film that I've ever seen, it's only 81 minutes.

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock in Colour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first feature film that Hitchcock made in colour, as well as the first independent film that he made with his own production company titled Transatlantic Films. Parting company with David O'Selznick, Hitchcock began to define himself as an independent producer with his first feature film in colour, and decided to use James Stewart's new depth of emotion that he picked up whilst serving in the air force during the Second World War. Because Stewart had frequently undergone near death experiences whilst serving his country, it created depths in him that Hitchcock could now capitalise on. In 'Rope', Stewart is the middle aged (40 year old) headmaster of a prep school that Farley Granger and his co-murderer had attended. They intrepret his teachings to an extreme that motivates them to commit the perfect murder on another of their school colleagues. They celebrate by holding a party with the corpse in a coffin where the food is served on, and define it as putting the signature on the painting of their masterpiece. They invite their own headmaster (Stewart) to the party as a statement to say that their interpretation of his teachings has now been fully realised. Stewart is left to pick up the pieces with the absence of the murdered colleague, the strange behaviour patterns of Farley Granger, and his sharp sense of perception to see through a cover up. Leaving the party somewhat unsatisfied, Stewart returns, stating that he forgot his cigarette case. He places it himself on the coffin which he suspects has a dark secret hidden beneath, and forces them into a situation whereby he can reveal their dastardly deeds. Stewart discovers the corpse in the coffin and alerts the police. A somewhat unsatisfactory ending and an unusual film as a whole, but there were some redeeming qualities. For example, the all star cast of James Stewart, Farley Granger and Cedric Hardwicke. The ten minute stagey takes. The first Hitchcock film in colour, and the whole story revolving around one location. However, 'Rope' did not have the cinematography of Robert Burks, nor did it have the score of Bernard Herrmann. For this reason, it was not necessarily a suitable vehicle for Stewart which was made more apparent when it flopped at the box office, and made Stewart suspicious of Hitchcock's marketability as an independent producer. Hitchcock would need to do something else that would prove to Stewart that their alliance would advance his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Suspense Plus Some Distinctive Features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known or most exciting films, "Rope" is one of his more distinctive movies, both in method and in content. The story has some of the usual suspense, but also has some unusual features, and Hitchcock's famous experiment with long-takes works seamlessly, even if it imposes a few limitations on the action.The two villains are well-acted by John Dall and Farley Granger - Dall's character is strong and completely amoral, Granger (in the much tougher role) is his easily frightened and manipulated accomplice. Hitchcock makes them interesting, but without taking the easy way out and romanticizing them or making them sympathetic. Jimmy Stewart has one of his most unusual roles as the man trying to deduce what is going on. He has a character that not many actors could have made credible. While the characters are mostly believable, none of them is made especially sympathetic, so that much of the time you get a sort of detached feeling about what is going on.Hitchcock made better films than this, but this one still gives you several reasons to watch it. It's fairly short, less than an hour and a half, and it establishes the tension immediately and keeps it all the way to the end. If you are a fan of Hitchcock, you will want to take a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone seems to be well aware of the technical aspects of 'Rope'. I wouldn't have noticed any of the cuts had I not been paying attention trying to find them. The movie moves along seemlessly and gives the great feel of a live play. If I were to sit down and see this live on stage, I would have left the theatre feeling very satisfied. The film as well makes me feel that way.I love the performances from Stewart and Dall. The last scene in the film, when Stewart and Dall go head to head, is absolutely fantastic. The acting is rich, the dialogue is great and their chemistry was fantastic. They made the film for me. The rest of the characters fill the cast nicely, but it is really Stewart and Dall that steal the show. I don't particularily like Granger all that much, or at all for the matter. He was sufficient, but doesn't add anything special to the mix.There is some real tension in the film, and Hitchcock does an excellent job planning everything and executing. It is a great technical achievement, but above all, it is an entertaining movie. Without Granger the film would have been a bit better, but even with him its good. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

I loathe the tired expression "pushing the envelope", but, as another writer put it, that is precisely what the film does. Gorgeous colour cinematography. Unlike one other reviewer, I love films adapted from stage plays, and the at-the-time innovative 10-take filming captures the "live theatre" feel beautifully for me. The implied homoerotic relationship between the killers was very well done too, foreshadowing what Capote would develop more in In Cold Blood some years later.Not perfect, but certainly a worthy ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's "Rope" is a wonderful example of innovative filming techniques meshing cohesively with brilliant acting and directing. Shot in ten continuous takes, "Rope" is the Loeb-Leopold inspired story of two young men who commit murder purely on philosophical grounds. They decided to stow the body in their apartment and then throw a party that very night in a final act of courage and pride, inviting the victim's parents as well as their old headmaster. An excellent script which requires close attention to fully appreciate it's nuances subtly builds the tension as one of the guests slowly unravels the misdeeds of the young men.There is an appropriate nod to Dostoevsky's "Crime And Punishment", where the philosophical and moral ideas are directly borrowed. And the unique visual style only helps to compliment the confined and cramped atmosphere of the apartment and build the suspense.If you enjoyed "Rear Window", "Rope" is definately worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROPE is one wonderful movie experience - and it's all in the knowing. ROPE is filmed in four sections - complete and continuous scenes, four acts; exactly as in a stageplay. The energy distribution becomes strange and palpable once you realize these actors are free, uninterupted and uncut. THIS is a must-see for cinemafanatics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock was always trying to push the envelope. In The Rope, he pushes this envelope in numerous ways. The first was technical. The film takes place in one apartment and on one set. In this respect the movie has the feel of a play. There are also no fade ins or outs. The few breaks in the film are done by having a body move in front of the camera etc. Also, during the sixties the censors would not allow same sex partnerships and Hitchcock also pushes this envelope although no word is directly given or said. I would recommend the documentary "the celluloid closet", which delves further into this. A movie that pushes the envelope years before it's time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real education in film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is not the best, having no real plot twists and an ending that can be predicted from about 5 minutes in. The acting is a bit uneven, with John Dall having a blast, but the rest seemingly only cruising. Must have been awful, I hear you say! But you forget one thing: this is Hitchcock.An experimental picture, and his first in colour, is absolutely gripping - not so much for the story, but for the film and the camera work, for that is where the real story is. I found myself trying to spot the infamously few cuts, keeping a track of the camera and which props would have to moved and then replaced in a single shot. Amazing!

		<fullReview>There is only one cut in the entire film of ROPE. Hitchcock proves his genius with this film. The entire film is made up of several large scenes with no cuts to different shots. A true theatrical film. The entire movie takes place in an apartment building after a murder has taken place. Hitchcock makes history with this film by proving that it could be done. In 1948, Hitchcock introduces the two male leads in the story as gay. A shocker for 1948, Hitchcock is successful in doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning of the movie we're pulled into a twisted tale of mystery and suspense, barely breathing while we watch as the story unfolds before our eyes in an almost humorous way. I found myself laughing aloud at just how brilliant Hitchcock's job of directing this film was. From the way he snuck in the cuts, to the way he brought the story alive with his incredible directing techniques. This movie deserves to be labeled by everyone as one of the top 5 Hitchcock films of all time. It's definately one of my favorites, and my hopes are that more and more people will soon make it theirs. If you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, see it now and you'll agree. Truly a film that I can very gladly give 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Suspenseful and Successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard too many great things about this film, but I walked away quite impressed with it. Stewart is absolutely fantastic as the former boys' school housemaster whose sees his idle philosophy taken to its gruesome end by his former students. The technical virtuosity (such being shot entirely in twelve takes) and masterful scene development is what one might expect of Hitchcock. The film takes place on one set only, and mostly in one room, producing just the right amount of claustrophobia. Although not a whodunit -- the crime is committed onscreen in the first minute -- it is highly suspenseful as the various players circle around the truth.In some ways an update of "The Telltale Heart", _Rope_ stands on its own as a landmark and gripping film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: (the long version)I don't think this review contains any spoilers, but that message that put at the beginning of the reviewing section now really scared me so I am going to say it contains spoilers any way so I don't get put on the blacklist.Warning: (the short version.) May Contain spoilers.Alfred Hitchcock is likely to be the best director that ever breathed. Every film I have seen of is brilliantly done. In this film he adds so many subtle things which all work together to make this a master work of suspense. The first brilliant thing he did was to film this in color. Don't get me wrong, I love movies that are in Black and White and get really mad When Ted Turner colors them. But here the color adds to the film immensely. It makes it seem like the plot in unfolding in your own house. The second brilliant thing Hitchcock did in the film was to do it all in a one shot. First off I would like to say how incredibly cool this is. The camera never cuts. This again adds to the film by making it seem like a live play. It makes the movie flow like a continuous rush of Hitchcock.. As the camera follows the actors around makes you feel like a part of the action. the story all happens in ?real time' which also adds to the real life effect and makes it seem more ominous. This also means we get to see the really cool sun set on the New York sky line as the movie progresses. I will stop listing Hitchcock's works of genius in this film at this point because they come by the dozens ever minute. The movie is also cast perfect. Especially John Dall as Brandon Shaw he seems classy enough to know all these people but also twisted enough to have killed one. All in all this is a really great movie. This is probably my second favorite Hitchcock movie (below only Psycho). Though it is tough to say because he made so many incredibly great ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock, as clearly displayed in Rope, was simply a true artist in that he was not afraid to take a chance.....not afraid to expose "uncomfortable" (taboo) subjects of the day, not afraid to give lesser-famous actors and artists a chance at displaying their talents. True, Jimmy Stewart was the most famous actor in the movie, but didn't necessarily add credibility to this piece. He was probably chosen for the part, not to "save" the film from failure, but because he apparently was a favorite choice of the director for many of his films. People of the day identified with Stewart; his general demeanor could easily fit into any film.However, I believe Rope was not meant to be just a typical film to appeal to the masses. Hitchcock was not concerned with conforming with the normal Hollywood style of film. He carved out his own nitch, which is why he himself is such a legend. Not just Stewart (because he's most readily recognizable), but each actor in the film--even Mrs. Wilson the maid gives a very unique, individual contribution to this film. Without any one of them, this story would seem devoid of something. Having the story take place in one apartment/room should make no difference in a Hitchcock film, as could later be seen in the more popular Rear Window. It was a daring trademark of this ingenious director.In order to appreciate Rope, I think you have to open your mind and push aside the conventional movies of that era, even today. What makes it so great is that it isn't just another box office hit that everyone would like. It's unique and a strange ugly duckling. If you are bored with Mr. Dall's rambling, you can look at the great set with city backdrop and excellent color schemes and decor in the apartment set. No detail was left out. Even the persistent crooked candle Brandon tries to straighten. One can't help but think it's the ghost of the murder victim trying to make his presence known. Costume, makeup, and set colors are all perfection. Even the little piano tune played by Philip seems to have a happy, then troubled sound.Remember, this is a play that happened to be caught on film. Everything about it, whether play or film or both, has the Hitchcock stamp all over it. Definitely watch it more than once before forming an opinion--it's not as simple as you may think. As in all of his films, you will find something new each time you watch it. Dare to be different!</fullReview>

It's undeniably a fine piece of work, but the ten-minute takes and continuous dialogue create a strongly static atmosphere, which decreases the enjoyment of watching the film a bit, though.John Dall is a stand-out in the talented cast.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Hitchcock masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope", as many people know, was done as an experiment. Alfred Hitchcock wanted to make a movie that looked like it was shot in one unbroken take. This was impossible, since a camera could only hold about 20 minutes of film. So Hitch, in his brilliance, would use the last seconds of film to focus in on something dark, like someone's suit, and then begin the next take focusing in on the same object. The result? A unique and fantastic movie that truly looks seamless!James Stewart gives one of his best performances as Rupert Cadell, a cynical and somewhat pompus professor. This was an unusual part for him, because Rupert isn't exactly sweet. And for all of you out there who think James Stewart was really handsome: see this movie! He looks twice as good in color!Although "Rope" wasn't the blockbuster that Alfred Hitchcock was accustomed to, I think it's a great movie. I definitely recommend this edge of your seat suspense, and give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rope was an important movie for Hitchcock for several reasons. It was the first movie that he had Jimmy Stewart in and as always Stewart gives a strong performance. It was his first color movie. Finally, he did the movie in 10 minute continuous takes. This is a good movie, but is really slow in some parts. John Dall gives a memorable performance as Brandon, unfortunately he would not be in many movies because he enjoyed the stage much more. However, I have always wondered whatever happened to Joan Chandler? She sort of reminds me, lookwise, like Ruth Roman, but I noticed that Rope was one of a handful of movies she did. Did she not like acting? She was pretty enough, that you would think she could of become something, but it didn't happen. Farley Granger was sort of weak, but I couldn't tell if that was because his character was weak. He was much better in Strangers on a Train. This movie probably contains the most controversial Hitch cameo. Some people said that he appears during the opening credits. Others say his cameo is an indirect one--he appears in the form of a neon sign 55 minutes into the movie. I really couldn't make that out clear enough to satisfy myself. A good movie, but just outside my Hitch top 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film making at its best!(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me that so few people have ever heard of this wonderful masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock's. It got poor reception when it first opened and now seems to have disappeared behind all of Hitchcock's more famous endeavors such as Psycho and The Birds.But for those who are willing to give this obscure film a chance, you won't be disappointed. This is a true SUSPENSE film. You know who the killers are from the very beginning and yet the tension never falters through the entire 80 minutes. There is so little action in that time span and yet with each shot the anxiety just builds and builds.For those who didn't read the 36 reviews before this one, the film is about two friends, Farley Granger and John Dall who murder a mutual friend in the name of philosophy and throw a dinner party for friends and family of the deceased with the body stuffed inside a chest where the buffet is being served. And then there is James Stewart, an old teacher of the victim and killers who unwillingly had inspired the crime in the first place.The entire film is a continuous guess of what is going to happen. Everything is set up very well as Stewart becomes more and more suspicious while Farley Granger begins to grow increasingly panicky. Everyone plays their part well with the possible exception of John Dall who plays the more ruthless half of the murdering pair. His continuous stuttering delivery of his lines grows to be irritating after awhile. But his chemistry with Granger is good and two convey the homosexual nature of their relationship very well.This might have been the first non-All American role that James Stewart played. His character is rather smug, sarcastic and almost unlikable at times. But it is a great set-up for what happens later in the film as he becomes more aware of what his former students have done. John Dall's character had so much potential for being a much more complex person with his twisted superiority complex mixed with a strange need for validation. But most of that gets lost in a myraid of stutters by the actor. Farley Granger gets a bit easier role, playing the weaker and more nervous half. It appears as a strange pairing at first but after awhile, the audience gets a real idea of just how much Dall's character needs Granger's. It's one of Granger's best performances as his character completely unhinges by the end.All in all, this deserves to be praised with the most popular of Hitchcock's films.</fullReview>

The (probably) gay couple, the wise professor, who stated an inhuman philosophy, reminding very much on nazi-terminology, that made him an unwilling accomplice to the murder. Many said, that it wasn't a success, because of the new way Rope was filmed, but I don't believe so. It's a very modern film and I sure hope, that it comes out on dvd some day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seductive film, historical milestone, Hitchcock at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years later Hitchcock was dismissive of his "crazy" idea of filming "Rope" in one long, eighty-minute shot: "When I look back, I realise it was quite nonsensical because I was breaking with my own theories on the importance of cutting and montage for the visual narration of a story."Luckily Hitchcock was a better director than he was a theorist. I'm sure he would have been a better director still if he'd broken with his theories more often. (The old canard that artists shouldn't theorise about art is, after all, true.) Hitchcck's one-shot technique works like a charm; "Rope" is one of his best, most compulsively watchable films; there's one minor but obvious flaw, but it has nothing to do with technique, or with the basic idea.The one problem is that Cadell manages to shrug off moral blame a little too easily. There's some confusion as to what his crime is. He's an academic who argues that certain people -- members of the elite -- have the right to commit murder ... and, of course, two of his students actually do so. But why doesn't Cadell himself do so? The trouble is not, as some have seen it, that he's just too decent to put his beliefs into practise. The trouble is rather that his "beliefs" are not beliefs. He never REALLY thought it was okay to kill people. He exhibits a kind of insincerity which is all too widespread in academia. And "Rope" plays out a fantasy which I am sure is also widespread in academia: an acka who pretends to hold some radical thesis finds himself face to face with someone who really DOES hold it, and gets the shock of his life. But Hitchcock is a little unclear if this is really what's happening."Rope" doesn't often find its way into top ten Hitchcock lists, but it should. It's certainly a far better film than some of the staples of such lists: "Notorious", "Strangers on a Train", "North by Northwest"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Hitchcock, for some reason underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is considered minor Hitchcock? For heaven's sake, why? Is it because the camera is the only thing there to remind us we're not watching a stage play? Is it that John Dall and Farley Granger, but mostly Dall, unevenly bridge the gap between playing it straight and hamming it up? Is it Jimmy Stewart's self-righteous monologue at the end?If those are the reasons people give, then they must not get scared very easily. The performances and stage aspect are mere afterthoughts in this film, or at least should be. Although the acting isn't really that bada anyway, praticularly Granger) Certainly they're secondary to the great camera work and the unbearably creepy tension, set up as only the master can do it. Isn't it just like Hitchcock to have a conversation going on in the background but focus the camera on the housekeeper clearing the food off of a chest in which the murdered body has been deposited and then prepare to open the chest to put some books in it? Isn't it just like him to have Stewart question an increasingly nervous Granger as he plays the piano and one of those piano clock things ticks faster and faster, possibly leading to a confession from Granger? He even forces us to feel sympathy for two people who commit murder for fun and because they feel intellectualy superior, and succeeds pretty well. Those touches are further testament to the master's brilliance and knowhow at how to create suspense. If they sound cliched, they weren't then; he INVENTED those cliches, and even today they seem new and fresh in this film. There's also the fact that the movie is (supposed to be) filmed in real time. Yes, it's pretty obvious that cuts are being made whenever the camera pauses on someone's coat, but the shots of the sun slowly setting over the New York skyline as seen from the apartment window also do add clever commentary on the situations. (Bright when the murder's committed, clouded over before the party begins, slowly setting as the suspicion grows, etc.) This is a clever, highly suspenseful, creepy, and tense little film, and quintessential Hitchcock. It should be with his classics, and why it isn't is also a mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time James Stewart, John Dall and Farley Granger star in this film that it was originally based on the real-life Leopold Loeb's murder case. Dall and Granger appears as a couple of friends who murder one of there classmates (occurs at the very beginning of the film) because they think that they were superior and because they think that it will be some kind of an adventure. They arrange a party for the victim and invites his family, but he will never show up because he's dead and they hide it in a trunk which is on the middle of the living room where the guests are. But no one suspects except their college teacher (Stewart) who they consider as their highest inspiration. The plot is very good but turns boring sometimes. The film lacked commercial success in 1948 (the year of it original release). Considered as one of Hitchcock's minor works. I still enjoyed the movie as I think that Hitchcock's fans will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bold, Beautiful and Flawed Experiment by the Great Hitch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read numerous accounts on the making of Rope, most of them focusing on the "trick" of continuous filming using 8-10 minutes of uninterrupted film. (length of film varies according to different sources) But rarely do they focus on the final finished product. Does this film work??The answer in brief is Yes. Certainly, this film does NOT rate as one of Hitch's best, but it is interesting and definately worth seeing, especially if you're a film buff or Hitch fan. The acting is uniformly good (stagey, but good), with Constance Collier and Sir Cedric Hardwicke stand-outs (probably for their vast stage experience more than anything else). They both know how to work the camera and maintain the theatrical energy needed to sell this "film/play". James Stewart struggles valiantly with his miscast role, and succeeds. Dall and Granger are both good but rather hammy as the murderous gay couple. The rest of the cast are able but nothing extraordinary.The beauty of this film lies in it's dazzling camerawork (dazzling for being so restricted) and the mood set by the designers. (with the exception of the normally brilliant Adrian, what in the world is that ensemble that Joan Chandler wears???)The best scene for me was definately the housekeeper's (Edith Evanson) clearing of the party plates and candleabras, building the suspense to a great peak. I won't reveal what happens next, it is up to you movie lovers to find out. As for the goofs noted on imdb, Granger's cut hand remains cut during the following palm reading scene. Look closely, you will see that he cleans most of it off with the linen, and you can still see blood in the corner of his hand! Also, the only time the film is clearly edited is the first of many reaction shots of Stewart beginning to realize that a murder has taken place. This film would make a great evening of twisted gay killer movies, alongside "Compulsion" 1959 and "Swoon" 1992, all of them based loosely or directly on the famous Leopold and Loeb case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, unsettling, and underrated Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the IMDB, this wasn't one of Hitchcock's favorite movies, and is considered by many (perhaps even himself) to be an `experiment that failed.' I must disagree. I think I liked this better than any other Hitchcock movie I've seen.Where should I start? I guess the thing I loved the most was the long takes, but hey, I'm a sucker for long takes if they're done well. The thing I liked most about the recent film Snake Eyes was the opening shot that follows Nicholas Cage all over the place for the first 8-10 minutes or so. I love the beginning of The Player because it shows the busyness and interconnectedness of life at a Hollywood studio. I love the long takes here because they are largely responsible for the pervasive creepy tension and atmosphere of the film. We, the audience, are stuck in the apartment with the two murderers and the body for the entire movie. Since the location never changes, we learn the layout of the apartment, and come to know where everything is at all times, including the body. No matter where the shot takes us, we're always thinking about that body. We wonder whether someone will find it or not, who it will be, and even if the body is actually dead (perhaps I've seen too many horror flicks, but at times I wondered if the body would suddenly wake up and pop his head out of the chest/coffin).We also wonder where Philip is and what he is doing. Is he acting normally like Brandon, or is he still having a conscience attack and making everyone uncomfortable (including us!)? The whole effect is very claustrophobic, and it really forces the audience to identify with the characters and many of the emotions they are feeling. Our obsession with the body is surely shared by the anxious Philip, who is terrified of getting caught. Our concerns about Philip's behavior are shared by Brandon, who is surely worried that Philip will do something stupid enough that someone figures out what happened.A few parts really stand out in terms of effect. One is the part in which the maid is clearing off the chest after dinner. The camera shows her and the chest, but offscreen to the right the men are talking-either about David or something else, I can't remember. I think it's David. The tension created by this scene is incredible, for we know that once she finishes with the table, she might put the books back in and find the body. Another particularly effective part (I guess I can't say `scene,' can I?) is the very end. Hitchcock doesn't try to `enrich' it with dialogue; he simply lets the images and sounds speak for themselves.I will admit that some of the cuts were quite contrived, but I guess that's unavoidable. In a movie with 7 cuts connecting 8 extremely long takes, the cuts are bound to be relatively noticeable simply because of their rarity and the fact that we are looking for them. OK, maybe some people aren't actively looking for them, but I was. Anyway, we're so used to films with dozens or even hundreds of cuts that a movie like this really stands out. I don't know if there is any way for Hitch to make the cuts any smoother (i.e. without zooming in on Brandon's back or the chest), but for me the cuts were a bit of a distraction. One of the only things I don't like about the film.I wish more video stores carried Rope, because it is truly a fascinating movie that deserves study. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Alfred Hitchcock Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually better than most Hitchcock films. Usually, when I'm borrowing a Hitch movie I only watch up to his cameo. If I own it, I might watch the whole thing. I borrowed this movie to see Hitch's double cameo. When I heard the whole thing was in the apartment, I pretty much figured I'd only see Alfred than leave. You see, Hitch has 2 cameos. One is at the beggining, when he's walking in the street with a girl. Later his trademark (from his TV show) is flashing in red on a neon sign. (Some people argue that Alffy didn't appear at the beggining, I think so, or else he wouldn't have a shot of outside of the apartment). Up to then I thought it was an intruiging show, and I watched it. I loved it. The end was full of suspense, for the stranglers realized that it may have been easy to keep the guests OFF the trail, but when they were on it was hard to get them off. A must see for Hitchcock fans. I can't believe the master didn't like this. I wish I had more info on the true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just for the sake of killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hitchcock made this film in 1948, he was introducing a new concept of film making-one(at least to my knowledge)that hasn't been used since.Some criticized Hitchock for casting James Stewart in the role of Rupert Cadell-who has some bizarre ideas. Stewart is usually cast as a clean cut fella-lovable, warm, fuzzy type. But, putting stewart in such a role is one reason why this film has it effects on people-it makes you ask the question "How could this nice fellow talk this way?"But then, In the last ten minutes of this film-Stewart becomes very agonized over the ideas he taught the boys when they were in prep school when he sees the body of the man they killed at the beginning of this film. He gives them a lecture about how he has become ashamed of the ideas he held. He tells them that "No one has the right to take another life just because they believe that he is inferior"This is great film making from beginning to end. We get the message that all life is valuable.</fullReview>

The concept of the film being shot in real time with few cuts is effectively appealing and original. The cast are likewise in their roles, especially James Stewart. One problem I had: lack of character development of the victim. This is a must-see for film buffs, Hitchcock aficienadoes, and aspiring film-makers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rope is one of the better movies that I have added to my library. The first element that caught my attention was the setup. You are given the answer to the mystery at the beginning of the film, but it is one of the characters that has to reach the right conclusion. I had never heard of the Leopold and Loeb murder before, but once I did the concept seemed fascinating. The morbid touch of the location of the body was great.I enjoyed the work of the actors in this film. The most interesting portrayals are those of the murderer's themselves, especially the contrast in their personalities. Probably my favorite was that of Phillip. It makes you realize what it would be like if you ever decided to commit a crime where you were in extreme danger of getting caught. Brandon just seemed so hammy and obnoxious, but that was probably the intent of Hitchcock and the screenwriters so you would identify with Phillip. The comic relief was very effective too. My favorite was Mrs. Atwater and her ridiculous small talk about horoscopes and celebrities. Also funny, but extremely annoying was that of the landlady (housekeeper?) and her fussyness and not very well hid whispered comments. The only actor that really didn't cut it for me was Jimmy Stewart. He just seemed too out of place, especially as a socialite. His voice and mannerisms don't seem very realistic either, but maybe they were more common in the 40s and 50s. His righteous indignation at the end seems a little forced. I felt that he had done a good job in Vertigo, but in an alternate universe where someone else had taken the job, Vertigo would have been just as good and possibly even better.It would be impossible not to mention the camerawork. I remember scanning Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock, and he mentioned that Rope was a misguided, failed experiment. I disagree and even if the technique was a gimmick, it was effective. Implementing real time and a single set really places you right into the party yourself, especially the way the camera wanders off into the background giving us extra information. Its like you get to choose to ignore the main action and concentrate on the little things you find interesting yourself, much as in real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All About the Camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope" is, technically speaking, by far Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece. The fact that the movie is, as much as possible, one long shot, makes the camera-work and performances even more stunning. As a psychological drama, it's suspenseful, funny, and touching all at once. The script, taken from the play "Rope's End", is impeccable, but what truly makes it such a fantastic film is what Hitchcock added: the camera. In most movies, the camera is simply used to show you who's talking. But in "Rope", the camera plays possibly the most important part of the whole movie. Often, what the camera sees is much more important than who's talking or what they're saying. It's the camera that really lets you know what's going on. This is why "Rope" is such a joy to watch over and over; often what's happening in the background is just as or more important than what's in the foreground, and you have to see it more than once to catch every nuance. Not to mention that the subsequent staging and composition is just phenomenal. Add to that a couple of fantastic performances by James Stewart and Farley Granger, and you have an absolutely amazing film. I highly recommend "Rope" to anyone who loves film, and it's a must-see for anyone who is interested in the film-making process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As chilling as a proper martini...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and twice as evil. The attentive viewer of Rope can come away with many valuable party lessons. For instance, you should serve a dinner party out of the dining room, not the parlor. You should promptly introduce new guests and offer them a drink. Dead school chums are best kept out of sight under the serving table, et cetera.It's even still considered fashionable (see the 1948 edition of Heloise) to invite the parents of the freshly murdered over to feast off the cabinet that houses the corpse. But, under NO circumstances whatsoever can you invite Jimmy Stewart and expect him to not get wise to your murderous shenanigans. He is simply too much THE MAN. Consider the case of Hitchcock's masterful "Rope". Watching Stewart pick apart the sinister "experiment" that poor Brandon and unfortunate Philip stage is, quite simply, one of the coolest cinematic experiences a person could hope for. As a party guest attending a murder deliciously disguised as a dinner party, his performance is awe-striking. His Rupert Cadell suspects the party treachery like a raptor spotting the squirming mouse from a mile away. With the exactness of a latter-day Sherlock Holmes, he wears down the false party faces of his former students and learns that they've taken a harmless academic notion he expressed in the past to a horrific extreme. In a great scene, Rupert delicately balances a plate of hors d'oeuvres on his lap while expounding on his theory of "artful murder." He suggests that murder should be applied as a kind of social science by the privileged and intellectual few. He describes how the turn of a knife or a well-placed bullet can dispense with the offending waiter or doorman, so that the civilized people can step over the bodies and be on their rightful way. Now, make no mistake, Rupert is a gentleman-- even if he does revel in gently shocking stuffy society types with his ink-black sense of humor. But it is an extension of his rapier wit, no more. Brandon, on the other hand, is unable to accept Rupert's ruse as anything but philosophical fact. Esteeming the old housemaster as he does, he nurtures Rupert's black kernel of humor until it grows into a towering superman complex, and with the help of Philip, serves up its' ghastly fruit at a dinner that would make Greek tragedy proud. As the cocktails flow, so do the suspicions of the partygoers rise. Philip begins to sweat guilt at Rupert's prying questions, and sickly suave Brandon tries to hold the caper together with diversions and a Cheshire grin. That is, until even his wicked conviction becomes unraveled like so much... (see title).Film students! Do you find that your curricular dining table lacks this Hitchcock chef d'oeuvre? Proceed then to bind and gag your questionable instructor until he includes Rope in your intellectual fondue-pot. If there is a movie whose mechanics and thematic subtleties are enriched through thoughtful discussion and careful viewing, it is this Hitchcockian masterpiece. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See This One with 'Compulsion'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No better way to compare Hitchcock with Orson Welles. Genius on both sides. The leering, sociopathic Loeb is emphasized in both movies, while the introverted, sexually ambivalent, hero-worshipping Leopold is done well by Farley Granger in this one. Also, for another comparison, read "Life Plus 99 Years" written by Leopold in 1957. He refused to go into his early life, which would have been a contribution to mankind in this day of almost continual random killings by young people. The lack of parental involvement in the young boys' lives is hardly hinted at in 'Rope'. Instead, you are more aware of the interaction between James Stewart, the friend both boys look up to. A much more subtle homosexual attraction is demonstrated.The movie itself is a stage set, since we never leave the apartment of the boys, who are preparing a dinner party. For kicks, the body is present in a trunk throughout the party. And instead of the boy being a 14 year old school friend of the Leopold character's brother, it is a fraternity 'pal' of theirs. Was this to soften the horror of it?I frankly found this version somewhat less chilling, less realistic than 'Compulsion'. I believe I spied Hitchcock in this one, as he usually inserted himself as an extra somewhere and this time, in an apartment building hall, was no exception.You will probably also enjoy this one more if you also follow it with 'Marnie' or one of Hitchcock other mysteries....ferreting out the similarities and differences. (Great English assignment, right?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rope, the cordon of conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope" succeeds for me as an example of the "birthday suit complex," that is, the desire in each of us to reveal ourselves eventually in as complete a manner as possible. Especially in the case of crime, the toll in lost human-heartedness is hard to endure, and eventually it overcomes all fear of detection. The strong homosexual subtext suggests that the two students murdered David Kentley because he had first accepted and then rejected one or both of them in favor of women. The chilling revelations we witness in the opening scenes makes us ache for some kind of sincere human contact. Even the daffy Mrs Atwater, a frumpish, would-be urbanite from the suburbs, is a welcome presence in this context. In fact the liberating pity we feel for David's surviving friends and relatives is one of the chief payoffs of this film.Besides its famous experimental camera work, "Rope" boasts a fabulous scale model of the New York skyline, plainly visible through the picture window in the living room of the apartment. During the lengthy takes it progresses from afternoon through a colorful sunset into a busy evening, a sort of Greek chorus to the sociopathic melodrama unfolding in the foreground. With all their fatuous talk about supermen, how tall would these young men stand among those skyscrapers, or their teacher Rupert Cadell, for that matter? Arrogant academic escapists, they have never allowed the real world to cut them down to size.The film has a realistic look close to high-quality television. Under the unflinching gaze of the camera all pretense withers until the guests become as uncomfortably honest as their hosts are uncomfortably deceptive. See "Rope" to find out how this strong dramatic tension resolves itself. Then see the semi-sequal "Compulsion" by Orson Welles. The personalities of the murderers are detestably similar in both films, yet the lawyer Welles plays (Clarence Darrow) gives such a brilliant peroration that you just may be won over full well knowing they deserve to hang!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of the fact that all of this movie takes place in one apartment, "Rope" is still a very fascinating and engrossing movie. It plays in real time and Hitchcock has gone through great effort to make the audience believe that it is shot in one single shot. Naturally, we notice where the scenes have been edited together, but it still gives the impression of a single shot and naturally supports the fact that it is set in real time.What's best about this movie is James Stewart -- I was completely mesmerized by his performance. Also, the plot is very interesting.Hitchcock also succeeds in making a *good* theatrical film. Some films with too much theatrical feeling to it can be boring; it feels as if the director does not use the medium the right way. However, Roman Polanski's brilliant "Death and the Maiden" has proved that theatrical movies can be really good. "Rope" is also a very good theatrical film. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No gimmick here... just effective filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree totally with the first reviewer. I'm tired of people using the work "gimmick" when describing this film. I consider Rope to rank up there with Hitch's best, including Rear Window (which some people may also consider a "gimmicky" film). I think most people are missing the fact that this film simply couldn't have been filmed any other way... if this film was made in a "normal" way, it wouldn't be nearly as effective. Hitch simply just found the most effective way in building the suspense and mood of the film. Cuts and edits would ruin the suspense and tension that the plot demanded... by using continuous takes Hitch makes you feel like an observer of the party... and the frame purposely limits you to what you can see or hear. Edits would also disturb the feeling of real time in which the story took place in.Besides, if experiments were never used in film, we would never progress the art.... Remember, it's not a "gimmick" if it works... and it certainly does work in Rope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precision filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is an eighty-minute waltz, with the camera dancing cheek-to-cheek with a provocative story of cold-blooded murder. The gimmick of filming the movie in one fluid shot in real-time puts extra burden on the actors and on Hitchcock to tell the story effectively without editing as a narrative device. And they all perform their tasks with resounding success. The lack of cuts takes away from several key reaction shots and such cinematic qualities as pacing and rhythm, but it accentuates the dialogue, which mimics the fluidity of action Hitchcock seemed to be going for.There is a keen sense of space at work, with the camera slowly bringing us into contact with the various areas of the apartment in which the film is set. The camera frame isolates the characters, making us voyeurs on their intimate conversations. It moves about like a silent accomplice to the murder and the events proceeding it. The characters and situations are placed in front of us, forcing us to deal with them whether we want to or not--the dissolve or fade out won't save us this time.All of it is executed with the utmost precision and skill of all involved. Although the film isn't necessarily cinematic, it does what many other films fail to do: tell its story effectively. And in that respect, Rope fulfills one of the basic purposes of the medium of film.</fullReview>

They sling David's body inside a chest and throw a party where guests are served food from the chest that contains his body. In a further sick move, David's girlfriend Janet (Joan Chandler) and his father Henry (Cedric Hardwicke) are amongst the guests who are invited, along with old school teacher Rupert (James Stewart). It is Rupert who begins to suspect something is not right and he returns when the party has finished to confront his fears.This is a colourful film that has a 1960's look/feel to it. The story has a sick premise and we wonder if John Dall and Farley Granger will get caught. There are good scenes, eg, the maid clearing away the food from the chest and the moment when James Stewart is given the dead man's hat by mistake, as well as the climax when Stewart returns to the party. There is also some very funny dialogue as John Dall really pushes the boundaries of indecency with his quips and topics of conversation.The cast are all good with the exception of Granger. James Stewart raises the dramatic bar as he pries into events and Dall makes a very good psychopath. However, Granger is a complete muppet. He is incredibly unbelievable in everything he does - very staged and his performance is poor. Not only does he not have the character to have even undergone such an act in the first place, but he is also sooooo obviously guilty of something.I forgot to look out for Hitchcock's usual appearance so I'll save that game for a later viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Implication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is one of Hitchcock's most dignified achievements. It is about two clever young aesthetes, Brandon and Phillip, going through with their plan to murder former classmate David Kentley in their classy apartment, but that is what happens in the opening seconds following the opening credits. As they await guests for a party, and as those guests eventually intermingle, we find a dramatic story about ideology and the power it has on certain minds in every generation in every possible form. Just after the murder, which is the film's capital letter in a literary analogy, Brandon, played by John Dall, delivers a great monologue about why they killed him, trying to open the champagne. As powerful as he feels, we believe that he is, but that feeling seems to us more and more hollow as we see how important his need is to commune and communicate his wit and nerve to circles of friends and associates."All beings so far have created something beyond themselves," Nietzsche asserted. In the case of the human, there are many creations that have transcended normative thought and manifestation. By that notion, it could be posited that a being creates something in an endeavor to be transcendent, even a superbeing. If one believes art elevates the artist, does the art of murder elevate the murderer to the same degree of superior being?Brandon's inspiration for the murder was rooted years earlier by discourse with his and Phillip's old prep-school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell, played by James Stewart as a solid, traditional pillar of society, not exactly a stretch for him. While at school, Rupert had reviewed with them, in a seemingly partial manner, the theoretical writings of Nietzsche's Übermensch and the art of murder, an instrument for showing one's superiority over others. He too is among the guests at the party, as Brandon chiefly feels that he would very likely admire their artwork.Nietzsche introduced the abstraction of the Superman in comparison to the entrancing mysticism of Christianity, expounding the Superman to be the meaning of the earth and warns his followings to avoid those who promise supernatural rewards in order to wile them away from the earth. The turn away from the earth is incited, according to him, by a discomfort with life, a perceived hopelessness that compels one to create another world in which those who made one unhappy in this life are oppressed. The Superman is not driven into other worlds away from this one. Thus Brandon, his sense of self inflated to invincible superiority amongst his peers, can never be a Superman.Whether or not Nietzsche is misinterpreted, Brandon's reading of him is the response of an insatiable ego. Once the ego believes one has the entitlement of the Superman, the goal Nietzsche famously claimed humanity should set for itself, one's only distinguishing power is to justify anything. But the ego wants recognition. And that is very dangerous in their case. Neither the script nor Hitchcock's astute direction demonstrate whatever partiality they might have to certain views of Nietzsche's notions, but the nerve-shredding final scene is arguably the speculative voice of Nietzsche's reaction to Brandon's reading, or perhaps his own put into practice.Indeed, the film is a masterpiece of implication, the psychological underscoring of everything from sex and violence to the realities denied by the day's social moors. Hitchcock, who truly was not fooled by the production code of his time, not for a second, made Rope, a film saturated in homoerotic elements, in 1949. And yet, it is not saturated by what he adds, but what he doesn't. As the diagetic music, played by Phillip on his piano, by Poulenc, a homosexual, sneaks in and out of the soundtrack, screenwriter Arthur Laurents, who himself was gay, gives no manifestation that Brandon and Phillip live apart. Phillip, played by Farley Granger, who was bisexual in real life, even has a key of his own to Brandon's apartment, and near the end they mention going away together for a holiday. At one point, when a guest asks where the telephone is, Brandon, played by John Dall, who was gay in real life, says "It's in the bedroom." The? Not "my" or "his" or "the second"? The guest's response: "How cozy!"This was not showing off; this was in no way arbitrary. The closer Brandon and Phillip, the more intensely their dynamic is affected by what they've done. We begin to see how they respectively augment and diminish through the dialogue's nuances, as Brandon constantly speaks for Phillip. Granger plays Phillip with his trademark a youthful, direct manner that sees what it wants and generally goes for it, but is repressed and intensely self-protective. And his restless and inescapable suffering is compelling.Hitchcock has a complete subjective grasp of the material, including its special little ambivalences. So subjective indeed that the entire film is made up of a mere ten shots, ten long, roving, dollying, tracking, masked, unmasked, painstakingly detailed takes. That material, initially a play by Patrick Hamilton, is like a metaphor for death, dissolution, even the lively Technicolor party scenes feeling ironically primordial. It is the manifest dream state in which such philosophical abstractions as those questioned here seem so whole and real, and as the actions within it gestate in real time, reality leaves our characters naked.</fullReview>

Hitchcock wasn't one to paint by the numbers and "Rope" shows it well. The movie begins with the murder and then goes on to far more unsettling events as the perpetrators attempt to proceed with the plan of having a party immediately after committing the "perfect crime".Watching this movie is a pleasure and far more thrilling than many of the modern ones with all the camera tricks and characters with no connection killing each other.

However, Hitchcock fumbles an experiment he should have abandoned early and pulls an otherwise excellent film down to merely good status.The film is about a male couple in New York who, inspired by the philosophical teachings of an old professor of theirs, decide to commit the perfect murder and, as if that weren't enough, invite over close friends of the victim, his family, and said professor essentially to flout their crime. However, that interesting concept is severely damaged by Hitchcock's apparently last-minute decision to open the film with the murder. We are immediately placed in a position, knowing that our main characters are thrill killers, to either detach from the suspense of the upcoming cat-and-mouse game or to throw our sympathies along with these unsavory types. Seeing Phillip's conscience get to him is probably intended to push us into the second category, but the extraordinary coldness of his companion, Brandon (John Dall) makes that identification nearly impossible.Understandably, Hitchcock considered this an ideal project for a challenge at which he took many shots throughout his career: filming in a restricted location. Since the grisly dinner party in this apartment simply drips with tension, that instinct isn't what failed Hitchcock. However, he also decided to film as closely as possible to a single take, using only one camera and only cutting or wiping in order to change film rolls. However, this need to change rolls leads to some extraordinarily heavy-handed dark screen wipes that almost feel like commercial breaks and the single camera limits the angular possibilities unnecessarily. The strongest experiments with limited sets (Hitchcock's own "Rear Window," Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men") have always used the tricks available to the director to make the film's look continue to vary in spite of the setting and have always ended with a relief of that confinement, but Hitchcock does neither. Indeed, the confinement is never even felt, because there is hardly a suggestion of any life beyond the windows of this apartment. Hitchcock essentially ends up with, instead of an interesting new film, an entirely un-cinematic one.The filming technique also places extreme demands on the actors, who (thankfully) largely perform up to the task. John Dall is especially powerful, alternately alarmingly cold and incredibly charming and managing to make the film seem far more real for his presence. Meanwhile, Farley Granger is stiff and uneven in his performance. However, the real damage to the film is given by James Stewart. He seems to have absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the set, which essentially destroys part of the purpose of his character (to provide an alternate, non-evil homosexual model) and turns him into a sort of outsider detective. Taken as a detective role, Stewart's performance is definitely credible, but it appears that he is either incapable or unwilling to perform the role as intended. However, the caliber of the minor performances is high enough to largely overcome those weaknesses.Overall, "Rope" is a very watchable and somewhat fun film, but it never reaches the stratosphere of some of Hitchcock's best work ("Psycho," "Rear Window," "North by Northwest," "Spellbound," etc.) because he made a poor decision in attempting to turn what should have been a film into a play. It's worth watching once, but not more than that, which is a shame since by any reasonable estimation it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rope a' dope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Feeling that their what German philosopher Fredrick Nietzdche described as being "Intellectual Supermen" Brandon, John Dall, and his little chicken sh*t partner in crime Phillip, Farley Granger, get unsuspecting David, Dick Hogan, alone in Brandon's apartment. After giving him a drink and having David let his guard down Phillip strangled him to death. These two pompous and murderous a**es felt that David was not worthy to live since he's wasn't like they are, Brandon &amp; Phllip, men of both tremendous power and influence as well as intellect.The fact that David, whom Brandon and Phillip feel vastly superior to, is an undergraduate of Harvard shows just what these two crumbs think of the rest of us lowly peons who aren't as well bread and educated,in what high paying jobs we can hold down and how we're able to express ourselves both properly and grammatically, as these spoiled brats are.Trying to put their theory, in how smart and invincible that they are, into practice Brandon and Phillip not only murder the innocent and decent David but dump his body inside a trunk. It's from that trunk that Brandon will be serving food and drinks to a number of friends and acquaintances that he invited over, whom the late David was one of them, at a private party that he's throwing at his pad, that has a breath-taking view of the Manhattan skyline, that afternoon!Even though Phillip is so guilt ridden in him being found, not in participating, out in David's murder Brandon is as cool as a cucumber. As the party goes on, with David unexpectedly not showing up, it begins to look for a moment that the two will get away Scot-free in committing the perfect murder! It's not until Brandon &amp; Phillips former college headmaster Rupert Cordell, James Stewart, shows up at the party that things, as well as their nerves, starts quickly unraveling for the two murderers.Sensing that something just isn't, besides the cold cuts, kosher Rupert zeros in on an almost pi**ing in his pants. Phillip who's actions are so strange and bizarre, whenever anyone mentions David's name, that it's very obvious to Rupert that David is not just late for the party but he may very well have been a victim of a crime or accident on his way there. With the party finally over and Brandon &amp; Phillip feeling that they not only committed the perfect murder, in order to prove their superiority to everyone that was there. Ready to dispose of the body Rupert unexpectedly shows up looking for his gold cigarette case! The cigarette case that he purposely left on the trunk where David's body was hidden!Learning the hard way that being smart privileged and highly educated doesn't mean that your entitled to do anything that you want, including murdering, to those that you consider not to be as "great and wonderful" as you are. Both Brandon &amp; Phillip are now left to face the music, and electric chair, for the crime that they so smugly and arrogantly committed and thought that they could both get away with. Yes most of us will not be as privileged and educated as both Brandon &amp; Phillip were in the movie but we all have the same rights as they do in life liberty and the pursuit of our own happiness, so long as it doesn't infringe on anyone else's. This is what these two arrogant and self-assured psychos are going to learn very soon as they stand trial for murder. What Brandon and Phillip think about themselves is their, and one one else's, business but when they try to act out their sick and perverted fantasies like murdering David, or someone else, it's the business of all the people, rich poor highly educated and not educated at all. It's the people, most of whom who don't live up to these two lunatics high standers, who in the end will judge them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre and morbid film from Hitchcock that succeeds to entertain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Marnie," "Rope" belongs to the dark world of Hitchcock?this time dealing with eugenics of the Nietzsche, superiority of one group of individuals over another group, "killing for the sake of killing," with bizarre touches of serving food on a "coffin." One can argue that this is not Hitchcock at work but the work of the writers?playwright Patrick Hamilton, actor turned novice screenplay writer Hume Cronyn and of course Ben Hecht. As I have not read the original play, I cannot guess how much was Hitchcock's contribution to the morbidity and various dark undercurrents, which included the aura of homosexuality. Equally inexplicable is the relationship between James Stewart's character and the housemaid.A good play is a boon for actors?they often get great lines to speak. Stewart et al. appear to give superb performances. But then Burtons gave an outstanding performance in Albee's "Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and Olivier and Caine captivated us in Schaffer's "Sleuth."If we leave the script behind and assess the cinema: the film offers considerable touches of innovation. For me, the finest scene in the film is when Jimmy Stewart is handed the hat of the missing/dead invitee as he prepares to leave the apartment. The innovative method employed by Hitchcock for changing scenes by obstructing the camera view with the back of various characters is captivating. Hitchcock loved to involve food and drinks in his films?but serving food on a box containing a dead person was incredibly morbid. Hitchcock also uses his technique of capturing conversations silently: the conversation of Stewart and the housekeeper slowly becomes silent for the viewer even when they are talking. Hitchcock did this trick in the court scenes of "Notorious" and "Frenzy" and the flower shop scene in "Topaz." He loved to repeat his own tricks, film after film.There is humor in this film. The banter about movies where the names of the films are forgotten and replaced by the word "Something" includes indirect reference to "Notorious" without mentioning the name but mentioning the names of the stars and the number of words in the title.Structurally the film is a delight for students of cinema. It follows the "Columbo" pattern?the murderer/s is/are known early in the film to the viewer; what follows is the unraveling of the past and identification of the murderer by others. The film is an interesting work but not one of Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to enjoy and admire in Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film "Rope". Starring Farley Granger, Jimmy Stewart and John Dall, the plot is loosely based on Chicago's Leopold and Loeb thrill-killing case. Phillip (Granger) and Brandon (Dall) decide to murder their friend David in order to commit the "perfect murder". After strangling David in their apartment, they place his body in a trunk that sits in the living room until they leave for a planned vacation that evening. Before they do, however, they decide to entertain some dinner guests ? David's father, aunt, fiancée, his fiancées former lover (and friend of theirs), and their headmaster from their old prep school, Rupert (Stewart). The party members sit in the living room and entertain one another, not realizing that the guest of honor that they are waiting for is actually lying dead mere feet from them. Tensions rise as the two killers try to maintain their cool to pull off their scheme, all the while trying to dodge the suspicions of their revered headmaster.Macabre? Absolutely. "Rope" is a deliciously wicked film. It is one of the few Hitchcock films that illicit many laughs with its darkly humorous script. It is also a great suspense film, however; one is so astounded as to the lengths these two will go, (actually serving dinner from the top of the trunk where David's body lies) that it is almost natural to root for them to see how far this scheme will go, and if it will succeed. Stewart is fantastic as the brilliant, sardonic and dark Rupert ? a man who ends up learning a lot about himself on this fateful evening. John Dall is uncompromising in his smugness, and Farley Granger, a great underexposed actor, shines as the fragile half of the duo. Even above these excellent attributes of the film is the production itself. Hitchcock filmed "Rope" in near real-time, employing 8 minute takes (the most film the camera could use before running out), so the film has a more intimate feeling, and of course, in an era of quick cuts and edits, actual long takes are for the most part, an unfortunate relic of the past. While watching the film, pay attention to the expert blocking of the scenes as a result of the long takes. It is amazing to watch the ingenious manner in which Hitchcock keeps the action going ? for example, if the camera is focused on Stewart, instead of swinging around awkwardly to face the next person who will be talking, Stewart simply stands up and walks toward the direction of the next speaker. It is exquisite film-making.For a film that takes place in three rooms of an apartment, featuring nine actors (one of whom has about ten seconds of screen time) and is essentially done in real-time, "Rope" is a powerful and masterful film made by The Master himself. "Rope" has always been one of those "Oh yeah? THAT film" kind of films that a lot of people have heard of but have rarely seen. If you are one of those people, make it your mission to see this one. It remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films, even with its highly competitive siblings. 9/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but flawed film with a strangely haunting subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Rope several times and like it more and more each time. It is a film which is at the same time brilliant and flawed. I see in it two stories, on one hand the surface story based on Patrick Hamilton's interpretation of the Leopold and Loeb case which comes across now as a slightly outdated and banal interpretation of Nietzsche's concept of the superman and its dangerous influence, with the conclusion that young men should keep away from dangerous philosophers. Not a very exciting story. On the other hand we have the homo- erotic subtext which is much more compelling: two young men doing something that society regards as indecent and immoral (murder standing in for sexual relations between men) but which they themselves see as perfectly alright. The film does not concentrate on the murder, rather on their status as disguised and haunted outlaws and deviants, pleasant young bourgeois men on the surface but underneath not only dangerous but also hunted and awaiting exposure. The atmosphere is strangely claustrophobic and the two young leads feel real (if the homo-erotic subplot is considered, the actors were almost portraying themselves). I also find interesting how the script portrays Brandon as the leader who is strong and aggressive and dangerous, but the images tell perhaps a different story, it is the supposedly weak and gentle artist Philip who is not only the actual strangler but the camera repeatedly focuses on his hands and thus, even though beautiful and artistic and seems consumed by fear and guilt (as in the 'chicken strangling' scene), and perhaps more sympathetic precisely because he is on the point of breaking down and starting to drink, this character is suggestive of the equally gentle but dangerous Norman Bates in Hitchcock's later film. In spite of this strong subtext and excellent job by most of the actors (not mentioning the camera work and the intriguing script), James Stewart is miscast, Hitchcock would later learn to use him extremely effectively but this film might have been better served with Cary Grant (originally offered the role) or James Mason or perhaps even George Sanders or Charles Laughton. Stewart, a fine actor as he is, lacks the sinister dimension the teacher would need to have to have had this influence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece tight rope of suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pure amazing intriguing masterpiece from legendary director Alfred Hitchcock. Rope is Hitchcock's first color film, taking place in real time and being edited so as to appear as a single continuous shot through the use of long takes. The movie also deals with one settling: the room in which, murder has happen. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's stage play, Rope's End. The story is loosely inspired by the Leopold-Loeb case of 1924, where the two were motivated to murder a boy name Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime. This story follows, a similar plot, it concerns two implicitly homosexual brilliant young college students who strangle to death a former classmate, David Kentley (Dick Hogan) not only to commit a crime, but also try to get away of it. In their own twisted way, they wanted to risk getting catch, for the thrill, by hiding the body in an antique chest in the middle of their posh apartment, then perversely arrange to hold a dinner party around the chest, inviting the victim's family, friends and David's fiancée Janet (Joan Chandler), as well as their intellectual role-model Stewart. John Dall was brilliant in his role as Brandon Shaw. Reminds me a bit of Victor Price in a way. The way Joan Chandler and John Dall played off each other with perfect timing and grace. Dall with his slight stammer and superb sinister smirk was amazing. Farley Granger as Phillip Morgan was also great. The imperceptible movements of eyes or facial muscles when fear of getting discovered by their teacher Rupert Cadall was great. I love that moment when the maid is clearing off the top of the chest; that scene is one of the most tense moments in all of that film. Sadly the movie's suspense is a little bit cut away, due to Alfred Hitchcock showing in the first few frames of film, the two killing David. It would have work better, if we don't know if there is a body or not in the chest. James Stewart was great as the Nietzschean philosophy teacher that serve as the boy's mentor. Rupert believes that murder is an art where a selected few feels justified due to the concept of the "übermensch" or "superman". Those who believe in the concepts of right and wrong and behave accordingly are deemed inferior beings and therefore unnecessary. While those who are enlightened enough to realize that one is free to act according to their own volition because there are no such primitive or external constraints on behavior are deemed superior. In this worldview, homicide is justifiable because the intellectually superior are actually bettering society by eliminating the inferior and their drain on its resources. In a way, Professor Cadell is no better than the two, because he taught Phillip and Brandon these nihilistic concepts to begins with. It's only when he believes to suspect that they practiced what he preached that he sees his wrongs. I think it's a bit too dark of a character for James Stewart to act, and that's probably why not a lot of people went to see this movie when it came out. I doubt a lot of people want to see James Stewart in this role. I know Hitchcock wanted Cary Grant at first, but I really don't see him in the character. Hitchcock's second choice, James Mason would fit perfect. I like how Alfred Hitchcock add dialogue talking about his choice in actors in the film. Still, James Stewart works with what he got, and added a sense of humor and charm to the character. The screenplay by Arthur Laurents is witty, and great. The dialogue is full of cleaver puns, and sayings. The killers make snippy, veiled comments about their deed, never going so far as to reveal the existence of the body nor their involvement in the murder. A lot of people didn't see it because of the homosexual tension. I have to say this movie, this movie pretty much limited the homosexual subtext to the point, that it's nearly impossible to notice. The camera work is astounding as he abandon many standard film techniques to allow for the long unbroken scenes. Each shot ran continuously for up to ten minutes without interruption. It was shot on a single set, aside from the opening establishing shot street scene under the credits. Camera moves were carefully planned and there was almost no editing. Every other segment ends by panning against or tracking into an object, the back of a piece of furniture or a man's jacket blocking the entire screen, for example. In this way, Hitchcock effectively masked half the cuts in the film. The extraordinary cyclorama of the city in the background of the apartment was interesting. The color lighting differs as sunset slowly unfolds as the movie progresses. Within the course of the film the clouds made of spun glass change position and shape eight times. Sometimes it can be staginess due to it being compensated for with tricks of some kind, but this movie was constrained by having to change reels or the length of the movie reels, since it was filmed in real and reel time. So it can be a bit annoying. It's not like knotty mess like some people view it. For me I love the film. It had many good elements that I really liked. I thought the character development was very good, and it did become more and more suspenseful all the way until the end. Also it's has the Hitchcock's cameo in the beginning. So check it out, and learn the ropes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh...there's the Hitchcock brilliance I've been hearing about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a recent fascination with Jimmy Stewart I've been powering through some old classic films like never before and that includes seeing two Alfred Hitchcock films, something I have never really seen before except Psycho years ago and same with Rear Window. I had no idea what Rope was even about and as of yet I was not understanding the brilliance that is Hitchcock. Well consider Rope me finally understanding. Rope is this brilliant, twisted, bright, deceptive murder mystery unlike any other. It plays out like a stage play in a small apartment overlooking this beautiful and haunting New York skyline. There is as much going on outside those windows as there is in the apartment. The murder and subsequent dinner party is so twisting and disturbing and edgy and riveting that you won't be able to tear your eyes away from this group of people, especially the two masterminds of the crime. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film that is so obviously made for the stage or would translate so well to stage. The undertones of the film, the little quirks in the personalities of the cast is just brilliant. This is the ultimate mystery thriller with very little thrills. Its all a character study and a brilliant one at that.Our two murderers are Brandon and Phillip. Brandon is played absolutely brilliantly by John Dall. His character is so brilliant I can't even speak highly enough about her performance. This character is so likable and charismatic and yet you just watched him murder his friend in an attempt to create the perfect crime. He's a complete sociopath and you can see it in the performance. Farley Granger is also very good as the "follower" of the two of them. He's paranoid and nervous and clearly under the spell of Brandon's fast talking charismatic personality. He is excellent in his role and the two of them play off of each other just right. Enter the incomparable James Stewart in a role he apparently always felt he was wrong for and didn't like and go figure because I thought he absolutely nailed it. His class and charisma makes his role as the impromptu detective fun, interesting, and believable. The best scenes are between Stewart, Dall, and Granger at the dinner party. The script is simply brilliant and the dialogue is outstanding. The supporting cast members are all good but have small, yet important roles. I thought Douglas Dick and Joan Chandler were particularly good in their roles as former lovers that Brandon is trying to manipulate to go with his murder game.Rope is of course famous for only have ten takes in the entire film. Its interesting for certain but realistically the average film goer might barely notice it except to think the film is shot differently. I think the brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock's direction in Rope is in the details. The inflections in the characters, the setting and the way the apartment is laid out and the sprawling city behind them, the flashing neon at the end when Stewart confronts the two men...I could go on. The homosexual innuendos in the film is certainly heavy. I can see why people saw that and were offended by it (in the 40's). Nowadays looking at it from a more accepting frame of mind you really see the sort of ambiguous relationship they created between Brandon and Phillip. It has no bearing on the story, its only interesting being such a big undertone in a film from the 40's. Rope was brilliant and I loved every minute of it. I am more excited now to see more Hitchcock but sad because I have no more Stewart/Hitchcock collaborations left to watch. A must see!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting Hitchcock film, great score, brilliant Stewart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope certainly was a very interesting Hitchcock film. However, I don't consider it his best or one of his best, as it is too short, and as Phillip Farley Granger is a little on the weak side, I much preferred him in Strangers on a Train. Flaws aside, it moves along quickly, is very well made, with a great setting and the clever use of continuous long takes(one of the film's main interests). Also the score is absolutely great, it really adds to the suspenseful atmosphere, as does the cunning direction and well-crafted dialogue. Other than Granger, the other performances are very, very good. John Dall is amazing as Brandon, really chilling in the role of who I consider the more fascinating of the two men. Cedric Hardwicke, who was also in Suspicion 7 years previous and played Frollo so memorably in the 1939 version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, is decent as Mr Kentley, and Joan Chandler is very good as Janet. But the best performance comes from James Stewart, while he has been better and he generously underplays as well in comparison to his other film roles, he was very cold, cynical and clever and his brilliant performance reflects those character traits. Overall, interesting and well made Hitchcock film, if not his best. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Values" have Consequences in ROPE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does this film seem improbable to you? Too contrived? Too unreal that two young modern American men, highly gifted and educated, with plenty of money, would just murder for the "fun" of it???I live a few miles south of Hammond, IL -near Wolf Lake, where the real life victim of Leopold and Loeb was dumped. (Leopold &amp; Loeb were the famous real life 1920's brilliant but extremely amoral men who were the models for the film's 2 young murderers).Some people will get tangled up in a side issue---the implied homosexuality of the film characters. (The real life Leopold and Loeb were a homosexual couple.) But they miss the large, central point. The elephant in the room.As we think, so we become...Thoughts lead to actions!The professor (played well by Jimmy Stewart)comes to realize that his amoral Nietzchean philosophy -- essentially that the strong &amp; smart can do what they like with the weak and "inferior"---i.e. an Americanized version of the then-recent Nazi superman ideology, is practiced by the young men (John Dasll and Farley Granger). And he taught these 2 this "superman" philosophy!!!who murder an acquaintance "just for the experience".The film has relevance today as some say that we are moving to use the weak for our own purposes, for instance...Some advocate creating fetuses to dissect for "parts" so to speak; others want euthanasia pushed as an option for the old, the weak, the depressed, others who are not "fully productive" as in the famous Netherlands euthanasia practices. Shades of Dr. Mengele and the "Master Race" practices!This film is suitable for older grade school on up viewing and would be a great discussion starter on the importance of values in society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Hitchcock Shocker -- Based on 1920s Leopold/Loeb Murder Trial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for eight (the guest of honor won't be joining the party). A gathering of former Ivy League chums, a girl they rivaled over, a highly admired former Professor all were acquainted with, a chatty maid, the father and aunt of a strangely absent guest of honor all gather for clever conversation and intriguing food and drink. The setting is typical Hitchcock, as is the twisted murder plot. The scene opens with the evil deed, then resumes with the imminent dinner.Hitchcocks first ever color production, "Rope" was shot in very long scenes (some lasting more than 10 minutes in a single frame), the film appears like a theatre play. Similarities to the infamous 1920s high profile Leopold-Loeb murder case are obvious but denied by a disclaimer at the end of the film.This is an undeniably "different" and very interesting Hitchcock Classic. James Stewart (pretty much playing himself, as usual), is effective as the "master detective", determined to get to the bottom of what's going on. A very young Farley Granger is great as the "frightened kid" under the thumb of his dominating older brother. For fans of the Master, this is an enjoyable trip into the exploration of some very disturbed minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if only James Mason had played Rupert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is a good film, and others have already written about most of its merits and flaws, so I'll keep my comments to the casting. Originally, Hitchcock wanted James Mason, rather than Jimmy Stewart, to play the role of Rupert; however, the role ultimately went to Stewart instead. Stewart's Rupert really obscures the homosexual sub-text of the plot--Rupert is supposed to have had a sexual relationship with Brandon, and this in part is the source of Brandon's hero-worship of Rupert. Mason as Rupert would've been able and willing to imply this relationship; however, Jimmy Stewart in no way gives the impression that he has any homosexual tendencies, whatsoever. Stewart's performance is admirable, but imagining Mason in that role leads me to believe that Hitchcock missed an opportunity to make an undeniably great film that dared to portray homosexual characters as fully human (flawed and capable of evil) rather than cardboard cut-out heroes or villains. With Stewart as Rupert, even the apparently sexual relationship between the two young men is so sublimated that viewers can miss it entirely if they don't know the story on which the film is based.All of this information is available in the interviews on the excellent Universal DVD release--I still love the film, but will always wish Hitchcock had cast Mason rather than Stweart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not wholly successful after a reasonable start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To experience how it feels, flatmates Brandon and Phillip murder one of their friends, David by strangling him with a bit of rope. To flaunt their intellectual superiority over their friends, the two decide to throw a party in their front room while David lies dead in a chest in the centre of the room. Using the chest as a serving surface for the food, Brandon gleefully drops morbid clues throughout the night and he is pleased as all the guests leave none the wiser. With Phillip's nerves totally frayed, Brandon rests on his laurels - until the pairs' old school master Rupert returns to find a misplaced cigarette case.It has been many years since I first saw this film and I could barely remember what I thought about it and thus decided to watch it again last week. From the start of the film things look good as it appears to be setting up an excellent cat and mouse game. However after the party things fail to really ignite in the way that they needed to and the end result is a rather wordy story that fails to create genuine tension. This is a real shame as the potential was definitely there from the party scene. Part of the problem may have been that Hitchcock was more concerned about the technical aspect of the film than the script. This is not to downplay the wonderful effect of the long shots he uses and the way that he moves the camera around the set with ease and fluidity but such attention should have been put on the other aspects as well.I understand what Hitchcock was trying to do with the technical aspects of the film but I don't understand why he didn't just accept that he would have to make do with 10 different shots instead of trying to hide the edit. Each time he does it by zooming in on a black jacket and then pulling out again after the edit. I was still impressed by the flow that the long shots brought to the film. Dall is not an easy to understand character but he gives a good performance as a man that is so arrogant that you keep watching to see his fall. Granger is more subtle and his fraying nerves are well conveyed during the party. Stewart is good but he really needed more material to work with in the final third of the film - the section where he really needed to bring things to boiling point.Overall this is a reasonable film but it can't manage to deliver in the final act. The plot is a little difficult to swallow but that wouldn't have mattered if the tension had been better developed and delivered. The cast try hard and do reasonably well but the final act of the film really just sputters out when it should ignite into flames. Hitchcock was experimenting with this film and I'm sure it helped his technical prowess but that doesn't make it an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A controversial theme that could have been more subversive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Alfred Hitchcock,what makes you so great is that you were able to make commercial films with dark subject matter starring some of the biggest Hollywood actors. In Rope, John Dall (Gun Crazy) and Farley Granger (They Live by Night) play supremacist college kids who murder their friend because he is weak. James Stewart is their politically incorrect teacher whose words they live by. The film which has a play like quality, takes place during a party in which the guests dine on a cupboard containing the dead body. Apart from the fact that the film is comprised of several long takes, I liked the way the camera moved around like an all knowing spectator. Tarantino used a narrator in The Hateful Eight instead of a camera which acted like a peeping tom. The film is not without its flaws. Farley Granger as the jumpy accomplice came across as too whiny. Stewart was pompous and annoying. His about turn towards the end after a rather offensively funny speech during the party was also hard to believe. The film would have been more interesting if Stewart joined his two students in their diabolical plot. But nonetheless, a very entertaining and provocative film, Hitch.Best Regards, Pimpin.(8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's only a piece of rope Phillip, an ordinary household article. Why hide it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon the play by Patrick Hamilton, Hichcock's 'Rope' is about two narcissistic men, Brandon and Phillip who invite their friend David to their apartment, strangle him to death and conceal his body in a chest in the middle of the living room. They then sadistically host a dinner party for his family and friends.It turns out that one man is more narcissistic than the other as while Brandon relishes the deviousness of their actions, Phillip immediately begins to fret and slowly break down over the course of the evening, threatening to expose their secret.One of their guests is their former professor, Rupert who inadvertently served as the inspiration behind their murderous act. He notices there is something "off" about his former students and sets about unravelling the mystery behind David's absence from the party.I feel like Rope is both one of Hitchcock's darkest and most light-hearted movies. The idea of entertaining the loved ones of a man you have just murdered is macabre and yet the constant incriminating double entendres in the dialogue, such as the discussion about choking chickens, add a layer of dark humour to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope", released in 1948, was remarkable to watch; the unique camera-work, where minimal editing is done, led to shots being about 10 minutes long, where the camera only basically moves and does not cut. So, at the time, it must have been quite experimental to make; just as the whole plot revolved around an 'experiment'; albeit a gruesome one.Two young men want to commit a perfect murder, in order to satisfy the superiority and inferiority theory of mankind where the superior can get rid of the inferior and look at murder as a form of art. In order to make their little experiment even more dangerous and satisfy their adrenaline even more, they host a party where they invite the dead young man's father and his fiancé, who are worried at his absence. James Stewart plays their former schoolmaster who taught them about these theories.The suspense is seen when one of them begins to crack under pressure and fear, and the movie focuses on many little details in order for us, the audience, to feel more involved and discover the characters' psychology and understand their ideas, and see the different stages they go through before getting caught by Stewart's character.The other young man, the leader of the duo, keeps calm and collected till the very end, when it is too late and they are caught.All in all, the film was entertaining, visually and technically unique and magnificently directed by the master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Murder an Art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is one of those rare movies which is totally engrossing within less than five minutes, no doubt in my top 5 films by the master. Hitchcock recreates the theatrical experience for the big screen. The set looks a bit fake and washed out, and even the colour cinematography has a washed out feel to it, this all being part of the charm of course. The actors strand in unnatural positions when talking, avoiding having their back facing the audience when speaking; unnatural for real life that is, normal for the warped reality of a stage play. Above all, the entire movie takes place in real time through a series of ten minute takes; and all this happens while there is a dead body in the room.The characters played by Farley Granger and John Doll as well as their teacher (James Stewart) hold a Nazi like ideology that murder is "an art a few superior beings should be allowed to practice", rather than those such as say, people who are Harvard undergraduates. The character's discussion on the justification for murder is chilling as they make it sound scarily convincing. Rope is based a true story from the 1920's and adapted into a play in 1929, although it's clear the movie is set during the period it was made such as the mentioning of movie stars from the era. It does seem unlikely in the aftermath of the atrocities during the Second World War that people would be so openly discussing such fascist ideas which were more common in the United States during the 20's and 30's.The movie is about homosexuality, although I didn't catch onto this. I'm not the best person when it comes to identifying gay characters, unless they're really gay (hey sisters!). I've heard criticism of Stewart being miscast in the role as he apparently doesn't make a convincing gay character, thus the homosexual love triangle from the play is not present in the film. Judging the film on its own merits however, Rope is a major step in his evolution as an actor, away from his gawky roles he was known for up until this point. His breakdown at the end is one of the acting highlights of his career and gives me the chills watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's Experimental "Hangman"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROPE A Review by JP January 11, 2015Freedom must have tasted pretty sweet after Alfred Hitchcock's first American feature film out from under the stranglehold, so to speak, of domineering producer David O. Selznick. Not only had Hitch attempted a cinematic feat unheard of the time: a 12-setup/cut, stage-play-oriented adaptation, he also chose a story that followed two "confirmed bachelors" ? or more rudely-stated at that time "queers" ? as they conspired to commit &amp; dangle the murder of a supposed-friend/colleague &amp; "inferior human being" under the noses of their party guests. To even consider exposing what co-screenwriter* Arthur Laurents (West Side Story, The Way We Were) refers to as "It" ? or homosexuality ? like any other antagonist couple back in 1948 was pretty risqué. Sweet freedom at Warner Bros. turned bittersweet as audiences failed to grasp the Master of Suspense's ingenuity, and "Rope" would fall short until a more modern audience could truly appreciate how ahead of its time this film really was. This would occur once again almost a decade later nearing the height of Hitch's unsurpassed career with "Vertigo" ? which would become known as his "Lost Masterpiece". I do not feel myself that it was, but that is for another review?The Murdering Mo's Knot: Gutsy thespians John Dall (Gun Crazy, Spartacus) &amp; Farley Granger (Strangers on a Train) risked a great deal to work with the then up-and-coming British director in his attempt to create a work of art on celluloid. Though the relationship between Brandon (Dall) &amp; Phillip (Granger) is not uttered, their overt interaction/body language said it all. Like a bickering old married couple, Brandon &amp; Phillip commit murder under the arrogant motive of a superiority complex &amp; to see if they could get away with it, hide the corpse in a chest, and serve party guests from atop the victim's crude casket. While the more-submissive Phillip (the bottom) ? whose "fame-bringing" hands were the ones attached to the "ordinary household object"/murder weapon/film's title ? succumbed to a guilty conscience and jangled nerves, Brandon (the top) flaunted &amp; pushed the envelope and stacked lies upon lies with a smarmy grin.A Vital Miscast Thread: All was going to plan for the sociopath and his murder mate until the true test of their plan arrived: former long-term friend (&amp; likely much more) &amp; academic instructor Rupert, played by the great James "Jimmy" Stewart (It's a Wonderful Life, Rear Window). His dry, pretentious wit played well into his character's commanding personality, but the thinly-veiled intimacy meant to be implied towards Brandon &amp; Phillip was voided. Stewart is truly a remarkable actor; an icon to a bygone era in classic film/Hollywood's roots. Though his busy, investigating blue eyes/manipulative characteristics read true to the audience as well as his effective delivery of the powerhouse monologue at the climax, his Leading Man-typecast/hugely-heterosexual status made Rupert's pivotal role fall short of what Montgomery Clift or Cary Grant (both rumored &amp;/or confirmed bachelors) could have tackled more eloquently?if they had not turned-down the role (most likely to preserve their reputations).Supporting the Noose: The majority of screen time is dedicated to the tainted triad of Brandon, Phillip, and Rupert, but the supporting cast deserves a great deal of mention. Mr. Kentley, the victim David's father, played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke (Suspicion, The Ten Commandments) helps add to the tension and morbidity of the situation. Humor, though a less-appreciated Hitchcockian theme, is an ever-present aspect in all his films. This tension-diffuser is featured mostly in exchanges between Rupert &amp; the following cast: Edith Evanson (Shane, Marnie), the cheeky housekeeper, and the ever-smiling, wishy-washy Mrs. Atwater (David's aunt), played by character actress Constance Collier (Stage Door, A Damsel in Distress). Rounding out the cast is David's girlfriend Janet (Joan Chandler-Humoresque) &amp; her old flame (Douglas Dick-The Red Badge of Courage) who both in their own, oblivious ways help spin into one of Brandon's self-woven webs, e.g. 2 of the many balls Brandon juggles which simultaneously-elaborates his character &amp; inadvertently-propels Rupert towards the truth.Tying it Up: For all it had going against it and despite critical confusion at the time, in the long run, "Rope" became one of the most revered films in Hitchcock's arsenal. Though the slots may switch around, this tight-knotted taut thriller will always remain in my Top 5 of Sir Alfred's 70 films (and always in my Top 10 Best Films of All Time).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie! I love the suspense about the rope. Hitchcock is at his best- -it's amazing that he can draw so much out of such a simple concept.Of course, it's based, loosely, on the Leopold and Loeb murder case in that the boys believe themselves to be superior because of their intellect. These two portray the same amount of stupidity and the carelessness that the real murderers experienced. All the hubris but flawed to the core. This video is perfect to use in the classroom to teach about setting: Throughout all of the movie, we stay in one room--no zooming in and out, etc. The entrances and exits, the window, the placing of the coffin, are all perfect for a one-setting play. The action is all based upon moving items from place to place--and upon conversation.This is a great story--movie or play! And anything with Jimmy Steward in it has to be great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting exercise in building tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today's film in my ongoing Hitchcock marathon is ROPE, in what is yet another prime example of how he was able to ratchet up the tension to keep the audience completely invested in the story. This time around, two friends strangle their classmate, hide his body in their apartment, and then proceed to invite his family, friends, and former teacher to prove to themselves that they committed the "perfect murder." One thing I heard about this film way before actually watching it was that it was edited to appear as if it was filmed in a single take. While I had my reservations about this in BIRDMAN, where it often felt like a gimmick, it felt more natural here. As this was based on a stage play, the constantly roving camera helped it from feeling "stagey." I also found the central conceit (at least to the two friends) of murder being an intellectually superior act quite interesting, and the way in which James Stewart's Rupert plays off of this was rather brilliant (as they were his theories to begin with). In general, I found the performances to be solid, although not spectacular (save from James Stewart, who is always a pleasure to watch). Hitchcock did an excellent job of staging the action and slowly building the tension regarding the big elephant in the middle of the room, so to speak. On a completely random side note, John Dall (who played Brandon) and Ben Affleck look a lot alike, to the point where kept on picturing the latter in a remake (which they should never do, by the way). Overall, I didn't find this as exciting as the last two Hitchcock films I watched (SABOTEUR and SHADOW OF A DOUBT), but it had a well-executed story and a solid technical construction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is one of the more well-known Hitchcock films. A film that maintains the illusion of being just a single, continuous long shot. A film about two men who murder their mutual friend and then proceed to arrange an evening party where their friends and family members dine literally on top of their dead member.And no, that's not a spoiler. That's literally the first five minutes of the film explained. If that hasn't hooked you in, then it's safe to say it's not your kind of film. But for the rest of you that are still here, it's a thrilling experience. Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) make for a fantastic main duo. They're a classic pair of foils. Shaw a cocky ego-driven intellectual who believes he can get away with it because no one's as smart as he is, and Granger, who's less confident, but also the one who Shaw needs to rein in his excessiveness. James Stewart plays the third main character and he's as great as always, giving a very suave performance with a razor sharp intellect.On the technical level the movie is a product of its time. The colours are slightly too bright, the window faces a painting of a background and the music and the audio warble a little bit. Plus the cuts made to achieve the illusion of a continuous shot are more than obvious, but you can forgive all of that. Especially because for its time it's very impressive.What bothers me more is the predictability. Yes it's a movie more about the building tension and general idea, but it's still somewhat annoying when you can practically predict what the characters are going to say before they even open their mouths.Nevertheless, Rope is a very good example from Hitchcock and definitely worth a watch if you've liked his other works and/or you're looking for a different kind of murder mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder is easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope was an adaptation of a stage play inspired by true events and turned into an experimental film by Alfred Hitchcock. However this was one of the movies he directed that he was dissatisfied with and was withdrawn from public distribution for three decades.The film opens with two young men murdering a fellow former student (David) at their apartment to prove their intellectual superiority and commit the perfect murder. Brandon (John Dall) more assured, smug and flamboyant adds a bit of theatrics by hiding the body in a wooden chest and turn it into a dinner table and invite people over for a party. The guests include the victim's family, girlfriend and their former house-master, Rupert (James Stewart) who inspired their men and supermen theories.Phillip (Farley Granger) more nervous and remorseful of his actions is a liability at the party, drinking too much and flying off the handle especially when when questioned by his house-master over the missing friend, David.The movie is shot in the apartment living room in long takes but its not one shot. Clever techniques are used to hide the cuts. This gives the film a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere as the net closes in with Rupert probing the disappearance of David and his family being worried that he has not showed up at the party.However with the stage setting, the New York skyline as the backdrop, strong use of colour, the theatre roots are very much present. The experiment being that Hitchcock never opens up the film.This leaves the three main actors to come to the foreground. We know who did it, why they did it. Its a case of whether Rupert will catch them out.John Dall gives a great performance as the more cold blooded and ruthless of the two. Amoral, superior, theatrical which in itself brings his downfall. Notice how when he first speaks to Rupert that he is stammering due to his nervous energy. Always eager to please his old house-master who he had previously sparred with and help install the initial germ of Nietzsche's ideology.If there are issues which is more to do with censorship laws of the time is that Brandon, Phillip and Rupert are all gay. Its done in a very subtle way especially with Rupert and it has been rumoured that James Stewart who may had been nervous over playing a gay character had a line added that he might marry the boy's housekeeper one day. It is very hard to discern the gay relationships between Brandon and Phillip who are supposed to be lovers.This is not one of Hitchcock's masterworks. Its a film I only encountered in the late 1980s after it had a short re-release in the cinemas. I had seen many of Hitchcock's previous films as they used to be regularly shown on television. It is however a director experimenting with his craft though and taking risks and stretching himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you think you were God, Brandon?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1948, Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" is based on a stage-play by Patrick Hamilton. Both film and play are based on a murder committed in 1924 by Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, two wealthy, well educated Jews who resolved to commit "the perfect crime"; the killing of a 14 year old boy.As is now well known, the film is comprised of ten unbroken, single takes, which are themselves roped together so as to convey the illusion of a single, uninterpreted, feature length shot. The film also largely takes place on a single set; a plush sky-rise apartment overlooking the New York skyline. In it resides Brandon and Phillip, two young intellectuals who've recently murdered David, a friend whose corpse they've hidden in a large chest. Brandon and Phillip view themselves as "superior beings" to whom "ordinary laws do not apply". Misreading and misapplying the writings of Nietzsche, they view themselves as Nietzschean Ubermensch.Throughout the movie, David is "missing" but obviously "there", in every line of dialogue, in the way his absence structures the plot, even in the shot compositions themselves. David is a disavowed obviousness. But what's remarkable is the incredibly amount of sympathy Hitchcock elicits for both the dispatched David and David's family. Brandon, of course, is precisely lacking in any and all traces of empathy. And in addition to being cold, Hitchcock paints him as a homosexual who gets high off the psycho-sexual power rush of murder (and is perhaps attempting to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control). Not content to merely dominate and decimate David, Brandon holds an impromptu party in which David's body, still concealed in the chest, is secretly the centre of attention. During this party, Brandon plays various power games with the guests, subtly bullying them all, including his "ally" Phillip. Much of his dialogue also has sexual connotations, topped off with visual, sexual puns (the orgasmic exhilaration of popped champaign bottles, our actors are themselves gay etc)."Man is a rope over an abyss, stretched between animal and Ubermensch," Nietzsche once wrote. Brandon, like most caricatural portraits of "fascists", interprets this as free pass for exploitation. In his eyes, the intelligent and the so inclined have a right, as superior beings, to lord over the common man. To Brandon, David merely "occupies space" and is "of little consequence". Brandon then likens art to murder: "Murder is an art," he says. "The power to kill can be just as satisfying as the power to create." Standing in Brandon's way is Rupert, a university professor played by the always likable Jimmy Stewart. Rupert spends much of the film masking his world-weariness with cynical irony. When he learns what his students have done, Hitchcock literally puts blood on Rupert's hands and has him swipe a stack of books off David's body, symbolically turning his back to academia. "There are no moral phenomena, only moral interpretations of phenomena," Nietzsche once wrote. Rupert, having now confronted the implications of misreading similar teachings, abruptly delivers an impassioned monologue chastising Brandon: "By what right do you dare say that there's a superior few to which you belong?!" Of course "rights" and "morals" are a man made concept. Human life has no intrinsic value. Brandon believes in a form of moral relativism (or nihilism). Rupert, faced with Brandon's actions, then espouses a form of moral objectivism (or universalism); the belief in a need for principles, ethics, codes and compassion. Brandon's stance is itself typically conflated with various branches of social Darwinism. Here, it is believed that it is "natural" to oppress others, and that a "survival of the fittest", "individualistic" credo sanctions such oppression. Biologist Herbert Spencer gave rise to much of this jargon in the late 19th century, whilst, around the same time, philosopher Peter Kropotkin mockingly used the same arguments to posit the exact opposite (ie cooperation as being the main factor in evolution, not competing forces). Regardless, just because something is "natural", doesn't make it either "good" or "bad", human nature is itself not "natural", is always in flux, always dependent, and of course "survival of the fittest" means the fittest for given conditions, and the fittest is not necessarily preferable. As Kropotkin said, the fittest in mud is the mud eel. No healthy person can live in mud. Are present social conditions such that they will develop the best type of man? No? Then don't blame the eel, change the water."Rope" was released when WW2 and the Holocaust were fresh in audience's minds. The film is thus typically read as being about one good, righteous American throwing away all his "big university books" and "fancy knowledge" and schooling a pair of evil Nazis on how to behave good and proper (Stewart's channelling his Capra films, bolstering good, old fashioned, fine American values). Of course this ignores a number of far more interesting things: the boys are based on Jewish killers, Hitler himself cited the tactics of the UK, France and US as the model for his own actions, and Nazi exceptionalism is no less insidious than Western exceptionalism. Ironically, the cosy values Stewart espouses here are today precisely the values used to justify modern mass murder ("Killing to bring equality", "War to bring freedom", "Nuking to save lives" etc).Beyond all this, "Rope" is impeccably acted, written and shot. It unfolds in real time, its transition from daylight to darkness echoes Rupert's own journey, Hitchcock captures the graceful passage of time, and his city skylines, which transitions from daylight to neon-hell, are magical (over 8000 incandescent bulbs). This skyline, a replica of NY city, the seat of commercial power, becomes emblematic of Brandon's own hunger for power. Neat joke: two of "Rope's" characters hint that they've recently seen Hitchcock's "Notorious" at a local cinema.8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 234Rope is beautiful in its simplicity. The whole thing takes place in one room, the cast of characters are all related, carefully chosen, interesting and cover a wide variety of personalities, and the premise is jumped on instantly and then followed for the next hour and a bit.From the second they murder the classmate, the race is on to see if they get away with it, or who will catch them and how. The crime itself is wretched, especially considering the perpetrators "reasoning" behind it. All the vocabulary that keeps popping up related to the crime makes us uneasy as well- it can't be a coincidence, can it?The acting is stellar- Doll and Granger carry the double edge of guilt- one is confident and egotistical, the other about to break down. Then there's Stewart, George Bailey himself in a very different role, inquisitive? knowing? his speech at the end is remarkably powerful and damning.This is a weighty film, pound for pound. The character dynamics are interesting. The minds of Brandon and Phillips are worth studying. But it's the final question posed: who decides what is superior and inferior? that can have the most extrapolated from it. Apply that question to anything, politics, social science, you name it. People eschew things horribly in the name of what they think is right. There seems to even be a religious aspect to it all. To think this is all condensed in a little thriller is fascinating: a very worthy watch. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can murder be Art? Can people of higher intellect dispense with normal morals? Brandan and Phillip (John Dall and Farley Granger) believed so and decided to undertake a murder to demonstrate this. But art has to be seen to have value, so Rope centres around a small party attended by those close to the victim. Unbeknown to the guests, the food for the evening has been laid on the chest containing the victim's corpse. This was Phillip's idea to reinforce how clever they had been, particularly as one of the guests was Rupert (James Stewart), their former school master. Rupert was the inspiration for the murder and Phillip in particular looked up to Rupert's Nietzschen values, but felt that he didn't have the heart to put his words into action. Nevertheless, Phillip could't help but hint at what they had done throughout the party, in a way to seek his approval.The cinematography throughout was good, particularly the illusion of one long shot. John Dall was excellent, but I did feel that Farley Granger's acting wasn't great and let the film down a little. Overlook, this last point and I think the film is an enjoyable watch that seems to fly by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A daring and technical thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men murder a man and hide him in a large trunk in the middle of their living room. They then perversely invite the dead man's family and friends over for a dinner party with the body hidden just under their noses the whole time.Rope is most famous as a film of cinematic technique. More specifically it's an exercise in long unbroken takes. Due to the technology of the time the film could not be photographed in a single unbroken shot as it's director Alfred Hitchcock wished for, instead it was made up of half-a-dozen or so long single takes, most of which are edited together so that the breaks aren't too obvious. There is no denying that the result is a bit showy and is technique for techniques sake. Nevertheless the experiment is executed well and it does prove that Hitchcock truly was a cinematic innovator.Another daring element of the film is in its central two villains. Their whole motivation for the murder is intellectualized; a very cold, emotionless driving force where the victim was killed as part of some high-brow theory on homicide. It's an unusual idea to base a movie around. Even more daring is in the homosexual undertones clearly evident in these characters. This was a seriously taboo topic in the 40's, and while it's not made explicit it's certainly alluded to. Hitchcock was definitely going out on a limb with both the technique and content of this film.Despite everything, Rope is maybe too committed to its own experimentation to entirely work. The long takes make the film unavoidably stagey and while being cinematically daring, they simultaneously ensure the film can't use one of the prime advantages of cinematic art: editing. As a result, Rope can at times drag a little and its story-line does seem to me to be just a little too artificial for us to buy the character actions entirely. Much of its experimentation was never really repeated again which perhaps gives an indication that maybe the method broke the mould here. Nevertheless, it remains something of a one-off and a genuinely interesting curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Pulls His Rope's End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two highly intelligent, wealthy young students attempt to get away with "the perfect murder". This intriguing drama was also filmed as "Compulsion" (1959) and "Swoon" (1992). Loosely based on the true story of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, this version stars John Dall (as Brandon Shaw) and Farley Granger (as Phillip Morgan), with James Stewart (as Rupert Cadell). At the time, lead characters' same gender relationship was said to be "toned down," due to outmoded attitudes. Presently, this gives their sexuality a more positive, "matter-of-fact" redolence; though, this can hardly be considered something to crow about, given the subject matter. What really hurts this film is director Alfred Hitchcock's experimental use of what was called "the ten minute take." But, even with this unnecessary and distracting self-limitation, Hitchcock is well worth watching. And, the performances are wildly entertaining.******** Rope (8/23/48) Alfred Hitchcock ~ John Dall, Farley Granger, James Stewart, Cedric Hardwicke</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's morbid cocktail party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holding us in its grip from start to finish, the audience watches as Rope unfolds on a single set in a Manhattan apartment for what becomes a nail-biting cat and mouse game. There is no whodunit because we know from the start but there is knife-cutting suspense as the viewer waits for the outcome. The young men giving the party are John Dall as Brandon and Farley Granger as Philip.The awkward attempt at a cover-up pushes the limits of risk-taking, particularly as the younger man played by Farley Granger becomes more and more unhinged by the suspicions and questions of an academic named Rupert Cadell, played by James Stewart. Cadell gives a rationale for certain murders during the party conversation; however, Cadell is not about to condone a senseless and ruthless crime. Cadell is not a man of great virtue or the common touch and has possibly contributed to the twisted thinking of the two Ivy League young men who are hosting the party. This movie gives us a sense of Hitchcock's sympathy for the "average person", as opposed to the highly intelligent, refined characters who are often portrayed as traitors and murderers. Hitchcock often shows his dislike of those who see themselves as superior and elitist in movies like Saboteur, Notorious, North by Northwest. Aside from the fine performances by Stewart, Granger and Dall, the cast is generally good, particularly Cedric Hardwicke as the doting and worrying father, Mr. Kently, and Edith Evanson as the maid who natters on and carries on, blissfully unaware of the crime. Constance Collier seems to fit the bill as the party's gabbing-machine. The movie is a series of long takes that give the viewer a feeling of being there. This is a trademark of Hitchcock. There is one take that focuses on the maid as she goes back and forth from room to hall with the conversation clearly in the background. It is almost as if the audience is a fly on the wall, listening to the conversation and watching the maid at the same time. We also wonder how long it will take her to see the truth that the viewer already knows. There is a tension in the room that the viewer feels throughout, as if we are there but cannot say anything. Cedric Hardwicke becomes more and more uneasy about his son not showing up. James Stewart becomes more and more suspicious. John Dall and Farley Granger fight an overpowering fear. Others seem to wish they were not there at all. After the suspense and wondering that seems to titillate us for so long, the ending is understated. There is no gotcha or summing up from any of the actors as the action slowly winds down. I felt great admiration for this well crafted thriller so heavy with fear and foreboding. While the movie is loosely adapted from a play, it seems fit Hitchcock's wish to deliver a lesson to those who place themselves above the law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shot in a stage production-like manner, Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" reminds us that as much entertainment can be found in a stage theater as well as on the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's first color film, 1948's "Rope", looks and feels very much like a recorded version of a stage production. It is, in fact, based on a play by Patrick Hamilton and save for the opening first few minutes, looks very like it was in fact entirely shot for a live audience. More than ninety percent of the movie takes place in a small apartment room. The performances by the cast are very Laurence Olivier-like in their style?very dramatic, out there, theater quality. And the dialogue itself is very much like one would expect from a stage production. Obviously, the film stayed faithful to its original source. "Rope" seems like it was shot in a theater on a stage and this may seem like a detractor for some audience members, but to them, I say that this marvelous murder story is just proof that a stage production can be just as exhilarating as a feature film. Yes, it is a film shot with cameras and on a set with a controlling director, but it still has the authentic and wonderful feeling of a well-realized stage drama.In the film, two prep school graduates played by John Dall and Farley Granger turn upon one of their fellow students (Dick Hogan) right away shortly after the film begins and murder them as a sort of experiment to test themselves and the perfection of their plan. They hide the body of their strangled colleague inside an old trunk in their apartment and what's more, arrange a party to take place later in the evening. As one of the cons begins to lose his composure and his grip on reality, their former mentor (James Stewart) becomes increasingly wary about their behavior and the true whereabouts of the missing guest.As I mentioned earlier, save for the opening credits shot, all of the movie takes place inside the apartment and what's more, the movie also is shot in very long, stretched-out takes. Hitchcock was obviously trying to recapture the feeling of the stage story and probably would have shot the movie with a single camera if technology would have allowed him to. The film was shot in exactly ten takes (a single camera reel lasts about ten minutes) and begins to assume the abilities of an invisible guest in the apartment, wandering freely about the room, focusing on certain individuals, and keeping a wary eye on the trunk where the corpse lies within. This is the ultimate genius of Hitchcock's direction and the cinematography. That while the actors are playing as though this were a stage, the camera keeps on the move so that we stay interested. There is one annoying little detail. Since the camera cannot go on forever, when the reel was close to an end and the take can to stop, the camera zooms in on an actor's back or a dark object in the room. And there is no real psychological explanation as to why the camera would do this and you can only know if you've read up on the production of the film, but again, this is only happens a handful of times and therefore doesn't become too distracting."Rope" is also a very well-acted motion picture, especially in regards to John Dall as the experimenting murderer whose only motivation for the killing was to test himself and his limits as a human being. This was also the first of four films that James Stewart collaborated on with Alfred Hitchcock; unfortunately, Stewart felt much less happy with this as the other three. Stewart felt he was badly miscast in this movie and when you look at his performance, yes, he doesn't present the true range of colors and audience-friendly qualities that he gave us in "Rear Window" (1954), "Vertigo" (1958) and previous films like "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). Perhaps he was not quintessentially cast like he was the other three films I mentioned, but I have to say that it was a welcome sight to see Stewart in a murder mystery and it's comforting to remark that if it hadn't been for this film, Stewart and Hitchcock may have not later collaborated on their truly famous and wonderful projects in the 50s.But all in all, more than sixty years since it was first released, Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" is a very good film. No, it's not on the same level as some of his other projects. This seems a little more like a warm-up for him and his later murder mysteries, but remember, this is Alfred Hitchcock, whose 'warm-ups' were marvelous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Experimental Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was known for being willing to attempt new and creative methods to tell a film's narrative, and Rope is Hithcock at his most experimental, willing so much in fact that he attempted to shoot this 80 minute picture as close to real time as possible.Using long takes and shooting until film ran out of the camera (around 10 minutes or so), Hitchcock used his camera to turn from one character to the other, much like a person's point of view. This makes the audience feel they are in the room and seeing everything that occurs, since there are very few cuts in the picture. What doesn't work is the fact that this is a murder story, and much debate has been made over whether or not Hitchcock was right in showing the murder in the opening scene. This takes away suspense of whether a murder was actually committed, and keeps the audience focused primarily on if these two men will get caught.Despite some of the shortcomings of Hitchcock's decisions in holding our suspense, this is for the most part yet another success for the great director. The cast is strong, particularly the two men, played by unknowns John Dall and Farley Granger. Dall, as the stronger and more subversive believer in Nietzsche's theory of the superman, is a most effective actor and is very convincing in his dark and sinister nature. James Stewart is a great actor but feels misplaced as the prep school teacher from which these two young men have taken inspiration from. Of course, the star of this film as with most of his others is Hitchcock, willing to try anything that will increase suspense and the joy of watching a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one doesn't rank highly among Alfred Hitchcock fans but it has become my favorite Hitchcock film and one that gets better for me after repeat viewings. Loosley based on the real life Leopold and Loeb case, Farley Granger and John Dall play close buddies who are convinced that their superior intellect and high social standards will allow them to get away with the perfect murder. They do away with a friend of theirs, hide him in a trunk in the living room and proceed to throw a party for the dead man's family and friends while serving a buffet dinner on the very trunk that now houses his dead body. All seems well for Granger and Dall until their old schoolmaster, played by Jimmy Stewart, arrives at the party. From there, Stewart begins to suspect something is not right and then the fun really begins.I really like this film. Yes, it is extremely dialog heavy and maybe slow in spots and there is very little action in the course of it's 81 minutes but that doesn't hamper the viewing experience for me. From the outstanding performances to the sparse studio set, the film slowly builds it's suspense to a satisfying pay-off in the final 20 minutes. There is so much for the eye to follow and the ears to listen to that the film is a totally involving experience. Cutting only to replace the camera's with new film after every 10 minutes, Hitchcock films the movie basically in real time. As a result, the camera and main microphones may be focused on a conversation between Stewart and Dall but you have to listen closely because a conversation between Granger and another character is taking place and there are interesting tid-bits to pick up. An amazing feature of the film is the New York skyline outside the apartment's spacious picture windows. To keep with the real time feel, the skyline changes cloud formations, turns to dusk and then neon lit nighttime. It's an excellent touch. I really can't say enough about the film, almost perfect Hitchcock IMHO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Suspense But Falls Short of Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first read the history of the Leopold-Loeb murders, on which this film is based, because I was interested in Clarence Darrow who defended Scopes in the Monkey Trials. He also defended Leopold and Loeb. So I wanted to see this film, especially since it was directed by Hitchcock.Intellectual giants Leopold, 19, and Loeb, 18, wanted to commit a perfect crime because they believed themselves to be Nietzschean supermen. Leopold agreed to act as Loeb's accomplice on the condition that Loeb would be his homosexual lover. They kill a 14 year- old boy. Leopold's birdwatching glasses are found at the scene of the crime, like the ROPE in this movie, and gives them away. Because of their arrogance when interviewed, it seemed they would be sentenced to death, but Darrow's eloquence "reduces" their sentence to life. Darrow argued that you could not hang boys for the philosophy they learn in school. Loeb is killed in prison by another inmate who claimed Loeb tried to sexually assault him. The news headlines read, "Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition." Leopold learned 27 languages in prison, and was released after 33 years. He married a widow in Puerto Rico.I give this film an 8/10 because the suspense continually mounted. Towards the end my heart was beating fast, and I was short of breath, partly because I have a cold, partly because of the anxiety. But there were disappointments. For one, I hoped Jimmy Stewart would've played the analog of Clarence Darrow. There was no such figure. Rather, the closest analog to Stewart's character was Nietzsche, whose philosophy influenced the duo. I found this character redundant. Also, at the end of the movie, when Stewart finds out their crime, he instantly renounces them and separates himself from them and calls the cops. He ceases to account for his influence, or the fact that the cold unfeeling killer put the submissive one up to it. And then the movie ends. In other words, there is no catharsis. It doesn't do justice to the characters involved. I was also thinking, if Stewart was there with the gun in his hand, wouldn't the cops implicate all three??? But these oversights (if you want to call them that) are probably not Hitchcock's fault, but that of the playwright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The power to kill can be just as satisfying as the power to create"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock, despite his commercial popularity, was perhaps one of cinema's most audacious technical innovators. Even very early in his career ? 'Blackmail (1929)' was the first British film to make the cross-over into "talkies" ? the Master of Suspense was forever searching for distinctive new means of telling a story and furthering his craft. Hitchcock was particularly interested in film-making that unfolded almost exclusively in a single restricted location, perhaps because of its likeness to a traditional stage play, or, more tellingly, because it allowed him to place the audience "in the room" with his nefarious characters. The director's first such endeavour was the radical 'Lifeboat (1944),' which took place entirely on a small boat in the middle of the Atlantic, and similar "one-room" thrillers include 'Dial M for Murder (1954)' and 'Rear Window (1954).' Of course, the most experimental of these experiments was undoubtedly 'Rope (1948),' a tense and intimate suspense tale that utilised extraordinarily-long takes to unfold the story almost in real-time. Against all odds, it's one of Hitchcock's finest.'Rope' was adapted from Patrick Hamilton's 1929 stage play of the same name, itself inspired by the true-life story of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, two wealthy University of Chicago students whose desire to commit the "perfect crime" culminated in murder in 1924. The film opens with the strangling murder of David Kentley (Dick Hogan) by two friends, Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger), who have come to consider murder an art-form, a privilege bestowed only upon a select few superior individuals. In order to crown their masterpiece, and flaunt their superiority before colleagues, the pair have organised a dinner party in their apartment ? attended by David's friends and family ? the buffet served over their victim's lifeless body in an unlocked chest. As Brandon narcissistically drops vague hints as to David's fate, and Phillip descends into a restless drunken binge, former prep-school housemaster Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) senses that his students have been up to something, and that his own teachings on the philosophy of the Übermensch (Nietzsche's "Superman") may have been responsible.All this action unfolds through ten continuous long takes, of between four and ten minutes in length, with around half of the transitions made "invisible" by dollying forward into the darkness of a character's back. As the characters move back and forth across Hitchcock's set, their lines and movements precisely choreographed, the cameramen and sound recordists track smoothly with them, constantly moving props and furniture out of the path of the filming equipment. This was the first occasion that such an audacious film-making technique had been trialled, and 'Rope' wouldn't be bettered until digital technology allowed Aleksandr Sokurov to film the entirety of 'Russian Ark (2002)' in a single take. Some have subsequently termed Hitchcock's film to be nothing but a gimmick, but to do so would be grossly unfair to all involved ? indeed, when I first viewed the film, such was my immersion in the story that, unbelievably enough, it took me the bulk of the running time to even notice that I was watching unbroken takes.'Rope' deliberately carries the air of a stage play, though the addition of a camera necessarily amplifies the intimacy of every situation. By eliminating almost all editing from his film, Hitchcock suspends the artificiality that is inherent in the art form ? effectively flouting the wisdom of Eisenstein and Vertov ? and allows the actions of his characters to tell the story. Characteristically, this technique also adds an element of voyeurism to our viewing the film, the unbroken takes suggesting that we, the audience, are actually standing in the room observing the proceedings. As the third perpetrator in the murder, we watch through anxious eyes as Brandon Shaw smugly offers dangerous insinuations, Phillip Morgan shakes uncontrollably at every item that might give away his crime, and Rupert Cadell thoughtfully begins to put the pieces together, despite his disbelief that such a cold-blooded murder could have been committed. Exhausting, exhilarating and, above all, entertaining, Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rope' finds the Master of Suspense at the top of his game, a shining example of experimentation turned into great art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ripped from the headlines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock likes to vary the formula he uses to tell his great suspense yarns. In this film, he uses a story involving two young killers ripped from the headlines: the Leopold &amp; Loeb case that rocked a nation in the 1920s. The effort is one of the director's more stage-bound versions, having been adapted from a play, itself based on the real-life events. Hitchcock is tinkering with his cinematic formula, and he seems to be spending a considerable amount of time experimenting with long takes. Yes, the camera work does retain a certain amount of fluidity. Nevertheless, the film engages the viewer, not because of gimmickry, but because of the performances by its trio of lead actors: James Stewart, John Dall, and Farley Granger. Their work compels the audience to find out what will happen to these unsavory characters. It isn't a matter of whether their lives will end tragically, because their fate is fairly much assured. Rather, it's more about just how tragic their lives will end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern day version of "Crime and Punishment."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do agree with the critic who stated that Jimmy Stewart's performance saves this film. From the moment he enters the scene (about 20 minutes in), the movie takes on a whole new energy. It's remarkable; it's as if his presence focuses the plot and stabilizes the chaos that characterized the movie up until that point. The story itself is a retelling of Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" (and is also apparently based on an actual murder case.) It asks the question of whether there are some people who are so intellectually/morally superior as to be exempt from the laws that govern the rest of us. The 2 antagonists of course believe there are, and to prove it (and for their own amusement) they kill a classmate whom they consider to be a "waste of space." Then they invite mutual friends and family of the victim over for a dinner party, where they serve the buffet off of a trunk stuffed with his body. The brilliant irony is that they are too arrogant to realize that they have completely misinterpreted the theories of the one man they believe will understand them- their former teacher, played by Jimmy Stewart. This is quite a cerebral film, and won't hold the attention of people who watch Hitchcock for the action and suspense. I think this is one of Stewart's best performances- the evolution as his character slowly figure out what has occurred is pure artistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Information about a Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not so old, but I do appreciate quality movies. To be correct and more specific, I like the films with James Stewart. I watch them over and over again, and perhaps that's why I'm starting to dislike them: I saw them too many times. This masterpiece I watched more times than the springs I saw. But this isn't about my age, it is about quality, like I said in the beginning, and even though I start to dislike the pictures of James Stewart, I can't say they are bad made pictures. Not only everything on a Stewart movie is perfectly organized, the actors play their part very well. Maybe it's because this was a Hitchcockian picture, I don't know. I start to dislike the suspenseful films from Hitchcock too, mainly because I watch them too many times. But I strongly believe we all have to watch each film many times, because our opinions changes equally with our age.Rope is about a murder (like the most movies from Hitchcock). But that isn't important. It's John Dahl ('Gun Crazy') and Farley Granger ('Strangers on a Train') who make the film as good as it is. The real life murder, on which this was based, had inspired many directors. Films as 'Swoon', 'Compulsion' and others are about the same killing. But none of them portray the madness of the (homosexual) murderers as good as in Hitchcock's 'Rope'. It gets under your skin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Ahead Of It's Time In Many Ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most technically brilliant film of Alfred Hitchcocks career. It is based upon a play and the play was based upon an actual odd murder case which had happened in the 1940's. It is not a real scenic film as all the action in the film takes place in three rooms.The living room with a huge window to the outside world is where the main action takes place. Hitch himself does not appear in this stage but there is a florescent sign of his image on a building in the obviously artificial back drop. He does walk down the street during the opening credits too.The play has gay overtones which do show up in the film but are toned down for in 1948 this type of theme was solidly "in the closet". For a long time films would treat this line, even 11 years later there are those themes in Ben Hur but toned down there too.The innovation is the shooting technique. This is the only time a great film was made with long (8 minutes or more) continuous takes. There is one sequence in the film where you see the camera shake. That is because a camera man just had the camera run over &amp; broke his foot. The brave camera man still worked broken foot &amp; all to finish the sequence and did not holler out with pain.Jimmy Stewart is uncomfortable in his role but it actually fits the story. Hitchcock leaves no mystery about who the killers are as the murder happens the first thing after the credits. It is supposed to be the perfect victim and the perfect murder. It is fascinating to watch all this unravel with Professor Stewart the only person who can solve it.While this movie did not sell the tickets that Rear Window would later, it a way this film is the perfect mirror of that film. This one looks into the intimate details of the murder from outside where Rear Window looks outside to see the details of the perfect murder. In a way Hitchcock used the brilliant Stewart twice to do mirror images of himself &amp; of the movie. The curtains are closed during this murder. In Rear Window, the curtains are wide open.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's dark reflection on the glamour of murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone may have had doubts that a play based on such macabre and controversial subject matter as murder for the sake of intellectual excitement could be successfully adapted into a feature film suitable for audiences, visionary director Alfred Hitchcock proved more than up to the challenge of meeting such apprehension head on. Like the majority of Hitchcock's other celebrated works, Rope was based on an existing literary work (Patrick Hamilton's play, which originated on the London stage) and tapped into such familiar themes as the perverse glamour and fascination induced by the concept of murder. Despite the fact that many of his classic works exploring such areas of interest were made later on (Strangers on a Train and Rear Window being the most obvious examples) Hitchcock proves equally comfortable delving into his predominant area of interest in Rope as in any of his later works, culminating in a devastatingly powerful and incessantly interesting vintage film. As well as being one of Hitchcock's earliest successes, Rope proved to be arguably the director's most experimental picture, technically. Apart from being Hitchcock's first film shot in colour, Rope was filmed almost as a form of 'cinematic play', shot in seemingly a single nonstop take, one of the film's most intriguing and innovative features. Since the amount of work involved to actually film 80 minutes nonstop would have been nearly inconceivable, Hitchcock was wise enough to break down the film into several roughly eight minute installments, each transition marked by zooming into to a stationary object which obscured the screen (a man's back, a table, etc.) to mask the editing cut - a subtle and clever enough technique at first, though as the film progresses, the editing transitions become more and more tiresome and obvious, and one begins to wish Hitchcock might have found slightly more innovative ways of masking his camera. Despite this minor criticism, Hitchcock makes marvellous use of his camera considering the enclosed setting (apart from the opening establishing shot, the entire film is set inside an apartment loft) and the film boasts some of the most impressive cinematography of the decade. The film's script, adapted closely from its stage incarnation, is an immensely intelligent and compelling piece of work, commendable for unflinchingly examining a rather morbid line of thought - the thrill of murder simply to prove one could, and for the ensuing intellectual exhilaration. Taking notes from writings by Nieztsche and Freud, the script blends its philosophical and psychological ideologies without missing a beat or dampening the suspense in the slightest. Though the film might come across as a bit "talky" at times, as proves the case for most theatrical adaptations, apart from a disappointingly static and anti-climatic ending, the dialogue crackles, and the characters presented are vivid and realistic, making the dark subject matter all the more unsettling. The lack of a consistent musical score compliments the tension wonderfully; the only background sound provided by an eerie solitary piano played by one of the characters. Rather than a more familiar tale of mistaken identity or the like, Rope proves to be one of Hitchcock's darker and more intellectual efforts. As always, Hitchcock draws impeccable performances out of his stellar cast and it is difficult to find a weak note in a performance piece so airtight. James Stewart is on top form, playing mercifully against type as a cold and sardonic academic, and giving one of his strongest performances as a result. As the two murderers, Farley Granger and John Dall are superb, playing off each other with effortless grace and energy. While Granger may toe the line of melodrama periodically, his emoting is consistently believable for one in such a predicament, and the audience genuinely empathizes with his character for the majority of the film. Nonetheless, he is easily overshadowed by the show stealing Dall, who masterfully blends slimy charisma, fervent intellectualism and an undercurrent of menace without missing a beat. The supporting cast, in particular Joan Chandler as a feisty college friend and Edith Evanson as a suspicious housekeeper give similarly excellent performances - the disappointing exception being Sir Cedric Hardwicke, who comes across as too unemotional to create a credible character, but surrounded by such charismatic performances, such a minor complaint goes nearly unnoticed. For one of Hitchcock's lesser known films, Rope proves a triumph of vision and cinematic prowess - an intelligent script given credibility by a highly capable cast, and complimented by innovative and fascinating technical maneuvers. To this day, Rope has lost none of its power or effortless class, and proves an excellent watch for any in the mood for a concise and captivating thriller as only Hitchcock could have delivered. -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's first color movie is entertaining and unique, but doesn't fully deliver for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock started out doing silent films from 1922-1929, then his British films from 1929-1939, and now he is well into his American films which started in 1940 with Rebecca. Rope stands out in Hitchcock's filmography trivia as his first color movie.Any review of Rope's technical aspects will undoubtedly mention the fact that the movie was filmed in extended scenes without much editing or cutting. The length of scenes before "cut" was called range between 4:37 and 10:06 in length. I think this is immediately obvious to any movie watcher who looks out for these kinds of things. Many criticize Hitchcock's decision here because the cuts are obvious and forced. For instance, to provide one cut, Hitchcock zooms into the back of a character, the cut happens, then the next cut picks up with the zoom out and continues with the next sequence. I did find several of the cuts distracting, and that is one of my pet peeves of movies is when the technical aspects get in the way and become obvious. I think the cuts between extended scenes should have been smoother so that the effect of the extended scenes would not be distracted by the cuts.However, Hitchcock is the prototypical auteur and I think this may be his stamp on the movie. The director is in charge. Hitchcock is in charge. But, I have often heard that Hitchcock thought the camera should just be another character in the room observing what is going on. What character would run into someone's back? But, I don't want to dwell on this point too much.A friend of mine spotted one scene where Brandon and Phillip were interacting and asked me, "Are you watching a gay movie?" Thinking back on it and reading other reviews, one can definitely watch Rope as a homo-erotic movie. The two main characters are based on Leopold and Loeb to some extent, the actors were gay in real life, the screenwriter was gay, the composer of the piano piece was gay, the part of Rupert Cadell was originally offered to a gay person and turned down by Cary Grant because of surrounding homo-eroticism, and the screenplay was heavily edited to remove sayings from the original British play which when interpreted were heavily homo-erotic. But, they managed to get it by the censors of the time with what it is now. If you look closely, though, there are enough remnants that viewing the movie with a homo-erotic slant is not out of the question -- there's still some dialog to examine and several instances of phallic imagery namely the wine bottle. So there's that.My main contention with the movie comes at the very beginning. Hitchcock decided to show the murder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is highly suspenseful even with the showing of the murder. But, I can only start watching the movie from after the showing of the murder to see just how much more suspenseful the movie would have been without showing the murder. It would then be the Macguffin of this film and what a Macguffin it would have been. The extended sequences would then work to an even greater effect by having the holding place in camera's view and the viewer would constantly be wondering, "Is he in there or not?" Even better, never reveal whether there was anyone in there or not! Ultimately, I enjoyed watching the movie. I really did. But I don't think the extended shots and Macguffin were used in conjunction to the extent I would have liked. So, Rope doesn't fully deliver for me.</fullReview>

It even lost you into the story of the two men who committed murder, and you became interested to learn more about the characters and their development, which I thought was clever.I watched the making of the film afterwards and I found out that most of my predictions were true and that Alfred wanted the film to have these type of feels. The man knew what he was doing and he is a master at suspense and mystery. Not to mention he knows how to cast a movie, James Stewart once again has won my heart with his heart gripping performance. This is a terrific movie, folks. Watch and learn from the pro's.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farley Granger?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" is a good, but not great movie. The performances of John Dall and Jimmy Stewart are very well done, though I can't understand why Hitchcock kept asking Farley Granger to act in his movies. Granted, his dialog left something to be desired, though his performance didn't do anything to save his character. Granger's acting, alone, is enough to warrant a 6 from me because it kept taking me out of the movie thinking about how ridiculous he was.The direction is simply outstanding - camera movement and framing were beautiful to watch.The story is somewhat predictable, although that was not necessarily a bad thing.Were it not for Farley Granger, this might be my favorite Hitchcock movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good twist needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad effort for Hitchcock's first color film. I found this a bit short but as it occurred in real time that is understandable. There was some over-the-top acting, especially from the sister in law, but the rest of the cast was solid.If this had been made in the modern day I think a nice twist at the end would have been a good idea. As the film ended with the sound of police sirens, I would have the police arrive and the two murderers say that Stewart had committed the murder, he did have the rope and gun after all. The rest of the film could have Stewart trying to clear his name, Brandon trying to appear as cool and as charming as usual and Phillip struggling to keep the truth to himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty fine hitchcock film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short. Rope was filmed in about 9 different takes, though tries to be one continuous shot. Though this was impossible in 1948, as film rolls were only 10 minute max.This film stars Farley Granger (strangers on a train) and Jimmy Stewart in his first collaboration with hitchcock. 2 college friends kill a friend for the fun of it. From here on the film revolves around a party which the twisted killers hold for their friends parents.Jimmy Stewart plays their teacher, who becomes increasingly suspicious of the boys behaviour.Filmed in one room, this film seems more like a play. Though is very entertaining. Its funny in places and surprisingly macabre for a film made in 1948.Definitely ones of hitchcocks best films. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another technological feat from Hitchcock, a film which seems to have no cuts throughout. Although there were 5 or 6, the editing is so swift that you will have trouble finding the cutting points, and the blend between each is seamless. Like other Hitchcock films where he experiments with camera work and conventional methods of filming and storytelling, it is a success and never feels as if it is the main gimmick of the film. The story and acting are all good enough to keep the viewer enthralled, and the balance between plot and camera-work is perfectly balanced, structured and adds to the overall effect of the film.The film takes place over the period of a night in one apartment owned by two young men, students of Philosophy taught by the well respected, cynical and clever Rupert Cadell. The students, Brandon and Phillip decided to murder someone as an experiment, to see what it felt like, and to see if they could get away with it. They choose to kill a friend, and hid the body in a trunk in their apartment. They decide to invite over Rupert and the other friends, who include the victim's family. Enjoying the irony and thrill of it all at first, the pressure soon grows: Knowing jokes about death and murder are thrown around, the victim's family and friends wonder why he is late and cannot get in contact with him, philosophical, moral and political discussions become heated and arguments break out, and Rupert becomes increasingly suspicious as the 2 students' behaviour becomes stranger. Phillip becomes more nervous as the irony, dark humour, and pressure from Rupert grows, and eventually the horror is uncovered. The boys explain their actions and Rupert realises that to some degree he had a part in it, because of his subversive teachings. The superiority complex much talked about by Nieztche is explored, and the boys question if it is right to kill another person because you feel superior.The dialogue is typical of Hitchcock, full of dark humour and nodding sight gags such as the fact that the food is served from the trunk in which the body lies. The backdrop of the city is impressive and Dall is pretty chilling. Th rest of the cast are admittedly average, but Jimmy Stewart makes up for this by giving a memorable performance. He easily controls the screen, and we come to feel like he is superior, all the more shocking and ironic when we realise his involvement and his reaction to that knowledge. Some my find the film gimmicky, if so take off a mark.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Very Best - a Must-See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like the theater, you will like this movie. That it runs like a play I think enhances it. The somewhat artificial dialog is so clever, and the painted skyline (it changes every few minutes) of the city is so evocative of a summer night, that I just love it. 1948 slang like, "oh, you're the end", "that's queer", and "he's a little tight" are as quaint now as something from Shakespeare. I like when Jimmy Stewart is verbally painting his murder hypothesis, and the camera moves around the room to follow his words. One tiny problem - what happened to the gash on Phillip's hand he got from nervousness and a champagne glass? He was getting his palm read and playing the piano a minute later. Other than that, it is fun to absorb all the attention-to-detail given by Hitchcock. This movie is a wonderful mood piece. It's one of my favorite films.P.S. About the probable homosexual relationship between the killers, Brandon and Phillip. I was slow to pick up on it, but my wife and other reviewers said it was obvious. Hitch covers his tracks with one quick comment: Brandon states that Janet dated him before the victim David. Brandon lets out a sexual sounding exhale after the last guest leaves and he thinks he's in the clear. The cigarette right after the murder also evokes the stereotypical smoke after sex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has none of the melodrama that Stewart received his fame for in "It's a Wonderful Life". I guess that's what I like about it. It's a good vs evil type movie but it portrays a man with a sense of good that supersedes any of the normal senses of goodness that you see in most films. It is Stewart's finest (Vertigo is close) and it is Hitchcock's finest (Vertigo is close). The unique style of filming also makes that absurd plot of the movie believable and approachable.The other main characters are as intriguing as Stewart and the acting is as good. You'll hope that they get caught but at the same time you'll hope one gets his day ruined a little more than the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dated but taught thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Points of interest both familiar and unfamiliar in this confusing middle period Hitchcock. One recognises the important symbols held close in long shots and the technicolour green/red flashing of the neon sign at the film's close is a clumsy precursor of the same symbol of moral conundrum as in Vertigo.But the film is barely that at all. It is, in effect filmed in two shots: one runs to the point where Jimmy Stewart's pater figure begins to twig that something is amiss, the other from this caesura (there are edit points, but it is as if a palindrome with the two shots). As a result the film looks rather like a stage play; once or twice the actors have to check themselves from treating the cameras as audience, and the blocking can be stilted. It can also be quite tiring, as anyone who has tackled Russian Ark will understand.The moral heart of the film is deliberately foggy - perhaps the extreme reasoning dates it a bit. I couldn't suspend my disbelief that anyone in 1948 (it's a contemporaneous piece) would countenance the possibility of eugenics as defensible: indeed the murdered boy's father, a reasonable character in both respects, is quick to draw the obvious parallels with Nietzche and the third Reich. But Hitchcock keeps it all tense and texturally rich - I like the disintegrating harmony of the piano piece Philip plays compounded by Rupert's introduction of a metronome in an alien tempo. And of course the Rope itself, produced so much by the insane Brandon that he's eventually hung with it. Metaphorically. 4.5/10UPDATE (7 July 2009): I've just watched this film again and I have to concede that my quibbles about the acting and blocking are almost negligible. This is a fine film, technically impressive, psychologically challenging and utterly gripping ("quite tiring"?!). If writing for the first time around I might have ranked it with Hitchcock's finest and given it 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is one of his best films and deserves more credit than it usually gets. The plot is well thought out, the acting is better than average and the ending is one of the best ever. James Stewart does pretty good in this movie, but it is the two main characters who enact a murder (based on a true story) because they feel they are inferior to others.

		<fullReview>Rope will forever remain with us because of the unique way inwhich Hitchcock shot it. Going against what he believed moviesshould be, he shot the film in continuous takes that ran forabout ten minutes or so. In a clever transition between takes,the camera would move behind something and then pick up where itleft off. We see a murder happen, then in a very twistedgesture, the two murderers place the body in a trunk and hold adinner party for him. The fun of this piece is watching FarleyGranger grow nervous with each passing minute. Every mention oftheir friend, brings on about of anxiety and we watch himsquirm. On the other end is John Dall, who seems to be enjoyinghis superiority over the rest of the party. The only one whosuspects anything is Jimmy Stuart and he questions Granger in awonderful little scene in which a metronome gives us an idea onjust how filled with guilt Granger is. Watch this one and payclose attention to the background. As the film unfolds in realtime, we see it get dark and we see the neon of the city come tolife. Look carefully for Hitchcock's cameo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(49%) More or less a filmed stage play using one take camera trickery with joins you could park a bus between. At less than 90 minutes long this still struggles to fill what little it has to say, much of which is centred around two friends who commit "the perfect murder". The glaring problem here is that the perfect murder is one that involves both the killing and disposal of the victim without any incriminating evidence upon the killers at all, so the very idea of strangling someone (not a spoiler as it happens within the first five minutes) then putting the corpse inside chest could only be considered perfect by a couple of idiots. There is some interest involving the ethics of the state power over the lives of the masses, but overall I found it hard to care about anyone or indeed anything. For cinema fans this is of course worth a look, but for me I'd stick with some of Hitchcock's less monotonous offerings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock on set?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock takes the story of two rich kids who kill a 14 year old boy just for the thrill of it and adapts it into this brilliantly acted and photographed film. The entire film consists of less than a dozen shots, which puts a tremendous strain on the actors and the crew, but they all pulled it off brilliantly. It would seem that Hitchcock shot the film in a small number of long takes and all on one set as something of a gimmick, but I think that it was just something that Hitchcock had to do. He found a story that fascinated him, and when it was determined that it would make for a technically simple film, he came up with the idea of doing it in as few shots as possible. This is, of course, pure conjecture on my part, but it makes sense to me, based on what I know about Hitchcock.(spoilers) Of particular note about the way the film was shot in long takes is that it gives an feeling of intimate knowledge to the set, which is probably the most important thing that the film could have done to maximize the suspense. Consider, for example, when the camera acts out Jimmy Stewart's theory about how a kidnap and murder would be carried out in that apartment. Not only does the camera work reveal that all of the furniture on the set is on wheels, since much of it had to be moved during shooting to accommodate the moving cameras, but it also gets extremely close to some of the furniture, giving the entire set a three dimensional feel. The props themselves cease to be background and become actual characters.Jimmy Stewart gives a wonderful performance, as do John Dall as the braver of the two criminals, and Farley Granger, who will go on in a few years to star in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. Certainly a curiosity piece as far as being Hitchcock's first color film, but Rope is also one of the most technically brilliant of his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Hitchcock might have pioneered many points of film, let's face it, more astute directors have come along that have formed stronger images because they have more talent. Evolutionary film.This is your only spoiler warning...In some ways, that superiority complex is evident here with the murder as the central focus, but that's only the beginning.What's interesting here is how Hitchcock tries exploring a simple stage play. While everything takes place in the apartment, nothing is seen from different angles. Almost all our shots take place from the same perspective, that of the audience on the fourth wall of the stage.In today's world, an audience wouldn't accept that in film, regardless of the quality of acting (in this case, bad) so there would need to be more focus. For it's time, this would've been great, but time is the enemy of all kinds of film.Overall, those interested in studying the focus of the stage should find something useful. Stick with Hitchcock's better works.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

The idea comes from a theatre play, that comes from real life, so it was easy for Hitch to create an interesting movie.James Stewart has nothing in common with his students, i think Hitch had to choose someone else for that character (infact initially he wanted Gary Grant for the movie, but Gary didn't want to play that role).Brandon was great.The idea of using just a camera is nice.

		<shortDescription>"Rope" is an honorable if not successful experiment from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You gotta give Alfred Hitchcock credit for one aspect regarding his first Technicolor feature "Rope" (1948) and that's the honorable attempt at trying something different in terms of telling his story. With "Rope", he tried to film the entire picture as if it were one seamlessly continuous take. Although I can clearly tell when the film may have been edited through close-ups of the backs of the character's suits, I at least respect what he's trying to attempt and that ambition alone is one of the best parts of this picture. The rest of "Rope" however, if you really think about it, is pretty boring especially by Hitchcock standards. We start "Rope" with, no surprise, a murder which is committed by two college students. One of them (John Dall) has complete confidence that they've committed the perfect crime, the other (Farley Granger) doesn't and becomes rather nervous. Other than the fact that they've committed a crime, why is Granger so nervous? Because Dall had the very head-strong idea to invite the victim's family, their friends, and a detective (James Stewart) over for a dinner party to basically make sure their crime is untraceable. Yeah, no wonder Granger is so nervous. One might be so wise as to say this is a very unwise idea and that this effectively proves why pride is a sin in a scenario like this. As you can probably tell, the story of "Rope", while efficiently told at a running time of less than an hour and a half, isn't really that interesting or groundbreaking. Hitchcock told this type of story many times before and there's no real twists to this one to make it stand out. Because there's no surprises, you can easily predict where the plot will go and you'd probably be right. The characters are pretty lame with the exception of James Stewart since he recognizes how unpleasant this dinner party seems to be. There's nothing really wrong with these people, but I just don't find much in these characters that make them memorable. They all just deliver whatever lines they have to say and get off screen as soon as possible. Some of the conversations the characters have are relatively pointless. There's one where they're talking about movie stars that immediately comes to mind. Once again, the only aspects about "Rope" that seem to work are its underlying ambition to make everything on screen feel like it's happening in real-time and James Stewart's performance. Aside from that, there isn't much here that will truly satisfy Hitchcock fans. If its story had more drama or twists, I'd be more impressed with the style Hitchcock was trying to go for here. As it is, "Rope" is an experiment that tries something new, but ultimately seldom delivers on its promise.</fullReview>

The only violent act occurs two minutes into the film (as Dick Hogan, in the role of David the murder victim, puts in a memorable cameo, his swan song in more ways than one, as he never appeared in another film, in any capacity) , the remainder, Nietzschean philosophising about murder and hypothesising about committing the perfect murder, intentionally humorous and simultaneously horrifying, at the dinner party. They throw open the curtains at sunset, revealing the bay windows overlooking Manhattan, light pours in, beautiful colour floods the room, the scene of the horrific crime. Later that same evening, after their crime is found out, the trunk is flung open, there is no need to show the victim again. To do so would be anticlimactic. Hitchcock knew to show restraint at that moment. After final gunshots, faint sirens crying in the distance tell what comes next. No further words were necessary.</fullReview>

It's a clever cinematic achievement, but if you're not aware of the experiment, it's just a rather stagy adaptation of a play that, from what I've read, was more effective than this movie.Still, it does keep things moving and there's just enough intrigue to keep you interested. And there are a couple of set pieces, one involving a metronome and another the clearing of a table, that show exactly how clever Hitchcock can be.Ultimately, Hitch tried to film a stage play in a stage-play way, and it didn't quite work.

		<shortDescription>An ambition drama from a master of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is renounced as one of Alfred Hitchcock's most ambitious films and his first colour film. It is a highly regarded film by his many fans and film buffs.Told in real time, Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and his submissive friend Phillip (Farley Granger) are two friends who murdered an old schoolmate thinking he is inferior. But Brandon is also a smug, arrogant man and celebrate the art of their crime by hosting a dinner party, inviting their victim's parents, his girlfriend, the friend's love rival and their old school house master, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart).One of the important elements of was it filmed as one long take with no breaks, leading the film to be in real time (and offering us one of the quickest dinner parties in history). Rope was based on a play the use of long take was able to keep the play setting whilst allowing the film to visually engaging. The camera flows naturally as we follow the characters and their actions and made for an organic experience, with the film feeling very grounded, using little music and focusing on the characters. A little detail I really liked was seeing the sky in background going darker during the running time. The best moments of tension come when Hitchcock focuses the camera on one particular thing, like focusing on Stewart's expression during a conversation and on the chest. But the moments where there are cuts are noticeable when the camera goes behind people's backs and there are two blatant cuts during the run time.Rope is very dialogue heavy film due to its set up and play origins. This is a very character driven film and has excellent acting constantly. Dall was fantastic in the lead, a psychopath who simply kills someone just to see what it is like and because he could, leading to his arrogance and cocky behaviour leading to him thinking he committed the perfect crime when it is anything but. Granger on the other hand is a much more nervous, jittery character who is stressed about his situation and quick to anger because of it. He is clearly a character way in way over his head. Whilst Stewart also gives a stellar performance, yet he is a man who has had a career of performances.Rope is an interesting film and I personally do love long takes in a films. It is a film that honours the stage play origins whilst making sure the film is cinematic. But whilst Rope is a solid film, there are better films in Hitchcock's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film you cannot half-watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you try and watch Hitchcock's 'Rope' half-heartedly, as I have done on a couple of occasions, it will probably seem talky, wooden, staged and despite its short sub 80 minutes, not ending soon enough.That it doesn't seem like a usual "Hitchcock" and no familiar face shows until about a third way in, when Jimmy Stewart - and his first Hitch flick - joins in, it all seems more Agatha Christie than the exciting pace and finale set-pieces of the Master of Suspense.However, it IS surprisingly easy to be gripped, if you allow it to. Follow the camera round, imagine it as a slow-moving armchair and the hidden genius is revealed. It's like a cat with a mouse; occasionally the cat loses its prey, but these are clever diversions from the Director.The conversations, even more so now, often seem trite but this intentionally lets our guard slip and then something is said or an object shown that has a profound effect on the whole film. And, these are trite, privileged individuals, who just like that toying cat, play deadly games with their fellow human beings, because it's fun and (so they think) it's clever and makes them look and feel a lot better than their peers.You could argue that, here Hitch is preparing, subconsciously, for his masterpiece, Psycho. The human psyche and its peccadilloes, a whole vast un-tapped world, at least cinematically, for the flourishing Great director to break into. It also isn't that surprising that Hitchcock didn't want to leave Rope as a filmed play, as everybody else probably would have and just had to embellish it with the now infamous semi- continuous takes.I haven't covered plot here. It's almost immaterial and to go into it again, pointless. It's either a film you watch - and 'get', or not. It has the potential to be a great film, but only to those to get past the Agatha Christie looking...Why 7/10 and not more? As everyone admits - and knows, it's not one of this great director's classics. It has limited appeal and whilst Alfred eeks out every ounce of watchability that he can summon, it is after all, a stagy, wooden and talky...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is always considered a fine technical craftsman of film, but he has always been perceived as something less of an artistic filmmaker in comparison to other world greats, such as Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, or even his fellow countryman David Lean. This is because as well plotted, acted, and directed as his films manifestly are, they appear to most critics as mere shiny baubles- all style and little substance. After all, Hitchcock took great pride in mass appeal; even going so far as being one of the few film directors to 'stoop' to active involvement in the 'lesser medium' of television. He also joyed in being termed the filmic 'master of suspense', implying that his films were geared toward the revelation of a plot point- usually the capture of a criminal, or not, and not some deeper existential queries.In the main, when one thinks of the top film names in the Hitchcock canon, this is true: Suspicion, Rear Window, North By Northwest, or Psycho. Yet, even in that list of immortal films, there are cracks in the theory. After all, Psycho's greatness is not merely dependent upon the revelation of Mother as Norman Bates, but the tale of the Janet Leigh character, her death and aftermath, how it effects ancillary characters, and what would become of Norman Bates; and let's pretend the sequels never happened. And what of The Birds? Pure chaos. Is the world doomed? We do not know. The film wisely ends on an ellipsis. The fact is that while Hitchcock's name and reputation were made on mass appeal and a Lowest Common Denominator style- albeit in the highest vein, there was a part of the technical master that wanted to be a true auteur, someone who would alternate between art films and pop cultural iconography. Unfortunately, the demands for financial success made the appearance of the 'artsy Hitch' all the more rare as his career went on.There were comedies like Mr. And Mrs. Smith, and Neo-Realist wannabe fare like The Wrong Man, which had measures of artistic success, but perhaps the best example of Hitchcock in full auteur mode comes from his first color film, 1948's Rope. It is a film based on the infamous 1920s Leopold and Loeb case, where two dilettante homosexual lovers in Chicago decided their superiority to the world entitled them to kill just for the fun of it. They murdered a fourteen year old boy, were caught, and sent to jail. While such overt things as homosexuality were verboten in mid-Twentieth Century Hollywood, due to production codes, it is there in full, on the screen in this film, and what amazes is how much more realistic the portrayal of homosexuals (albeit killers) and their relationship's power plays are in this nearly six decade old film than in the recent atrocious Brokeback Mountain, which indulged all the worst clichés of homosexuality. Yet, by not mentioning 'it' overtly, its ellipsis creates suspense, and forces the viewer to interpolate things into the gaps.Reputedly, the film's two lead actors, and its screenwriter, were gay, which only adds to the depth of watching and rewatching this film. Not only that, but Hitchcock makes a brilliant move early on in the film, right after the opening cameo of himself on the street (the other cameo is about 55 minutes into the film, as a red neon sign of Hitchcock's profile flashes in the background as the guests leave the party), and the credits. He shows us the two main characters strangling their friend David Kentley (Dick Hogan) to death. Thus, we know the film will not be a tired whodunit? And, as the film progresses, we know it will not even be a will they get caught? film, for the writing is so great, and the dialogue so precise, that it reads like a play of the sort that an Oscar Wilde may have penned had he done straight dramas. While film is a visual medium, it is one almost wholly dependent, in the sound era, upon words. Only Hitchcock's earlier Lifeboat was almost as dependent upon dialogue, although that film was not as needful of sharp repartee- Tallulah Bankhead aside. Of course, there are Wildean puns and ironies galore, such as the dead man's aunt looking at Phillip's hands, which just strangled her nephew, and saying, 'these hands will bring you great fame.' She means as a pianist, not strangler, but the viewer gets the joke. There are also other nods to murder, such as 'knock 'em dead,' 'I could strangle you,' and 'killing two birds with one stone,' which rise above cliché since we know that there is real foul play beneath their utterance?. Oddly lost in all the speculation about homosexuality in the film is the overt critique of Nazism and racism that the film presents, which is almost never commented upon by critics, even as Brandon condemns Hitler and the Nazis as moronic brutes. This aversion to the Lowest Common Denominator, by characters, runs through a number of Hitchcock films, but never is it more well expressed than when Brandon turns to Phillip, just after the murder, and says, 'Good and evil, right and wrong, were invented for the ordinary average man, the inferior man, because he needs them.' Then, of the dead David, he says, jokingly, 'Of course, he was a Harvard graduate. That might be grounds for justifiable homicide.'All in all, Rope is Hitchcock at his very best, without MacGuffins but with depth, clarity and, most of all, a vision, although, oddly a vision that is not primarily visual, even as Hitchcock knows exactly where and what should on screen at any given moment, for it is the screenplay which does all the heavy lifting of this film, and the weight it lifts is still nonpareil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suspenseful wonder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thoroughly engaging thriller that proves without a doubt that you don't need a booming score or haunting visual tricks to create a suspense and intrigue. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the most suspenseful film ever made; I was on the edge of my seat every second wondering how and if they will get caught. The idea of 'killing for the sake of killing' has always fascinated me and I felt that Hitchcock perfected the idea with seemingly flawless reasoning to boot. It sounds almost sadistic, but Brandon Shaw is one of the most relatable figures I've ever seen on film. He's highly intellectual and is a very good manipulater, but his superiority complex often gets the best of him and he thinks that he can get away with much more than he is actually capable of. Hitchcock displays the flaw of such intellect in the form of Brandon constantly brushing as close as he can to getting caught, but being so overly confident in his own intelligence that he doesn't think anyone could possibly figure it out.Phillip Morgan was the perfect black to Brandon's white. Another highly intelligent boy, he was constantly second guessing himself and his weariness made it blatantly clear that a wrong had been done. This presents the fact that if you are to perform the seemingly perfect crime, it is vital that you do it alone. However this is a contradiction, because if you are intelligent enough to perform the perfect crime than the desire to share your own accomplishment will boil inside of you until you crack. So I found that the film presents the idea that there is such thing as a perfect crime, even murder, but there is no way to get away with it since one way or another you will end up making yourself available to get caught. I found this to be a fascinating idea that Hitchcock brought to the forefront of a suspenseful masterpiece. Making it all take place in one room was a phenomenal and unique idea as well and he pulled it off flawlessly. The performances were perfect all around, especially from John Dall. James Stewart was also spectacular, as always. The only thing that I felt would have made the film better was if the boys would have gotten away with their crime, but in doing so Hitchcock would have given up the entire message of the story. If you perform, and get away with a perfect crime, the need to brag about your glorious efforts will result in your own demise. No less than a masterwork and one of the greatest films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic thriller a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's claustrophobic thriller is a riveting movie about the ethics of murder. Brandon and Phillip are two college friends who play a 'cat and mouse' game with their guests whom they have invited to a party in 'celebration' of the gruesome murder that they have just committed.Every character is played spot on, with good support from James Stewart, and an excellent performance (in the role of Phillip) by Farley Granger. And of course, Hitchcock's great direction, and his innovative cinematography ("Rope" is filmed with one continuous camera shot) don't do the film any harm.Yet another must see from the master.Sunday, July 11, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

I went crazy until it was on T.V. Then when I saw this movie and loved it. James Stewart gives a great performance and want to see his other movies like Rear Window or Mr.Smith Does to Washington. The other actors do a great job and is one of my favorite cast put together. This is a short film and has so much power and great film making in just 80 minutes. This film is only based on the apartment that were the killing took place and that leaves like you were in the killing and didn't want to be found and not many movies do that. This is one of my favorite movies and is great and is underrated and I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hard to digest movie and that includes everything, from theme to dialogs, from acting to direction and more importantly, story and script.Hitchcock movie is always a special but the way he treated this movie is just amazing. Movie is about homos but never in the movie, the very "word", is being used rather they case that as "it" as homosexuality is extremely controversial theme at the time. To be truthful I did not get this while watching the movie but eventually I got there while watching "Making of Rope". And I think that is what a director is all about.One more thing, to make a color movie in 1948 is something special and when the set is just a room it become more difficult.And above all, the main theme of killing the inferior by the superior is shocking. The way he presents that on celluloid is special. The talk of "Brandon" and "Rupert" is main stay where Hitchcock unfolds all the cards by telling the basic motive behind the killing.You need a big heart but a MUST WATCH?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much More Than a Technical Experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock has complained that the technological restrictions forced upon him during the making of "Dial M for Murder" (shot as a 3-D picture) kept him from making the film he wanted to make. It's his own self-imposed restrictions that make "Rope" one of his lesser efforts.Known of course as the film that is shot in one long take (actually about 7 or 8 ten-minute takes, with cleverly disguised edits to cover those places where the cinematographer had to replace camera reels), it is fascinating, like Hitchcock's "Lifeboat" from 4 years earlier, as an exercise in style. However, the storytelling and script suffered as a result, and the gimmick --let's see, how will Hitch pull this shot off -- becomes all you really remember about the film.But for me, the gimmick was enough to sustain my interest, and if you're a Hitchcock fan already, you'll want to see this as yet one more piece of evidence (as if another was needed) of Hitchcock's powerful influence as a cinema innovator.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rivals Hitch's best two films, Vertigo and Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Rope has always been one of those Hitchcock films which scholars ignore. It was probably dismissed when it first came out by audiences and critics alike (it was also dismissed by the director, who said he wished he hadn't done it). I am shocked to see that over 2000 imdb voters have rated the film, giving it a rating of 7.7, since it really is one of Hitchcock's least known films, or least studied, in any case. I suppose it does have Jimmy Stewart in it, so as many people could come upon it from that direction, too. According to this site, it looks as if Rope is receiving a new audience who appreciates it as it deserves.There are two common reasons why people claim they don't like it. 1) it is filmed in such a way so as to make it look as if it was filmed in one take. This appears gimmicky, and thus decreases the film's value for some, including Hitchcock himself. 2) it is based on a play. Filmed plays are very often dismissed, since they tend to seem stagey. The only really famous filmed play (that comes to my mind) is Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but I've seen that film dismissed likewise, also. Let's try to break through these two criticisms. In reply to the first criticism, I personally think that if the film was cut in a more classical style, it would be the film that people tend to categorize it as: just a plain movie, one of Hitchcock's lesser efforts. It HAS to be filmed as continuous. This adds a lot of suspense. In this film, time moves in real time, and it is always ticking down to the discovery (or the non-discovery, but since this was made under the Hayes Code, the discovery is the only option). To have it cut as a film normally is would fragment the time frame in our minds. The movie Nick of Time, starring Johnny Depp, is supposed to take place in real time, but it never seemed so since it was cut as any other film. The way in which the director tells us that time is moving normally is through the constant display of clocks, which just becomes annoying. With this single take technique, we are acutely aware, without ever being reminded what time it is, and that time is moving. From this, suspense builds up. Also, when Hitchcock wants to give us a close up of an object, e.g., the rope, instead of cutting to a close up of it, the camera is very slowly moved towards it. The camera moves in this film more than most films of the time, and a lot of films now. This works more like real life. People are generally bored by subtly moving cameras as opposed to classical cutting. This is because they are trained to like the cutting. It makes things seem quicker. This movie does move slowly. Its similar to mountain climbing. The tension is building steadily and slowly. By the end, my head was beating with it. I think I held my breath all through the final scene where Rupert comes back. As to the second criticism, I'd like to say that plays generally do make bad films. Then again, I generally hate plays. Theater only exists now because the bourgeoisie perceives it as a form of art that is generally beyond the comprehension of the plebes. Okay, so maybe it is less strong than that, but truly, film should have replaced theater long, long ago. Think about it: a play consists of actors being forced to speak lines in a volume so as to be heard by the audience. Thus, there is absolutely no room for subtlety. The most powerful moments of life do not come at this volume, but at a whisper. This cannot be shown in a stage play (in the classical theater, anyhow; I've seen alternative theater try to answer this before). Also, we can never see a stage actors face. The face and eyes contain the essence of acting, so therefore stage actors don't even really act. Well, they do, but the audience can't see it. The first close up of Lilian Gish should have erased theater as an art. This is why plays seem silly on the screen. They tend to conform to the stage way of doing things. Plays are written for the conditions on the stage, and one has to change them in order to film them. Rope is not done as a stage play at all. The camera movements, already mentioned, and placements, the framing, that is, are divine. The moment when we are watching Mrs. Wilson getting closer and closer to opening the chest, while simultaneously the backs of a few of the characters are on the right hand of the screen, though we can't see any faces, we hear them conversing about David, the murder victim who is in the chest, its just some great filmmaking. How can one ever dare to say that this film comprises solely of a play and does not contain Hitchcock? Also, to make a play into a film palatable, one needs fantastic acting. This is why Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is so successful (although the cinematography of Haskell Wexler also adds greatly to its success). Rope should be at the very least be notable for its acting. I think this may be Jimmy Stewart's best performance, even better than his role in Vertigo. For one thing, this play is extremely well written. The characters are all very, very complex and well written. But Stewart's delivery of Rupert's lines is just so fantastic. We realize his thoughts and see him thinking. This is hard to communicate in a film. Equally good are John Dall, Brandon, probably the main character of the film (pay close attention to the disparity of what he says and what he does), and Farley Granger as Philip. He gave two of the best performances in film in this and in another Hitchcock film, Strangers on a Train. He is often said to be overshadowed by Robert Walker's performance as Bruno in Strangers. I personally found Granger's character to be much more complex and just more well done than Walker's part. I identified with Granger and was afraid of Walker, which is how it should be in that film. In Rope, Granger is perfectly convincing as a nervous and almost unwilling murderer.From the comments I've seen on imdb and from the number of people who've seen it here, along with the relatively high rating it has here, it seems that the film is slowly gaining its deserved appreciation. I implore everyone who sees the film and loves it to tell everyone you know, even those who've never seen a Hitchcock film before, to watch this film. Someday in the future I hope that it will be considered to be equal to his very best, which would also include it among the best films ever made. 10/10</fullReview>

A pair of young men, imbued with a former professors Nietzschean theories of the "ubermann" commit a murder just for the "excitement". Yeah, sick puppies. One, played by John Dall, feels triumphant, and more or less tries to get caught. The other, played by Farley Granger, is wracked with guilt, and more or less also tries to get caught, for a different reason. He reminded me, more than anything else, of Raskolnikov. There were apparently a lot of homosexual overtones, but in truth I totally missed that, and just heard about it later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrogance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only word that can summarize the concept of this film is "arrogance." The arrogance of the two young men that, not only had they committed the perfect crime, but that they could flaunt it in the face of the victims' intimate relations- it is beyond belief for anyone but Alfred Hitchcock. Only Hitchcock could see the arrogance of young men extending this far. He had a sadistic streak (I love his movies, but you have to admit, he DID love to torture the audience) and enjoyed conveying the negative facets of individuals where most directors only wanted to show the positive sides. The two college "boys" who commit the murder even go so far as to invite a professor of theirs who is, possibly, the only man who could detect the crime. They're so positive that they cannot be caught; again, the arrogance! The whole concept is so unbelievable- and yet, horrifyingly plausible. Isn't that the reason we keep going back and watching Hitchcocks films, the fact that every one of his stories is, in its own way, possible? Doesn't everyone wonder if a flock of "The Birds" could swoop down upon their town? Doesn't everyone know someone who reminds them of Norman Bates? In fact, to quote a line that Mr. Bates himself once said, doesn't "everyone go a little mad sometimes?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two friends decide to murder a man to see what it's like. Soon begins a cat-and-mouse game, expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, very suave and sophisticated. My father (who disliked the film) once described it as if Hitch was trying to make everything very upper-class, and sophisticated, and "cool." In a way, this is true. The technicolor version I saw was very un-Hitchcock-ish, but still very good.All in all this is often looked over by most Hitchcock fans and I can see why - but it's still a classic, enjoyable movie that you must give a chance, even if you've never heard of it. Plus, James Stewart is SUPERB as usual.

		<fullReview>The more I look at Hitchcock movies, the more seconds thoughts I have. They're so artificial! I mean, they're more Theatre than Cinema. The sets are sometimes even laughable.Well sometimes they're brilliant in terms of scenery, and this guy had so many good ideas that it's difficult not to like his movies. Some are really outstanding (Rear window, Psycho..), some are kinda cheesy and suffer from many goofs (North by Northwest, Saboteur..). Anyway, after having seen so many good movies in my life, I can't help but wonder why Hitchcock movies are still SO praised.In "Rope", we have a rather well written "in camera" theatrical thriller, a typical theatrical/TV scenery (the camera shoots from the same side all along the movie, you never get to see one of the walls...), a 100% artificial set, a bunch of excellent actors, and the result is... OK. I mean from an artistic/theatrical point of view, it's rather good, but who would actually believe in the story it tells? And in the characters it shows us? They're so stereotyped. And the moral points.... hem... the idea is nice, but the development is shallow.And there's this scene where we are asked to believe Philip plays piano, when all he does actually is moving his hands over the keyboard. Oh, well.Looking at films like "Rope", while being entertaining, is somehow sterile. For people that never go and see theatrical plays, it may be impressive. But is it good cinema? I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock experiment that doesn't come off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of what ails "Rope" is inherited from the original play in which two deluded preppies murder a friend to demonstrate their "superiority." To make the deed even more daring and exciting, they dump the body into an old trunk and leave it there during a party to which the victim's parents amd fiancee have been invited. Typically, one of these supermen (poor Nietzsche takes it on the chin again) turns out to be a frantic weakling whose nervous behavior raises the suspicions of another guest, a former master at their school. Hitchcock's odd decision to film the story in real time forces viewers to endure the vapid party chatter and a stupid subplot in which the dominant killer of the pair amuses himself by trying to play Cupid. Fortunately, the party falls flat and breaks up early. Good thing. The guests and the hosts are both boring. The Farley Grainger character is such a whining bundle of nerves that you may wish that he had been strangled instead of the victim. As the dominant partner in crime, John Dall is such a slimy creep that you wonder how he could have any friends but he does smirk very nicely. He imagines that his former master, who casually jokes about the uses of murder might even appreciate his deed even if he might not be "superior" enough to actually do it. Is there any doubt that the master (James Stewart) will figure out what they did and be appalled by his own contribution to it? Minimal suspense and some boring stretches. Neither Hitchcock nor anyone else tried filming without obvious cutting and in real time again. No wonder. It's like watching a bad play...which is what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all bad, but it's disappointing in comparison to Dial M for murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brandon (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger) strangle their inferior classmate David Kentley (Dick Hogan) and hide his body within their apartment. As a way of challenging the perfection of their crime, they host a party in their apartment and to add to the excitement and danger amongst the guests are David's father Mr Kentley (Cedric Hardwicke) and his aunt Mrs Atwater (Constance Collier). To further increase the excitement, they also invite their old school teacher Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) who they class as being a superior being and someone who may possibly suspect that something is not right once he arrives. With all these people at the party and with the perceptive Cadell in tow, will Brandon and Philip still be able to get away with their so called 'perfect crime'?In some ways, my plot summary has probably made this film sound exciting and it is, at least on paper. It starts out interesting; Brandon describes the guests that are going to be coming to the party, we have Philip who I felt had been coerced into assisting Brandon with this crime - it's clear that Brandon is in control the whole time.Like Dial M for Murder, this is another Hitchcock film that has been adapted from a stage play. Therefore, I did expect it to be dialogue heavy, but Rope wasn't just dialogue heavy, it was more like dialogue overload. It was just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.... well you get the point there. I wouldn't have minded if all the talk was relevant to the plot, but it seemed at times that the film went off at a tangent and a lot of the characters were talking about things that weren't relevant to anything. Added to this, the film also felt rather pretentious and 'artsy fartsy' and to be honest I didn't buy into this 'inferior' and 'superior' beings rubbish. I did find myself rather bored with this film at times and this is not something that you can say about most of Hitchcock's films and this is coming from someone who is a big fan of Hitchcock. With the possible exception of Brandon, Philip and Cadell the rest of the characters were quite thinly written and uninteresting (which again is not something that you can usually say about Hitchcock's films). Maybe it's just that the sight of a load of toffs at a dinner party having their pretentious conversations that just wasn't of particular interest to me.The saving grace with this film is James Stewart's character Cadell; once he appears on screen the film really goes up a gear and does start to become interesting; Cadell quickly becomes suspicious of Philip and Brandon and starts probing them for information; he's a clever man and Brandon and Philip are clearly unnerved by his presence. The best aspect of this film was towards the end where the psychological battle of wits occurs between Brandon and Cadell - I won't say anymore than that, but if you can make it past the rather dull first 60 minutes then it's well worth the wait.Another problem with this film is that it's surprisingly formulaic and also lacked any real tension or suspense - there also wasn't really any great plot twists (which is disappointing when you think how clever Dial M for murder was). I don't blame Hitchcock for the film's failings as I can see that he was only credited as the Director and once again his directing was superb. Arthur Laurents was the man responsible for the screenplay and ultimately it's here where the film fails as it's far too talky, pretentious and rather unspectacular. Then again, if it's a faithful adaptation then I can only assume that it just wasn't my cup of tea.Another saving grace with this film is with the acting; Dall was terrific as Brandon - he's cold and calculating on the inside and charming on the outside. It's clear that Milland emulated this style in Dial M for murder also to great effect. Dall was a true joy to watch. Granger was excellent as Brandon's somewhat nervous co-conspirator Philip. I thought Granger was a bit wooden in Strangers on a Train, but in this earlier effort he was much better. Stewart was as reliable as ever, but this was hardly ground breaking for him. The rest of the cast didn't really make that much of an impact, but I suppose they all did OK.If you're a fan of Hitchcock then it's probably worth checking out (if only to tick it off your list). However, for anyone else I wouldn't bother with it. It's only 82 minutes long, but it still felt like there wasn't really enough plot even to sustain the rather short running time which I can only assume is the reason that there was so much 'filler' in the middle. My advice would be to check out Dial M for murder instead.</fullReview>

'Rope' is the story of two college men, Brendon and Philip, who murder their fellow student David, hide him a chest and have people come over for dinner and fool them. Yet, it is obvious from the start that their plans won't go as planned since Philip feels guilty of committing the murder and their professor, Rupert, is also coming over. Soon, Rupert becomes suspicious of their activities and decides to investigate himself. The movie is a normal Hitchcock film, yet I didn't feel as much suspense as I normally do when I see a Hitchcock film. James Stewart played his character well, as usual. The two actors that played Brendon and Philip also did very well. Yet, this movie does not measure up to the great storyline normally produced by Hitchcock ('Psycho' for example). Overall, it was a well done movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's first color and also one of his most experimental movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Hitchock movies always had been experimental in some ways, making his movies often something unique and spectacular, even by todays standards. But this movie is perhaps more experimental and daring than most of his other projects. What makes this movie unique and experimental is that the entire movie consists out of 10 long shots.It makes the movie perhaps look and feel more like a stage-play but it still manages to give the movie a typical movie look and feel to it. Notmally when you film a stage-play as a movie it rarely ever works out but somehow Hitchcock manged it but picking a fascinating and provoking subject and characters.Of course the movie relies heavily on its main concept and story of 2 young men killing one of their friends because they feel intellectual superior to him, which they think, gives them the right to commit murder. As if this isn't enough already they decide to test the perfection of their carefully planned and executed plot by inviting a couple of their friends and even the victim's parents, while is body is still in the room. They drop small hints, which soon rises the suspicion of one of their old teacher's, played by James Stewart.It's a provoking movie with its subject, that isn't just being black and with but also questions its themes in a sophisticated manner. It raises a couple of discussions with its well written dialog and actors delivering them.Fore of course the movie is also relying on its actors. After all, the main actors are in frame for basically the movie its entire running time and there are no in between cuts to conceal a badly delivered line or other goof-ups. It relies on the professionally of the actors and therefor the movie also uses some real typical stage actors. Its acting style isn't always compelling but luckily there also is still James Steward who with his acting style counterweights some of the overly typical stage style of acting. I though he played a great role in this movie and it shows him like we didn't get to see him too often. For his role he was also made to look older than he was in real life.Despite it's obviously very restrained locations and room to move the movie never gets dull or slow. The pace at all times remains good and steady, which of course also is thanks to its limited running time of about 80 minutes.It's a small and simple movie from Hitchcock that is still daring and unique. It's daring that he had to guts to make a movie with an approach like this one had and unique through its successful execution. Perhaps in a way you could say that this movie was a sort of practice for his later "Rear Window", that shows some similarities to this movie in its approach and also stars James Stewart in it.Hitchcock's first color is not just unique and fascinating because of its color!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis is most definitely the most underrated Alfred Hitchcock film out there. I mean, it is basically one scene and there is almost no suspense whatsoever but the acting is brilliant and the long shots are really unique and make the film more into a play. You also feel for Brandon and Phillip. It is quite obvious that they are "it," in the words of the crew and cast for Rope. I also find the way of Rupert finding out of the murder to be very smart. There is also very dry humor in this movie.Here is the plot of this movie. Two men named Brandon and Phillip murder another man named David. They kill him because of art. They put his body in a chest. To celebrate their "perfect murder" they invite David's friends and family over, along with their headmaster from prep school named Rupert. They pretend that the party if for David's father and Phillip. Brandon, whom you know is more ruthless than Phillip, kind of gives hints at the party about the murder. Phillip, who was nervous from the beginning, starts to become even more nervous and drink. When everyone leaves Rupert discovers that that they murdered David. Rupert alerts the citizens by shooting a gun out they window.Overall, this is a fantastic and very underrated movie by Alfred Hitchcock. I also find the ending to be brilliant. I mean, it is just so silent. Brandon is having a drink, Phillip is playing the piano, Rupert is sitting next to the chest with the gun in his hand, and in the background you can faintly hear people talking and police sirens. I also find the beginning of this movie to be very strong. I mean, it opens with a man being strangled. By the way, Hitchcock's cameo is at the beginning and he is seen from a bird's eye view. Anyway, this is a great movie that a fan of Hitchcock should not miss.9/10Recommended Films: Vertigo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock takes on cosmopolitan degeneracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though he's known as the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock tried his hand at a little social commentary with Rope and proved himself more than equal to the task.Brandon (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger) are two old school chums who are holding a party. They tell everyone it's to celebrate Philip's impending first public performance as a pianist. The truth is it's to celebrate their murder of another old school chum, David Kentley (Dick Hogan). The film opens with Brandon and Philip strangling David and stuffing his body in a trunk. They didn't kill him because they disliked him or because he owed them money. They did it for the thrill and as an experiment to prove they are the sort of superior intellects who can pull off the perfect murder. Philip is immediately disturbed by what they've done, while Brandon shrugs it off like it was nothing. To Brandon, the killing was just the first step. He's just as excited about the party. He's invited David's father and mother, David's girlfriend and her ex-boyfriend for some pleasant conversation and food served off the trunk where David's body is hid. He also invited Rupert (James Stewart), who was the prep school house master for Brandon, Philip and David. As the party unfolds, Brandon plays little games with his guests, Philip comes more and more apart at the seams and Rupert begins to suspect the terrible thing that has happened.While certainly suspenseful, Rope is first and fundamentally an attack on the sort of cynical, urbane sophistication that makes a mockery of good and bad, right and wrong, morality and decency. Brandon believes the superior man, such as himself, should have the right to murder if he chooses. It's a belief that had been cultivated in him by Rupert back in school, as Rupert is the sort of misanthropic intellectual who finds sport in everything that others find dear. There's even a discussion on the advantages of murder but while Rupert treats it humorously, Brandon is deathly serious. For Rupert is the sort of fellow who says outrageous things and thinks he believes them without ever appreciating what he's saying. Brandon, however, has no inner core of morality and ethics and such thoughts fill up the emptiness inside him.The acting in Rope is quite good. Stewart and Dall do excellent jobs playing two sides of the same coin. They create characters that seem so similar on the surface, yet the way they say the same things lets you detect the deep differences between them. And while his role is less complex, Farley Grainger does equally well as a man falling apart from guilt and fear. He's able to take Philip and make him seem just a little bit worse, a little bit more unhinged at each moment in the story until he finally snaps at the end. The other actors are given their own moments in the story's spotlight as well and they all manage to shine. Some of the dialog might sound a bit dated in the early 21st century, but it's still sharp and clever.Rope is also noteworthy as probably one of the greatest adaptations ever of a stage play into a movie. Hitchcock filmed the script as a series of long scenes shot with a single camera in one continuous take, essentially putting the audience "on stage" as the play is performed around them. He moves the camera throughout the apartment where the murder and party take place almost like it was another person, invisibly observing the goings on. Often, while the camera is focused on particular characters you can dimly hear the conversations of other party goers happening off screen.As wonderful a job as Hitchcock does though, it's hard not to think that a remake of Rope might be a good idea. The tools the great director had to work with in the late 40s are quite crude by today's standards. While the things Hitchcock does with the camera in Rope would have been cutting edge then, it's rather primitive compared to modern storytelling technology.Rope may be the finest expression of Hitchcock's visual skill as a filmmaker and is definitely a must-see for any fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dated "experiment" that fails to engage its issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Rope remains an unusual cinematic experiment - but not much more than an experiment. A number of factors may contribute to its current status as a curio, even in Hitchcock's oeuvre.First of all, the movie is beholden to its source material, a stage play, adapted for the screen by Hume Cronyn, which had been based loosely on the notorious Leopold-Loeb thrill killing. (Two brilliant young college students who were also closeted gays murdered a young boy to show they could get away with it by dint of superior intellect).In the movie, a couple of Manhattan young-men-about-town, still inflamed with Nietzsche's Ubermensch/Superman rhapsodies of their fairly recent college days, strangle a buddy and host a dinner party over his dead body. And though Hitchcock drenches this grim gathering with every cinematic gimmick he can shove in, it still feels stagy. (Rope preserves the famous try at an entire movie shot in a single `take,' although it is really several long takes spliced together - and from a modern point of view, none too adroitly. Did nobody notice there were so many extreme closeups of the back of men's dark suitcoats?.And, except for the opening shot in the street, we're stuck in that studio-like penthouse living room. Couldn't we have taken a glimpse into the kitchen where housekeeper Edith Evanson was plating the pate and the cold roast fowl? Or, more provocatively, into the fellows' bedrooms (or is it bedroom)? By keeping us so confined, counting the silver, as it were, Hitchcock seems to trivialize his subject by reducing it to a parlor game - a thriller of manners.The late forties, also, was not the most hospitable era for exploring the gay subtext. Subtext? Without acknowledging the principals' sexual orientation, the movie makes even less sense than it does. Though Hitchcock went so far as to engage, as the homicidal twosome, John Dall (generally assumed to be gay, as Joseph H. Lewis, who cast him in Gun Crazy the following year, reveals) and Farley Granger (certainly at least rumored to be gay), their relationship is left to be inferred. Still, it's kind of fun to watch the codes that were in operation in mid-century, with smokescreens about `roommates' and `eligible bachelors' and `fiancees.' But basically the movie has to remain coy about one of its intrinsic premises.And James Stewart doesn't add much to the party. A few years later, in Rear Window and, particularly, Vertigo, Hitchcock coaxed excellent, against-type performances from him. But, in Rope, he's the chief windbag in a movie gone stale from all the gusts of hot air generated by the interminable ethical discourse.There's enough in Rope to keep it watchable, what with the gaydar-free housekeeper fussing and fretting over every last detail to ensure the success of her boys' soiree, and the shifting skyscapes outside the windows, and the collation lovingly laid out atop the chest concealing the corpse. But this is a movie where Hitchcock sought refuge in technique rather than grappling with the psychological underpinnings of his plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Experiment That Doesn't Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a stage play which was in turn based upon the infamous Leopold-Loeb case, ROPE is famous for two technical reasons. First, it is a very rare instance of a film that occurs in "real time;" the entire action of the film occurs in the span of about two hours, which is the duration of the film's run time. Secondly, in order to heighten the effect of "real time," Hitchcock attempts to make the film seem as if it is presented in one long, uninterrupted take. Instead of cutting, he moves the camera itself instead and attempts to disguise points at which the film had to be changed in the camera by briefly focusing the camera on a dark or neutral object.It doesn't work. There are several reasons. Although the story has some interesting aspects, it seems extremely contrived: two friends thrill-kill a young man and then as a test of their coolness conceal the body in their apartment while they host a cocktail party. Guest Jimmy Stewart becomes suspicious and, predictably, ferrets out the truth. Stewart's performance is merely adequate, while Farley Granger and John Dall's performances are about as subtle as a turd in the punch bowl.This aside, all the actors seem to have considerable difficulty sustaining energy through the very long takes, and Hitchcock's self-enforced "no edits" concept gives the film a static, stagy, and decidedly awkward feel--and, I might add, the "invisible cuts" aren't. Certainly Hitchcock deserves considerable applause for attempting something completely different in his work, but in this case the gamble doesn't pay off. Die-hard Hitchcock fans will no doubt find much to praise, but more casual viewers should stay away.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

Farley Granger who plays the openly insecure partner is so constantly in a panic its ridiculous , while John Dall's character the supposedly ''clever'' one of the two has to continuously make excuses for his partner well after he falls on his face time after time . How these two could mistake themselves for superior is a mystery , how an audience is supposed to swallow it ...

		<shortDescription>Technically innovative but still one of Hitchcock's weakest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rope' is never able to rise above being an interesting gimmick. I feel as if Hitchcock was trying to get to the essence of what he could do with the utmost minimalism in terms of setting and it is an interesting experiment but I think it doesn't work quite as well as we might have hoped. 'Rope' deserves to be looked at from that technical standpoint but it in looking at the film's acting and screenplay we see it's shortcomings. One cannot call Hitchcock subtle but 'Rope' is practically histrionics and it seems odd and disjointed in this small setting.The problem resides with John Dall as Brandon who has no gift for subtlety in his performance. He over punctuates every line of dialogue and everything is done with a grin and a sly wink in the eye. I get that Hitchcock probably intended to showcase the nerve and joy of this character but instead of coming across as evil it is actually kind of funny in some parts. The most jarring example is when Dall goes into his bit about this philosophy at the table. He practically screams sociopath and seeing the other characters react nonchalantly just stretches the realms of credibility too much. We are lead to identify with this character and part of us no doubt is encouraged by Hitchcock to want him to get away with this murder. Wouldn't the picture work so much better if Dall had reigned in the excess or waited until later to indulge in it? We don't like him and we don't identify with him because he is so loud.There isn't much of a progression in the dialogue either and so maybe Dall isn't entirely to blame. Stewart's character practically finds out everything he needs to solve the mystery after that big dinner scene. The question is is Hitchcock deliberate in these decisions? Part of me wants to say yes. I think he thought he had to raise the stakes as much as possible to make the film work. The reason this is one of the lesser Hitchcock films though is that there is no build up because of Dall's performance and this dialogue. This could have been more successful if it didn't come out of the gate with all cylinders running. Hitchcock was never one for a slow burn thriller however and I think 'Rope' would work best that way.'Rope' is entertaining and it cannot be denied that from a technical point it is a triumph. It just doesn't stand up next to some of Hitchcock's beloved films. It's different though and definitely worth a view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even a failed experiment can sometimes yield interesting results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were two highly intelligent University of Chicago students who, in 1924, kidnapped and murdered a teenage boy named Bobby Franks, apparently motivated by their study of the philosophy of Nietzsche and their belief that they were Nietzschean "supermen", free from the normal constraints of morality. The carrying out of an otherwise motiveless murder was seen as a way of asserting that freedom. A number of films have been based on their case, such as "Compulsion", "Swoon" (which have not seen) and "Murder by Numbers" from 2002, which moves the action from 1920s Chicago to modern California. Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope", however, was the first cinematic treatment of the subject and also updates the action. Patrick Hamilton's 1929 play on which the film is based was set in twenties London, but Hitchcock relocates it in the New York of the forties. This allows him to give the case a greater contemporary relevance; one character compares Nietzsche's philosophy to Nazism, a comparison which, for obvious reasons, would not have been available to Hamilton. In this version the protagonists are named Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan. The two young men, former classmates at school, are rather older than Leopold and Loeb (aged 19 and 18 at the time of their crime) and are not university students. They are clearly from privileged backgrounds, as they share a luxurious New York penthouse. (We know it is in New York because a panoramic view of the Manhattan skyline is visible from the windows). In the opening scene they strangle another former classmate, David Kentley and hide his body in a large wooden chest. They then host a dinner party, the guests at which include the victim's father and aunt, his fiancée Janet, and Rupert Cadell, a former schoolmaster who once taught Brandon, Philip and David. In a macabre touch, they serve the food from the chest in which the body is hidden. The was the first film Hitchcock shot in colour, and is notable for a number of reasons. It is one of the few films to observe the Classical unities of time, place and action. ("Twelve Angry Men" is another well-known example). Not only does it take place in real time, but it also takes place in a single location, Brandon and Phillip's flat. The murder occurs in the late afternoon, and the passing of time is shown by the setting sun, the darkening of the sky outside and by lights coming on in the buildings. Hitchcock filmed "Rope" in a series of long takes, carefully edited to look like one single continuous shot. (He was interested in experimenting with long takes during this part of his career; they also feature in his next film, "Under Capricorn")Another Classical element present in the film is the idea of hubris and nemesis, a common concept in Greek tragedy. Brandon in particular is supremely arrogant, convinced of his own intellectual superiority, the attitude which the Greeks would have characterised as hubris. Nemesis comes in the form of Cadell, who becomes convinced there is something mysterious about David's failure to attend the party at which he was supposed to have been a guest. He concludes that his former pupils are hiding some guilty secret and turns detective. Several Hitchcock films ("Strangers on a Train" is another) appear to have a gay subtext, and "Rope" is one of them. It has often been suggested (there is little direct evidence one way or the other) that Leopold and Loeb were homosexual, especially after Loeb was stabbed to death in prison in 1936, by another prisoner to whom he had allegedly made unwanted sexual advances. In 1948 the Production Code forbade any direct reference to homosexuality, but indirect references were much more difficult for the censors to forbid, and it would certainly be possible to interpret the relationship between Brandon and Phillip as a sexual one. Both roles are excellently played by John Dall and Farley Granger respectively. Dall's Brandon is the dominant personality, outgoing, arrogant and supremely self-confident. Granger's Phillip is more submissive, nervous and self-doubting. Although we do not see the discussions between the two which led up to the murder, it seems clear that it was Brandon's idea to kill David and that Phillip was dragged into the crime by the force of Brandon's personality. The weak link is, oddly, James Stewart's Cadell. Cadell's role in the drama goes beyond that of the amateur sleuth who uncovers Brandon and Phillip's crime. He is also, in a sense, morally complicit in that crime in that it was he who introduced the concepts of Nietzsche's philosophy to them while at school and had discussed with them, apparently in an approving way, the idea of murder as an intellectual game. Early on in the party, before his suspicions are fully aroused, we see him joking about murder in a rather tasteless way. When he realises that Brandon and Phillip have taken him seriously, however, he is horrified by what they have done. Careless talk costs lives. At this stage in his career, Stewart was best-known for playing sympathetic characters, and seemed ill at ease with a more morally ambiguous one. (In later films such as "The Naked Spur" he was to play partly unsympathetic characters more successfully). Hitchcock allegedly called "Rope" an 'experiment that didn't work out'. To some extent I would agree with his assessment, in that it is certainly not his best film, but it is also far from his worst. I would certainly prefer it to something like, say, "Dial M for Murder", another film based on a stage play and largely set in a single flat. Both films can at times seem rather static and dominated by talk, but "Rope" is better acted and holds more interest for the modern viewer. Even a failed experiment can sometimes yield interesting results. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough without the gimmick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to this film because of its "gimmick" -- the idea that the entire film takes place in real time and was filmed in only eight takes -- 80 minutes of one long shot after another. Once I began viewing the film, however, I forgot about the gimmick. The acting, plot-line, and dialogue are all good enough that they could have survived without the gimmick, which really does nothing to add or detract from the film in any way. By today's standards, some of the dialogue might seem a bit overblown, and some of the performances a little hammy, but considering that the film comes from the late '40's, I enjoyed it. I actually think that it could have been scarier if Hitchcock had allowed himself to play around with close-ups and points of view. I have a feeling that he went with one long shot after another only to prove the fact that he's a genius and could do anything he wanted to. That "Rope" is still a suspenseful, engaging film despite the unusually long takes is proof enough of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Not just yet. Let's stay this way for a minute."This is the story of two overconfident killers who put their perfect crime to the ultimate test: diner with the victim's family. The movie is an adaptation of the play with the same name, which in turn is loosely based on real events. The movie has interesting direction, very good actors and a questionable script.Alfred Hitchcock is the man behind this movie, conceived as an experiment in film making. The entire picture is a series of 10 continuous shots, each about 8 minutes in length. The result is a stage play, where the camera mingles with the characters, telling the story in first person. The camera moves rather nimbly, considering the difficulties involved and the amount of work that goes on behind it's back, so to speak. The experiment succeeds, in that the movie accomplishes what it set out to do: long continuous shots. It also fails, however, in that it is not a movie, but a play. The gimmick wears out by the second or third shot, and from then on it doesn't feel that fresh anymore.The actors do a fantastic job and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are actors, not just some pretty faces. On the other hand, the constant strain of remembering the lines and delivering them in a meaningful way kind of flattens their act. After all, it is a tremendously difficult job to express the sheer amount of emotion required, all the time, every time.Continuing on the subject of the actors, I was rather disappointed because I was expecting James Stewart to be the main character, yet he only showed up half way into the movie. I was quite interested to see him pull it of, not some guy I didn't quite know before, no offense intended to John Dall and Farley Granger, who deliver a very strong and intense performance. I mean... what happened? Did Mr. Stewart show up late for work and they switched roles on him? Or was he the Bruce Willis of the day, and he would've saved everybody? Not sure. A bit of false advertisement there.The script. The script is quite predictable and showing the murder in the first minutes didn't help matters, because it removed any uncertainty in the viewers mind, and because it also looked quite silly, if there can be such a thing as a silly murder.Rope. Incredible achievement from a technical point of view, but if I wanted to see a play I would have gone to the theater. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rope (1948) **** (out of 4) Terrific Alfred Hitchcock thriller is his most underrated film in my humble opinion. Two college students (John Dall, Farley Granger) strangle their classmate just for the thrill of it but try to push thing further when they have people over for dinner while the boy's body is inside a trunk where they're serving food. I'm really not sure why this film doesn't get more four-star reviews but this is a film that keeps getting better and better with each new viewing. I think the one minor flaw is in the ten-minute stretches that Hitchcock directed in because this makes the edits stand out really bad. Outside of that I think this film is flawless from start to finish with terrific performance and the director's magic touch bringing some terrific suspense. I think another real key is having James Stewart basically play a small supporting role, although it's a very important one. Both Dall and Granger are terrific in their roles and perfectly carry the film and that's why I think it's great having someone as strong as Stewart in a supporting role to push the suspense over the edge (not to mention Stewart's great comic timing). Another strong aspect is the dialogue that really pushes the 80-minute running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Experimental long takes only make the film even more stage-bound...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't regard ROPE as one of Hitchcock's major achievements. His decision to film in long takes (one reel at a time) seems an arrogant one, as arrogant as the leading character (JOHN DALL) and his scheme to invite friends of a murdered man to the apartment shared with FARLEY GRANGER. He and his partner have murdered the victim and placed his body in a chest upon which they intend to hold a buffet for invited guests.Anyone familiar with the Leopold and Loeb case can see where Patrick Hamilton got his inspiration for the play he wrote. They arrogantly went about committing what they thought would be the perfect murder, just to show the world how superior they were. The same motivation is present here--as the young men attempt to prove (especially to their mentor, JAMES STEWART), that they are above the law because of their supreme intelligence.Much of the suspense lies in wondering just how and when the men will be caught in a trap--and Hitchcock has given many a moment his touch with exposure of the crime almost within reach.Unfortunately, the long takes only make the tale even more theatrical than it was on stage. JOAN CHANDLER, CEDRIC HARDWICKE, CONSTANCE COLLIER and DOUGLAS DICK give fine support as invited guests, but as an experiment, the film largely fails to produce the sort of edge of your seat suspense it was striving for. Most distracting is watching the Cyclorama skyline change gradually as the evening progresses.Summing up: A critical and box-office failure, it remains a Hitchcock experiment that he admits was a mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films adapted from plays have always a good chance of failing. Point is proved again with the experimental Rope, a behind-closed-doors movie that felt like an eternity despite a barely 1h20 duration.The plot is uninteresting because there is absolutely nothing at stake, everything unfolds like one could have imagined it from the start. And it isn't unfortunately the shallow characters, nor the dialogues more insipid from one to another except maybe the last exchange, that manage to compensate for the general mediocrity.Only the cinematography prevents Rope from being a total disaster. And even so, the point of suggesting a single shot, which cuts are clearly visible anyway, isn't particularly evident. One also has to note the lighting being quite bad for the majority of the movie, perhaps because it was the first time Hitchcock filmed in color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently this movie is underrated. Virtually most of the reviews I have seen here are rating it highly. Perhaps it was underrated until now. It is rightly underrated, it is very poor indeed. I was going to give it a 1 but I gave it a 2, it's a Hitchcock after all! I've got a number of Hitch movies in my collection, this was one I wanted to add to it. I didn't know anything about it but I knew the title and for some reason I was thinking it was a classic. Perhaps I had read the reviews here before. When I bought the movie I thought it was strange that it was hidden away in the Hitchcock movies, thinking as I was at the time that it was supposed to be a classic. It was rightly hidden away from the the good Hitch movies.The whole premise is ridiculous. I know it's based on a real event but it's no more a very nasty schoolboy prank than the real event and is certainly not the subject of an entertaining or thrilling movie (which this isn't).The lead character, Brandon, is an out and out dork (that's me being polite). He waxes lyrical about the intellectual beauty of murdering someone for the sake of it. Presumably he enjoyed the sound of his own voice, I can't imagine anyone else enjoying it. He really is an obnoxious character and just having to look and listen to him had me wanting to switch off very early on but I persevered.Equally, I found it very slow going. I (wrongly) thought that it was a slow burner and would explode into a gripping tale. No such luck.So it's a play shot for the cinema. It looks like a play, a very bad one. Apparently the play was a success, I can't think why.Don't get me wrong, the night before I watched Dial M For Murder, which is also a play shot for the screen, and what a contrast! One of Hitch's best versus one of his worst! Come to think of it, I think it is the worst Hitch movie I have seen.This is the movie in a nutshell: Two half-wits murder a pal. They invite some people around and all-but tell one of them (their old teacher) what they did. He tells them they are crazy and turns them in. That's your plot. That's your movie. So so disappointing.I was waiting for a clever deduction of the crime. There wasn't one. I felt the other guests might play a part in the deduction, nope. I think they were there to pad out the time, though the girlfriend character was good and had some good lines.I watched the extra feature about the movie. In it they spoke of homosexuality in the picture, and much has been said here about it. I didn't notice it, they just came across as pals to me but I suppose you can make a homosexual angle on just about anything.Yes it was an experiment too, giving the impression of being one shot. The film changes with a close up of someone's back were very deliberate. Hitch said later it wasn't such a great idea.There were two "Hitchisms" that at least gave me some reward for watching it all the way through. The increasing speed of the metronome as Rupert (James Stewart) interrogated Phillip (Farley Granger), and the building suspense as the housekeeper cleared the items from the chest before attempting to open it, while we hear the main players talking out of shot.As I say in my summary, the biggest thing I got from this movie was disappointment. Expecting a classic and getting a very limp effort instead. Believe me, it's bad. Don't watch it if you're tired, you won't make it to the end. That said, you might be doing yourself a favour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay drama; not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two pompous young men (John Dall, Farley Granger) commit a murder just for the thrill and satisfaction of pulling off the perfect crime. They hide the body in their living room and then host a cocktail party as if nothing happened. But one guest, their old prep school house master (James Stewart), is suspicious right from the start.Hitchcock wanted to experiment in filming longer takes, up to ten minutes long, rather than the typical take of just a few seconds. The result makes the movie look like a staged play, with the story taking place in just one room, no action, and a lot of talking. James Stewart goes against his usual nice-guy persona to play a cynical and sarcastic man who thinks he knows more than everyone else. He's not likable and that detracts from the story. Dall is charismatic and frightening as the more confident of the killers but Granger's weakling character is too highly-strung, too obviously guilty right from the start. Some subtlety was called for and is missing. All of the supporting actors overact throughout with the exception of Cedric Hardwicke, who is wonderful as a concerned party guest.The dialogue is too perfect and stagy with everyone taking turns speaking politely and with perfectly measured wit; no one interrupts or pauses and it's not at all realistic. There's never any doubt that the killers will be discovered which eliminates any possible tension or excitement; there is no hero to root for and the villains are too loony to care about. Not one of Hitchcock's better movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing plot concept but not fully developed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rope is well cast and grabs your attention immediately with the opening scene. However, I find it somewhat hard to believe that Phillip Morgan could divulge the truth so quickly. Having a party without removing the body from the crime scene also seems incredibly stupid, but at least the murderers could have temporarily put the body in a place it wouldn't be discovered. The chest was known for keeping the books that one of the party guests came specifically to look at. The entire movie takes place in 1 location in 1 evening which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, I would have found the movie much more believable if it occurred over several days and the murderers left more clues. Talking about murdering people when just about everybody at the party is worried why one of the characters, David, hasn't shown up just seems too easy for Jimmy Stewart to pick up on. Also, I think it would be much better if more was made of Stewart being given the victim's hat accidentally when he leaves the party. It doesn't make sense to me that he remains silent when everybody is still at the party and worried about where David is. It also was risky for him to come back alone when the party is over.There's also one scene that I'm not sure was intentionally funny. Jimmy Stewart returns to the party claiming he forgot his cigarette case and there's this silly conversation about his character having another drink. Finally, Philip blurts out, "He said you can have another drink!!" Philip's character was almost campy as he frequently overplayed his lines.Lastly, I think the film would have been much more intriguing and memorable if Stewart's character is never quite sure if Brandon and Phillip are guilty of anything. The movie "American Psycho" with Christian Bale played on this theme and I was very impressed with that movie. Even when Bale's character tells his friends he's psychotic, they laugh and brush him off. Many people believe what they want to believe despite the evidence because of their prejudices and inclination to stereotype criminals. This film is similar in that Brandon and Philip are well to do and look like the type of fellows your parents would want you to date.Rope is worth watching if you're interested in Hitchcock's work although it could use some improvements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Straw Man Argument</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to deal with usual cinema fare in this review, the acting, cinematography, music and pacing are irrelevant insofar as I'm concerned, what matters is the strength of the argument. This film is seemingly opposed to the idea of Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the 'Overman', two men perform a murder believing themselves to be such beings (though the scared man's performance in this regard is very unconvincing) and then hold a dinner party to show they can get away with it. Ignoring the fact that the corpse would likely empty it's bowels and the gig would be up, so to speak, and that very much of the movie was contrived, the fact remained that at the end this films sentiment that no such hypothetical 'Overman' is beyond the constraints of any posited good or evil was not dealt with to any extent whatsoever. The discoverer of their plot makes claims of right, 'What right' did they do this thing by? Well if the writer understood Nietzsche in the slightest he would recognise that Nietzsche has no such conception, putting all things down to stemming from power, and that this murder would simply be an expression of power, which it basically was, having no other motive. To talk about 'rights' with someone who does not believe in such things is sophistry pure and simple, there is no logical defence against the argument, merely an attempt to appeal to the emotions of the audience, and as our killers have no chance to respond, this poor defence is the final word and the sheepish audience goes 'Yup, case closed, murder be bad.' This film is akin to the priest who lectures on God's behalf and because no one comes along to challenge him he feels reinforced in his own sentiment, but rest assured, this film does not challenge Nietzsche as a thinker or anything resulting from his work, it may demonstrate that the two men in this movie fail to satisfy the demands of being defined as hypothetical 'Overmen' because they were caught, but to demonstrate that one fruit tree does not produce fruit does not mean all fruit trees are as impotent. Also, resulting to 'Yeah, but Hitler thought that as well' is a merely childish response.This movie was awful, thinking otherwise is to admit to having no knowledge of nihilistic philosophy or adherence to any consistent system of logic. Sometimes I get the impression that Hitchcock is so revered simply out of nostalgia, I've seen quite a few of his movies and none are particularly impressive, this one was just the icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You didn't need Charlie Chan or Miss Marple to figure out that something was amiss in this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rope" is an interesting experimental film and I can respect what Alfred Hitchcock was able to do with this film--a movie with only minimal cuts and made all within a tiny little apartment set. It was quite clever and watchable...but I think also a bit overrated. Despite its high score and glowing reviews, the film comes off as too obvious--way too obvious. So obvious that you didn't need to invite Jessica Fletcher or Charlie Chan to this dinner party to figure who dunnit! So, when the crime is unraveled by the 'brilliant' professor (James Stewart), it's not exactly a case of super-sleuthing! The film is a re-imagining of the facts from the infamous Leopold and Loeb case--a true-life incident where two gay lovers killed a fellow student just to feel what it was like as well as for the thrill. Here in "Rope" the story begins as you see the victim begin killed--so this is never in question. But like Leopold and Loeb, these guys enjoyed what they did--particularly the smug creep played by John Dall. And Dall has a flair for the dramatic and decides to throw a party--with the victim hidden inside a chest in the middle of the room--surrounded by people who love him. Dramatic and rather delicious. On the other hand, his lover and partner in crime, Farley Granger, is a very nervous type--and throughout the dinner party he's so incredibly transparent. It's VERY obvious that he and Dall are hiding something--particularly Granger. And that, in my opinion, is what makes this a good but far from perfect film. Anyone with half a brain could see these two are up to something and Dall's repeated pointed remarks about the victim make it obvious they know something about the man who has disappeared....way too obvious. Cocky Dall and wimpy Granger, both lacked the subtlety needed to make this a great film. I know Hitchcock is a bigger than life director, but I just wouldn't place this among his best films (such as "North By Northwest" or "Psycho"). But, on the other hand, it is an interesting experimental film.By the way, watch Farley Granger's fingers as he's very nervously playing the piano as he talks with Stewart. He's not even close to following the music he's supposedly playing on the piano and the scene probably should have been re-shot. Also, there were a couple plot problems that came up near the end--why didn't Stewart return with the cops when he became suspicious and confronted the pair ALONE and why did Dall just stand there when Granger and Stewart were fumbling over the gun?! And, when the gun when off, why didn't the cops come?! After all, they were in an apartment!! Sloppy and unfortunately too many holes to make it a classic. For me, making the film without showing the murder and having their be some doubt as to the killing would have improved the film a billion times more.So why, then, is this film so revered? Well, I think part of of it is clearly because Hitchcock has a stellar reputation today. Also, like a few of his greatest films, Hitchcock owned the rights to it and it was withheld from public viewing for decades--thus increasing the mystique surrounding "Rope".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now the fun begins..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young men, one with "a twisted sense of humor" and the other the jittery, go-along type, strangle an acquaintance and hide his corpse in their NYC penthouse; later, they give a cocktail party and invite the victim's friends and some family, and get very nervous anytime someone goes over to the cedar chest. Alfred Hitchcock-directed "thriller", based upon a play and inspired by the Leopold and Loeb killing of the 1920s, is chatty and sterile, underpopulated. It was Hitch's first color movie and his only picture filmed in experimental 10-minute takes; this was possibly the worst way to film the material, as the elongated set is one-dimensional (and artificial) and movement and quick cutting would seem imperative here. Worse, killers John Dall and Farley Granger (presumably playing homosexuals) have the same astonished, sour looks on their faces throughout--Dall is the sinister, more masochistic one, but they seem cut from the same cloth. James Stewart is very good as a professor friend of theirs who catches onto their game...but what kind of game is this? Neither the screenwriter (Arthur Laurents!) nor Hitchcock seems to have settled on a point for all this cat-and-mouse nonsense, and the young men themselves have little dimension or sense of cunning (they're supposed to be 'seeking a new thrill', or proving that inconsequential lives are nothing against those with superior intellect, yet we view these two as spoiled rich kids, not geniuses). Heavy-handed in nearly every aspect, this is one of Hitchcock's misfires. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin String And Sealing Wax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This entry will not, alas, cause me to revise my opinion that Alfred Hitchcock is a director vastly overrated by the Academic-Pseud axis. I'm quite happy to reiterate that 'overrated' is not the same as 'incompetent'; Hitchcock clearly knows enough to remove the lens cap before shooting and which end of the camera to look through and to that extent his films are 'professional', polished, slick even but a subsequent adjective all too often is 'empty'. In this case he was adapting a one-set play by Patrick Hamilton which in itself was something of a one-trick pony; two young men, tacitly homosexual, strangle a third man, conceal his corpse in a large wooden chest and then invite his parents, friends and fiancé to dine off it. As Oscar Hammerstein put in (in What's The Use of Wond'rin') all the rest is talk. As talk goes it's reasonably interesting and well-spoken but no more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Drama Inspired By A True Life Case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROPE is possibly the strangest film made by Alfred Hitchcock . Inspired by the real life case of Leopold and Loeb the film is shot in real time and gives the impression that it was shot in one continuous take , but I'm not sure if it's one of the director's best films . The problem is that ROPE is a stage play and is in no way cinematic hence we have the idiosyncratic reasons why great plays don't make great movies . The characters are somewhat difficult to believe in . Think about it - Would the arrogant Brandon really have involved the wimpish Phillip in the murder ? All Phillip does is bleat and whine and moan , he's certainly not the type of person you'd want as an accomplice to murder is he ? And would anyone really want to include a third party ( ie Rupert Cadell ) to their plans . Being hubristic is one thing as is understanding 19th century philosophy on the " superman " but would any murderer be stupid enough to believe anyone would understand their crime without turning them in ? Of course these flaws are to do with the writer of the original play and the director is blameless . The only real fault of Hitchcock is an artistic one - He's made a real time play into a movie so ROPE isn't a movie you're going to watch over and over again , but it's well acted and compelling enough to earn seven out of ten from this commentator</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, I first wanted to see this film because it was the first to star James Stewart, he starred in another three afterwards, and then I heard about the film style, so I had to see it. Basically Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) are two homosexual (I never would have guessed) who share a New York apartment, and using a rope, they have committed the perfect murder, killing David Kentley (Dick Hogan). Brandon sees it as an experiment or challenge, while Phillip is panicking about being caught, and with the body disposed of in a chest, covered with a cloth for food and drinks, he is bound to crack eventually. Guests they have invited for a small party are relatives and friends of David, including father Mr. Kentley (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), fiancée Janet Walker (Joan Chandler), aunt Mrs. Atwater (Constance Collier), David's rival for Janet's affections - Kenneth Lawrence (Douglas Dick), and of course, Brandon and Phillip's old teacher, Rupert Cadell (Stewart). As the evening goes on, Brandon uses his sense of intellectual superiority to drop tiny hints about the nasty goings on, while Phillip is trying to hold his nerve, but this is becoming increasingly difficult when Rupert is being very snoopy. It is when everyone else has eventually left that Rupert comes back to return an item they might want back, the rope they used to murder! Of course, Rupert realises they committed the murder "experiment" because of ideas he put in their heads about human life expenditure (or something like that), so when a gun gets involved, the film ends with Rupert getting people to hear gun shots, and the police arriving. Also starring Edith Evanson as Mrs. Wilson, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man walking down the street during the opening credits. What makes this film unique is the continuous long takes, the film is made up of ten long takes, ranging from four and even ten minutes long, and the only time you can tell there is a cutaway is the camera zooming into a dark object, or just a simple straight cut. This thriller may not be one of the most exciting films in Hitch's career, being very chatty, and Stewart may not have the biggest part of the film compared to Dall and Granger, but it still a very watchable film. James Stewart was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

		<shortDescription>James Stewart's Performance Saves This Film From Being A Total Waste Of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1948, Alfred Hitchcock made an experimental picture called Rope. It was experimental, because he shot it in ten takes, which provides a seamless flow. Based on the real life Leopold-Loeb murder case, it told the story of two college students{Farley Granger and John Dall}murdering a peer just for the thrill of it. As an added thrill, they invite the peer's family, close friends, and a former professor of all three college students{James Stewart}to a party and use the chest,where the body is in, as a buffet table.Stewart begins to think that something is wrong, when the young man, who the party is for, is terribly late and the subject of murder is discussed greatly. Except for,the fine acting by Stewart,the film drags continuously. This is probably because, the film stays in the confines of the students' apartment. The dialogue is flat, and it doesn't have the usual nail-biting suspense that mister Hitchcock is famous for.Rope was not a hit with audiences when first released and the years haven't given it a new perspective.I give it a 5 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting plot, original technique, fascism denounce but also very Homophobic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchkock here denounces the seed of fascism, but also does not hide the homophobia of of the original theatre play. I guess those days any gay character deserved to be considered as an assassin or evil in anyway, or even worse a sympathetic poor queen costumed in women's wear.I don't like this movie specially for this because show gays as bad people just because we have a different sexuality (not because we are different to the rest of human beings)... It's ridiculous I still have to say this in XXI century.The technique of using what is apparently one shot with the camera moving all the way as if it were in a theatre stage could be innovative those days, now is just a curiosity.However the hidden or not so hidden message that homosexuality is something bad and homosexuals are always evil or sympathetic people spoils from my point of view, the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anytime the opening credits reveal that a movie has been adapted from a stage play, you can be almost certain that the movie will be dull, boring, and without any real action. "Rope" fits this description very nicely. Fine actors such as James Stewart are totally wasted in this abomination which takes place entirely in one room ( the old stage play bit). As I read through a description of how this movie was made it became apparent that Alfred Hitchcock used this vehicle to indulge himself and take a massive ego trip. Nuff said!!!!</fullReview>
