		<shortDescription>Disappointing and Inconsistent Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1925, in Damascus, the patriotic rebels of Syria are fighting against the invader French forces. The powerful weapons smuggler Harry Smith (Humphrey Bogart) is an amoral dealer taking advantage of the situation. He meets in a restaurant, Violette (Märta Torén), the girl of the idealistic French Col. Feroud (Lee J. Cobb). Feroud is trying to make a deal with the rebel leader Emir Hassan (Onslow Stevens), and he forces Harry to be his liaison and arrange a meeting with Hassan.I am a great fan of Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor, but "Sirocco" has a very disappointing and inconsistent screenplay. The story presents Harry Smith as an amoral and ambitious man, but never explains the reasons or motives for his final act, since he had his visa and the girl with money. In Casablanca, the love for Ilsa is the motive for the sacrifice of Rick Blaine, but in "Sirocco" there are no explanations for his final redemption. Along the story, something is missing to make "Sirocco" a great movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Sirocco"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bogart hidden treasure..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally enjoyed this film. I wasn't expecting much from what I had previously read (on here) and if you can try and not think about some of Bogart's other triumphs, this is a quick moving, interesting enough film with underlining truths..Basically Bogart has been presented with a choice of doing right or wrong in a war torn city in Syria, trying to mind his own business and continue to profit himself with supplying guns to rebel fighters, he is steered towards helping the French. Of course this would also help him get out of the city and onto better places..but the story unveils complications for him..Bogart's role is similar to his other characters but not entirely, he's definitely got that "cynic on the outside, but heart pointing in the right direction on the inside" thing going on.Also, the film does have other strong roles, in particular the very beautiful Märta Torén as Violette, she trys to resist Bogart's outlaw charm but in the end like the rest of us, cant get enough..she is also a good choice of casting, definitely an unusual beauty about her with a presence to match.My only glitch about this film and I noticed it right away, was that the French / Foreign army officers and in particular Everett Sloane as Gen. LaSalle speak with American and British accents. Could they not even try and break out in a French accent? What was the director thinking (You will notice in the glorious 'Casablanca', every nationality was played with the utmost truth to where they had come from, even a line or two in their given language)? However, overlooking that, this is a great film and I can't see why any Bogie fan would not dig it.~paul browne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way Bogart's greatest performances have left Sirocco "priced out of the market." I won't argue that it's on the same level as Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, or Key Largo, but it is a surprisingly nuanced picture that gets unfairly criticized for not living up to some of the greatest films Hollywood ever produced.Bogie is Bogie, tough-talking and trenchcoat-wearing as usual. He plays Harry Smith, a man who, ordinarily, doesn't take sides, but this time, see... there's a dame! That sounds a little dismissive, it's not meant to be. Nobody's ever played a "shades of gray" character quite like Bogart, in my opinion he could have done it a dozen *more* times.Swedish actress Märta Torén (pegged as 'The Next Ingrid Bergman') is the dame. She really seems almost as out-of-place in the picture as she would have been in war-torn Damascus. Lee J. Cobb, playing the French commander Col. Feroud, chews the scenery a little but overall he gives a good portrayal of a man fighting for a cause he no longer believes in.I'm a fan of both Zero Mostel (the original Max Bialystock) and Nick Dennis (the exuberant Greek mechanic from 'Kiss Me Deadly') and they both have good if small roles here.I was impressed by the way Sirocco refused to overtly side with either the French or the Syrians. Neither does the film present Smith as anything but what he is, an opportunist. In fact, for me, it his teetering on the brink of whether to take sides or stay neutral (and thus be true to his own self-serving moral code) that provides the film's best drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1951 Bogart vehicle, produced by the great man himself, and directed by the estimable Curtis Bernhardt, is a slow-moving rehash of some of Bogart's better known films, going back to Casablanca. This one's set in 1925 Syria, with the Trenchcoated One working both sides against the middle. He's a gun runner selling arms to the Arabs, which at the time was illegal, since Syria was controlled by the French. Bogart had an affinity with the Levant, and was most at ease in an occupied city, with terrorists, revolutionaries and criminals,--often hard to tell apart--running around, blowing up things, and making life difficult for the authorities. As usual, Bogart couldn't care less who wins as long as he gets paid.Sirocco is a back lot picture, yet an attractive one. It was made at a time when movies of its type were getting either a whole lot bigger or a whole lot smaller. As such it was somewhat of an anachronism when it came out, and its box-office was modest. This was really the end of the line for the old-style Bogart pics, which it is the last of; and Bogie's next movie, The African Queen, filmed on location and in color, would open up a whole new career for him. I like this one better than most people do, for its cast (Marta Toren, Lee Cobb, Everett Sloan, Gerald Mohr), and its shabby fatalism. A good deal of the picture is set indoors, in cafés, hotel rooms and warehouses. There is a circular, labyrinthine aspect to the movie, as it seems at times as if all the action were taking place literally underground, with the various characters moving from cavern to cavern.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Rooting Interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sirocco was one of those independent productions that Humphrey Bogart's Santana productions did for Columbia Pictures after Bogey's long term contract with Warner Brothers expired. Bogey had a mixed record of success and Sirocco didn't exactly set the movie world on fire.The story takes place in Damascus after World War I with the French given a mandate by the League of Nations over the former Ottoman Empire territory of Syria and the Syrians not really too crazy about it. They've got a guerrilla war going against them and it is being led by Onslow Stevens as Moulay Hassan.The French occupying troops are led by General Everett Sloane with Lee J. Cobb as the Colonel in charge of intelligence. They're having no luck even trying for a cease fire. And there's a lovely black market in weapons being sold to the Syrians.Which is where soldier of fortune Humphrey Bogart comes in. Bogey is at his most cynical here, too cynical probably to get a real rooting interest from the audience. He really has no inner core of decency that was apparent in Casablanca to which this film bears a superficial resemblance.The Ingrid Bergman character is played by another Swedish actress Marta Toren who is Lee J. Cobb's girlfriend. Can you imagine Elsa Lund as a selfish slattern, than you've got what Toren is. Somehow her domestic problems also and fling with Bogart also don't arouse the audiences interest.There are some good performances from supporting players like Zero Mostel, Nick Dennis, and Ludwig Donath as various Arabic types. You will enjoy them.But I would also have to say that Sirocco takes place at a time when certain movements and issues were coming to the fore. Great questions were being raised and Sirocco answers none of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Marta Toren to Bogie)....what a great line! I'm surprised it hasn't gone down in the lexicon of great movie quips...and it captures perfectly the paradoxical mystery of Bogie's eternal charm, as well as the mystery of how an essentially mediocre film can be redeemed by its own dry, sardonic charm (due largely to help from fine supporting players as much as from Bogie), some great B/W photography, and a persistently downbeat refusal to push any sort of patriotic agenda.(adding greatly to that charm quotient.) The postwar noir influence is in fine fettle here. So Bogie doesn't exactly have a great motivation for his final decision? He just changed his mind, that's all. Take it or leave it. "I've taken long chances before. Okay." What could be better than that? It's the way people act every day. Every good critical eye without a mote in it knows that this film is safely and securely within the universe of the best product Hollywood ever put out, a great, mordant, counterweight universe to the unwatchable sap they themselves were producing right alongside it. "Sirocco" is not even really that minor a star in that universe. Good, good, good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SIROCCO is a film which has gotten mixed reviews, or at least mostly bad reviews. And they are right. My favorite Bogie films (or at least the ones I've seen) are IN A LONELY PLACE, CASABLANCA, THE BIG SLEEP and a couple more. And they have the right to be called "classics". Or even by some, "masterpieces". But SIROCCO doesn't get that chance because, well, it's really nothing special. Being a huge Bogie-fan, I was disappointed when the movie ended and I felt that person who can be referred as "supporting role" was Bogie. Being the superstar that he was, he should have been able to be in the film a little more. I wouldn't advise anyone to not see this film. OK, see it. But don't expect a masterpiece, or even a great movie cause' it's not, unfortunately. the acting and the whole black/white thing were the only good things. But, hey, I would advise IN A LONELY PLACE to anyone, anytime, anywhere. So don't get your hopes up for SIROCCO, instead go rent/buy IN A LONELY PLACE, because that is a film worth calling a classic. Hope I helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale imitation of Casablanca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to begin with a detailed plot description of Sirocco, but what's the point? Sirocco has essentially the same plot as Casablanca. Change settings to Syria from Morocco, put Marta Toren in the role of Ingrid Bergman (Toren was actually billed as "The Next Ingrid Bergman"), exchange Lee J. Cobb's Col. Feroud for Conrad Veidt's Maj. Strasser, and throw in a few other similar characters and almost identical plot points and you've got two very similar movies. The problem with the comparison, though, comes at the end of the film. Although Casablanca is the far superior film in most every way, the final scenes really drive home just how inferior Sirocco really is. In both films, Bogart must decide between being selfish or doing "what's right". The difference, however, is that in Casablanca there is a good, justifiable reason for his actions. As heartbreaking as his final act is, I can understand why he made that decision. In Sirocco, on the other hand, the decision to do "what's right" seems totally out of character with everything leading up to that point. There is no valid, justifiable reason for Bogart's actions. There is no sound reasoning given for his sudden change of heart and it therefore feels forced to make Bogart look like a good guy before the end of the film. It just doesn't work.The highlight of Sirocco for me is Marta Toren. She made even the most mundane of scenes seem elegant and worth watching. While she may have been "The Next Ingrid Bergman", personally I saw a lot of Audrey Hepburn in her. It's a shame that Toren's career was cut short by her untimely death in 1957. I, for one, would have liked to see what she would have done with a more complete filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What do you care whose gun it is as long as it isn't aimed at you?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to see who Humphrey Bogart is paired up with in his films following the Warner Brothers days. This time out it's Lee J. Cobb as a French colonel and Swedish actress Marta Toren. The story takes place in 1925 Syria, as French forces operating under a United Nations mandate have a difficult time containing Syrian insurgents bent on governing themselves. The comparisons to "Casablanca" are unavoidable, but at least in that film, one has a general sense of history and can lay a finger on the Nazi villain. In "Sirocco", it's difficult to empathize with either side in the conflict as neither is particularly sympathetic or likable; perhaps in hindsight that's one of the strengths of the film.Bogey's character is a gun runner with a checkered past and without hint of morals or principles. While Rick Blaine might have been a 'citizen of the world', Harry Smith's political convictions don't carry him that far - he's up for the highest bidder. As such, he's not very sympathetic or likable either, receiving a back handed compliment from Toren's Violette - "How can a man so ugly be so handsome". It would have worked the other way around too.Dingy underground catacombs give the movie a claustrophobic feel as Harry takes it on the lam following a grenade bombing in a café. Violette invites herself along to Cairo, and the way Smith caved in to her request seemed a stretch, it was like no, you can't go, you can't go... oh, alright let's go. The lack of urgency and any remote chemistry between the two wasn't convincing enough for this viewer to have her along for the ride. In any event, you won't think of dried apricots in the same way again.If the film's ending was meant to capture a particular poignancy, it's meaning was lost on me. Smith's demise seemed senseless and unnecessary, and then the story ends in a heartbeat. The fate of Violette is a loose end which just adds to the unsatisfying conclusion. "Sirocco" could have been much more and certainly had a cast capable of pulling it off, but putting a checkered bow-tie on Bogey was just asking for trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogie's role was not really unsympathetic unless you happen to be a Francophile. This can be looked at as a prequel to Casablanca. Harry is very much like a young Rick would have been in 1925. Problem is, Bogie is 10 years older and is basically playing Rick as he was in the 20's. The woman is,though, one of the most unsympathetic creatures ever in films. High maintenance, manipulative, out for everything she can get wherever she can get it. Damn sexy too. Not by any means a great picture but if you like Bogie and you like older films, it is worth a summer night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware 2 dimensional reviews of 3 dimensional movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears that many (most?) critics and viewers here alike are stuck in a rut of complaint, that this movie reminds them of Casablanca, but then refuses to be Casablanca. I wrestled with tagging this as a spoiler, but I have to say that the following point is essential to my appreciation for the film: Bogart? His character here is not supposed to be confused for Rick Blaine so much as contrasted with him, as well as an earlier Bogart classic role--Harry Morgan of To Have and Have Not. In truth, despite the coincidence of a beautiful and exotic Swedish co-star, (and, yes, Marta Toren is no Ingrid Bergman), "Harry Smith" of Sirocco (not even the character's real name, as we learn as we go along) can't even be so generously described as an "opportunist". Heart of gold? Not even close. Harry is a fully-fallen and corrupt profiteer who makes his living enabling the slaughter and death of soldiers and civilians alike. He abandons his loyal sidekick as easily as he flees his girlfriend. His denouement (this is absolutely a noir) is thus essential to his character, as is his moral redemption within that framework.In the end, Bogart and his character are the MacGuffin, and the real conflict, and the real heart of the story, is within the soul of Lee J. Cobb's character, and his outstanding performance as the French intelligence officer, Colonel Feroud. Feroud allows an underling to be sent to his certain death, and he beats his girlfriend when her torment overwhelms him, but he spends the entire picture fighting to maintain his professionalism and his dignity and his humanity against all odds in a world where all is savage and cruel, and there very well be no "right" at all. That Bogart/Smith awakens at the last, to understand the difference between them, is the light shining on Feroud, not Smith. Watching this film again, and viewing Bogart/Smith's sacrifice in those terms is to see a far more mature and nuanced film than Casablanca and To Have and Have Not were able to be, as "A picture" vehicles required to have noble endings.No, this is no 1940's film of good guy vs bad guy idealism. This is both a 1950's film of burgeoning cold war cynicism, as well as a timeless study of intractable sectarian conflict that is so topical today, where everything in the world is shades of gray, yet the people in it still have to decide what is "moral" among the shrinking number of corrupt choices they have left. Bogart disliked his performance, but I wonder how he would view it now, so many decades later?For me, this one was of the most rewarding films I have watched in a long time, and it has awakened a curiosity for more of Bernhardt's pieces, all of the descriptions of which seem to have this kind of timeless moral ambiguity at their center.Set aside your campy Hollywood ideals, and your search for 2-dimensional good guys with rough exteriors and hearts of gold. This is an adult picture with more to offer than mere cliché.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a great flick, but interesting to see that conflicts between foreign occupiers and arab locals has been going on for a long time, with similar results. Its a recurring theme in Arabia - foreign armies come in hoping to pacify the locals, only to fall into a bloody pattern of terrorism and retribution. The amazing thing is that its been going on for so long and in so many places. It's an insight on today's middle-east events.And like so many middle-east conflicts, in this movie you are left being not very sympathetic to either side. Yes, its the Syrian's home, but their tactics are sickening. The French come off no better as the aggressors and oppressors. The third parties, such as Bogart's character, are just vultures feeding off the tragedy. Good one to watch if you're thinking of invading an Arab nation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damascus, 1925. "Harry Smith" (Bogart), a ruthless arms dealer, you need a pass to leave Damascus and has no choice but to resort to his arch rival, the French colonel "Feroud" (Lee J. Cobb), blackmails him demanding to change an important military information ...Apparently the film follows the lines of "Casablanca" for the exotic, the war and the character "Harry Smith", which reported revenue of conflict, and that seem to support that view. But in "Sirocco" we see an interesting film director Curtis Bernhardt-("Conflict" 1945) who masterfully portrays Syrian resistance to French troops who managed one Arab state mandated by the League of Nations.This is the context in which it develops a history of personal, emotional conflicts and the need to struggle for survival between the squalor of Damascus in each frame is sensed and its mysterious underground mazes and alleys where death seems to threaten from every shadow . Bogart's character, though typical of him, as in "Casablanca" has distinct differences, such as being less self-sufficient, and more vulnerable, more human."Sirocco" clearly delineates two "Harry Smith". One, selfish, interested, jealous keeper of his interests. Another, weaker, open, fearful and escape, but who still has a sense of honor can not shake.Respect to Lee J. Cobb is an excellent actor to give form and life to unscrupulous characters or, as in this case, convoluted and inner conflicts.The object of seduction Bogart is Marta Toren, a Swedish actress filmography weak and died as a result of mental illness and only 31 years old. Not even Ingrid Bergman, her beauty and her work to be considered meritorious.In short, this is a good job of Curtis Bernhardt that could be framed in a variant of noir cinema,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another stalemate in the Middle East</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a most unusual movie for its time, and it is fascinating to read the comments on it here on the IMDb. Many viewers are apparently undecided what to make of Sirocco as it does not fit any of the known stereotypes. This is neither Algiers (1938) nor Casablanca (1942), there is no romance, you don't find anything exotic about the place in question (Damascus, Syria) and no great friendships are about to develop. It is basically a movie about people who are confronted with a drab and hopeless situation (messagewise I would compare it with The Sand Pebbles (1966)). It painfully reminds todays viewers of the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq (well, the Jasmine salesman bolts off before his handgranades go off in the cafe, the suicide bomber had not been invented yet). Western powers (they have a mandate from the League of Nations) are pitted against so called "patriots" (they have no mandate at all) in a bloody battle without a discernible cause. The Bogart character is an opportunist arms dealer and a coward to boot. At one time he really hits rock bottom in the Catacombs underneath the city as he tries to hide in his tattered Bogey-raincoat - one of the many great visual moments in this beautifully photographed nightmare of a movie with its superb set design.The main message of Sirocco is a depressing one: If things turn bad, the efforts of single individuals are of negligible effect. We have a disillusioned French officer (Lee J. Cobb who I have never seen better). He wants to prevent a planned execution of civilians as a retaliatory act after an ambush, not out of idealistic motives or with any hope but just because he is sick of all the killing. Like all the other characters he gets bogged down by the circumstances and in the end departs on a meeting with the "patriots" with the Bogart character's help. Everyone agrees that this action is meant to be a suicide. The officer even gets out of his uniform which heretofore had the function of a corset.Great sets and scenes abound here. Damascus is a place of eternal night - and we never get out of the place into the open. The Roman Catacombs seem to be inspired by Giovanni Piranesi's "carceri" drawings. There is a great scene in which the Bogart character buys a belly dancer's finger cymbals. Another scene begins with the focus on a visibly tender and juicy steak which the Bogart character starts cutting into. "He brings his own food", the waiter explains to other patrons who would like the same. What a better way to depict a war profiteer?As the lines above suggest, the storyline of Sirocco is pretty sprawling and the film is more of a situation than a story. That makes it only more realistic and instructive. Our time is right for anti-war movies of this kind. In can recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unremarkable Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of Bogart as a gun runner unwilling to commit himself is set in 1925 supposedly. A Western army of occupation runs an Islamic country in the Middle East and is in a constant battle with fervent but treacherous insurgents fighting an asymmetric war. And this is 1925. Not that anyone would know it was 1925, not judging from our contemporary circumstances or from the dress or demeanor of the performers in this movie.The role of man in the middle, the disillusioned idealist, wasn't a new one for Bogart. He practically defined the role in "Casablanca" and repeated it several times after, as in "Key Largo." But here, he's disillusioned not by having seen where his earlier idealism has led but, as far as we can judge, from his betrayal by a wife. And it's turned him into an exceptionally bitter and irritable opportunist. He's rather a skunk, right up to the end in which he commits an act that isn't so much heroic but still involves courage.Lee J. Cobb is the French colonel. He's fighting the insurgents who are being provided with weapons by Bogart. Cobb is also in love with Marta Toren and Bogart is trying to steal her away. Bogart's motives have nothing to do with love. There is, needless to say, considerable friction between Cobb and Bogart. Neither gets the lady because she's on her own trip.Marta Toren made few movies and died at an early age but she was stunning. Although Swedish, she resembled the Italian Alida Valli -- the actress who loved Orson Welles in "The Third Man." Marta Toren really was a knockout. Whew! Her eyes were slanted at an alarming dihedral and each looked at the world from a slightly different angle. They were blue, with thin dark circles around the irises. They were eyes you could fall into.The plot has a few moments of action that evoke real-life events, if anyone remembers Algiers. (The movie doesn't take sides. The Syrians slit your throat, but the French shoot you.) In an early memorable scene, a raggedy Syrian nationalist explodes three grenades in a café full of Europeans. It's to the director's credit that it takes the survivors several smoky minutes to shake themselves of dust and slowly recover from the blast. It's nicely photographed too, although the whole movie is shot effectively.Outside of that the story is routine -- full of spies, intrigues, betrayal -- and generally a little unpleasant. That includes Bogart's character. In other films, enacting similar roles, Bogart always had a hidden spark of fundamental decency. He may be disillusioned -- "I stick my neck out for nobody" -- but he was basically just waiting for the right moral moment. Here, he's old and cranky throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1951, we have a very formulaic Bogart movie that was shamelessly ripped-off from his 1940's classic 'Casablanca'.Here we have Bogey once again involved in questionable shennanigans somewhere down amongst the Arabs. This time it's Damascus. Again, he's an American on the edge who has been hardened by past adversity. He has no national allegiance, no political ties, no loyalties but himself and no beliefs but money. The French are also, once again, the erstwhile authorities, but this time they're in conflict with the indigenous population rather than the Bosch.There's a femme fatale and a fractured love triangle as in 'Casablanca'. There's a comradeship of convenience between Bogey and a senior authority figure, just like 'Casablanca'.It's a very noirishly lit and filmed piece which seemed to suit the character Bogey so often played. Yet something is missing.This movie could almost be a sequel to Casablanca. For those who wondered what became of his character after the tearful separation from Ingrid Bergman; here it is. With the assistance of the police chief, he fled to Damascus, and a decade later was making his way running guns to the rebels.The ending, however, is a little more down-beat.It's well worth a watch - what movie with Bogart isn't? He always gave a fascinating screen persona that made up for a lot of other inferior elements. But one star doesn't make a classic, and this piece will never match his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart called this one "a stinker." He wasn't wrong, but at least there's Everett Sloane to appreciate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know Bogart liked to keep working. The movies he made in the late Forties through the mid Fifties, however, sometimes give "work" a bad name. He veered effortlessly between fine movies that to this day continue to challenge, satisfy or do both and movies that are nothing more than nearly forgotten commercial hackwork. He knew what he was turning out; he called Sirocco a stinker. What an odd and undiscriminating selection process he and his agent must have had. In 1950 he makes Chain Lightening but then makes In a Lonely Place. In 1951 it's Sirocco and then The African Queen. In 1953 it's Battle Circle and then Beat the Devil (maybe a confusing failure, but not hackwork). With Sirocco Bogart gives us Harry Smith, a gunrunner who finds himself in Damascus. The year is 1925. The French run things. A lot of Syrians don't like that at all. They're called "rebels." Harry? He doesn't care one way or another as long as he's paid. Harry is tired, sour, cynical and a skeptic. He doesn't believe in anything except money and the value of his own hide. He's Bogart. Harry quickly finds himself involved with a martinet of a French general named LaSalle (Everett Sloane) who thinks shooting five Syrians for every dead French soldier will be educational for everyone; a sympathetic French colonel named Feroud (Lee J. Cobb) who thinks he can avoid bloodshed if he can just sit down and talk things over with the rebel leaders, especially Emir Hassan (Onslow Stevens); and Feroud's mistress, a cool drink of water named Violette (Marta Toren), a beautiful woman who seems to be aroused more by the prospect of shopping than the prospect of making love. In other words, a courtesan to scriptwriters, a sophisticated prostitute to the more realistic; something akin to a wealthy CEO's trophy wife. Harry meets Violette, wants her and comes close to falling for her. This sets up some tension between himself and Colonel Feroud. All the while Harry is trying to extricate himself from an arms deal gone very, very wrong. By the end of the movie no one has gained much of anything, although it appears Violette will have the time to do more shopping. At one point in Sirocco Violette says to Harry Smith, "What a man! You're so ugly! Yes, you are! How can a man so ugly be so handsome?" Ugly? Quasimodo, that's ugly. Bogart may not have been handsome, but he had style, a unique screen personality and the good fortune to star in three -- count 'em, three -- iconic career-making movies in less than two years. High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca carved Bogart's screen persona so deeply in granite that even hackwork like Sirocco scarcely makes a chip. When we see Harry we're really seeing Roy, Sam and Rick. There's no reason to watch this movie unless you're fond of Bogart and have an hour and a half to waste. But if you watch, remember Everett Sloane. He was a fine, fine actor who seldom found memorable parts in Hollywood. He was a member of Orson Welles' Mercury Theater and came to Hollywood with Welles. He wound up in the Fifties doing a ton of television shows. He killed himself in 1965 when he was 55. My best memories of Sloane include Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane (1941); Arthur Bannister in The Lady from Shanghai (1947); Mario Belli in Prince of Foxes (1949); Dr. Eugene Brock in The Men (1950); and, powerfully, Walter Ramsey in Patterns (1956).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak and Inconsistent Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching this movie after seeing the 2003 PBS documentary "Lawrence of Arabia: Battle for the Arab World," which adroitly lays out how in 1916 the French and British brokered a back room deal (known historically as the 'Sykes-Picot Agreement')during World War I which secretly 'decided' how ownership of the vast and varied Middle Eastern Arab ancestral homelands would be controlled by the European powers after the war. This deal was made by the British while they were simultaneously promising, thru its trusted Military Officer in Arabia, T.E. Lawrence, independence to the Arab freedom fighters after the war. The Brits promise was as reliable as those made by the US in American Indian Treaties. After the Arabs defeated the Ottoman Army and won their freedom in the Middle East, the British and French moved in and took control of Arab lands at the close of WWI. France was given "ownership'of Syria among other Arab territories at the post-WWI peace conference, setting the stage for the period of this movie in 1925, when the Syrian freedom fighters are fighting the invading French terrorists for control of its homeland and Bogart plays a Halliburton-like character (a young Dick Cheney maybe?) engaged in profiteering from the conflict.There are two major flaws in the script that have been alluded to in some of the reviews included herein. One reviewer writes that he is "impressed by the way 'Sirocco' refused to overtly side with either the French or the Syrians." Nonsense. In the film, it is the Syrians who do not honor their word and in a coy double-cross, kill our cinema hero Bogart in the end. In a previous scene, the French are portrayed as honoring their word by giving Bogart the travel Visa he was promised despite him admitting to brokering a secret and dangerous meeting between the Syrians and the head French Intelligence Officer (Lee J Cobb). This is a coy way of the movie siding with the French since the subliminal (and not so subliminal) takeaway is that the Arabs word can't be trusted. You are expected, of course, to disregard who's in whose fruggin' country anyway causing the problem.Several other reviewers here have made reference to how at the end of the film the opportunist Bogart still manages to "do the right thing" or support "the right cause." This is more nonsense. What they are referring to is Bogart's decision to lead the French to Syrian headquarters to attempt to negotiate the 'release' of the French intelligence officer who had voluntarily traveled to Syria to attempt to initiate some kinda undefined "peace talks." The question to ask yourself is how is anything Bogart's character does to support the French in this movie considered "noble" or the "right thing?" It is 1925, and the French have invaded an innocent and non-threatening foreign people and their homeland. Supporting the invader isn't "nobel," its criminal. Supporting Syria is what would be nobel. The Syrians are not at fault in this conflict for defending their homeland from invasion. Another reviewer writes "Yes, its the Syrian's home, but their 'tactics' are sickening." That's an odd statement, since they use pretty much the same 'tactics' our Revolutionary 'founding fathers' used in America, and America wasn't even the founding fathers' ancestral homeland! Besides, I'd like to see what 'tactics' that reviewer would use if a foreign terrorist group burst in his home, killed several family members, and took ownership of his assets. I doubt that his 'tactics' would consist of cordial discussions over a cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an interesting scene with Lee J. Cobb intimidating a grovelling Zero Mostel. In real life, Cobb succumbed to pressure from the House UnAmerican Activities Commission and named others in the entertainment industry who had "communist" affiliations. Mostel refused to give any information about anyone else, was blacklisted and was unable to work in the entertainment industry for almost a decade. Bogie's character initially acts only in his own self-interest, but subsequently does "the right thing" despite personal risk. In real life, Bogie was part of a group formed to oppose the HUAC, a group which quickly fell apart in disarray when the HUAC started to push back. Bogie started out doing "the right thing" but when personal risk loomed, quickly acted to protect his self-interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having personally known the protagonist in another setting, this movie has a strong grip of realism. No, I did not know Bogie, but worked closely for many years with the type of person he portrays in Sirocco. 60+ years after its making, Sirocco shows us how the world turns. Its emptiness; its senselessness; its ugliness; its cruelty - these are the things we do not want confront. We want to pretend that the characters in the movie could never exist. Yet, they and the undercurrents of war and chaos are the grist of modern day life. That is why you feel uncomfortable when the movie ends. The actions and reactions of the characters are too real. Comparisons with other movies, actors and scripts are attempts to dilute the caustic quality of Sirocco, where everyone loses. This is an excellent tutorial to learn about human behavior in no-win situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was happening back then in Syria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that needs to be said is that, although this film is supposed to be set in Syria, there is no sirocco wind in Syria. A sirocco (or scirocco), the word coming from the ancient Greek sirokos, comes off the Sahara, and nothing from the Sahara blows as far as Syria. There is a similar strong wind in Syria, but it is called the shluq. Moving on, as there is so much going on in Syria at the moment, I thought I would get Humphrey Bogart's take on it all. This film is pure Hollywood hokum, set in 'war-torn Syria' in 1925. Needless to say, it is all made in a Hollywood studio and there does not appear to be a real Arab in the cast. Bogart plays a gun-runner who falls for beautiful, mysterious Marta Toren, but she is Lee J. Cobb's gal, and Cobb is the head of military intelligence in Damascus, because Syria is under French occupation. Cobb doesn't like Bogart at the best if times, and these are not the best of times. The people to whom Bogart is selling the arms are the locals, who are 'fighting for their freedom' because 'we want to run our own country'. Well, look what a mess they made of that! Still, 'freedom' sounds good, even if it does lead to the Assad family in the end. Just so that everyone understands the background, I should explain that Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire and was ruled by the Turks until 1918, upon whom the French were a significant improvement. Because the Turks sided with the Krauts in the First World War, their empire, like the Austro-Hungarian one, got dismembered and divided up between the victors. The British got Iraq and the French got Syria and a new country which came to be called Lebanon. These countries were then called 'protectorates'. In fact, somebody had to take them over, as the Turks were thrown out. And if it weren't for Humphrey Bogart, we might never have had the Assads, and the tens of thousands of Syrians massacred by father and son of that family might not have died. Or at least, that is the Hollywood view. This film is mildly entertaining and has three interesting stars in it, but I would not really rate it as 'three star'.</fullReview>

The French "hero" went to the finest military school "Saint-Cyr" ,the French West Point as Bogart points out ;his values such as honor have become obsolete in this mercenary world.The best moments in what is finally a routine military melodrama (of course the officer has a woman who falls for...you' ll never guess !) are the scenes in the dark alleys or in the catacombs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware the Bow Tie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a general rule to follow about Bogart films: if he's wearing a bow tie, its going to be a disappointment. "Sirocco" is no exception.Even Bogart himself called this film "a mess". He wasn't wrong. There's a lot of pieces here that sound great--Bogart as Harry Smih, an arms merchant in Damascus--Everett Sloan as the French commandant--Lee J. Cobb as the French officer who's trying to bring peace while losing his woman to Bogart--catacombs, mysterious events--but it never comes together.The script is just a confusion of parts and after watching it again, Bogart seems to be playing second fiddle to Lee J. Cobb. Never heard of Marta Toren? There's a reason. She may sound like Bergman, but she does not have any of Bergman's charm, talent or magnetism. She actually gets a bit grating at times. As for the direction, I can only say this director also directed "Conflict" another third rate Bogart film.There is no romance, no heart to what happens to Harry Smith at the end of this either. If at least he would have had a meaningful exit, this film might have been worth watching. But instead, it fulfills the bow tie rule quite nicely and is not recommended for anyone but the most hard-core Bogart fans who have to watch everything he's in...(sigh)...like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sirocco" takes place in 1925 Damascus where French troops are occupying the city and fighting against rebel insurgents. (Hmmmm...that sounds familiar).Harry Smith (Humphrey Bogart) and his pal Nasir Aboud (Nick Dennis) are running guns to rebel leader Emir Hassan (Onslow Stevens). French General LaSalle (Everett Sloane) wants "an eye for an eye" after another of his patrols is ambushed. His Head of Intelligence Colonel Feroud (Lee J. Cobb) wants to negotiate with Hassan. He gets the General to agree to send in an emissary, Lt. Collet (Harry Guardino) to meet with the rebels and start peace negotiations.When Collet is found murdered, Feroud rounds up the usual arms dealer suspects including Smith and forces them to sell their wares to the French. Harry agrees but as a measure of revenge, sets his sights on Violette (Marta Toren) who is Feroud's lady friend. Harry meets with Hassan's man to collect his last payment but is told not to return as his "services" are no longer required.Harry attempts to leave Damascus with Violette but their bus is stopped. Harry escapes and Violette is captured. However, Feroud releases her and gives her a pass out of the city. When an informer Balukjian (Zero Mostel) obtains proof the Harry is supplying arms to the enemy, Harry becomes a wanted man.Despondent over the loss of Violette, Feroud offers Harry a pass out of Damascus if he will arrange a meeting between himself and Hassan without LaSalle's knowledge. Feroud realizes that this will certainly result in his death. LaSalle learns of the scheme and implores Harry to arrange for Feroud's release for $10,000. Harry has plans to leave the city with Violette but reluctantly agrees to undertake the mission.Together with Major Leon (Gerald Mohr) Harry approaches Hassan's headquarters and.............................................This "film noire" was produced by Bogart's production company Santana and reminds one somewhat of "Casablanca" (1942). Bogey is somewhat of rogue in this one with few redeeming qualities. Toren makes a good "femme fatale" ultimately destroying the two men that love her. The picture has a dark tone, playing for the most part, as it does, at night in the rain swept streets and damp underground catacombs of 1925 Damascus.Sloane and Mostel has appeared with Bogey in "The Enforcer" the same year. Cobb would appear with Bogey in "The Left Hand of God" (1955).Entertaining film, better than some would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look, but don't expect the Bogey of old...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time this film was made, I am unsure exactly what American popular opinion was to this film or the occupation of Syria. On one hand, the French were imperialists and had no right to occupy Syria (as well as about 1/5 of the planet). On the other, the Syrian revolutionaries were at times mindless killers--much like parts of the Muslim world today. Because of this, the usual "good guy vs. bad guy" focus of most Hollywood films is gone, and to top if off, Humphrey Bogart plays a most amoral and unsympathetic leading man--making it a hard film to connect to. Interestingly enough, in light of recent problems in Iraq and the rest of the Middle East, this movie is once again a rather timely film.Lee J. Cobb plays, of all things, a French officer in occupied Syria in 1925. The country is rife with civil war and his commander is inclined to match terror with even greater terror. Cobb, on the other hand, is rather reasonable and wants to broker a negotiated peace--and sadly, he seems to be the only one in the film thinking this way. In so many ways, the star of this film was Cobb--as he was in more scenes and played a much more interesting character than Bogart. His acting was good, but he hardly seemed French--with no accent whatsoever.As for Bogart, the film is an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of CASABLANCA--with many similarities to the original. The setting looks an awful lot alike and the characters seem very similar as well. However, unlike "Rick" from CASABLANCA, down deep, he really is amoral and stands for nothing in SIROCCO. Plus, he just looks sad and old--with very little energy. As a result, caring for him is quite a chore. It's even worse for Bogie's love interest, Märta Torén. Not only was she amoral, but she was just plain nasty and selfish throughout the film--and yet, inexplicably, two men wanted her throughout the film! No lady is THAT beautiful! So overall, this is one of Bogart's poorer efforts of the latter portion of his career--due to a lackluster performance, a derivative script as well as characters (aside from Cobb) you could care less whether they lived or died.</fullReview>

He inspected the carpet that had just been led (by him personally) on the floor of their garage turned movie theater. It was a dark red that was a bit darker than the vintage theater seats with wooden armrests and wooden backs which he had bought from a sale."Only not in the same way. This is the inhabitants rebelling against the French. Now it is Syrians rebelling against other Syrians.""I gather from the movie. When was this again? 1925?""Yes.. I was not even sure if that really happened so I looked it up. And indeed there was a revolt in 1925 that lasted to 1927 against the French. The rebels, or freedom fighters - depending on your point of view - actually beat the French several times.""I also looked up something! You know what Sirocco means? It says here, that it is the name for a wind that comes from the Sahara and gains hurricane strength when it reaches the Mediterranean and North Africa." Henry lifted his Nokia Lumia. "Cool. A reference to the rebellion, I guess. A rising storm.""That might be.""Has a bit of a Casablanca flair over it, although there is no such similarities as between Dead Reckoning and the Maltese Falcon. There is a conflict that serves as an interesting background against which the story enfolds. There are some colorful people that fill the scenes. But there are differences. In this Bogey plays a shady character with doubtful morals who repents a bit at the end. His adversary, the French colonel could be considered the good guy who wants the killing to stop, but at the same time his relation has with his wife Violette has turned sour. A kind of relation develops between Violette and Bogey, but it is not something like in Casablanca, where it is a passionate love affair. So there are some superficial similarities.""But did you like the movie?""Did you?""Well. No.. not really.. It seems a bit lackluster.. There is never any great dialog or any great scenes. It works, but it isn't a captivating intriguing story. It is a bit like stale bread. You can eat it.. but it won't be a remarkable good experience. It just misses everything that makes it great.""I see..""So how about you?""Let's say? I am curious about the next movie.. it has got to be better," Henry laughed.www.meritcoba.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite talent involved, Sirocco's a gust of stale hot air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of expensive talent went into Sirocco; alas, hardly a glimmer of it shows. It's a guns-and-dried-apricots intrigue drama set in Syria during the 1925 Druze uprising against the French protectorate. But A.I. Bezzerides sought in vain for a unifying focus for his screenplay, which, in consequence, Curtis Bernhardt directed slackly and torpidly. The usually resourceful director of photography Burnett Guffey let his camera linger in one clammy catacomb too many, and George Anthiel's score, with its ophidian oboes, would better suit an asiatic confection like Curse of the Cobra Woman than a story set in the (relatively) modern middle east, with issues that still resonate today. Then there's the cast. Humphrey Bogart was starting to look haggard in this umpteenth retreat of his patented persona, the cynical loner in an exotic locale. And while it's good to see Everett Sloane outside an Orson Welles vehicle, his small part is disposable. Even the obligatory love triangle -- shades of Casablanca -- seems of less urgency to its principals (Bogart, Marta Toren, Lee J. Cobb) than, if possible, to the audience. It all ends on a sour dissonance. Only its title remains apt: Sirocco is a gust of stale hot air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would even say less than B if it were not Bogart. For Bogart fans, there is a certain amount of satisfaction, but it is hard to avoid criticism. With Prohibition past and even WW11 gone, idealism is a short commodity and Bogart himself isn't getting any younger either, so that the character of Harry Smith is not the mingled wheeler-dealer and idealist of earlier Bogart, but seemingly closer to a vulgarian pig like so many others, wooing with blatant appeal to material goods. This is like Bogart without Bogart. In fact, Harry Smith is too tired looking to really make a foreign land seem romantic for that matter.Also a dramatic mess is Lee J Cobb. Maybe it is just the hang of his uniform but he is not set up so much to be a tragic figure as an unappealing one. His act of self-sacrifice is nauseating rather than ennobling.Then there is Violette, responsive to Bogart's materialistic approach. Marta Toren is so beautiful I am surprised she isn't more famous.And I think this must have been the film Woody Allen saw when he started mocking the trench coat. Cobb and Bogart both look a little too solid in them. Finally, the set is a little bit superficial. Fezes and shots of Byzantine copper ware practically covers it. Abbott and Costello might come around a corner any minute.In sum I say, as a potential film to watch, it is interesting, in a nihilistic sort of way. It only lacks poetic justice.</fullReview>

If you can picture any of these career missteps, you will get a good idea of how Humphrey Bogart soiled his portrayal of high-class slime-ball Rick in 1942's best picture, CASABLANCA, with his one-note unintentional spoof as "Harry Smith" that he phoned in on SIROCCO nine years later. Since Martha Toren as lone love interest Violette can't hold a candle to Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of Ilsa Lund in the earlier film, about the only redeeming grace in this 1951 misfire is the complex portrayal of relatively humane if fatalistic French Col.

A complete waste of talent, and paper for the scripts, Bogart, Cobb, Sloane Corey, Mostel,Mohr can't make this clunker work, WOW ! I can't believe I wrote that, but it is a FACT.Aimless in its direction, Curtis Bernhardt(Director) , doesn't deserve to get paid for this sch-mucky remake attempt of "Casablanca."He doesn't know how to blend romance with drama or action, I guess he read the script ?, and didn't know how to make dramatic changes. Violette(Marta Toren) is the Ingrid Berman clone, and a very light clone at that. While lovely to the eye, she lacks the depth or skill in acting to create any chemistry between her and Bogey, incredible.As I stated previously, this is how NOT to make a film, and just about anyone can these days. People are often confused if this movie was filmed in the bazaar or the catacombs, it should have been filmed in the dark, and kept there ! I gave this film 3 stars , just for the cast, a negative 10 for the script. Note: for future screen writers, use this a template to build against, maybe you can reedit the film to have some dramatic tension, or rewrite scenes that would build to a climax, just not the veritable collapse that it currently does.All in all, Bogart should have saved his money, and credibility.</fullReview>

To watch him here virtually phoning it in it seems barely credible that a scant two years earlier Lee Cobb had galvanized Broadway when he created the role of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's Death Of A Salesman, nor does Sloane retain anything of his outstanding performances in Citizen Kane, The Lady From Shanghai, The Enforcer nor does his lacklustre performance give any hint of what's to come - his brilliant Hollywood agent in The Big Knife, Graziano's manager in Somebody Up There Likes Me, for example. Marta Toren died tragically just months short of her thirty first birthday but she died metaphorically every time she tried to act - and perversely for a Swede had a filmic penchant for the middle East having 'starred' previously opposite Tony Martin in Casbah, the third and by far worst remake of Pepe Le Moko. In truth there's not a lot to praise here, Joseph Kessel was a fine novelist whose L'Armee des ombres became the basis of what is arguably the finest film about the Resistance ever made, yet what they did to his novel Coup de Grace here doesn't bear thinking about. Bogie is, of course, always worth watching and Bogie completists should and will see it but that's about the best you can give it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>little shooting going on in the city</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was awful went it came to the fighting between the French and the Syrians. There should have been a lot more gun fire between the French and the insurgents. There should have been a lot more explosions of French artillery shells bombarding the city. They show the city against the background of a early sunrise; however, there was no heavy columns of smoke that resulted from the French artillery shells exploding in the city There was also no sound of French airplanes and having them bomb and machine gun the Syrians' positions.In addition, the way the French troops move around the city was terrible. In a combat situation, troops would have their rifles at port arms so they be ready to bring their weapons to a firing position just in case they get fire upon. They would not be walking around the city with rifles on their shoulders and walking in a parade ground formation.One person stated that the American people during the 1920s never heard of the Syrian revolt. I suspect one reason why the Americans never heard about it that the American press was concentrating on Prohibition, robbers like Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, organized crime like Al Capone, labor strikes that occurred after World War I, and the communist scare of the 1920s. Even if it was printed in the paper, it was just a sideshow event that never got much notice. I bet that today most Americans still don't know about the revolt in Syria. The only time we paid attention to Syria was during the various Arab-Israeli Wars and Syrian intervention in Lebanon.It was and still easier to concentrate on doing war movies against the Japan and Germany since we won those wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sirocco" is a crock-o</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right up there with the hysterically overrated "Beat the Devil," this has to be Bogart's worst. What a lot of the actor's fans forget is that between that string of gems that began with "High Sierra" and ended with "Desperate Hours," he cranked out a lot of crap. Anybody remember "The Two Mrs. Carrolls?" You don't? Never saw it? Lucky you! I'm not talking about the second-banana parts he had in the '30s. This is about movies he made after he was an A-list star - when he should have known better. In "Sirocco," he's a cynical American gunrunner in 1920s Syria, when the country was a French "protectorate" - the 20th-century euphemism for "brutally ass-kicked colony." He has an affair with a French officer's wife amid a rebel uprising. Sound romantic? Forget it. If they thought they were coming up with a second "Casablanca," they were way too delusional to be handed car keys. The one plus in the movie is its sympathetic portrayal of the native Syrians - a rarity for the backward America of the 1950s. As for the rest: Bogart's character isn't exactly a heartwarmer; he's so cool and world-weary he's practically petrified. But the lead female role is the real dead-weight. Obviously sketched out by a misogynist screenwriter, she is a clawing, viperish, manipulative harridan! Marta Toren does what she can with the role, but "Violette" is so unappealing you want her idly stroll over an open manhole and - just - disappear! If that's not enough, Bogart's sidekick (Nick Dennis), tries to steal every scene he's in and ends up looking like a drooling idiot. All that, plus a genuinely grim atmosphere makes "Sirocco" as attractive as three-month-old hummus. Even Bogart fans should pass. I warned you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Business needs no morales or loyalty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slow moving drama with big name stars, but falls short of being memorable. Humphrey Bogart is an independent gunrunner in Damascus in 1925, when Syria is fighting off the occupation of French military invaders. Bogart is far from his best. Others in the cast are: Lee J. Cobb, Everett Sloane, Zero Mostel and Marta Toren.</fullReview>
