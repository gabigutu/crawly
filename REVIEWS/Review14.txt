		<shortDescription>Well acted character study - NOT an action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard grumblings from two guys who were leaving the theater behind me after seeing THE INFILTRATOR that this movie did not have nearly enough action/bloodshed for them. I think they were expecting another SCARFACE or GOODFELLAS. That is not what this movie is. This movie is a character study of a man who goes undercover with the Pablo Escobar drug cartel and develops relationships/friendships with these bad guys in order to bring them down. The real conflict in this film is not the action, but rather, the RE-ACTION of "the infiltrator" - will he remember that he is just playing a role to bring down the bad guys, or will he lose himself in the role and the relationships and become a bad guy himself?If you are looking for an action movie, this movie will be a little too slow for you. If you are looking for good acting and a strong character study, then this is a very enjoyable film.Much of that enjoyment hinges on the performance of Bryan Cranston as Robert Mazur, "The Infiltrator". We follow him as he dives deep into this criminal organization. Cranston is in about 90% of the scenes of this movie, so his performance better be strong or this will be one long movie, indeed. Fortunately for us, his performance is better than strong. He continues his string of fascinating/watchable performances and he more than anchors this film and makes it worth watching.Ably assisting him is a strong supporting cast - Amy Ryan (as his boss), Jason Issaacs (somewhat wasted as the District Attorney), Benjamin Bratt (as one of the main bad guys), Olympia Dukakis (in a fun turn as his aunt) and Diane Kruger (defying age as another agent posing as his fiancé - when I first saw her I thought "that's a young Diane Kruger" until I realized it WAS Diane Kruger!). Finally, John Leguizamo as Mazur's partner, Emir Abreu is TERRIFIC. The best performance I've seen from him in quite some time. If this movie was a little better and a little later in the season, I'd be touting him for an Academy Award nomination.If you want blood, guts and action, wait for the Jason Bourne film. If you want an interesting, gripping film that is well acted check out the Infiltrator - you'll be glad you did!7 (out of 10 stars) and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LJ'S QUICK MOVIE REVIEW"I think we've been doing this backward. We've been following the drugs to get to the bad guys. What if we chased the money?""The Infiltrator", starring Bryan Cranston, follows the fascinating tale of Robert Mazur, a U.S. Customs Agent who goes undercover in a drug cartel. The stakes are extremely high. If Mazur's disguise isn't convincing, he will be brutally tortured and murdered. He, along with his two partners, have to deal with intelligent drug-lords, ruthless thugs, and shrewd businessmen. Watch as the trio concoct risky plans and false identities while avoiding the suspicion of their targets.The severe tension is truly felt through the amazing performances. Cranston steals the show, while Diane Kruger, Benjamin Bratt, and Emir Areu are all top-notch. There are nerve-wracking moments where viewers sincerely fear for the characters' safety. Overall, "The Infiltrator" is a riveting and complex movie with great direction and superb acting. If crime-dramas are your cup of tea, I highly recommend watching it.If you found this quick review helpful, please visit LJ's Movie Facts on Facebook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cranston shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The war on drugs has become a bit of a punchline in the real world, but has proved to be fertile ground for filmmaking: Sicario (2015), American Hustle (2013), Traffic (2000). Additionally, the popular Netflix show "Narcos" takes on the same Medellin drug cartel as this latest from director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, 2011). The movie is based on the true events of Robert Mazur's book "The Infiltrator: My Secret Life Inside the Dirty Banks Behind Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel" (a title that's very descriptive, if a bit long).Bryan Cranston continues his impressive Hollywood run this time as Robert Mazur, the man who goes undercover to expose the money-laundering system of the cartel. His flamboyant alter-ego is known as Bob Musella, a character that allows Mazur (and Cranston) to show a side not typically seen. His antics get him inside Columbian Drug Lord Escobar's organization in the mid-1980's.When Mazur realizes the traditional method of chasing the drugs isn't working, he decides the age-old idiom "follow the money" might be a better approach. This takes him inside the world of international money laundering, and he learns that banks and governments are quite dependent on this huge business of drug money movement.There are specific groups of people here: the government agencies, the small task force, the corrupt (and appreciative) bankers, the various levels within the cartel, and even Mazur's family ? all these forces intertwine to make life difficult for Mazur and his team, and provide a glimpse into the complexities of undercover work.In addition to stellar work from Cranston, the cast is terrific. John Leguizamo plays Mazur's motivated partner Abreu; Diane Kruger plays his undercover fiancé; Juliet Aubrey is Mazur's real life wife who doesn't much appreciate his declining the early retirement offer; Olympia Dukakis provides a dash of comedy relief as Mazur's Aunt; Yul Vasquez is the creepy money manager for Escobar; Benjamin Bratt plays Roberto, Escobar's right-hand man and the key to Mazur's case; and Elena Anaya (The Skin I Live In, 2011) is Roberto's wife. Also present are Amy Ryan, Jason Isaacs and the always great Michael Pare.There are a couple of standout scenes ? one involving chicken and voodoo, and another with a briefcase mishap, but my favorite is the Happy Anniversary cake scene in the restaurant where Mazur flashes his alter-ego Musella for his real wife to see ? and she is understandably stunned.The movie does a nice job of capturing the look and feel of the era (30 years ago), but it's somehow missing the elevated suspense it portends to drag us and the characters through. Some elements seemed impossible to believe ? why would Mazur risk his family's safety? The timeline was a bit muddled. We aren't sure how much time has passed, but there certainly don't seem to be enough interactions before Roberto is telling Mazur he is "like family". It plays a bit like those romance movies where the two leads are head over heels in love after a conversation or two. An element is missing and it affects the level of tension throughout the film. And that's something even a Leonard Cohen song ("Everybody Knows") can't fix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Cranston is not your typical movie star, although he seems like it. Underneath the cool-high-school-dad exterior, there's an actor of great depth and unexpected power. You'll know it when you see a scene involving his character, said character's wife, and a restaurant on their anniversary dinner. Cranston seems to have benefited during his years as Walter 'Heisenberg' White on TV's Breaking Bad. And it has contributed greatly in this biographical crime thriller, about as straightforward and predictable as a stab in the gut.Yes, Brad Furman's (The Lincoln Lawyer, Runner Runner) directorial efforts here will not be known for their signature riffs, as there is none to speak of. It's standard thriller fare, the kind that would do well had it been released between the late 1980s and early 1990s; pure genre fare that caters to mostly adult film-goers that aren't interested in seeing computer-generated superpowers or rubble. In other words, unoriginal yet mature, grown-up stuff.The Infiltrator, however, is textbook example of how great casting can elevate shopworn genre material into solid entertainment, as the always-reliable Cranston has proved here. Sure, he is strongly supported by a bevy of intriguing cast members including Benjamin Bratt, John Leguizamo and the lovely Diane Kruger; but in portraying real-life undercover agent Robert Mazur shimmying his way up through Pablo Escobar's criminal empire, Cranston's understated but strong everyman presence confidently carries the movie solely. That quality alone replaces the tediousness often found in similar true-crime movies with an intense amount of uneasy suspense and grounded credibility, providing lots of fun for Cranston fans as long as they do not expect anything groundbreaking.Breaking Good, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, Great Performances and High Production Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Infiltrator" is a gripping, intelligent, fast-paced cops-and- robbers movie with a dream cast and high production values. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the entire film. The top-notch performances by all involved, but especially Bryan Cranston, really sucked me in. That "The Infiltrator" tells a true story of a brave, resourceful, and heroic public servant, Robert Mazur, makes it inspirational as well as entertaining. It's the early 1980s and Colombians and others are exporting millions of dollars' worth of cocaine into the US. US Customs special agent Robert Mazur takes on the persona of Bob Musella, a Mafia-connected money-launderer. He offers his services to the Pablo Escobar cocaine drug lord. The Escobar gang takes him in and he and other Operation C-Chase agents take down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the seventh largest bank in the world. Mazur is masked and driven through Colombian jungle where he is forced to participate in a grotesque voodoo ritual. He and his fake fiancée, Kathy Ertz, (Diane Kruger) are invited into the private homes of extremely wealthy and discriminating criminals, and he and Kathy form genuine personal relationships with them. Mazur's partner, Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo), gets a man killed and has a brief breakdown afterward. Indeed this is a very violent movie. At one point Mazur is conversing with a fellow undercover agent and without any warning the agent is shot to death with blood spattering everywhere. "The Infiltrator" doesn't offer any innovations on cops-and-robbers. Many other films have treated South American drug kingpins, Mafiosi, and undercover agents. Too, the movie never asks the question that must be ramming through the viewer's brain. "Why the heck are we doing this? Why are we spending so much money trying to prevent drug addicts from doing what they are going to do, anyway? Why are we allowing criminal gangs, who are as violent and sadistic and without conscience as any terrorist group, to have so much sway? Why don't we legalize and regulate and tax drugs and let Darwinian laws take their course with the addict population? Why don't we let Uncle Sam reap the profit of human weakness, rather than criminals?""The Infiltrator," unlike the 2000 film "Traffic," never asks that question. PS: I am a proud Polish-American and so is Robert Mazur, whose father's family is Polish, and whose mother's family is Italian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twizard Rating: 80</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many reasons to like The Infiltrator. It takes place in the '80s, it's suspenseful, and it gives us a really gritty inside look at what life is like for a good guy who goes undercover to work with the Colombian drug cartel.Which is what Bryan Cranston's character does. He's a guy on the verge of retirement and could easily leave to spend time with his wife and kids, but takes this one last job. And it proves to be the toughest one yet as he poses as a money launderer to try and take down Pablo Escobar's entire drug trafficking network.It takes place in the Reagan-'80s and so there's this whole overt camera filter over the whole film. It's not too distracting, but it's also not terribly necessary. But it's minor.The whole thing plays out as one giant sting operation. And the filmmakers understand that in a 2 hour movie, you don't need to run through all the details in one quick dialogue-filled scene. However, it would've been nice if they had given us a little more along the way.It starts unraveling a little over an hour in. There's about a 30 minute stretch where you're looking at the person sitting next to you saying, "What's happening?" There's a lot left unexplained, but I guess there was more concern about the movie not becoming any longer.The film is long at 127 minutes, but it's never really an issue. We need the time to process what's happening and for Cranston's character to evolve over the course of the film.It tightens back up in the home stretch, culminating in an emotionally impressive final scene.The always-under-appreciated John Leguizamo plays Cranston's partner and does a very good and believable job.There seems to be this slightly neglected theme intermittently placed throughout the film about the American economy collapsing without laundered money. It's an interesting idea and one that should have been touched upon way more.Twizard Rating: 80</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More about BCCI than it is about Escobar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Infiltrator" brings the story of undercover agent Robert Mazur. As the movie opens (with Rush's "Tom Sawyer" blasting away), we are reminded that it is "Tampa, Florida 1985", and we see Mazur at work, in what turns out the be the last phase of an undercover job. Due to his length of service, Maruz is offered the possibility to retire with full benefits. Instead, to the dismay of his wife Ev, he decides to take on one more job, far more complicated and dangerous than he ever imagined. As this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Brad Furman, who previously brought us the Matthew McConaughey-fronted thriller "The Lincoln Lawyer". Screenplay is by Ellen Brown Furman (I imagine related to the director, but don't know for a fact). This is a narco crime drama that is essentially "The Sting" on steroids: can Maruz (in his undercover role as Bob Musella) and his rookie partner Kathy Ertz pull off a sting of gigantic proportions, right under the noses of the feared Colombia drug cartel of Pablo Escobar? As you have probably noted, the connection with Pablo Escobar is played up in the movie's marketing materials. The reality is that Escobar is perhaps hovering over the movie in spirit, but the movie in fact is a lot more about what happened with BCCI (the UK's Bank of Credit and Commerce International), the 7th largest private bank at that time. (And if you are looking for a true Escobar crime drama, check out "Escobar: Paradise Lost", starring Benicio Del Toro and Josh Hutcherson.) "The Infiltrator" has many great moments, and is tense almost from the get-go. Bryan Cranston, on the heels of the excellent "Trumbo" last year (but still best known for his work on TV's "Breaking Bad"), delivers yet another winning performance. But the big surprise for me was the outstanding work from Diane Kruger as the rookie undercover partner. She is superb (aside from being superbly beautiful). Lots of great songs throughout the movie, including The Who's "Eminence Front", which plays not once but twice in the movie! "The Infiltrator" opened this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, somewhat to my (pleasant) surprise. I found "The Infiltrator" to be a riveting narco crime-drama, the likes of which we don't get to see enough, and would encourage you to check it out, be it in theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "The Infiltrator" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that will take you on a ride that you will never forget, enveloping with tension, darkness, and the magic only a great production can have. For that you need solid story telling and directing skills, and to complete the package, one can only be thankful for the work of the actors involved. Cranston, leguizamo, and Pratt give what could their best turns ever, and the work done by Kruger is magnificent, reminding us how good and sexy she can be. Cranston is a man who has done well in his government post. He's about to retire comfortable but can't let a golden opportunity go by. It can certainly bring success and fame and might give him a chance to live what one can guess is a longing to experience the ultimate thrill if accomplishing a feat few ever do, to leave a mark in his did, but this could also mean irreparable damage or death.He's familiar with the connections he needs to infiltrate a dangerous world deeper than he ever tried. He knows the logistics, but he can never predict human nature. He soon realizes that once he goes in, there are only two options to succeed or to give his life. It will be the ultimate performance both professionally and personally. He will live his dream, always having the possibility that it might become a complete nightmare.Little by little he goes into the most selective and dangerous circles of the drug world. He interacts with apparently honest professionals who are part of this world. He also hangs with the lowest members of this society, risking his life every minute. The film pumps the suspense and never lets go. It's the good old fashioned thriller that gives you action and a complete character exploration. We known these are real people but most importantly, the performances make you feel you are seeing something really good. In the end, one can't complain that is nothing short of spectacular, a great achievement and a reminder that we can still have a grand time at the movies. A big thank you to all the parties involved, and see at awards time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touch too long and a touch too whitewashed, but a solid, engrossing, ultimately entertaining sting picture with a truly top-drawer performance by Bryan Cranston.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ding-a-ling, and take your seats children because it's time for Oscar-bait semi-thinky semi-sleazy undercover period pieces! You know the type. Some high-wattage actors get all mustached, gold-chained, and spread-collared and take on the eighties. And that's pretty much what happens here. With Bryan Cranston!It's not a great film, but it's a solid genre base hit and entertaining, if a tad too drawn out.On the tail of the successful series Narcos comes The Infiltrator, the story of a slightly less dramatic undercover sting that chased the money, not the coke. Bryan Cranston plays Robert Mazur, a government agent who goes deep as Bob Musella, a mob- connected money launderer. Teaming up with Emir Abreau (John Leguizamo) and his cover-fiancé Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger), Mazur brokers some cash-washing deals between the Medellin folks and a big investment bank, and we follow the trail as it leads deeper in and higher up.The story is based on real-life Mazur's equally real-life book, and frankly isn't terribly interesting (as, to be fair, I suspect many other true bust tales probably are not). And the fact that real-life Mazur wrote the real-life book also presumably accounts for the ultra-pure, good-guy undergirding of Cranston's protagonist in the film. Whitewash? So be it. The victors write the history, and all that.Director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) tries to spice things up with a dusting of sexual tension between Mazur and his cover girl (will they or won't they?); there's also a feely bromance with Benjamin Bratt, who plays the gleaming, wholesome gentleman of the drug trade. Mazur and Ertz form earnest friendships with Bratt and his family, hinting that when the time comes it might be hard for Mazur to sell his pals down the river.Except it's not. Said friendships feel too forced and phony, and Bratt's genteel drug lord character strains credibility -- he's just too polite and wholesome and nice. There's no real doubt that goodie-goodie Cranston will do the right thing in the end.But that doesn't make The Infiltrator a bad movie. For starters, Cranston is a really terrific actor. Even in a throwaway opening vignette with a bowling alley waitress, his microexpressions just seep realism. His performance here is fantastic, and it's worth watching this movie just for him. The supporting cast is earnest and hardworking and generally believable. There also are some pretty locations, great fashions, flamboyant characters, classic meanies, and crisp shots. It all comes together quite nicely.And then it stays there. The Infiltrator falls short (long?) in its pacing, running probably a half hour past its bedtime. It's perhaps hard to fault Furman for this, given that he was directing from a script his own mother wrote (no joke -- must be a first?). Happy Mother's Day, I left your chaff in my picture! Either way, you might find yourself wondering when time's up.All told, The Infiltrator might not be best of breed, but it's engaging, atmospheric, nicely shot, and offers an interesting take on the 80s drug war -- one with fewer Uzis and drug mules and more middle eastern bankers. Relax and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'boring and watchable'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not avoid borrowing the qualifications used by a Web site from Toronto when writing about this film. It's 'boring and watchable'. An unusual combination indeed. And yet, this is exactly how I feel about 'The Infiltrator' directed by Brad Furman - a talented director who succeeded much better IMO with The Lincoln Lawyer.I must also confess from the start that I am not a fan of the 'true crime' genre. Reality has the disadvantage of being in many cases confusing, and bringing it to screen demands a level of processing that elevates it above what we - as spectators - live in our daily lives. After all we do not pay the price of the ticket to live inside the cinema theaters the same lives as we do in the fresh air outside. Script writers and directors approaching the genre face the dilemma of either sticking to the truth of the story (and risk to be drown in the details) or of 'dramatizing' the reality to make it better fit to screen (and risk losing credibility). Succeeding is not only an exercise in balance but also requires the art of finding the artistic truth that makes the film valuable and attractive for viewers beyond the documentary news.The element that makes 'The Infiltrator' different is the building of the relationship between anti-drug cop Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) and the drug dealers and the bankers that financed the business in the crime organization that he infiltrated in the 80s playing the role of a money launderer. There is tension in the building of the undercover team and the way they gain the trust of the lethally criminals they deal with, but the difference is really the fact that Mazur not only starts living as the character he poses as, but also seems to develop feelings of real sympathy (if not friendship) towards his enemies-in-law.The result is to some extent convincing, but it takes a long way to get to it, almost the totality of the two hours film. The rest of the time is spent into telling a cops vs. drug dealers story that is not too original and not too different from so many other stories we have already seen on screen. The inflation of real life characters brought too screen because they were around in the real story, but not really living a screen life of their own makes much of the introduction part, and much of what happens next confusing. Bryan Cranston is OK in his role, but an actor with more charisma could have made the character more interesting. The best acting in the film came from John Leguizamo, an actor I have seen in many supporting roles, and I am glad to see that he gets near more consistent roles towards a lead role in the future that he certainly deserves.The Infiltrator is not the big crime film 'inspired by a true story' that I am waiting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timely, relevant and completely fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie isn't perfect but when it is good it is really good. There are so many interesting aspects about the drug war that haven't been shown so centrally on film before - the white collar financial type undercover DEA operation and the money laundering aspect. This movie is timely and relevant. It's fascinating to see the money laundering by BCCI. And right now the money laundering scandal with the Malaysian fund 1MDB stretching from the U.S. to banks in Singapore is playing out. Drug movies have to be shooting a minute action movies to be exciting.Brian Cranston is as always watchable and sympathetic. It takes a moment of getting used to him on the other side of the drug war and Walter White comes to mind now and then. Diane Kruger shines as a DEA undercover agent posing as his fiancé. She is convincing, watchable and beautiful. She needs more feature film roles.There are a few faults: it's a bit confusing who some of the minor drug characters are and which side they are on. Some things leave you a bit confused and should have been clearer. Please give this movie a chance - don't give up if the start is a bit slow. This is a true story that deserves to be widely known. If you enjoyed Narcos so far this is a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Meth Cooker to Drug Catcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's certainly been a lot of Bryan Cranston craze since his series Breaking Bad. There's no doubt that this man has a lot of talent and certainly broke that Malcolm in the middle image and shown he's very versatile in that he can take almost any role that hes interested in and just makes it his own. With the Infiltrator this is another which Cranston makes his own and although some might say its almost another kind of criminal/drug dealing sort of adventure the difference this time is that Cranston isn't playing the drug guy but the Drug Catcher.The Infiltrator is based on the real life story of Robert Mazur(whom Bryan plays in this feature); it takes place in the 80's during the Colombian drug trade headed by Pablo Escobar and Mr. Mazurs job as a customs agent is to infiltrate this particular business and stop distribution but at the same time he's having to deal with family and how that affects him going into this undercover operation. The big surprise isn't even him having to lie and infiltrate this organization but having to establish relationships and lie because in doing so he learns about them on a personal level and although these are criminals whom have committed some really horrible crimes there's another side to them mostly just that they're human and do this to protect and provide for their families as much as Mazur is trying to do for his. Mazur gets into the league with these guys and begins infiltrating and finding out as much as he can about them and their operation but when it comes down to busting them can he actually go along with it?Whats interesting about this film is the fact that the relationship angle is built up, Mazur gets invested with these crooks very personally to where they're friends but none as much as his relationship with Roberto(Benjamin Bratt) and his family. You see their motives and how this business affects them(its vital for their family) and even Roberto's wife's view on it. Some aspects of the film itself are some what rehashed from other films (particularly the family aspect whether it's the crime family of the cops family)and indeed I felt a kind of Breaking Bad vibe with this film in how Mazurs work is affecting his family and marriage in particular(though unlike Breaking Bad this was a real situation in BB it was fictional) but I do believe that what makes this one unique is its being able to show both sides of that aspect to where when it gets down to it can you truly bust your own friends that you just made even though that trust was based on a lie. But the performances in this film are really hold this together, watching Bryan Cranston just act in this role is fun and especially since hes in another drug film but on the opposite side with the law busting the bad guys, Benjamin Bratt definitely nails it as Roberto playing the big bad guy and what Benjamin brings to that role.All in all if you need something to watch and would like a good crime film this is definitely one to check out you'll just be glued to your seat with your eyes to the screen every step of the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking Not So Bad, Actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the era where summers are ruled by superheroes, sequels to blockbusters from last century, or uninspired remakes, The Infiltrator is nice adult entertainment where actors and story are carrying the films rather than CGI booms.Although The Infiltrator might be Brad Furman's best directorial job (that might not saying much) it is not very memorable film with lavish style (although it tries to emulate some 'Miami Vice' vibe with it's night shots of the city and very Jan Hammer like synthesizer score by Chris Hajian). It's pretty much textbook example how to make character driven film with straight forward story based on true facts. The story might even be too straight forward - not much excitement or thrills. The Infiltrator feels little bit like last years 'Black Mass' with Johnny Depp - exciting premise and perfect players, but still, that something special is missing to make it truly great film.If you care more about Oscar worthy acting jobs rather than Oscar worthy special effects, then The Infiltrator is summer movie for you. It's just pure enjoyment to watch banter between Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamo, or the growing respect between Cranston-Kruger and Bratt-Anaya duos.</fullReview>

He sold his performance. Gritty, real, and I bought it. Diane Kruger, same thing. But Bryan Cranston? I have no idea what they were thinking. I just didn't buy it. The tension never felt real with his acting. It was so weak. Had they cast this with the right guy - I'm thinking Josh Brolin in Sicario - this would have been epic. I know there's only a set amount of great actors so I can't expect Gyllenhaal, Christian Bale, and Mcconaughy in every flick but I really had my hopes up for this one.</fullReview>

Blending in the cast of BREAKING BAD, this feature illustrates that top international bank executives and drug lords both adhere to the same Sociopathic "anything goes" immoral codes, eagerly signing their Pacts with the Devil for the instant gratification of Living Large atop a pyramid built upon the shattered corpses of their countless victims. Cynically pillaging Civilization, secure in their confident rejection of any possible After Life and Final Reckoning, the villains that fill the screen of THE INFILTRATOR prove that Wealth Accumulation and Corporate Structure are both Dead Giveaways of Satan's Work. President Ronald "The Gypper" Reagan is referred to frequently during INFILTRATOR as the sanctimonious spider (along with his "Just-say-no" Henchwoman Nancy) lording it over millions of normal people snared in his Web of Deceit. Black Lives Matter has long documented the truckloads of crack that Reagan dispatched to the ghettos, while using his Iran Contra bankers to make a mockery of the U.S. Constitution. Look for President-Elect Trump to burn that old parchment as America becomes wholly of, for, and by the Billionaires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie at all ........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went and saw this on Saturday and it was entertaining. I will say that there could have been a little more story to go w/ the overall plot. There was something missing, but not much. It tells of an undercover vice cop, and its a true story. The guy is lucky to still be alive and walking the streets today. Two thumbs up ! Most likely this movie won't be at the regular theater's unless it takes off. It will be Netflix material soon. Regal charged $9.50 per ticket, Saturday matinée. Too expensive - like Cinemark the best. Plus Cinemark has better drink offers. IMDb makes it hard to write reviews. I miss Yahoo Movie reviews. Easier and better laid out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cranston takes on Escobar and BCCI!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like another reviewer has said, this is more about how a US customs agent helps to bring down BCCI than taking out Escobar even though he is the main target. The film opens up with the main character(Cranston) involved in a smaller drug bust, in which he is wounded and is now up for early retirement. He decides to stay on for the biggest assignment of his career as he is tasked to somehow take down Escobar by going after the money men.(BCCI and co.) The movie is decently paced as you see how the undercover agent and his small crew befriend some Escobar bigwigs by offering to launder their money in the US by using legit US businesses as cover, using smaller amounts of $$$$$$$ to get under the feds radar. As Cranston's character gets deeper into the caper, the stakes get higher, and some folks die in the process. This isn't Scarface in terms of violence, as only 4 guys get capped throughout the film, so if you are going in for some really hot action you will be disappointed. I am glad that the film didn't go over the top with the violence though, as it really would not have fit the plot all that well. Still this is Pablo Escobar, so everyone is on edge as they know what will happen if their cover is blown. The acting is superb all around though. Cranston is doing his job, but as the danger mounts it is putting a strain on his family and his marriage, and this is really well portrayed. The people playing his crew are top notch as well. The novice agent that plays Cranston's wife for the scam is one gorgeous woman to boot!!!!!!! All in all I am glad to have seen this movie, as it was a portrayal of something that really went down in 1985, and was based on the book about the said incident. It was a great change of pace movie, to escape from all of the superhero and kid flicks that come out every summer. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes drama, with some suspense thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A credible film but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cranston is very good because he is a hard working actor who brings the appearance of the spontaneous to what are in fact very good moment-by-moment choices. He has worked on the film before filming -- to me that's evident. But the film -- for all its true story and round-peg-in-square-hole plot -- tends too much to the standard. Of particular concern are a number of short scenes, edited so as to leave the audience dangling. "What just happened?" could be the call. The "old aunt's story" is particularly odd. I very much appreciated the possible infidelity not happening. In fact, Cranston and his wife are given a complex relationship that becomes even more complex. However, her "this is my choice" was sufficiently ambiguous that even the last scene between the two was vague and relied on my saying "oh, this is what must have happened."Go, but if you get your expectations down, you'll have a better time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of Robert Mazer; an undercover customs agent that got quite close to Pablo Escobar and incarcerated many people related with drugs traffic and money laundering; this is the type of movie that after a few minutes will keep you nailed to your seat and will not let you breath until the very end.Most of the credit; belongs to the incredible performances by Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamon closely followed by Juliet Aubrey and Diana Kruger as real and fictitious wives and many other secondary characters; but also thanks to the very tight script; and a direction that forcing slow burning pace that make you feel inside the movie.There are however some open questions that the movie barely answer; first of all the CIA involvement but a few things about characters that are not really very clear (specially about Mr. Mazer motives to keep risking his and her family lives).In brief; worth the price of the ticket and your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Life Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Infiltrator", starring Bryan Cranston-Godzilla_2014, Breaking Bad_tv; John Leguizamo-John Wick, Assault on Precinct 13_2005; Diane Kruger-Inglourious Basterds, The National Treasure movies and Benjamin Bratt-Ride Along 2, Catwoman.This is based on a true story that happened in the 1980's. A US customs special agent went undercover to put a stop to Pablo Escobar's Columbian drug cartel, or at least try to slow it down a bit-Remember, this was when Ronald Reagan was President and his wife Nancy was just saying 'No' to drugs. Bryan plays the undercover agent tasked with the job. John is a fellow agent that helps him make connections in the drug world. When situations get too heated Bryan gets an assist from another agent, Diane-who happens to be on her first assignment undercover-as his fiancé. Trying to get close to Pablo Escobar is no easy task, what with all the security measures, big banks laundering money, etc. and Benjamin is Pablo's next in command. Any little mistake can, and often does, end in a violent death or dismemberment. The best part of this movie is the acting, of course, and Bryan really sells the part. He is very good. All the problems of living undercover are touched on-getting close to drug lords and becoming their friends-and during the end credits, you get to see what happened to the surviving cast of players. I think I read that the operation ended in the arrests of something like 85 people. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 7 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, the American side of the Escobar story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before buying my tickets for this film, I had mixed feelings on the plot and how suspenseful or emotionally gripping it would be. I thought maybe it would be something that was just dull and far fetched. Within the first 10 minutes, I was proved wrong. The entertainment hits you like a brick wall and the character build, is something truly remarkable. Now note that I've always been a fan of anything Bryan Cranston, but I tried my best to keep a level head and not get all excited just for him. I wanted to be able to take in all aspects without any bias, which I could successfully do because not only was Cranston amazing, but his supporting roles were also great, if not better. John Leguizamo plays Emir, who is Robert Mazur's (Cranston) partner in crime....or should I say justice. These two put on a show together that really shines. The chemistry between them really adds great meaning to the story, and it really shows how strongly they had to depend on each other to work this case out. On the female side of the story, we have Juliet Aubrey, who plays the wife of Cranston, and does a great job at relaying the emotions of a scared and worried wife who is trying to deal with her husband's continuous second life while under cover. In the other corner we have the beautiful and talented Diane Kruger, who plays Cranston's fake fiancé who has to step in when Robert slips up under cover and says something he shouldn't have, endangering them both, and the entire investigation. Lo and behold, Kruger steps in and puts on a performance that is, in my opinion, the highlight of her career. Now I gave this film an 8/10 because it has some imperfections. Mainly because Cranston and Leguizamo just happen to be the luckiest under cover agents in history. Also because the way it ended, didn't really feel satisfying. The action and the suspense was enough to keep me going for weeks, but the ending of the film just left me in a weird rut. However, besides the ending, and the crazy ways these agents avoid death, this movie really delivers and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. It worked so well because I could really feel the dirty drug filled lives these people were living. There were some shocking moments that left me speechless, and moments I could have done without, but overall, it was a wonderful, heart pounding film. I would definitely recommend for everyone to see this. You wont regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great effort by Mr. Cranston, but I would bet more people wanted to see the story being John Leguizamo's character more than Robert Mazur's we-should-be-scared undercover guy.There is no singular reason that this movie should've been made. Is it to tell us that undercover cops sometimes cross the line in friendships? Already done..."Donnie Brasco" or that the United States had funded the drug trade in order to set up secret wars? Yep "Traffic." So what's left. Sorry, bones picked waaay too clean by vultures.The message then becomes...drug dealers are people too. I do enjoy the darkest of humors, as when the sting of the century has unsuspecting criminals celebrating but not realizing they are seconds away from collapse, but the real fun is watching Leguizamo skirt the dirtbags he has to use and befriend in order to get his own adrenaline high. And sometimes the darkest moments are when decisions are made that sever yourself from humanity. There isn't enough mud here to be "Scarface," but a solid effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, entertaining, poor clichéd script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this completely forgettable film. I'll give you the summary of what it seems most agree upon:Acting: Cranston is fantastic. Leguizamo is equally good as the slick, likable but somewhat sloppy and looser partner. They make a great team and clearly hold the film up. Everyone else is forgettable.Script: Like a tired cliché. We care most about family says one of our villains while cutting vegetables with a sharp knife. The closeness that Cranston develops with the mob is never actually visualized and it happens all too quickly. Cranston and Leguizmo sell a very disconnected script. There are also holes that are bizarre and unexplained such as Cranston being followed to his real home, yet this is never brought up in the film.Cinematography: Just fine, nothing memorable nothing obtrusive.Music: Ditto.Summary: A by the numbers supposedly true story of the takedown of one of the greatest drug kingpins in history, Pablo Escobar. Cranston is charismatic, very capable and very likable. But the script seems to make it incredibly hard to get to Escobar one moment and then like a hot knife through butter during the next moment. It's an enjoyable performance by this duo but it won't stand up to repeat viewings. Well worth the entertainment price but that's about it. I'm not even a Cranston fan and have to admit that he's just a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you're dealing with the Medellin Cartel you need more pizazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert (I guess - not sure)Just finished watching this movie - it was OK. I was around in those days and even went to Cali, Colombia a few times in the 70's and 80's. Even many of the low level dealers were millionaires back in those days. So what really disappointed me was this guy was dealing with top members of the Medellin Cartel and the most they showed was one Rolls Royce, a hangar with a few nice planes, and one nice house. But these were people with hundreds of millions of dollars and many at the top were even BILLIONAIRES. Back in the 70's a billion dollars was maybe worth 50 billion today. Pablo Escobar had his own zoo with exotic animals all over the world, the Ochoa's bred beautiful stallion horses, and many of them had gorgeous mansions all over Miami and the U.S. but they didn't show none of that, which was very disappointing for me. Unlike many people who write reviews I'm no expert on movies but this seemed like a low budget film to me. How can you have a low budget film when you're dealing with billionaires and top level people from the Medellin Cartel? Doesn't make sense...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book Is More Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Cranston which is why I went to see this film. I've felt he chooses projects that are solid pieces of story telling. I immediately felt that had I not read the book many years ago, I would not have known what was happening because the story telling in the movie is very disjointed and somewhat uneven. A huge problem is Cranston's age. He's too old for the role of Mazur. At the time the events took place Mazur would have been about 40, Cranston looks 60. He has young kids, and Diane Kruger is much younger than him. So I didn't buy into the character as being believable as nonfiction.More could have been added to let the audience know what the police department was facing financially to front his undercover operation. That is a key issue to this story. The undercover cost was huge. I was not disappointed that there was not a lot of action, I wanted a film with lots of dialogue but more detailed storytelling so the audience can follow the challenges of the behind- the-scenes undercover operation. I wanted more of the thought process behind Mazur's decision to take on another case instead of retiring when he could. What was his motivation to take on this dangerous assignment? Never saw a dialogue between him and his wife about his motives since this case would take a toll on their family. The film felt like a made for TV on USA Network or the CW, not a Hollywood production. The acting overall is fine, but the dialogue was stiff. Drug world stories can be a yawn but I was expecting it to be much closer to the book which is why the combination of having read the book and liking Cranston so much led me to want to see this film. The movie didn't need more star power than Cranston, Kruger, Dukakis (love all her work) Bratt and Leguizano. Aaron Paul would have made a good Mazur but he's too young - Bob Odenkirk would be the right age and might have been a more interesting choice as Mazur. One detail that was not clear to me was the fate of Pablo Escobar. Cranston would have been better used as a supporting character, someone working with John Leguizamo, and John was great, and he's believable as a drug informant. Kruger was stunning as the fiancé and it's interesting that after this case she never again went undercover. Seems like a smart move since there were some close calls. This won't be the summer hit I thought it would be and it might play well on Netflix or Cinemax. The film looked grainy so that might be challenging for a small screen. Not sure why it was done that way, I found it distracting. Overall not fun movie going experience. If the story of Pablo Escobar is of interest, pick up the book, it's a page turner. The details are worth knowing and one gets the sense of the complications inherent in undercover work and the risks everyone takes. The book also tells of the creative ways drugs are moved from country to country. And more could have been emphasized why following the money, not the drugs, is a better trail to Escobar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure to infiltrate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is some excellent acting here, especially from John Leguizamo and Diane Kruger, but I found myself hoping I could "fast forward". Not only is the pace problematic, the film fails to exact the kinds of suspense that you expect from a film like this. As such, my involvement in what happens to the character s was minimal. It didn't help that the period (the 1980s) is rarely invoked, so we are kept at arms' length from the location as well as the characters. And the plethora of dialogue, and the many characters who come and go, helped seal the film's fate.There are so many films about the drug problem in the U.S. (e.g., "Traffic", "Scarface", "Sicario", "Clear and Present Danger", "Savages", "Miami Vice", "Bad Boys") that this film doesn't stand out at all. The unique perspective of looking at an undercover operation that focuses on the money laundering situation is indeed refreshing, and the best part of the film. From that POV it is certainly worth watching. Had the direction, music, and photography been at the same quality as the acting, this would have been a truly memorable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE INFILTRATOR': Four Stars (Out of Five)A crime drama flick; based on the true story of an aging U.S. customs agent, named Robert Mazur, that helped take down Pablo Escobar's enormous money laundering business. The film was directed by Brad Furman (who's also helmed other crime flicks; like 'THE LINCOLN LAWYER', 'RUNNER RUNNER' and 'THE TAKE'), and it was written by first time screenwriter Ellen Brown Furman; the screenplay is based on Robert Mazur's autobiography (of the same name). The movie stars Bryan Cranston, Diane Kruger, John Leguizamo, Benjamin Bratt, Amy Ryan and Olympia Dukakis (Cranston and Leguizamo also costarred in 'THE LINCOLN LAWYER', and Leguizamo also starred in 'THE TAKE'). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's made a small amount of money at the Box Office (although it probably won't make a profit until video). I enjoyed it.The film is set in the 1980s; when Robert Mazur (Cranston) was set to retire from his job, as a U.S. Customs Service special agent. He then decided to take on a dangerous new assignment; infiltrating drug dealers, that were trying to clean up their dirty money. Robert used an alias, known as Bob Musella, and he got assistance from two other agents; Emir Abreu (Leguizamo) and Kathy Ertz (Kruger). It was Ertz's first undercover assignment, and Robert was worried about her safety (and putting the job at risk). The assignment also ended up putting Robert's whole family in danger.The movie is a little routine, and unoriginal, but I think the cast, and direction, make up for that. It does, at times, have a strong TV feel to it; but the Furmans are able to breath some intense drama, and excitement into it. Cranston, Leguizamo and Kruger all do what they do best (as well); and Kruger looks stunningly beautiful in it, too. The film is decently entertaining, I'd say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Infiltrator" is an engaging and entertaining true story which sticks close to the truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Cranston is such a great actor that his chameleon-like performances leave audiences wondering if there's any part that he can't play. Although he had taken on many roles in TV and movie dramas going back to the early 1980s, he first became well-known as a comic actor. Between 1994 and 2006, he played dentist Tim Whatley in "Seinfeld", another character named Tim in "The King of Queens" and became a three-time Emmy nominee for playing the inept but loving father on "Malcolm in the Middle". Soon after that show, Cranston's career took a more serious turn when he became high school chemistry teacher turned meth cook and, later, drug kingpin Walter White in "Breaking Bad", a role that brought him six more Emmy nods and four wins. But Cranston has never stopped doing comedy.While still doing "Breaking Bad", he had recurring roles on "How I Met Your Mother", "The Cleveland Show" and "Robot Chicken". He has also voiced characters in the "Madagascar" and "Kung Fu Panda" film franchises. Meanwhile, Cranston had important roles in dramatic movies like 2014's "Godzilla" and in three Best Picture Oscar nominees ? "Saving Private Ryan", "Little Miss Sunshine" and "Argo", the last of which won the award, and then he earned his first individual Oscar nomination for playing the lead in 2015's "Trumbo". Bryan Cranston's talent for disappearing into a character serves him especially well as undercover U.S. Customs agent Robert Mazur in the biographical crime drama "The Infiltrator" (R, 2:07).Mazur was one of the best in the business ? and has gone down in history as one of the most effective. As "The Infiltrator" opens, we see Mazur working undercover as a street-level drug dealer trying to bust a local south Florida drug ring. He's injured in the operation and is offered the opportunity to retire with benefits, but he thinks there's more good that he can do. Fellow agent Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo) comes to Mazur with what he says is a lead into the international drug operations of none other than Columbia's Medellin Cartel chief Pablo Escobar. Emir is street-wise, but Mazur thinks he's a bit of a loose cannon. Still, Mazur finds the prospect of breaking into Escobar's empire too tantalizing to pass up.After appropriate preparations (including finding and adopting a new name ? Bob Musella), Mazur is posing as a high-level businessman who can help the cartel launder its drug money. As Musella, he gets deep into that world through contacts established by Emir, gets some credibility and important advice from convict Alexander Biscuiti (Joseph Gilgun), who is sprung from prison to help out, and even from his gutsy, but morally ambiguous aunt (Oscar winner Olympia Dukakis). Also along for the ride (and playing a major role in the operation) is Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger), on her first deep cover mission, playing the role of Musella's fiancé, partly because of a noble but dangerous mistake by Musella himself.Eventually, Musella gets to meet (and, along with Kathy, become close personal friends with) top Escobar lieutenant Roberto Alcaino (Benjamin Bratt). In order to bring this very complicated and perilous sting to a successful conclusion, Musella must deal with corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) bankers (played by Sa?d Taghmaoui and Art Malik), shady informants (Juan Cely and Michael Paré), unpredictable Medellin cartel members (Yul Vázquez and Rubén Ochandiano), supportive but sometimes unreasonable supervisors (Amy Ryan and Jason Isaacs) and the constant danger to his team, his understanding but frightened wife, Evelyn (Juliet Aubrey), and their three young children."The Infiltrator" is an engaging and entertaining true story which sticks close to the truth. Screenwriter Ellen Sue Brown and director Brad Furman take a few understandable liberties with the actual story in order to make their movie clear and cohesive, but they manage to make an actual international banking scandal from the 1980s interesting and they don't waste Movie Fans' time with unnecessary exposition. The climactic scene is fabricated, but is fairly close to what happened in the operation and makes for a terrific closing to the story. Cranston's acting is fantastic as he portrays a real person whose job and very life depended on effectively playing a role for some very ruthless people. The rest of the cast is equally exceptional, making for one of the best and most diverse ensembles of 2016. The overall content of "The Infiltrator" is a little too ambitious and its spirit a bit too subdued, but it's well worth a look. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most lifeless movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had an award to give for the most disengaging movie of year I would give it to this movie. Right now. I wouldn't even wait till I've seen all the movies that I want to in 2016. Because this is probably the most bland, heartless movie I have ever seen. Which is something I never thought would happen in a Bryan Cranston movie. The movie is about a government Infiltrator. He is given the task of going undercover in one of the biggest mobs in history and break them apart. With this kind of source material it would seem impossible to make a boring movie. You have an R rating, one of the best actors working, and one of the craziest true stories ever.And you did the very thing no one could have imagined. You made one of the dullest mob films I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. The only reason I am not calling this one of the hands down worst films of the year is because of Mr. Cranston. Who, despite the garbage he is working with, turns in a typically excellent performance.Every else does a pretty great job as well. But this is one movie that proves that an ensemble cast means nothing when the movie around them sucks. You'd think going into a film like this that there would be stakes, or tension. But there isn't, at all. Even scenes where bad dudes are looking over a briefcase filled with recording equipment don't land. Why? Because that scene lasts less than ten seconds.You can't expect people to feel nervous about what is happening when the person looking over the case doesn't even touch it. He looks at it from a distance for a few seconds and clears it. Where's the tension in that? Moments like this plague the film. Anytime actual conflict arises it stays for so short a time that it doesn't feel remotely nerve racking. The makers put these moments in the film to make you nervous right? So, why do they mean nothing to the rest of the film? This mans whole career is based around secrecy and going with the flow. But when the entire film feels scripted there is nothing to get invested in. It doesn't feel like the bad guys are controlling anything. It feels like Cranston could have done whatever he wanted to them. If he asked them to handcuff themselves and walk into a prison cell, I'm confident they would have done it. It was so incredibly boring to watch. Even when it tries to show how the job is affecting his family life, it's bland. That has everything to do with the absolutely atrocious characters. There's no one to care about here in the slightest. I was constantly waiting for some one to die so that we could really see who these people were and how would react to that but that moment never came. Not only does this movie feel artificial and generic but it plays everything so safe. Despite being in the middle of a mob that prides themselves in cutting people up you never see anything like that. So how can we be invested in our main character or his "struggle"? This disregard of storytelling is only highlighted by it's run time, which feels ten times longer than the two hours it claims to clock in at. There is so much that this film does wrong it actually blew me away. Among all the reasons I listed there's also a by the numbers soundtrack, poor direction, and an utter disregard to small details. When your film is mostly meant to be character driven and every one of them is a walking blank slate then you have a big problem. The only saving grace is Cranston and his incredibly convincing performance. Aside from that, this is easily the most lifeless, bland film that I seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talking Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the subject matter is basically the same, the main difference between the two is that "Scarface" was an action picture, and this one relies heavily on dialogue. And lots of it. There is also a great deal of plot and a dizzying assortment of characters to wade through. Now that I think of it, there are more flaws than strong points in "The Infiltrator", which I hoped would have some of the tension and absorbing narrative that "Scarface" had.Bryan Cranston is a marvelous actor but is trapped in a picture that needed Denzel Washington or someone like him. He is not an action hero and is not believable as an undercover Gov't agent - more like a crooked accountant. He is also too old for the part. Supporting cast was competent, especially John Leguizamo, but there is no Robert Loggia or Michelle Pfeifer or F. Murray Abraham here. Sadly, it is up to Bryan Cranston to carry the picture."The Infiltrator" has the feel of a made-for-TV movie in that most camera shots are close-ups and tight shots and the picture lacks scope. Lastly, the scenario is somewhat confusing due to all the characters and the intricate plot. There was no rewind on the armrest in the theater but I could have used one in some spots.I was hoping "The Infiltrator" would be the summer's blockbuster, but I guess we are in for a pretty dull summer movie season. My rating above means it's passable entertainment, so go and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Infiltrator is a perfect fit for Bryan Cranston. It has the right amount of Walter White elements to wheel us in, but this time around he gets to be on the other side of Law Enforcement (well sort of) As Robert Mazur, Cranston plays a seasoned undercover cop on the verge of taking down the biggest drug cartel in history, at the same time, he's trying to balance his personal life with his career. A lot of the strength in the movie is the moments when the cops are on the balance beam and attempt not to cross the line, with intense moments of Mazur's career and family accidentally crossing paths.An excellent performance by John Leguizamo when it comes to this. He plays a undercover cop who gets too excited about being undercover. He has his moments when he explores the darkness and it gets to him, which are very deep. Plus he was a good Yin to Cranston's Yang.I love Benjamin Bratt in the film (Although, getting a little tired of him playing the head of the drug cartel in all these movies)The Infiltrator was a perfect blend of gritty crime drama with a dark sense of humor. The combo made for a realness in the police work.The cinematography does a good job in getting us into the 1980s era, and helps with the grittiness. sometimes it did feel like I was being beaten over the head with footage that places in the time period but that's fine.Overall this a a point for Bryan Cranston as a good leading man, and it's a great crime drama.</fullReview>
