		<shortDescription>A stunner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just completed watching this harrowing documentary and it is only now that, having got the time to catch my breath, I am able to review it.To begin with, I'd recommend not reading any of the other reviews so that you start watching it with absolutely no foreknowledge, and so that the film gets the opportunity to have the impact that it is designed to have, which, in my opinion, would only be fair to the director. Therefore without revealing the story I would only like to mention that this is a documentary that the film maker has made in remembrance of his close friend and his family; and its a bloody good watch.The direction is great and the best part is that this documentary is made in 'real time'; which means that events unfold as the film progresses. This is probably something that I've never experienced in any other documentary before, since most of them are made in retrospect. It makes its point clean and crisp and it will certainly not be a waste of your time and money.The film progresses in a quick and efficient manner and the time just seems to fly. The film is narrated in a very smart way with plenty of smash cuts. This documentary plays like a big budget commercial Hollywood film and will probably have you glued right up to the last minute.So its good stuff. If you get the chance to watch it I'd recommend it. If you don't, well that's just too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Experience the Life of the Bagbys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never been affected by a movie as much as this. Ever since i saw this movie, I have not been able to get the story out of my head. The way Kurt uses home movies and interviews to capture the essence of Andrew is perfect. I feel like i know and love the Bagby family. The film takes you through Andrews life showing the people that he touched along the way. The quote that really stuck with me was when Clark said something along the lines of "What would life be if this one person never existed". This is very relevant because of this movie to this day Andrew is affecting the lives of people that he never met including mine. He has inspired me to really cherish the relationships that I have, because life is too short for petty things. I have never cried in a movie, but this movie managed to get me to cry within the first 20 minutes. I am not a movie critic so i do not know how to write a review, all you gotta do is watch the movie. You are doing yourself a disservice if you miss this beautiful tribute. Much love to the Bagby friends and family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking Roller Coaster Few Will See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the pleasures of an all access pass to film festivals is the opportunity to be drawn to something by word of mouth. I was accidentally standing outside the theatre after the first viewing of this film at the Sarasota Film Festival. Everyone coming out was raving about it, a film that I had originally pegged as just another manipulative true crime documentary. Most had been crying like babies. My freedom at the venue allowed me to change from a viewing of Priceless to this film. I had no idea I was waking into a wall of cinematic fury.To say it was staggering is inadequate. The impact of it all is in part driven by style. Though the form is a traditional overlapping story structure, the frenetic pace of the presentation creates a sense many times of 'too much information'. Mixed in however are some stylistic tricks that act as accent marks to move your perception to one place versus others. This moves your feelings in one direction or another within the time frame of larger movements of emotion that drive the story. The technique, though not unique, is applied in the course of a story that would seem to demand more subtly, however, it works wonderfully. Could it be that within this piece of time about a very personal tragedy a new documentary form emerges? But the story and the trek to get through it are what keeps you glued. I will not go into the morphology of the multiplex of stories here since it would ruin the impact. Leave it to say that constant unexpected change ups give one the feeling you are on a roller coaster of emotional complexity. The net effect leaves you nearly breathless and, as one sobbing young woman I convinced to see the film told me, in desperate need of water.The film ends with a seemingly endless list of all involved, most at least tangentially affected by the event if not actually in the film content. As you absorb the story's impact, consider that the true theme of the film is to introduce you to this virtual community of people discovered by this young filmmaker who started with an homage to his best friend and ended up capturing something far more profound.There are many moments where we try to take solace in the good that can come from the horrid. After viewing this, ask yourself that even though all involved would have wished for the events not to have happened, the emotional fulfillment exuding from this film may have left all surviving the better for it. This filmmaker's love letter to his vastly extended family that grew out of the tragedy and his odyssey documenting it make for the kind of things we most look forward to in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiration through loss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started out as a remembrance for a son about his father and it became so much more.I saw this film Sunday and it still resides in my heart and haunts me. This is the first documentary I have ever seen that has drawn me in completely, and made me feel as though I am part of the story and a friend to the victim. It was a roller-coaster of emotions and there were quite a few teary-eyed people by the end. I feel I had to give it a proper review, but like many have stated, it's hard to do so without ruining the effect the filmmaker intends. This story pulls you along and unfolds as it does for our narrator, the filmmaker, Kurt Kunne. His story is personal because he grew up with the central figure, Dr. Andrew Bagby. Andrew's parents, David and Kate, whom I had a chance to meet with after the screening, are lovely people, and I instantly saw why they foster so much love and support throughout the film: They are genuinely kind people who give off a wonderful parental-vibe. They show so much love and hope in the face of almost insurmountable evil. You hold onto their love and hope through the last few minutes, and eventually you find what the narrator finds: inspiration.The editing and the directing reveal a truly gifted filmmaker, Mr. Kunne, a superb storyteller, bounces back and forth between past and present events. He reveals what happens at several key points which leads us an ending you should rather just see than have me explain.From what I've read there were several richly deserved standing ovations as the film ventured into the festival circuit. If you have a chance to see, "Dear Zachary," this film will be playing until Thursday of this week at the arc-light cinemas in Hollywood. The filmmaker, Kurt, said the film will be making a return to Hollywood in early November and shall be coming to New York City in late October, MSNBC will be premiering the film December 7th and the DVD shall go on sale some time in mid-FEBRUARY. I suggest everyone pays their money to see this film for the sake of advocacy groups and to support bail reform in Canada. Although the legal system in Canada is put on trial in this documentary, it reveals a real problem with our own justice system here in the United States, and how some criminals are given preferential treatment over victims and their families' rights. I cannot tell you how much this film has affected me. How truly inspirational I find David Bagby and Kate Bagby to be?Please support Academy caliber documentaries, with a strong sense of heart, and a great message of hope. This is a wonderful, albeit tragic and yet inspiring film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Zachary Dir. Kurt Kuenne ***** "Perhaps it's done already, perhaps they have said me already, perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story, that would surprise me, if it opens, it will be I, it will be the silence, where I am, I don't know, I'll never know, in the silence you don't know, you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on."-Samuel Beckett, The Unnamable That final sentence, from one of the great novels of all-time, works here as a description of the heart and soul of this film, the best I've seen all year. Kurt Kuenne sets out to find all there is to know about his murdered friend Andrew Bagby after talking with friends who knew parts about Andrew's life that he never told Kurt. Shortly after stating this endeavor it is revealed that the woman who killed Andrew is also pregnant with his son. Kurt then decides to make the film into a memorial to give to Andrew's son, Zachary.This is a film that is a search for its filmmaker, a search which ultimately finds itself asking the most unanswerable of questions. The unfolding of the events surrounding the search cause Kuenne to revisit his approach, his interview subjects, and allows the audience a personal look into an artist trying to make sense of the impossible (in fact, the film was never meant to be released except to family members).Nearly a decade in the making the film compiles years of interviews with dozens of people who knew and loved Andrew, as well as through a number of home videos. Part of makes this a stunning example of art as process, is the fact that Andrew starred Kurt's home made movies growing up, and we see footage from those films, where we see even then the use of film being used to make sense of the world.The amount of footage, interviews, and information comes at you early and quickly. The audience becomes immersed in the lives of Andrew's family; knows the information when the family knows it, and experiences the events as if they were one of Andrew's friends. An outsider may have been tempted to manipulate the audience, but Kuenne's approach is earnest and admirably restrained. He obviously cares about his friends, and is nothing but charitable to them by his representation (or non-representation in some cases) in this film. That said, Kurt doesn't pretend not to be involved himself. He keeps in narration where he gets emotional. He lets you know that he is frustrated and furious, and that at times he doesn't know where to turn.This is one of those rare films which is an experience. I cannot remember the last time I was so viscerally effected by a film. Not just in tears but going through a wide range of palpable feelings, some clear cut, some frustratingly ambiguous, and leaving me haunted, purged, shaken. The film allows us to experience with Andrew's parents a diverse and difficult range of emotions. You will be angry, sickened, hopeful, humored, devastated, inspired, awed, depressed, and everything in between. At times you'll want to throw up your hands and say: "I can't go on!" It shows us humanity at its most evil, yet, without being sentimental, shows us how life can go on in the face of incomprehensible horror.I don't know if I've seen another film which so effectively conveys the impact of the loss of a human life. A shot early on in the film catches a quick glimpse of ripples in a water, and this film looks at those ripples instead of focusing on the initial cause of those ripples.And in the end, when the film comes back to the filmmaker, on his experience and his journey, in a recap of what we've experienced with humanity in microcosm throughout the film, its a devastating turn which displays the brilliance in the film's structure, despite it appearing a bit haphazard on the surface, all along.I don't know whether to tell you to read more about the film or not. I've tried not to tell too many details because for full effect, and to do justice to the filmmakers experience you need to let this film wash over you. But I also don't know if some of the more sensitive viewers will make it through this film unprepared. Maybe this will suffice: this is not an easy film; the best never are. But like Becket's Trilogy, by looking through at life through the most hopeless of situations, somehow those who experience the work come out stronger, more human. Victor Frankel's early title for Man's Search for Meaning was "A Case for Tragic Optimism." That is this film.read more reviews@ floydfortnightly.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot praise this heartfelt documentary enough. Too often documentaries with such a personal tie have touch (or more) of vanity. Not Dear Zachary.Kurt Kuenne could have easily turn this tribute to a dead friend into a vanity project, or overly sentimental. The evolution of this project is full of sentiment, indeed, but is done so in such a way that the viewer is completely engaged in the story and feels the loss on a personal level.This is the hardest film to review because to explain it, is to spoil the experience of it. Let's just say that Andrew Bagby was a very loved person, and this tribute to a man whose life was brutally cut short could have easily been a depressing, dark tale. Instead, while it has some wrenching moments, it's ultimately a love story of family and friends, and the powerful influence people can have in each others lives, for good and for ill.If you have the opportunity to catch this film, do not hesitate to do it. This is one I'm adding to my DVD collection as soon as it's available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely devastating documentary you will never forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It makes me sad to see people criticizing "Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father" for its technical limitations. I rented knowing only it was about a pregnant woman who killed her ex-boyfriend, the subsequent plight of the victim's parents and their agonizing efforts to win the custody of their grandson, Zachary (whose mother was released on bail). But the whole story is so unpredictable - and devastatingly sad - that the less you know about it, the better.Writer/director/producer/composer Kurt Kuenne was a close friend of Dr. Andrew Bagby, who was killed by a psychotic woman, "Dr." Shirley Turner, right after he had broken up with her. He decided to make a final film with his childhood friend Andrew, and when they learned Shirley was pregnant with Andrew's baby, whom she named Zachary, it became more than a tribute to a friend, but a project to show Zachary the father he would never get to know. With Shirley at large, however, their nightmare wasn't over.With such a tough, emotional subject, it would be easy to get overtly sentimental, but Kuenne does a terrific job. The film is obviously a very personal project, and visibly no-budget, but that's not an issue because this is not a film meant to be visibly stunning. Apparently, some people are way too cynical to appreciate a film for its heart and content rather than focusing on its aesthetics and "artiness". It had a much bigger effect on me than the last Oscar winner for Best Documentary, "Man on Wire" (a fine film itself). Had this film been directed by, say, Michael Moore, it would have been more incendiary and garnered larger media attention, but wouldn't have been half as passionate, compelling and, most important, honest. Kuenne uses the cinematic tool to document history, make a tribute for beloved friends (not only Andrew and little Zachary, but also Andrew's parents, David and Kathleen, the emotional core of this story) and to instigate the audience, both emotionally and intellectually. When most movies that get a wide release don't even attempt either of these goals, this is a remarkable achievement. Not to be missed. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Traumatic Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father is easily one of the most traumatic films I've ever seen. Its not technically the most impressive documentary film, but the subject matter is powerful-enough that you cannot help but be deeply impacted by the story. I've hesitated to suggest it to a few of my more fragile friends because it is one of those films that can leave you in an emotional funk for days afterward. Its that powerful of a film, but not for the faint of heart. I personally would not watch it again, though I'm grateful that the filmmaker stuck with the project through it all and did not give up, as many would have. I'm grateful this story was told, even if it was painful to experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I certainly wasn't expecting it to be this overwhelming. It's the emotional equivalent of having your head kicked in against the curb. I thought I knew where the story was going but I couldn't shake the sense of sinister dread. I didn't think the story could get any bleaker but then... Maybe I'm doing it a disservice but I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who isn't in an already too fragile state. Because once you invest your own emotions in the story, you are screwed - within minutes I went from sad to angry to shocked and depressed and back and forth etc. That's quite an achievement. Yes, the film is flawed but you know what? I don't mind that films are flawed, it's the emotional punch that I'm going for. The film is made by someone on a mission (albeit a confused one at times) but the end result is a film that is raw and intimate.Oh, there is a special place reserved in heaven for all the Bagbys. And a special place in hell for the murderer and the judge who set the murderer loose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Finest Documentaries I've Ever Seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not fair. It's shocking, and If you have a Netflix account it is essential that you sit down and spend an hour and half watching the documentary DEAR ZACHERY: A LETTER TO A SON ABOUT HIS FATHER. I mention Netflix because it is part of their watch instantly section and I can say without a shadow of a doubt: you need to see this film.Directed by Kurt Kuenne, it's a story about him on a quest to make a movie for Zachery Turner whose father, David Bagby, was brutally murdered by his Mother. When the Canadian courts let her go on bail it turns into a story of his Grandparents fighting to stay in Zachary's life. These Grandparents never give up. But mostly the story is about the people we leave behind and the legacy that we leave in their hearts. If you think your life is useless, if you think you haven't made an impact on the people around you, then think again. This movie pulls you in at the beginning and doesn't let go.To tell you anymore about this story is to ruin the emotional impact of a film that will leave you in tears, and thanking God for the people around you. In 90 minutes I laughed, cried, was made numb, angry, philosophical and by the end I rejoiced in the beauty of the human spirit. I saw through some very dark turns that love can conquer all. But more importantly I learned the giving up is never an option and that it's our duty to help those in need.The film begins with some cheesy computer graphic logo, and the moniker MSNBC Films presents and maybe that's what caught me off guard. I almost turned it off right then and there. But by the time it's over the cheesy little touches made the film feel like it was made by real people and not slick Hollywood documentary film makers. It feels like one of those photo montages at a funeral, or a wedding. It a small snapshot into the lives of of people ravished by tragedy and it ends on a bittersweet note that for once shows the power of real life.DEAR ZACHERY is one of the most powerful and moving documentaries I've ever seen. It's an emotional film that will leave you angry and yet hopeful. It tells a story that can't be made up, it rejoices in the best of people, during the darkest periods of their lives. I've seen thousands of films in my life and DEAR ZACHERY is a rewarding film, that does what all great films do. It makes you rejoice in the human spirit and demands that if we see something wrong we fix it. Please see this film, I promise you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder of doctor by ex-lover and subsequent legal mishandling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am friends with the parents of the doctor who was murdered by his ex-lover. This documentary was made by a friend of the victim, with whom he grew up, and who is a respected filmmaker in his own right.The miscarriage of justice in attempting to extradite (from Canada to the U.S.) the woman who murdered the doctor is difficult enough to comprehend, but there are yet other complicating factors, such as her having her victim's baby and the attempts of the baby's grandparents (parents of the victim) to obtain custody of the baby.The film is staggering, and the filmmaker does not spare the viewer's emotions. It is brilliantly filmed and edited. The movie was premiered in the U.S. at the Slamdance Film Festival in Utah, then showed in San Jose, CA at the Cinequest, and is going on to the South by Southwest Festival in Texas. If you have a chance, check out this film--it's not particularly uplifting, but it portrays a very real problem with our justice system, not only Canada's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Voyeurism is a funny thing. Watching other people's little dramas or lives may seem boring at the outset, but often times it can be just as interesting, if not more so, than anything a big studio can come up with. With "Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father," we as an audience get a glimpse into a man that we otherwise would never have known. And after viewing this film, I have to graciously thank writer/director Kurt Kuenne for this.After the murder of his lifelong best friend, Dr. Andrew Bagby, filmmaker Kurt Kuenne decided to go and interview everyone who knew Andrew in order to give his late friend's soon-to-be born son a way to know his father. But unbeknownst to anyone, this film would turn into something completely different.Reviewing this film is difficult. For one thing, no one had any idea where this film was going (Kuenne, who narrates, openly admits this, although no one could possibly imagine what was going to happen). But more importantly, this film has something that many films don't: passion. It has a voice. This film will make you laugh, cry, scream in both terror and anger, and so much more. Even the most politically, one-sided films do not speak to the viewer like this film. In that sense, this film is a masterpiece.But, on a critical scale, it comes up a little short. For me, the most effective bits were the interviews about Andrew. Those were funny and touching. Even if it added a few extra minutes to the running time, it would have been worth it. I felt like I could have watched a whole day's worth of interviews about Andrew. But the film gets into the struggle between Shirley Turner, Andrew's ex-girlfriend and probable murderer and Andrew's parents, who are trying to seek custody Andrew's son, Zachary. The film sort of loses focus at times, and it really inhibits Kuenne's goal in letting us know who Andrew was. At the end, it almost seems like a piece of propaganda (see the movie and you'll understand). Judging by what happens, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but still. Of minor note, the film only shows the good things about Andrew. Not that Kuenne turns him into some sort of flawless figure (Bagby does that himself), but it would have made Bagby seem more well-rounded.Yet I wholeheartedly recommend this film. It introduces us to a wonderful person, and his name was Andrew Bagby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He was never late ? Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Non-fiction and me, we don't generally get along. Not that the truth is something I try to avoid, I just usually find documentaries too much like a school lesson, teaching rather than entertaining. Film to me is a medium that I use to go to different worlds, to be shown something new and exciting. Fiction as a rule, even if based on real events, is usually made more emotionally accessible and shown less analytically, to hit home stronger. However, every once in a while something will come out that truly astounds me, a tale that touches me on a gut level where the story transcends the monotonous narration and still frame photo after still frame photo. Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father is just that experience. The last thing I want to do is ruin any of the twists and turns taken by this true life account delving into the death of a beloved man, so this review may be vague. On those same regards, though, I also want to recommend not finding out the facts yourself before viewing. If you let the document play out, slowly uncovering its own secrets while you discover them too, the impact will hit so much harder. But, if a swift kick to your heart isn't what you're looking for, by all means read up on the case. It's just that that punch is what makes the film so powerful.Filmmaker Kurt Kuenne set about making this documentary in order to collect all the memories of his slain friend, Andrew Bagby, before the people he was to interview forgot them. He travels to England to retrieve stories from Andrew's mother's family there and then sets off on a cross-North America trip to visit everyone who held a special place in their heart for his friend. Between family, friends, and co-workers, the documents captured are truly moving. It's a stunning portrait of this man that was loved by all he met. Descriptions range from how you'd feel you could trust him with your life upon first meeting to how after spending fifteen minutes in conversation, you'd feel as though you knew him longer then people you'd known twenty years. Bagby's was a life cut way too short, and the reverberations of his death literally shook the world, it's tremors spanning two continents, three countries, and countless people.A staple in Kuenne's films from grade school, Andrew was a self-deprecating young man, always striving to be a success in the medical field. He did what he had to do, moving to Newfoundland for medical school, after being rejected from all schools the year before, and eventually settling in Pennsylvania to put down his roots. After finding that surgical medicine was not for him, Bagby stumbled upon a family practice that allowed his affable nature to come through in force. The consummate people-person, he excelled at his job, saving lives and touching them for the better. After only a couple days, one co-worker spoke of, people were already requesting to be seen by him.Of course, this rosy glow being set around him is an obvious thing to occur. No one wants to say how horrible his friend was after he has passed. The beauty of the film is that one, every account is so genuine that you will believe he was a saint, and two, the course of events that transpire after his murder become so horrifyingly unbelievable that you will be glued to the screen waiting to see how it all ends. Thankfully Andrew had so many friends close to him, because without that line of communication no one might have known the truth of that fateful night. When an ex-girlfriend shows up at his door wanting to meet and talk, Bagby calls a friend to share the news about how "you'll never guess who showed up at my house". When that friend warns he should go out the back and call the police, that no one would drive fifteen hundred miles to see an ex without reason, Andrew just laughs and says "why?" He was such a loving and trusting person that he'd never comprehend the horrors living behind some of humanity's eyes. Monsters do exist and this film will introduce you to one of the worst.On the other hand, though, it will also usher into your knowledge the existence of angels. Bagby's parents, David and Kathleen, are the kind of people you wish were in your life. Upon the discovery that their son was about to have a child himself before he died, the two quit their jobs and moved to Canada to try and be a part of his life ? especially since his mother was the supposed killer of their Andrew. Watching the events that happen concerning the extradition case to get Shirley Jones back into the US to face criminal charges is impossible to comprehend. The sluggish judicial system and lax care on the safety of individuals, (if someone is deemed not a threat to society, they may walk free because they have already killed the one person they wanted to kill?now that's sound logic), will leave you speechless. It got to the point to where in order to be a part of their grandson's life, David and Kathleen had to visit him with his mother. They had to make play-dates and play nice with the woman who murdered their son. How they could have done that is a testament to their love for both Andrew and young Zachary, but once you hear David's account of their "options" you will see that they did look into alternative methods. When the many twists and turns rear their head, Kurt Kuenne could have easily given up on his work. But the idea of commemorating his friend kept him going and I am very glad he did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of depressing films and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of the sub-genre. I love tragic films like Dancer in the Dark, Amour, Martyrs etc. all of which have reduced me to teary eyes which is something I never normally do. Dear Zachary is without a doubt the most heart-wrenchingly devastating film I have ever seen. Nothing I've seen has come close to the sheer power of this film.I went in almost totally blind and would urge everyone else to do the same. Dear Zachary left me utterly stunned and I'm sure if I didn't watch it with my family then I would've broken down into sobs. Tears clouded my vision, my heart thumped like a train, chills covered my spine and my lip quivered. This might sound like a regular occurrence for the more sensitive amongst you who weep at Marley and Me and Beaches, but no film has ever affected me so physically like Dear Zachary has.It's impossible to rate and review this film because to do so would take away its importance. Dear Zachary is beyond a rating, it's absolutely crucial viewing for everyone to see how the law can absolutely wreck people's lives. The film is made by one Zachary's father's closest friends so it's made with a raging passion which grabs you right from the start. There are images and sounds within which will haunt you forever.No fictional film could ever come up with a story as shocking as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Watch This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly a must-see. If there's ever been a documentary that helps showcase the flaws in the Justice System, this is it. I've never finished a documentary, though I DO enjoy them, and been left with a lingering doubt in my soul. But this one ... this was the one. It is very important, if at all possible, to not read reviews. Do not watch trailers. Don't let people influence your thoughts going in to this film. Just watch it. Get it over with. Then cope.You may not feel good afterwards, and truthfully, it'd be strange if you did, but please watch this. I know and understand this really isn't a good review. Or even a review at all, really. But I just needed to say something about it. My wife and I watched it last night. And I'm not sure if we'll ever have the correct words. The director is everything that is still pure about society. We should all thank him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just experienced the joy of Kuenne's most recent film "Shuffle," I sat down with this one expecting a sad but warm'n'fuzzy (and obviously personal) account of friendship and loss. And that's what he set out to make. But who knew that such Real Evil exists in this world, and that his tale would turn into one of Horror that would leave me intensely depressed, angry and shattered? This a mighty, mighty difficult journey to take, but it's personal, independent filmmaking at its absolute zenith, and was worth the extra dose of Clonazepam I needed to get through it. Kuenne is quite the multiple threat...the brilliant editing that hammers the bigger moments home with unbearable ferocity is his, and the trenchant music score is his. This is an Important Talent, and I'll be in line for whatever he does next. And may I say to Mr. Kuenne that I'm so sorry that life dealt you, as well as Dr. Bagby's wonderful family and circle of friends, such unspeakable horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting and devastating documentary that will stay with you for days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many documentaries that are better than this one, specifically from a technical stand point. The biggest shortcoming on this film is the poor editing. It was never meant to be released theatrically, it was meant for the family it focuses on, so there are forgivable aspects, but it is indeed distracting to watch the film with distracting editing choices. Parts of the film do feel really messy and quickly put together. The subject matter on the other hand is one of the most heart wrenching things I've had to watch. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion and you sit there, helpless with nothing to do. The film is about Andrew, a 30 year old male who was shot to death, 5 times, from his ex-girlfriend. The filmmaker, one of his best friends, decided to make a film dedicated to the memory of his friend. Along the way they discover that the ex-girlfriend was 4 months pregnant with Andrew's child. Now the film switches focus and becomes a "letter" of sorts to Zachary (the child) about the father he will never get the chance to meet.That's only a fraction of the emotional core of the film. I have nothing but utter respect and disbelief in the strengths of Andrew's parents, for what they chose to go through in order to be apart of Zachary's life. The director manages to showcase Andrew enough to make it seem like the viewer knew him by the end of the film. I have to hand it to Kurt (the director) as well, he goes to great lengths to speak to and film every person that had some sort of involvement in Andrew's life. His family, his friends, his co-workers, etc. He goes on a cross country trip to track down these people and talk to them. There was undoubtedly hours upon hours of footage to splice together and as I mentioned before this film was never meant for theatrical release. So the entire production was done by Kurt. Every aspect he had control over and it's a heavy task. His relationship with the subject matter makes the doc extremely subjective. Yet with all the evidence presented, is there another way to look at it? An abundance of emotion overcame me while watching this documentary. The two that stood out to me was sadness and anger. The filmmakers shortcomings from his technical aspects isn't a deterrent to the overall film. I say that everyone should go out and seek the film. If you have Netflix, it's available. It's a must see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Dear Zachary: A Letter To A Son About His Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I cried in any movie was a few years back at the end of The Green Mile and that was a good 5 plus years ago and the time before that was probably The Lion King when I was 7 so it's fair to say that it's quite rare for me to get all emotional during a film. This film though had me blubbering like a schoolgirl who had just lost her favourite teddy.Dear Zachary follows the true story of Andrew Bagby, a medical resident who was murdered in 2001 shortly after having broken up with his girlfriend Shirley. She then announces she's pregnant with Andrew's child which leads his closest friend Kurt Kuenne to make a film about Andrew as a gift to the child so he will know what his father was like whilst he was alive.The documentary jumps between these past events and the present in real time so we find out what is unfolding at the same time as the family and friends. The film can be very fast paced and a bit full on especially at the start but this tends to immerse you into the life of Andrew and his family and you become one of them rather than this approach inhibiting the story. There is a lot of focus on Andrew's parents, Kathleen and David, as they go through the emotions of not only coming to terms with the loss of their child but also the challenges in seeking justice for the murderer and fighting for the right with Shirley to see their grandchild.This movie perfectly sums up an emotional roller coaster ride as the emotions I felt varied wildly from sadness to anger, frustration, hope, inspiration, humour and everything in between whilst watching it. I found it even more intense because I knew nothing about the case or this movie coming into it and I recommenced that if you can keep curiosity under control (don't even watch the trailer below) to watch it without prior knowledge of what happened, hence why this review might be slightly vague in places.The fact the documentary is personal to Kuenne brings about a certain objectivity that could not be achieved by another film maker. We get an insight into their life as they grew up in the form of home made movies they did together and family occasions. In some cases this is beneficial as he knows his subject matter better than anyone while in others it's less so as we meet Andrew, the man who has done no wrong in his life (but this bias is understandable, especially considering the intended viewer of the documentary).Movies are supposed to elicit an emotion from you and for this fact alone, Dear Zachary was able to climb its way into my category for one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Granted the technical film side may not be the best you are ever going to see but boy it has a story to tell and it's well worth listening to.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most heartbreaking and horrifying films you will ever see...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Zachary is a documentary, and there is a fallacy about documentaries that this one proves wrong- that they are all logic and lack heart. Kurt Kuenne has made a documentary in a way that a film itself is made, with amazing editing patterns and with a story that really grabs you and moves you. Yes, this is a sad film, but the reason a documentary like this is able to move someone so deeply is not just because it's real, but also because of the craft of the filmmaker. He is trying to make an actual memorial to these people and no words or facts will capture the true horror of a true life event as honestly as what he has created with music. The film plays out very much like a thriller, drama, and tragedy all at once.Now, to the actual events in the film- horrifying. Of course, the film also takes a look at the unbelievably flawed legal system in Canada, but it makes one wonder. Why? Why? Why? To be honest I have never been fond of Canada and the film might play out like an attack against it but my personal feelings can't be kept inside. It is enough to truly make you hate the country. I just hope the film also makes people notice, which is the point of an actual documentary. I usually dislike emotionally-manipulative films, but films like this when are well made cannot be disregarded. As a documentary it succeeds amazingly well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love documentaries because they show unbelievable stories happening to real people. Unfortunately sometimes everyone's worst nightmare can come true &amp; this is the story of a good man who was murdered and the horrible criminal injustices that continued to follow after his death. I have seen hundreds of movies &amp; documentaries over the years but this film affected me more than anything I've seen before. I was blown away by all the love from Andrew's friends and how important he was in their lives. The awful events that happened to him and his family totally broke my heart. I admire Andrew's parents so much for the love they showed to their son, grandson &amp; battle for justice. I came away from this documentary wishing I had known Andrew &amp; had friends like his. I'm sure he would have been very proud about all the tributes they gave him and his parents. The director Kurt Kuenne also deserves praise for making a wonderful documentary that will keep Andrew's &amp; Zachary legacy alive forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What starts as tragic story of an extraordinary young man being murdered, begins to takes unimaginable twists and turns leaving the viewer stunned in disbelief. In 2001, Andrew Bagby, a medical resident, is murdered by his ex-girlfriend in Lancaster, PA. Shortly after her arrest she announces she's pregnant with Andrew's child. Kurt Kuenne, one of Andrews friends, begins a cross country trip to make a film for Zachary, a father he will never know. Running parallel to this devastating story is the remarkable family and friends of the victim, displaying relentless perseverance keeping Andrews spirit alive and how he touched so many lives around the world. Andrew's devastated parents uproot their entire lives and relocate to Canada in order to fight for the future of their newborn grandson. During this time, the Canadian government freed Turner (ex-girlfriend) on bail as she awaited extradition to the United States. As a result, a tragic story of loss evolves into the unimaginable. Despite this painful story of loss, it is the awe-inspiring people that make this documentary so poignant and unforgettable.</fullReview>

The quality, the editing, the music.. It did not need more 'stuff'. No, I am no filmmaker but it is just so pure and that was exactly what this story needed, something pure.I am so sad for 'Bagsby' and his little, cute son he is now comforting, they are together somewhere I hope. Zachary looked so much like my youngest daughter who is 17 months now so I was falling madly in love with the little boy on my TV. And then he died. The woman who gave him life ended it. I did not see that coming, strangely enough, and I was deeply shocked. Sweet, sweet boy...I hope you rest in peace in your dad's soft and caring arms &lt;3After sobbing for half an hour I did see hope though, what a beautiful people are the Bagsby's and what a beautiful people are all of their friends. The world has beauty in it because of people like that. Keep strong, keep fighting and keep remembering. Kurt, you made a perfect film that touches lots of hearts I think and although it would be so much better if you did not need to make this film, I truly feel there is a reason I saw this today.

		<shortDescription>Will tear a hole in your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not you are a parent, as long as you are a functioning human being, the documentary Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father will tear a hole in your heart so wide that you can drive a truck through it. Dear Zachary was written, produced, and directed by Kurt Keunne in tribute to his childhood friend, 28-year-old Dr. Andrew Bagby, who was murdered in November, 2001 by his girl friend, Shirley Turner, an emotionally disturbed woman twelve years older than him. After the couple had broken up, Shirley had purchased a gun, then drove from her home in Council Bluffs, Iowa to Pennsylvania to meet Andrew that night in the park, where she shot him five times.The film, originally intended for Andrew's son Zachary as a picture of the father he would never see, is both a love story, a crime story, and a horror story, and one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen. While the film is a passionate cry from the heart, it is also very angry and disturbing, and is not recommended for a family with small children. Shot like a home movie, with photos, home movies, interviews, news footage, and recording of telephone conversations, Dear Zachary is a wild ride with cuts so fast it will make your head spin. When the director discovered Andrew's interest and skill in photography, he realized that there was much in his friend's life that he hadn't known about and set out on a journey throughout the United States, interviewing people who knew his friend.We hear testimonials about the kind of person Andrew was from people who knew him from the time he was a child to the time he graduated from Medical school and became a doctor doing his residency in Latrobe, a small Pennsylvania town. Friends recalled Andrew as the gregarious, well-loved individual who starred in Kuenne's earliest attempts at filmmaking. As events unfold, the focus of the film shifts to Andrew's parents, David and Kate Bagby, whose emotional resilience in the face of continuing tragedy is remarkable. Kuenne is deeply involved with the family and often portrays his subjects as being somewhat larger than life but he never claims to be objective.Kuenne tracks the events leading up to the murder, the actual killing and the investigation, and the ensuing custody battle when the accused killer gives birth to a son Zachary after fleeing to St. John's in Newfoundland, Canada. What he could not have known was to where the tragic circumstances would lead or that the Canadian judicial system would fail to protect the family. Shirley, accused of first degree murder, was let out on bail pending her extradition to the United States using the twisted logic of Justice Gale Welsh who said that Shirley was not a danger to the public because she already had killed the one she targeted and would be unlikely to kill again.As we reflect on the tragic shootings in Arizona and the call for healing, the film's rage against the Canadian judicial system and hatred towards the accused killer, while understandable in the wake of unspeakable loss, dehumanizes Shirley to the point of being called "pure evil" and "the devil". More valuable would have been to begin the process of forgiveness and letting go, to consider events in the context of a purposeful universe, and to find hope even when circumstances dictate otherwise. To their credit, however, David and Kate became political activists in Canada after going through their traumatic journey, fighting for stricter laws against sociopaths. The couple's long fight for legal changes in Canada ended recently with a new law that changed the Criminal Code, allowing courts to refuse bail for suspects accused of serious crimes when a minor is involved. For the first time in years, David Bagby and his wife Kate decorated their home this past Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbingly monological doc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I would agree that the documentary recounts a sad story, I had heard about the story in the news, so I knew how the story ended. Without giving the basic plot of this documentary away, it's a very sad and sometimes frustrating narrative. The story of the way the justice system worked with regard to a local woman, Shirley Turner, in St. John's, Newfoundland sounds pretty stupid on the part of most of the lawyers and judges involved in the case. Nevertheless, as a documentary this is an awful piece of filmmaking. The story involves the murder of a young American man, Andrew Bagby, by a Canadian woman from Newfoundland, Shirley Turner. The director was a childhood friend of the deceased and part of the narrative is the journey literally taken by car from California to Nfld. by the director/filmmaker. Along the way the director meets friends of the deceased and there is even a few moments given to mourn the death of a relative of the deceased from cancer. Why? Because he was a relative of the deceased and a hell of a nice guy. The documentary criticizes the problems with the justice system in St John's, Nfld. that affect the murder case and later events. But there is absolutely no attempt to research this topic besides some scenes purporting to be cold calls to some of the lawyers and judges. We view the story largely through the eyes of the director and the parents of the young American man. Thus the film is basically a moral condemnation and denunciation of the woman Turner. But what struck me in the end was that the woman who murdered Bagby was seriously ill. I am not excusing this woman, but in the end it is quite obvious to me that she was just being who she was, a seriously disturbed and potentially violent person. Therefore, despite all the best of intentions of the filmmaker and the friends and family of Bagby, the anger, hostility, and moral condemnation against a person who was obviously mentally disturbed creates a strange effect on a film supposedly made to show love for the deceased Bagby and a child who was possibly his son (considering the erratic behavior of Turner, I wondered if anyone actually ever verified whether the child was Bagby's for certain). Turner was a sick person. That goes without saying. But in the end the hostility towards her just seems to me to show that those involved, including Bagby's parents and the filmmaker himself, were "infected" by the horrible person named Turner (truly the movie's "villain") so that they too end up as spiteful and antagonistic as Turner. In other words, everyone plays along with Shirley Turner. With a disturbing atmosphere of self-righteous and un-self-conscious aggressivity, the film attempts to gloss over emotions of violence and hatred. But by hating Shirley Turner so clearly, the film asks the viewer to participate in the same emotions of manipulation and twisted emotionality it condemns in Turner herself. I felt at times that the use of repetition of some of the clips was truly in bad taste. The closing words of a letter "Love Kurt" cannot hide the pure hatred and revenge the film perpetuates. I suppose if the purpose of the film is to vent and spew hatred against a mentally deranged person, "Dear Zachary" is a success. Personally, I found it awful that they would ask one of Turner's own children from a previous relationship to come on camera to castigate a mother who probably left him long ago. But everything is fair game since it is after all for Andrew Bagby, then for Zachary, and finally for the Bagby parents, those loving grandparents who decided that their son lived in the child carried by Shirley Turner, a disturbed, violent, psychopathic woman who wanted to be recognized so much, even of it meant making those around her want to kill her. And they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that reminds you of all the ripples your life can spread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary from one uncle to his nephew manages to create one of the most heartwarming and heart-wrenching films. It makes you cry, smile, and get extremely angry. The film uses a lot of dramatic tricks to dramatize the emotions of a scene, but what sells the film is the genuine emotions displayed. When watching this documentary, the insane drive the director had to tell the story of his best friend is constantly on display. It stands as a testament to the idea that every life influences 20 others. If the emotional aspects of the film are the core of the documentary, then the crime thriller element is the outer shell. This documentary's true crime story exterior helps take an already compelling film and make it captivating. Especially if you don't know the outcomes of the film before going in, watching this story unravel piece by piece is a journey. This film came from such a personal place for the director so the recounts of each new wrinkle in the story feel like they are coming from a witness with stakes in the story rather than just a film maker who makes the film from an outside perspective. It's true crime drama at its most compelling. This is one of the best documentaries i've seen in years. It pulls you in by your heart strings only to punch you in the gut. Prepare a box of tissues and watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more than a tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dear Zachary" rises above any documentary. It transcends all of them, and calling it a documentary almost seems to be an insult. And please don't read this review or any other review before watching it. Go in as blind as possible."Dear Zachary" is a film that Kurt Kuenne began making in 2001 after he received the news that one of his best friends, Andrew Bagby, had been murdered. Since it was made by one of the victim's best friends, it gives it a much more personal standpoint than the distant point of view of the normal documentary. He began it to learn about the things he'd never known about his friend, and to make "one last film with him", as a sort of tribute. And just like that, he set out to meet everyone that had ever cared for Andrew. However, as many events began to occur over the course of the film, it began to be about so much more, and of course when Andrew's murderer and ex- girlfriend, Shirley Turner, was announced pregnant, Kurt knew he would be making "A Letter to a Son About His Father".The way the film is structured and edited makes it very emotional and somewhat intense. Many relating interviews are inter-cut and sometimes the audio will be overlapping to show the universal experience people had with this man, and who he really was. It also makes the pace of the film overall very fast, but some interviews are so heart-rending that they seem to go on for very long. Oh, and that's another thing: this film is SAD. REALLY, REALLY SAD. This film will play your emotions like a flute. You will be angry, depressed, happy, melancholy, and then sad again. But it's also incredibly beautiful and inspiring in a way no film that I've seen has ever been before.The film shows the infuriating injustices in the court system and the government. And one big problem, among others, is how impersonal it is. The lawyer simply recites the most obscure laws to try and defend their client, with no real empathy for the victims. And since the judge doesn't seem to care much either, she simply allows this. Both of those positions possess a lot of power, but neither of them seem to realize what is on the line. They don't think about the lives behind the people in the court, and this leads to a serious abuse of their power. It makes me think too. When I see that a murder happened in the news, I simply say "that's awful" and move on with my day. I never thought about the families of the victims, or the people that he/she affected. This film is so much more than a tribute. And I'm not talking about the bits of political commentary in it. That's not what this film originally set out to do, and in the end of the day it's only really a side effect of what it really does. It not only made me think about others' lives more, and the people that care about them, but about me, and my own life. It made me think about the people I care about, and the people that care about me. It made me realize how many people each person affects, and how precious life really is, and how abruptly it can end. It's a morbid thought, but the people you love most could be gone tomorrow suddenly.I don't think a film will ever truly be able to tell the full story of a man's life, and who he was, and who he cared about and who cared about him, and why. But this is about as close as any film will ever get to doing that.</fullReview>

I think it's great how so many of Andrew's friends talked so highly of him and continue to support his parents after his death.

Rarely has the courage &amp; tenacity of a family been so honestly and vividly depicted on screen, told through the many friends, family members &amp; colleagues of Andrew, a young man whose life ended abruptly and needlessly in 2001. Kuenne's journey takes him to the UK, Canada &amp; across the US as he pays tribute to his lost friend. Andrew's parents, Kate &amp; David, typify strength, love, determination and heart- wrenching grief as they recount the events of Andrew's life &amp; death and the consequent battle to rebuild their shattered lives in their struggle to care for their grandchild, Zachary. It is a must watch documentary. In fact, if not for the occasional breakneck &amp; dizzying speed of narration, interview grabs and exposition, it would be near perfect. This is not a minor quibble - during the first 15 minutes of watching, I had to check my media player was not set to 1.5x speed, such was the bombardment of information coming right at me. That said, it's a masterful work and unless you're in some way inured to the pain of strangers, Dear Zachary will stay with you long after the final credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a totally absorbing and shattering documentary. While the film could have seen some better editing in the last 15 minutes, it is a devastating film to watch. To get the full impact of this documentary, one should definitely not look up the particulars of the case. If you are familiar, you can still view the film in order to become more familiar with the particulars of the entire situation. It is also an interesting film because of the way in which the film ultimately was put together, given the historical events. The filmmaker might have redone everything, as you will see and will become clear as you watch it, but he didn't, and that makes for a very interesting kind of framing for the entire project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking At A Life and A Death in Full</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A filmmaker decides to memorialize a murdered friend (Andrew Bagby) when his friend's ex-girlfriend announces she is expecting his son.This film is so many things all in one: a deeper look at a friend, an examination of a murder, investigation of the killer, and a critical stance on the Canadian justice system.What makes this documentary go from good to great is an unhappy accident: a change of events that happened part of the way through. Indeed, it is just such a twist that makes all great documentaries what they are: that unexpected moment when what you picked as a subject suddenly becomes even more relevant.Martin Tsai of the New York Sun said the film "has so many unexpected developments that it plays like a first-rate thriller . . . and the film is so unsettling that it will stay with viewers for a long time. Like The Thin Blue Line, Dear Zachary borrows some narrative dramatic tricks, and they pay off remarkably well. It's hands down one of the most mind-blowing true-crime movies in recent memory, fiction or nonfiction."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong, emotional doc that might not be for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you feel like having a good cry, you should definitely watch this documentary. And I don't mean the kind of crying that comes with a Nicholas Sparks movie. I won't list all of the reasons that this movie will make your eyes water because that would not only take too long but also take all the fun out of watching the movie for yourself. Dear Zachary, which started as a tribute for Andrew Bagby from his filmmaker friend Kurt Kuenne, takes a major shift in focus once Andrew's convicted murderer/ex-girlfriend announces that she's pregnant with his son, named Zachary. Kuenne doesn't spoon feed you the background information about Andrew's life gradually, he drops you right into the world of his friends and family with multiple interviews cross-cut together to emphasize the well-loved subject of the film. It was most likely intended to overwhelm the viewer with all this information, so they could be submerged in the situation and could feel for the people involved in the film. Kuenne's techniques of presenting the facts in sequences with fast-paced editing does a very successful job of persuading the audience to feel the emotions presented on screen; all the narrations and images being thrown at you is just like how the family experienced these events. But the film isn't all an information dump; there are slower parts where the audience is given time to process all the information, which is good because I never felt like the movie was miles ahead from where I was. The persuasion of the emotions in the film did exactly as intended, making me feel joy, anger, sadness, grief and sympathy for those featured in the film. I would highly recommend this roller coaster ride of a documentary to those who are mentally prepared; the bitter harshness of the execution and material may be too much for some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Spoilers.This documentary is truly a labor of love. This death prompts a close friend to try and document (to his friends unborn son) who his father was and why so many people loved him. You really get to know this victim and are sad that this happened. This death is not an ordinary situation and we encounter many twists and turns along the way. Even though it's a documentary, you really aren't sure what is going to happen next. The drama is thick and the reality of death, keeps punching you in the gut. I can't reiterate enough how well this story (for better or worse) will resonate with you. I hope you will take the time and watch this documentary, it's well worth the time invested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional Roller Coaster...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What begins as a quest to learn more about filmmaker Kurt Kuennes murdered friend, Andrew Bagby, ends up becoming a tribute to Andrew's parents David and Kate. This is a poignant and gut-wrenching story of love, loss, betrayal, and the will to endure. Im finding it difficult to accurately describe the emotional roller coaster this film takes you through; and while its a sad and difficult journey for David and Kate Bagby there is a profound sense of endurance and perseverance that is nothing short of inspirational. Its difficult not to laugh, cry, and get angry right along with the Bagbys throughout this film and by the end you almost feel as if you know the people involved. This is a heart-wrenching and emotional film that is definitely not for the lighthearted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say that reading the reviews before the movie will not allow for the full effect that the film is capable of generating. I began watching the movie thinking that I would be sincerely sad about the whole situation. However, when the credits started rolling, I was incensed about the whole situation. I could not comprehend how there were people in this world that could do such terrible things...and ultimately get away with it. I'm a pretty understanding person, so not understanding the rationalization behind Shirley's thought process left me completely flabbergasted! The way Kurt puts together the film really allows the viewer to become emotionally involved with all the people and the situation. Especially at the end, when the viewer's emotions become synchronized with the rhythm of the film. I finished watching the movie with tears streaming down my face in both anger and sadness. The movie impacted me so much that I then wanted to know even more, so I did some online research for the rest of the day. Dear Zachary is such a powerful film that everyone should watch and prepare to be enraged!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dearest Zachary; You Deserved So Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been few films in my life that have ever done to me what Dear Zachary did to my emotional well being. The documentary, made by Kurt Kuenne, was the most amazing and beautiful documentary I have ever seen. I might even go as far as to call it one of the best, most touching films I have ever seen. It moves you in ways that you never could have imagined, and you are left at the end, wondering if it was all just a joke. You feel like you knew Andrew Bagby, and you feel like you were a part of the journey that Kurt Kuenne takes to find the truth about what really happened. I was so moved by this movie, that I don't know if I will ever be the same again. A film like this opens your eyes, and it makes you ponder why people act the way they do. I felt so much hate for Shirley Turner that I felt a cold, nauseating sickness in my stomach every time she came on the screen. Overall, I believe this movie should be in contention for best film of the year. I would be very surprised to see it lost Best Documentary at the Oscars, and I would be extremely surprised if the name Kurt Kuenne was not a name you heard about for years to come. Even though the movie follows so closely to his life, you can just tell by the way that he made this film that he is a very talented film maker. I have become inspired by his work, and I look forward to seeing more movies with him in the future. In closing, Dear Zachary is a movie that will probably never leave you. After watching it, something inside you will hurt so badly, and you will feel so moved by how brave and strong David and Kathleen Bagby are, that you will never be the same. I am excited to see what happens to this film come Oscar time.</fullReview>

I had only read the cover and thought that it would be pretty sad but I had never expected this huge shocking event that happened near the end. It was shocking to me because I didn't know very much to begin with. I needed about ten billion boxes of tissues just to get through it. I don't think that I have ever cried so hard through a movie before.I could never ever in a trillion years imagine the pain and suffering that the parents of Andrew had to go through. That has to be the worst thing that could ever possibly happen to a person. I would highly recommend seeing this with a mass amount of tissues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewing this documentary is definitely better if you don't know beforehand the whole story that this doc unfurls. However, even if you know this story already, then this doc is still definitely worth viewing anyway, because of the mind blowing and heart wrenching way that the filmmaker tells the story.Much of the mental and emotional effect that this doc has is due to the fact that much of it is filmed in "real time". That is, the story that is related here was filmed mainly WHILE it was happening, and not in retrospect, as do most docs. So, through most of the film, the narrator / filmmaker himself is ignorant about events that will transpire later in the film.If you don't just LOVE this film, whether you're a doc addict like me or not, then you must have computer chips where your brain and heart should be.I can' think of another film, doc or theatrical, that had as much of an effect on me personally as did this film. You are really missing out on a rare opportunity if you miss this film.20 Stars!!! 20 Stars!!! 20 Stars!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was, at first, unable to engage with this story. At times, I actually hated some of the mechanical aspects of this filmmaking. There was the fast cutting blur/barrage affect, reminiscent of NPR's Radiolab episodes, which threaten to make your head spin. We knew, from the start, that the main character had been murdered, and the likely suspect. The characters seemed almost obnoxiously....normal. I watched the first ten minutes or so, and fell asleep, unable to become involved in the lives of this "everyman" and his family, in a story I'd thought I'd already heard the sad conclusion to. I tried again, and what I experienced was something akin to an existential fist to my stomach. This film is one of the greatest explorations of film, into the depths to which humans can sink, as well as how the safeguards of society, meant to protect us can fail so tragically-- and yet, how two people who have suffered more than I could imagine are able emerge from the wreckage not only with their spirits intact, but with a fighting mission to change (at least a small part of) the world. The way in which the events unfold is beyond heartbreaking; perhaps because I'd seen a similar custody battle occur in my own family (without the murder; but similar in the sense that a mother that is demonstrably, beyond a doubt, unfit for parenting can sometimes be protected by a well-meaning but skewed system), that increased the impact and brought out my empathy, coupled with my disbelief and thankfulness that nothing like this has happened in my sphere of existence. Regardless, this film will crush you and then breathe life back into you, if you aren't desensitized to human tragedy, that is.</fullReview>

But no at the end it showed that Kurt Kuenne edited the entire thing himself. This film will change the way documentary's are told forever. It will not bore you for one single second.

This is as emotionally powerful a film as I've ever seen. Make no mistake, this is a one-sided story, not some emotionally neutral take on the events, but it's all the more effective because of it. Not only is it presented in such a way that you feel as though you've gotten to know the people involved, but also the story unfolds in a manner that packs a huge punch. I'm not a cryer during movies. Ever. But there was no containing myself on this one. A truly harrowing drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly the Bagby family aren't the only ones to surfer at the hands of dubious and corrupt official's. Nor are they the first to have loved one's murdered by someone who should have been locked up long before they committed their crimes. However what this film does, is remind us why we were put on this planet. Hopefully the next time we see others in the world suffering due to the greed, ego and self interest of others, this film can help relate to how circumstances can be so out of our control. This film was meant to be a memento for a Young child who would never know his father. Sadly, it has become a brilliant and successful rallying point to kick start change in the inept Canadian legal system. As moving a tribute, to the positive elements of human nature as you will find in the history of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Dear Zachary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started off as a love letter sort of project for a late friend's son, became something quite horrifically unimaginable as Kurt Kuenne's documentary wore on. It's filled with enough twists and turns, and moments where you would deem manipulative thanks to the power of editing and sledge-hammering some obvious emotional points through, but told in such a compelling, engaging fashion that you can't help but be caught up in both the video memorial, as well as the documentary aspects of some heinous crimes committed.The project started off as a huge collection of video recordings from family, relatives and friends of Andrew Bagby, who at age 28 was found murdered with 5 gunshot wounds to his body. Kuenne had decided to embark on a cross-country project to document the memories of Andrew's closed ones to allow them to share with his unborn son, their respective tributes and nuggets of information of a man who had his life unfairly cut short. And through this collection of videos, with of course its snippets of Andrew himself making it to the film, allows for the audience to identify and get chummy even with jovial man who's so full of life. Until a mistake was made.Which involved a relationship with a much older woman, and would spell trouble with a capital T, being the villain which you'd love to hate thanks to the unflattering portrayal put together by Kuenne. Accounts from friends too turn out to be filled with plenty of negative vibes, and she's prime suspect #1 (almost without qualms actually) to be guilty of the homicide. To make matters worse, she's pregnant with Andrew's kid. For the second half of the film, it became sort of a murder-mystery, and follows the uphill battle of Andrew's parents Kate and David Bagby in their custody battle, for which you'll feel an abundance for in the crazy ordeal they were put through deliberately designed to test their mental strength and willpower.It's a remarkable effort in trying to preserve the memory of someone, fused together with the last days and aftermath of a person's life, and documenting some 3 generations of the unfortunate Bagbys, as well as filling in the inadequacies of the justice system regarding bail. Not to mention too the ridiculousness of the folks sitting high up in their ivory towers and having lost touch with the ground, of the indifferent attitudes such people bear in making what seemed to be irrational decisions and judgements, that probably wouldn't fly over here.You'll feel some pangs of sorrow for what the film had pieced together, and empathize with both Kate and David for having bear witness to crimes that could have been prevented should proactive, common-sensical action be taken. From what turned out to be trying to capture in essence the multi-facet life we all lead depending on who we're with, and the discovery of new things about a friend passed on, this film took on greater proportions and became a more powerful force in social activism. Not to be missed if you have the opportunity to watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional powerhouse with masterful craftsmanship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Zachary is the story of several people: of Andrew Bagby, one of the kindest people you could know, murdered in cold blood; of Shirley Turner, Andrew's ex-girlfriend and accused murderer, with a share of documented mental issues to boot; of Zachary, the child of Andrew and Shirley that never saw his father alive; and of Kate and David, the parents of Andrew, forced to suffer the loss of their only child and the faults of the legal system afterward.If you haven't seen the movie, stop here and go watch it, it is an absolute must-see for both the grim story and the expert direction that knows just how to play with your emotions. I won't be spoiling anything, but reading anything more than the above prior to watching the movie is unnecessary and should be avoided.With that out of the way, Dear Zachary is an intense, emotional documentary, serving as a scrapbook for the titular Zachary Turner about his murdered father Andrew Bagby. But what opens as a portrait of apparently the nicest man to ever live pans out into the aftermath of his murder and the legal entanglements of persecuting Shirley Turner, Andrew's ex-girlfriend and accused killer. There isn't much room for argument either, especially in filmmaker Kurt Kuenne's eyes; the evidence and documentary is overwhelmingly stacked against her as the prime suspect, but as the movie will note, "the law is slow."This movie is very black and white, no gray area, with Shirley Turner being our villain of the picture. I'm not implying innocence- it's pretty obvious she did it, and her mental health issues are apparent both through actions and history. But instead of focusing on her guilt, the movie casts the real guilt on a legal system that fails to provide justice. It's all the true crime of a story you'd see on Investigative Discovery, but with plenty more pathos, a better production value, and a bigger purpose in mind.It's clear just how much heart and effort Kurt Kuenne put into this movie, how close it is to him and the pain he felt just trying to bring it to life. This work shows through his tightly wound editing and pathos-fueled direction, bound to pull out some feelings of grief and anger from the stoniest of hearts. But I wouldn't call this humanity at it's worst, and the movie tries it's hardest to be both black and white, not too much one or the other.Dear Zachary is a portrait of humanity at both it's cruelest and it's kindest. It's not stimulating a discussion on morality, instead set on archiving the failure of a legal system to detain and protect others from a clear and present danger. But without fail, Dear Zachary maintains the focus on the effect of loss, as well as the influence and effect we have on others. It's an emotionally charged film that will show you the worst, but leave you remembering and appreciating the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best docs ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Documentary ranks in the top 3 documentaries of all time next to 'Thin Blue Line' and 'Man on Wire'. Some people may dispute my top 3 list, however I will argue why I think that Dear Zachary is better than the other two. Thin Blue Line was notable for exonerating a man from a wrongful conviction. Man on Wire is a real life heist movie with an incredible story about the World Trade Towers in New York.Dear Zachary encompasses two themes that mirror the aforementioned and combine into a greater narrative: the story of an evil murderous woman who was never properly convicted and a story of several terrible crimes that went unpunished and lead to the exposure of major dysfunction in the Canadian justice/legal system. This documentary is not for the weak of heart but for those interested in the film aspects, it is evident that the filmmaker has made a painstaking effort to assemble footage in a way that hurt his very soul to share with you. A more honest documentary has never been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Zachary attempts to reach the son of Andrew Bagby, a man who was murdered by his lover, Shirley, the woman who was pregnant with his son. The footage portraying Andrew Bagby proves to show how he was a man with a big heart and touched many of his friends' lives. Andrew probably had more friends in his adulthood than the average prom king would have had during his high school years.The events in this film are true as it is a documentary. The various interviews touch on Bagby's life, his death, what the interviewees want to say to his son and how the legal system needs to be reformed. Thus, as many documentaries do, this one touches on a wide variety of topics and themes while it tries to remain focused on one story as a whole. The problem is that a real story has many parts, many angles, many side stories that it needs to be represented differently than a fictional film. It is difficult to structure facts and interviews into a cohesive story with a three act structure. Details are thrown at you to digest, and some documentaries are less clear in their point than others. The documentary focusing on the Bagby's, however, keeps the viewer intrigued and leaves them heartbroken at points with tragic events (other than the death of Andrew).There is a clear "first act" with this film as it begins by detailing Andrew's death and how he touched others, but the second and third "acts" seem to blend together. It is unclear what the climax of this documentary was supposed to be as there are at least 2 or 3 moments of high interest which seem to bring different points across, but they are important points not matter how different they are. This documentary explores the true nature of love versus evil in interesting ways and should be viewed by people who are looking for a good cause to fight for.3.0/4.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My emotions are still running high after watching this movie!!!! My heart and prayers go out to the Bugby's. Why is it only through tragedy do people realize what right is. Cases like these are the reason I'm going to law school, the system is so corrupt and that's the justice system anywhere. This movie was very well made it captures every human emotion and brings it out of you. Kurt you have done what slot of big budget Hollywood film makers can't do and that's make the viewers feel and remember and take the film with them in their daily lives. A lot of people need to be held accountable for little Zachary's death. Before you are given a job in the justice or dealing with children or before you have children it should mandatory that you watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a powerful Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Bagby and Kathleen Bagby lost both they son and they own grandchild and I can feel they pain and it's amazing how much they hold strong during tough and difficult times. God bless you Kathleen and David, stay strong.Dear Zachary is about a filmmaker decides to memorialize a murdered friend when his friend's ex-girlfriend announces she is expecting his son.I've seen many Documentary's in the past that can make me tear up or get me shocked, well not like this one that actually got to me deep inside. To those who think I'm spoiling the whole Documentary well all this did happen and thanks to the world wide web if you even search this up it would already be spoiled for you, even at the start of this review I already spoiled it.Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father is a heartbreaking and a truly outstandingly documentary that I got to warn you it's not a easy watch sometimes, because this has to be the most depressing Documentary I ever come across. These never like a full happy moment, just a tragic one to get your head around. Now will recommend this and the answer is yes and no as well, just like I said early it's not a easy watch and some people like the happy go lucky stories with a happy ending, but to those who can handle this kind of story then go ahead because it's worth a watch. It's a powerful Documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. This film will make you sad, if you aren't sad after watching this then what is wrong with you. I think this is a good example of how when it comes to murder, it can't be assumed it will all be fine. I never heard of this case before, I thought Zachary was still alive, but as soon as I learned he was killed I was holding back tears. This shows how awful some human beings can be. I would recommend this movie to everyone, you will not believe the evil in this world. The movie also shows if you are in a relationship and your friends have a funny feeling about this person, listen to them. I watched this on Netflix so if you want to hear an interesting story, or want to cry, this is for you. I gave this a 10/10, it is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only had the pleasure of watching or reading three other stories in my 41 years that have affected me to the depths that "Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son about His Father" has. It's one of the very few life changers we encounter. I was sitting here in the middle of the night, broken knee and all, literally on the edge of my seat absorbing what passed before my ears and eyes. If you have Netflix, you can view this free and instantly. If you don't, it's worth the time it takes to register for a free trial just to watch this film.Kurt, you did your friends justice. Dear Kurt, I have not the words to describe how profoundly your documentary has affected me. I have only recommended one other doc/book/movie before to friends and family. I just did so for yours via Facebook and personal emails to select people. Given the posting character limitations the above is what I just posted on my FB.And Kurt, you did do your dear friends justice. Thank you for continuing this journey and helping to improve this world with your documentary. Please thank Andrew's parents for me, a viewer of your documentary, as well. Please allot a portion of the revenue from this film to making copies of it and sending it to those people along the way who wronged Zachary and their neighborhoods and colleagues.Thank you for the sacrifices you personally made to make this documentary.Sincerely,Kim Taylor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic story that should be seen by everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001, Andrew Bagby, a medical resident, is murdered not long after breaking up with his girlfriend. Soon after, when she announces she's pregnant, one of Andrew's many close friends, Kurt Kuenne, begins this film, a gift to the child. Friends, relatives, and colleagues say warm and loving things about Andrew, home movies confirm his exuberance. Andrew's parents, Kathleen and David, move to Labrador where the ex-girlfriend has gone. They await an arrest and trial of the murderer. They negotiate with the ex-girlfriend to visit their grandchild, Zachary, and they seek custody. Is there any justice; is Zachery a sweet and innocent consolation for the loss of their son...? Dear Zachary has to be one of the most moving and powerful stories I have ever seen. The first half of the documentary focuses on Andrew Bagby and trough interviews with his friends and family, we get to know who this guy was and what kind of person. The second half focuses on the events that happened after he was killed, how the person who murdered him ( a girlfriend) was able to avoid jail and remain free. It's also revealed that this girlfriend is pregnant with Andrew's child and from that point on the the documentary shows the battle of Andrew's parents Kate and David Bagby in their attempt to gain custody of their grandson. I don't want to give anything away but, the story doesn't exactly end there and there's a lot more tragedy. The events this documentary shows; to say that they're tragic is putting it lightly. And Andrew's parents are two beautiful people that seem to be some of the best human beings I have seen. I sincerely hope, they succeed in changing a few laws (which is what they're trying to achieve) that made possible for this tragedies to happen, not only because it's important for the world but also so that they can have some kind of closure. The documentary in itself, is a bit amateurish, more similar to a home video then to a documentary per se, but the story being told is so powerful and meaningful that you can't help but overlook the flaws. Dear Zachary is a must-see. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting subject matter, but terrible filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the storyline was fascinating, the slick MTV-style editing and constant cuts were difficult to watch. This started out as a tribute to Kurt Kuenne's fallen friend slain by a crazy lover, but ended as a jumbled mess. The look into Canada's justice system was disturbing and riveting, and the parents of the victim were amazing people that you simply had to root for. The story was excellent, and the filmmaker had much of the young man's life already on film. It was the execution of it that I had a problem with. There are stretches throughout the film where no clip is even a second long. One person's sentence is spliced into another's and so on, at such a pace that it's almost nauseating. Kurt himself also spoke with the speed of an auctioneer, which I found very distracting. It's a shame, because this documentary had the potential to be great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the Canadian legal system THAT screwed up or do they simply hate America?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: There are LOTS of spoilers here. I am including them because I think many would like to know about them before deciding whether or not to watch the film--especially those who have themselves have had friends or family murdered.This is perhaps the hardest documentary you could watch--or at least among the hardest. So, if you don't want to cry or feel depressed, please do NOT watch "Dear Zachary". Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--it's tremendous--it's just very, very hard to watch in spots--mostly because the film is true.This documentary was made by a friend of Andrew Bagby (Kurt Kuenne). The purpose of the film was to chronicle the life and death of Andrew in order to let his young son, Zachary, know about the man his father was. That's because Andrew was murdered...murdered by Zachary's unstable and truly evil mother! Andrew was apparently very well-liked as dozens of friends, family and co-workers were interviewed for the film. You learn about his childhood, his time in medical school and his life as a budding young doctor in this film. However, it all came to a head during his residency when he had a brief relationship with another doctor--a lady who turned out to be very dangerous. When he broke up with her, she began stalking and harassing him--and ultimately murdered him and fled to Canada--and the evidence was very clear that she'd done it. There really is no doubt, though like most murderers she claimed to be innocent. Once in Canada, the woman was soon arrested--and was soon awaiting an extradition hearing. In the meantime, Shirley announced that she was pregnant and the baby was Andrew's! Now here is where it gets weird. Now you'd THINK that she'd soon be returned to the US to face trial. However, again and again and again, extradition hearings and pre-trial hearings occurred in the Canadian courts. And, during this period, much of the time Shirley was allowed to be out--without bond!! How long did all this take? Well, after about two years she was STILL out...and retained custody of her young son. Now you'd think having killed the boy's father she'd both be kept in prison AND not have custody....yet the courts seemed completely indifferent. And, in addition, the Canadian child welfare services did nothing...absolutely nothing.During this lengthy period, Andrew's parents moved to Canada to be near Zachary. During some of the short periods during which Shirley was begin held in jail, they cared for the boy. Once she was released, they were forced to be nice to her in order to even see the child. When it eventually appeared that she would be extradited, Shirley killed herself and Zachary...a final way to curse Andrew's friends and family.Now the story does not end here. The next twenty minutes or so consisted of discussing the aftermath of this very preventable tragedy. The many OTHER ways that the Canadian system failed were then discussed. Apparently Shirley had a history of stalking, violent behavior and suicidal ideation. Doctor's reports that warned of the final tragedy were completely ignored. Andrew's family went through hell but also decided to make the best of this--becoming advocates for change--as such awful and totally preventable tragedies can be prevented--at least the final chapter in this sick story.This film earns a 10--not just because the subject matter is so stirring but because of the very creative way in which the film was constructed. The same friend of Andrew's who directed the film also wrote it as well as the music. Additionally, it was obviously a labor of love and must have taken an enormous amount of time to make--and at some great expense. Finally, it's an amazing film because it angers AND advocates for specific changes--something very positive despite the horrible tragedies.Finally, a few words about my summary. I assume that the reason that the system in Canada worked so horribly was because it's become a huge, lumbering and uncaring bureaucracy--something that clearly needs to be changed. However, I sure COULD see a viewer wondering about any sort of covert animus concerning either the US or extraditions to foreign nations. While it may not be true and I am not a xenophobe, you do wonder what was motivating the judges, the prosecutor and the welfare system. How could they be so disconnected, indifferent and incompetent unless it was, at least in some cases, deliberate? The film NEVER tries to make such a statement but clearly the viewer in many cases will be left wondering what motivated these many people. This legal system sure will make me think twice before I go back to Canada--a country generally seen as safe and very civilized. I'd sure love to hear from others. Is this an isolated case? Are other extraditions handled this poorly? What was the tone in the Canadian press and among Canadians about this particular mishandled case?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The saddest film I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, I don't know if this film touched me so much because I've recently had a major loss in my family. But this film touched me deeply. I've never struggled so hard to hold back tears as I did watching Dear Zachary. I don't know if this is the finest documentary I've ever seen, but it's certainly the most moving. The pain is so raw and so new. The loss these family and friends encounter along the way is nothing short of devastating.I'm not sure if I can recommend Dear Zachary, unless you really want to be sad. I'm not sure if I'm happy I've seen it. I didn't need someone else's loss in my life, but now I mourn for these lovely people I just met on TV. What a waste of such joy and life. It brings back all too familiar feelings.I leave it at this... If you have never experienced true loss, then Dear Zachary is open window into a devastating world of pain that you can only hope you'll never have to deal with. But if loss is something you are familiar with then maybe you don't need this refresher course on the subject.Thank you for this real and sincere work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many people have already expressed I think that this is one of the very best documentary films that I've seen in at least ten years. Easy.Kurt Kuenne has produced such a hugely compelling narrative that it often makes you feel like you just got slapped in the face by some big meaty hand. It's as crushing as a ton of bricks.There are scarcely moments when you're not entirely inside of this equally beautiful and equally tragic story. It's a very rare and quite perfect example of just how love and bravery can still exist in the face of such unspeakable awfulness. (And sometimes in spite of it.)Thanks, Kurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, suicide, rage and grief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: if you want to be surprised by the events depicted in this film as you watch it, do not read further. This documentary tells an incredibly sad, disturbing, enraging story. It's first of all the story of Andrew Bagby, a promising 28-year-old doctor from Sunnyvale, California, murdered in a parking lot on November 5, 2001 in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where he had gone into family practice. Films of Andrew and testimony of friends and relatives show he was a person of enormous charm and warmth. The obvious suspect was Shirley Turner, an unstable ex-girlfriend, whom he originally met in medical school in St. John's, Newfoundland and had just decisively broken up with. There was plenty of evidence. Turer fled back to Canada and fought extradition, shortly afterward declaring that she was pregnant with Andrew's child. She tried to lie about her presence in Latrobe but her cell phone calls gave a record of her trips back and forth at the time of the murder. The records show that she had left Bagby, and then returned 1,300 miles from Iowa, where she was then in family practice, and shot him five times in the face and body with a 22-caliber pistol in which she used the same bullets that killed Andrew. She lied and changed her story repeatedly, and claimed to have lost the weapon.Filmmaker Kurt Kuene was a close friend since childhood of Andrew's (evidently one of many) who made films in his teens that Andrew acted in. After Shirley gave birth to the son, whom she named Zachary, Kuene set out to make a documentary about Andrew as a future record, a kind of letter to Zachary telling him what his father had been like, how promising he was and how much he had been loved. But this letter was never to be received. Released from prison with custody of the child despite her being on suicide watch, Shirley drowned herself and Zachary in September 2003, a few months before her likely extradition for trial in the US, where she knew she could face life imprisonment.Last year Andrew's father David Bagby published 'Dance with the Devil: A Memoir of Murder and Loss.' He and his wife Kate, Andrew's mother, are the primary talking heads of this film. They chronicle their struggles after Andrew was killed. They went to Pennsylvania in terrible grief--he was their only child--simply to reclaim the body. But he meant so much to them, they wound up quitting their jobs and relocating to Newfoundland to pursue the case and to seek custody of Zachary. Shirley Turner was imprisoned, but released twice, extradition was constantly delayed, and though Zachary's parents gained visiting privileges, which they pursued in spite of great hardship, the case ended in tragedy before they could gain custody of the boy.Kuene tells two stories, about Andrew and about Zachary. Andrew, a short, stocky man with an open face resembling Jack Black's, was a warm, ebullient person loved by all who knew him, in California, in Newfoundland where he attended medical school, in Pennsylvania, and in England where through annual visits he became close to relatives of his mother, who is English. There is a lot of weeping in this picture. Five or six men say they had meant to make Andrew best man at their wedding. People who only saw him occasionally each year bonded with him as brothers.The liaison with Shirley Turner was a tragic mistake on Andrew Bagby's part. An earlier engagement with another, more suitable woman had broken off, and, reeling from that, alone in Canada, and later while going through a difficult residency, he took refuge in the company of this woman who was 13 years older and had children by two other marriages whom she rarely saw, and whose behavior toward him and his friends was possessive, cloying, and inappropriate, according to many accounts.Delays in the Canadian judicial system and flaws in the family court system and the malpractice of a psychiatrist who put up bail for Turner led to what the film presents convincingly as a terrible miscarriage of justice. How could a person suspected of premeditated murder be let out on bail? When evidence was so strong against Turner, how could the appeal for extradition be dismissed and postponed on technicalities? Turner wrote a letter to a St. John's judge, Gale Welsh, and gained release from prison while awaiting further decisions. Welsh's decision argued that Turner's alleged crime was "not directed at the public at large but was specific in nature" and she was therefore not a threat to society. An investigation commissioned by the Province of Newfoundland led to the 2006 publication of a 1,100-page book-length report on the case against Shirley Turner entitled 'Turner Review and Investigation,' which details the Pennsylvania evidence.Kate and David decided after Andrew's death to go to Canada to fight to have Turner brought to justice. Ultimately after her murder of her son and suicide, they became crusaders for reform of the bail and family court systems. David's book is a journal of the whole experience.Kuene's film doesn't give you a chance to meditate. He throws images at you with lightening speed, and sometimes scenes are chopped too fine and lines like those words of Gale Welsh, are repeated too naggingly. The mouths of this judge and another person are animated in a way that's unnecessarily caricatured and seems mean-spirited. Evidently David Bagby has not found closure and lives with rage and grief on a daily basis. Still, some of his more extreme moments of cursing and rage might better have been left out. None of this is necessary. Especially when the case is this clear, understatement is the most effective approach. Nonetheless his energy and dedication, rivaling Andrew's parents', have enabled Kuene to produce a film that's as thorough as it is emotionally powerful. thorough and emotionally powerful.</fullReview>

For those who remark on it's "amateur" quality, need I remind you, it was not made by Steven Spielberg. It is a simple movie made by a man as a tribute to his best friend, his son, his family, and friends. No CGI animations, no special effects or editing. The result is a beautiful and heart-wrenching movie. The ending totally,.... totally caught me off guard but I applaud the parents who persevered and fought to get the laws changed.I highly recommend this movie... As a warning...you will be angered at the lack of action on the part of all members of law enforcement. This movie clearly illustrates how the law does not protect the families but gives the criminals enough leeway to hurt again...truly a sad statement of affairs in our world..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a certain aura to this film that will undoubtedly make you feel right at home, this story, is about so much more than the murder case of a man. About so much more than just home videos and slightly poor camera skills. There's something far more personal, perhaps the filming contributes to that. But it's about the silent, unbearable miscalculations of those by the time responsible, about the lives that the charismatic Andrew Bagby touched and thereby through his death drew an immense amount of tears from and far more. You will get wrapped up in the beautiful and just as you've cozied up to the fact that you think you know what'll happen next the twisting tragedy will punctuate your ego and the tears will, with extremely high probability, come running down your cheeks. The story of this just one man and the lives he left behind will, if you let it, not only make you cry but also make you smile.I think I went through every emotion, humanly capable through the course of this movie. And never have i ever been so struck by any roll as I was affected by ''Dear Zachary: a letter to his son about his father''.So go see it,this film deserves far more publicity then it's gotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever believed that you are a very very insignificant person to bring a big change to the system- you are correct. But if you wish to know what difference you can make if you try to do that- then you must watch this documentary based on real life. The filmmaker Kurt Kuenne made the film on the life of his friend Andrew's parents. When 28-year-old Andrew Bagby (Doctor by profession, year 2001) started dating 40-year-old Shirley Jane Turner, Andrew's friends and family was unhappy of this strange woman. He was loved for his goodwill and humor, Andrew agreed with his well wishers to break up with Turner one night before heading over to a friend's house. The next day his dead body was discovered. He was shot with bullets, Turner absconded to Canada to avoid prosecution. Bewildered Kuenne packed up a camera (almost without any experience on movies) and took off on a tour of Andrew's dearest friends and family, traveling continents to reach out to loved ones who wanted to share their feelings on Andrew Bagby. It was evident that Turner was having psychological problems. Andrew Bagby's parents wanted justice. What they found was a poor justice system in Canada . Surprisingly it was sympathetic to Turner . It not only granted bail for Andrew's baby, as Turner was pregnant. Bagbys found a whole new reason to love a woman they hated for little Zachary. After his birth little Bagby was very similar in his behavior &amp; looks as compared to his father. He always preferred his grandfather &amp; grandmother over his mother, which always disturbed Turner. One day she killed the baby &amp; committed suicide. From then Andrew Bagby's parents started thinking from past apart from blaming their fate &amp; they found the legal system to be guilty of this sad catastrophe. They moved to the court &amp; they proved to be correct. The court of Canada took action &amp; punished juries, judges &amp; consultant psychologists for their lenient attitude towards the case. They will never get their son &amp; grandson back but they ensured no one gets through once again in similar situation with legal system in his stride. The movie is an outstanding presentation of lamentation,grief &amp; determination after one's . Portrayed poetically by to say goodbye to Andrew. The story of Andrew Bagby is tragic beyond words, it will keep you glued till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgustingly sad and depressing. An educational look at injustice at it's utmost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I could never recommend that anyone see Dear Zachery. It is NOT entertainment by any means. This is a rare film that gives a treacherous, gut wrenching look at a travesty and an injustice that will leave people furious when you are finished watching this. I can't talk about cast in this example because it is true through and through. Real interviews, a real story, real friends and family and real footage that, even as I write this, gives me chills. A young, idealistic doctor who was apparently adored by friends, and family alike gets involved with an older doctor, breaks it off, is subsequently stalked and eventually brutally murdered allegedly by the female doctor. She escapes to Canada where she allegedly has his baby and his parents, and friends fight to have her arrested, arraigned, extradited, anything. She is let to run free until she murders the child and herself once again ripping the hearts out of his family.Despite the fact that creator of the film Kurt Kuenne is a legitimately aspiring film maker so some could consider this trying to cash in or make a name for himself but when you're watching this film, and hear his voice narrating I feel his honesty and his intense vision for finding some sort of justice for him, his murdered best friend, and the parents of his friend. I firmly believe he did make this film with the intention of it being a love letter to his late friend's son before he too was brutally murdered by his cowardly mother. If this film is what it takes to open anyone's eyes to the complete and utter cowardly injustice of Canada's (my own country) justice system and Government. Also to show the true travesty of this crime. This might be one of the hardest reviews I have ever written because this is not a movie, this is not entertainment, this is education at it's finest. This is not a documentary like Michael Moore who manages to make serious situations entertaining, this film is revolting in every way and so important. Please see this if only to know that an absolute injustice was done and to be aware of this going on. It's a haunting, beautiful, disturbing twisted story. Absolutely heart wrenching. You will cry. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is absolutely the best documentary i have ever seen. this film had me crying and shaking by the end.the editing of this movie is not accidentally slapdash and MTV-esquire. I found it to be quite cerebral; reflective of the subject matter and emotional content attached. The pastiche of vocal and visual moments are presented in this fashion to move the viewer along without bogging them down with consecutive repetition. However, the film-maker does use repetition of facts to great affect later in the film. yes, at times, the film-maker did insert himself too often into the story. but, this film-maker is not a novice, making mistakes. perhaps those most vocal in their critique would rather see a michael bay film?one may see this film's subject matter as a reason to criticize the legal and judicial system of those provinces and individuals involved. i feel one should be ready to hang the medical and insurance industries on the line as well. for far too long the mental health of too many individuals has led to theirs, or another's death. behind every preventable disease is a mental disease. behind every sad, angry, or neurotic reaction is mental disease. when will people stop seeing mental illness as something akin to "crazy" - mental illness is no different in it's content than cancer. we should have a green ribbon walk in every city in America to meet the walk for a cure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is by far the most powerful and moving story I have ever had the honor of watching. Every aspect of this film is moving to the point of tears, something very few movies genuinely do. The stories of Andrew and Zachary create an overarching nonfiction drama that has turned out to be the moving force behind a massive paradigm shift in Canadian legislation towards murders, extradition and child custody.The documentary follows the surviving parents of Andrew Bagby, who after learning that the woman who murdered their son fled to Canada, who then turned out to be carrying their unborn grandson. David and Kathleen (Andrew's Parents and Zachary's Grandparents) are forced to meet with Shirley (Zachary's mother) just to have an effect on their grandson's life.Kurt Kuenne manages to make the most powerful, personal, and a near perfect documentary by searching for information of his fallen friend to pass on to his son, so that Zachary may get to know who his father for who he was, which was an amazing person.Although, once the news that Shirley had commit suicide, and murdered Zachary, the film took an unexpected turn. It was no longer a film of the father to be passed on to the son, it became a film to be passed on to the parents from the son and the grandson.I strongly recommend this documentary to everyone. This documentary touches the soul in every way imaginable. The entire spectrum of emotions flows throughout your body over the whole 95 minutes. Kurt Kuenne proves to make one of the most powerful documentaries that has ever been produced.9.9 and change out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decidedly tragic, but tone deaf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story at the center of this documentary is devastating. The Bagby family undergoes a horrific tragedy that was certainly hell to live through and to continue to live with. So while my deepest sympathies extend to the long-suffering Bagbys, I find the film based on their story to be seriously deficient and tone deaf. Part of the problem lies in director Kuenne's closeness to his subject. A personal friend of the Bagby family, he doesn't approach the story as a journalist, but as a man with an ax to grind. And while we understand the source of his anger by film's end, it overshadows his objectivity. He is frequently snide and dismissive. The tragedy at the film's center is done a disservice by Kuenne's frequent caricatures.Stepping on screen in your own documentary is problematic as it quickly discounts your objectivity. It telegraphs to the audience that you may be too close to your subjects to treat their story fairly. Unless the film is about you--and "Dear Zachary" is not as much about Kuenne as he seems to think it is--it's also distracting. The film presents a very narrow picture of its subject Andrew Bagby--a man who did no wrong and was loved by everyone--that it is hard to not suspect Kuenne of hagiography. The director's greatest success is in letting the parents of Andrew vent, get angry, and weep on camera. These are the film's most unvarnished and believable moments.The film's central conceit, as well, is dreadfully misguided. The film is ostensibly a video keepsake for Andrew's son showing the boy how much his father is loved and cherished by friends and family. So the film's divergence into repeatedly telling the boy what a she-devil his mom was comes off as unnecessarily cruel. This view of the mother begins to gain traction as the film progresses--and its inclusion slightly more justified--but it's glaringly out of place in the letter to the boy. The film morphs from letter to a son to angry director with an ax to grind making its central conceit seem unnecessary and manipulative.Decidedly tragic, but tone deaf. An unpleasant experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It's been sitting on my recommendations page for a while, and I didn't think I would want to watch a doc about a crime case I hadn't heard of, but it is very well put together.The only that really bothered me about this doc is that they portray Canada as having a crappy legal system. I understand the creator is angry about his friends death, but the Canadian trial had the same procedures as any American trial has. He says that when she was charged, she had to pay a $75,000 bond, surrender her passports, check in to the police station in person every week, sign tons of paperwork with all of her personal information, and sign a document promising not to move or flee or else she will be thrown in prison. The doc's creator was upset that she didn't go to prison immediately. You can't incarcerate a person who hasn't been convicted, and is assumed innocent, especially when they are pregnant. The USA gives people the option of making bail as well.But that's just me defending Canada. Give this doc a chance, you'll probably like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one thing I don't understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this documentary. Dr. Bagby's family and friends lost an immense personality and friend and my heart goes out to them. This is truly a tragic story of a promising life cut too short by a mentally ill woman. The one thing that is not addressed and I have wondered since the details of this crime were made public and that I kept asking myself during the entire showing. Why, if Dr. Bagby had been trying to break up with this psycho for months, was he still having an intimate relationship with her? She didn't get pregnant by herself and, I believe, he was aware of her unstable nature, yet they conceived their child very shortly before he told her it was over and put her on a plane. That's pretty cold and even a sane woman would be very VERY angry. I am not saying that Dr. Bagby deserved to die nor am I trying in any way to justify what Shirley Turner did. She was clearly a disturbed woman and had no ability to think of anyone but herself. But, this is the part of the story that continues to baffle me. She wasn't that attractive and had a history of stalking ex boyfriends. Are men so desperate that they will overlook possibly life threatening personality flaws for sex?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Docs can't get worse than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pathetic documentary by an incredibly unskilled director. This film is completely destroyed by MTV editing which turned what could have been a heartfelt piece into a 90 min montage. The director annoyingly overlaps dialog several times, never shows more than a few moments of any interview and, instead of relying on the dialog to set the tone and provide details, he simply cuts away repeatedly to the actual thing (or representation of) that the participant is speaking about. Important information is passed over quickly and small, pointless details are examined in excruciating detail (ie there was a delay in the trial becomes a 3 min sequence of calendar swipes). Rapid fire narration degrades it even further! It takes real effort to use compelling subject matter like this and make a bad film out of it! Avoid this at all costs. If there is a book on this case, read that instead.</fullReview>
