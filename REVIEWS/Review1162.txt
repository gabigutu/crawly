		<shortDescription>What A Kids Movie Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too many people spend too much time comparing Disney movies to each other, as if to say that every Disney movie made should unfold in such a way as to easily identify it as a "Disney Movie." That's a shame, as each movie should be judged on it's own contributions to the motion picture lexicon. Fortunately for Pete's Dragon, it contributes something that is essential and valuable to a child's world: fun.There's nothing too serious in Pete's Dragon. Granted, the catalyst for the action in the film is a boy running away from an abusive family, only to encounter an equally abusive society (not to mention a scheming charlatan who wants to capture - and kill - Pete's Dragon for his own monetary gain), but all involved in the production are aware that their target audience is children, and so all of the aforementioned is handled with kid gloves. The best example of this is the acting.The cast does their best to have fun with their character and, as such, contributes greatly to the light-hearted tone of the film. In particular, the villains are played with great, over-the-top gusto, which is exactly what is needed in a kids movie. You want to teach children a lesson, not scare the crap out of them. As such, Shelley Winters as Ma Gogan and Jim Dale as Doc Terminus are classic kiddie villains: Winters stomps through her scenes in a bluster of hilarious hillbilly kookiness, while Dale steals every scene he's in - and nearly the whole show - in a deliciously maniacal role that should have one him an oscar - seriously!Any actor can bring on the tears and boo-hoo their way through an "emotionally intense" role; they're a dime a dozen. It takes a real actor to come up with the kind of performance Dale did, in which every line of dialogue is nailed, and his voice and his body seem to be in completely in synch with each other and with the character. There is not one word left untouched by his genius. Especially fun are his interactions with his sidekick, Hoagy, played by Red Buttons. The two are perfect comic foils. They are no matches, however, for the straight-shooting Nora.Nora (Helen Reddy), along with her father Lampie (Mickey Rooney) tend to the local lighthouse. It is in these two characters that children find their protectors. In any kids movie, there needs to be at least one character on screen with which children can find comfort and solace. Reddy plays Nora as a down-to-earth, take no bull lady who becomes a mother figure to Pete. Rooney plays Lampie as a drunken old coot who rides the fence about Pete until about halfway through, at which time he, too, joins the side of good. There's a lesson in this movie for adults, too.Nora and Lampie both learn a little about life from Pete. Nora had decided to keep people at arm's length for fear of losing them (as she did her beau, a seaman who was lost at sea). Through her encounters with Pete, she learns to open up and allow love back into her life, this time in the form of motherly love. Lampie, too, becomes attached to the kid, and, throughout the process of his daughter and Pete bonding, learns that there's more to life than the bottle: there's family. These, really, are important lessons for adults, and ones that are never dated, rather, always applicable to any time and place. So is the lesson for children.At the heart of Pete's Dragon is a simple message for children: hold tight to all that is right, no matter how bad life gets, and good things will come. Pete escapes a horrid life slaving away for the wretched Gogan family, only to run into the arms of a civilized society that looks down on him because of he's an outsider. He's anything but welcomed, and when things start going wrong, he's the first one to be blamed. No matter how hard he tries, society won't believe him, or accept him. He could easily make the wrong choice: give in and become the ruffian they all think he is or, worse, do what society did to him, and turn his back on his friend, Elliot, who is partly to blame for Pete's predicament, as he pulls pranks while he's invisible, leaving Pete to take the rap. In the end, his perseverance pays off: the town embraces him and he gets a family. This lesson is learned, as is to be expected in a musical, with a song and a dance.The musical numbers are by far the weakest element in the movie. The songs are simple, yet they work (believe me, after you watch the movie, you'll find yourself spontaneously singing the choruses the next day). The dancing is the most difficult to digest, as it is often stiff and pointless. That's okay, though, as the story and the acting more than make up for it. When all is said and done, Pete's Dragon is everything a kids movie should be: educating and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live-action Disney flick with a splash of animation. Well-made, entertaining, but slightly overlong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can be fairly sure with the animated Disney films that you're going to get something good. But with the studio's live-action films there are no guarantees. On the one hand, you might get something like Mary Poppins or 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea - in which case you'd be plenty satisfied. On the other hand you could get something as terrible as Popeye, in which case you'd need a great deal of willpower to make it to the end. Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's live-action ventures (though it features one animated character in Elliot, the dragon of the title). Though a little overlong and rambling, it is on the whole a well-made and entertaining film, and it is certainly a gulf ahead of the likes of Condorman, Popeye and Herbie Goes Bananas.Scruffy young orphan Pete (Sean Marshall) is on the run in the woodland of Maine from the Gogan family, a bunch of abusive rednecks led by Lena Gogan (Shelly Winters), who claims that she owns Pete because she bought him at a market. Pete escapes from them, and sets off for Passamaquoddy, a nearby coastal town where he hopes to find safety. Accompanying Pete is an animated dragon named Elliot, who can make himself invisible and who has come to look after Pete until the kid has got his life sorted out. Once in Passamaquoddy, Pete and Elliot inadvertently cause havoc, including scaring the wits out of lighthouse-keeper Lampie (Mickey Rooney). They hide out in some nearby caves, but Pete is found by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), who decides to take him in. Elliot's job seems done (Pete is now safe and wanted, after all) but then con-man Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town.... and soon he's got his mind set on capturing the dragon.Like I said, the film is rambling, and from this synopsis it's clear that the plot wanders around a lot, introducing probably more events and characters than necessary. Nonetheless, Pete's Dragon is still entertaining. Jim Dale as the unscrupulous Dr Terminus, and Red Buttons as his dim side-kick, are genuinely funny villains. The blending together of animated Elliot and the living, breathing actors is very good - especially for 1977 - though in a shipwreck sequence near the end the special effects are utterly dreadful. Kids will find a lot to like in Pete's Dragon as long as they can sit still for over 2 hours, and adults too will find pleasures along the way. It's certainly one of the better live-action offerings to come from the Disney studio at a time when their output was quite indifferent in quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best underrated live-action Disney films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pete's Dragon" is an enchanting Disney tale that combines live-action and animation. The dragon is the only animated character, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a perfect combination of live-action and animation. This is definitely one of the best live-action movies produced by Disney. One of my favorites. It's cute and charming.It looks dated, but that's not a major flaw. Actually, that's part of its charm (which is timeless). There are plenty of beautiful vistas: a lighthouse, mountains, green places, the endless sea and more. Passamaquoddy is a strange name, but the village is nice.The dragon Elliott is cute and lovable. He almost resembles Puff the Magic Dragon and has a funny way to communicate. His sounds are awesome. Elliott is a good and innocent dragon, but big and clumsy. Pete is a cute and lovable kid. I enjoy his friendship with the animated dragon.There is a nice cast in the film. Sean Marshall is excellent as Pete - he is a very underrated former child actor. Helen Reddy is great as Nora. Mickey Rooney is funny as the silly but comical Lampie. Jim Dale is priceless as Doc Terminus. Red Buttons is very convincing as Doc Terminus's sidekick Hoagy. Shelley Winters plays well her role (the wicked Lena Gogan, the leader of the Gogans).This is an underrated film. Yet, it's a nice old-fashioned one. And nostalgic too because it's a reminder of other times and also of my own childhood.There are some cheesy moments, but nothing too serious or enough to ruin the movie. One of the few things I don't like about this movie is Pete's teacher. She is so mean, even more when she does that corporal punishment thing to Pete.Hoagy is one of my favorite characters. I don't consider him a villain. He's not a bad guy, he's just a poor devil who chose the wrong friend. He is hilarious even in his name. I don't know why, but 'Hoagy' sounds funny to my ears. Classic humor is another solid point of this movie. Many of Doc Terminus's lines are funny, as well as the fact that he never says "Passamaquoddy" correctly.About the songs, I like most of them very much. My personal favorites are "Brazzle Dazzle Day", "It's not easy", "Candle on the Water", "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I love you, too)", "There's Room for Everyone" and "Bill of Sale". These songs are great. Timeless classics.This motion picture is one among many examples of great underrated films. Many times I get more surprised with a less popular and less appreciated film than with one of those films that most everybody loves. It doesn't always happen, but most of the universally loved films end up being overrated and turn out to be disappointing because we create too much expectations on them, while a not so known and valued movie I may not expect that much from it but turns out to be a pleasant surprise. That only makes me respect and admire these less valued movies even more.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations.The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs.It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome.I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was a little kid and my older siblings before me. I can remember every detail and every character and every song! Brazzel dazzle day, There's room for everyone, candle on the water, its not easy... all songs that I remember word for word! I love this movie! Great for any age! My sisters and I always quote this movie. We go back and forth singing "We've got a bill of sale right here!" and every other song. This movie isn't just a kids movie. My sisters are in their 20's and I am 18 and we all watch it still! Granted the acting wasn't the best but come on it was made in 1977! And even for a 70's movie it was awesome and completely unforgettable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's combo live action and animation fare didn't just end over at "Mary Poppins." No, no; it lived on with "Pete's Dragon" from 1977!!!!! It's a nice little film about an orphan who finds a nice, magical dragon. From that point onward, it's a grand old big adventure!!!!! Very nice, indeed!What I like about this film: This is another one of Disney's real/hand-drawn films, and like "Mary Poppins," this movie is wonderful. Seeing this really brought a smile to my face, and that is wonderful also for anyone who watches this movie. This is great Disney fun; no bad stuff, and always 100% G-rated!!!!!"Pete's Dragon" is a great movie for people ages 3 to 103. Don't miss it!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid but forgotten Disney family fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete is a small boy running away from slavery with an abusive hillbilly family who have "bought" him. He falls in with an invisible dragon and a lighthouse keeper and his daughter, and assorted good and bad things happen.This Disney offering is one of the more forgotten live action movies despite the fact that it has quite a lot going for it. It is colourful, daft, has a good moral heart, some excellent villains, decent songs, and decent effects (both physical effects and traditional animation).The performances are all good, with Helen Reddy doing well in her only movie lead role, and young Sean Marshall's sincerity outweighing his winsome cuteness.This is still a good family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing and entertaining film that combines live adventure with animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endearing animated monster movie about a lively dragon and his little friend . The story takes place in Maine circa 1908 , the starring are an orphaned 9-years-old boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his sympathetic dragon Elliot . Freckly Pete flee the overbearing foster Gogan family (Shelley Winters , Charles Tyner), who all utilize him as a slave instead of a kind child. When Pete can successfully escape from them with his protective dragon , his only friend , that only can see , then they stumble into the town of Passamaquaddy- an ocean front dock town plenty of fishermen, drunks and rare people . Pete's arrival does not fit well with the townsfolk , as his pale green dragon Elliott accidentally causes town destruction and rioting among the school teacher , the Mayor (Jim Backus) , the citizens , among others . Expecting to be an outcast yet again, Pete is cared by the loved Nora (Helen Reddy) who lives in a lighthouse with her daddy Lampy (Mickey Rooney ). And when a phony con disguising as a Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) and his pal (Red Buttons) arrive in the little town , they see Elliott the Dragon as the ultimate profit to his fortune and money.Enjoyable story that mingles animation with live action . This is a likable sort of a kiddies' adaptation of ¨Harvey¨ and another attempt for repeat the Mary Poppins magic . The dragon Elliott steals the show , as itself grins, grunts and botchers around.The primitive but efficient animation is by Don Bluth who subsequently would direct successes as Nimh , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Originals are Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of the newly updated version out this past Friday, I wanted to write about the original Disney masterpiece, Petes Dragon. It was a great memory as a child, watching this magical film and singing the songs. I realize that not everyone is a fan of musicals or Disney films in general, but this was one of the last true musicals, up there with Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Mary Poppins.I like the original, it has depth and feeling. Remakes just make me feel like I'm paying for a story I already know. Some remakes can be good, but the original Petes Dragon isn't even that old of a film. And I know Disney has a history of remaking a lot of their own films, but Petes Dragon? It's a classic.This film has so many memorable moments, from the characters to the sets to the music. Mickey Rooney as Lampie was great, probably his most remembered role ever. And Helen Reddy as Nora was excellent, and her song Candle on the Water is beautiful. And Doc Terminus, played by Jim Dale was hilarious and charming. He is a real treat to watch in any Disney film.If you love Disney films, watch the classic and give it credit where it's due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally unsatisfactory musical numbers blend in with the other major flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part.With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems.This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last representatives of an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pete's Dragon" is not the last Disney classic combining live-action and animation (although the dragon is really the only cartoon in it), but it's one of the last in the traditional sense. That is why it looks older than it really is. It's from 1977 but in many ways it looks like something from the 60's or even the 50's. This means that even in 1977 it already looked dated, an impression that is even stronger considering "galactic" movies like '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and "galactic" TV series such as 'Star Trek' and 'Battlestar Gallactica'.But the dated style for its time isn't really a fault. It's just temperament. Actually, "Pete's Dragon" has a charm of its own. It's a timeless classic. This was one of my childhood films.Settings are authentic and owners of a great and natural beauty. I wonder if Passamaquoddy exists for real. Nevertheless, Passamaquoddy is one heck of a name. Not as difficult to spell as "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" (and by no means as difficult as to say it backwards, which is "dociousaliexpiisticfragicalirupus" but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?), yet still a little difficult to pronounce at first. Takes its time to learn how to pronounce. But it's not as hard to spell as Doc Terminus wants to make us believe (ha ha ha).The dragon Elliott is cute and very friendly and sweet. If he was real, he'd make a wonderful pet.The kid is cute. What ever happened to Sean Marshall? He was both a very talented actor and a gifted singer. In other words, he was an authentic actor and singed like an angel. Speaking of music, this movie has immensely charming songs. "Candle on the Water" is soft and very relaxing. "It's Not Easy" is very touching and beautiful. "Boo Bop Bop Bop Bop (I Love You, Too)" is quite cute. "Brazzle Dazzle Day" is a feel-good and very optimistic song. "There's Room for Everyone" is another wonderful and nostalgic song. "Bill of Sale" has a different nature than all the songs previously mentioned, but it's just as great and memorable.Jim Dale is priceless as the sly as a fox Dr. Terminus and Red Buttons is hilarious as his follower Hoagy. Hoagy is the typical Disney follower of a villain: mostly harmless, not truly evil or threatening, just a poor guy who made the wrong friend. That's real acting in both cases! Charlie Callas makes very well Elliott's sounds. Helen Reddy and Mickey Rooney are great too. The actors who portray the Gogans are quite convincing in their roles. The Gogans are dirty and creepy, they aren't nice and likable people, but there are moments when they're funny. Pete's teacher isn't a nice and likable person either, but the actress convinces in her portrayal.Title in Portugal: 'Meu Amigo o Drag?o'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to first see this movie as an adult, I would probably scoff at it and return to "more important" things like ipods. However, I have been watching this movie since I was about five years old, and I have always loved it. Maybe my reason for loving it is because it brings back memories of my wonderful childhood, or maybe it's because the catchy melodies continue to get stuck in my head. This is a Disney movie from the 70's. It doesn't have to be Godfather II material. It's sad that the animation of the movie doesn't even compare to the computer animation of today, but don't let that get in the way of this story. It's just fun, bubblegum for the brain. This will always be one of my favorite Disney movies, and I will continue to watch it. I recommend that you do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously one of Disney's finest few</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 1975 this children's classic is absolutely magnificent. Beautifully cast - masterful songs - brilliant color and scenery. Disney couldn't have produced a more memorable, masterful musical than this one. Mickey Rooney gives a fine, stunning performance as the comical, drunken 'Lampie' and is alloted full use of his veteran musical talents in 'I saw a dragon' - tripping about the saloon after a chance encounter with "Elliott".Helen Reddy is dandy as 'Nora', the unmarried daughter. And Jim Dale and Red Buttons are at their comical genius best as 'Dr. Terminus' and 'Hoagie' - especially in their performance of 'Every Little Piece', which I countered in connection with an off-Broadway musical style quality - of which the song could also garner a Tony.The Gogan's - I felt, almost stole the show - next to Elliott-the dragon. Their memorable hillbilly opener "happiest home in these hills" was brilliantly choreographed &amp; performed. And actor Conaway is still remembered all these years later (outside 'Kenicki' in GREASE) as one of the bumbling, hillbilly brothers.I proudly own my own DVD copy, the org. vinyl, and my new CD. Sadly, Disney doesn't produce high-quality action-animation like this classic much more these days. Which makes appreciating this film as a work of art.PEANUT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Disney Studio was in a huge state of "FLUX" when Disney died in the 1960's. The Theme Parks were what kept the company afloat. Well the theme parks and the re-issues of their classic movies. Before the days of Home video Disney would re-issue 2 sometimes 3 animated films a year. Titles that were only released every 5-7 years included "DUMBO" "Snow White" "101 Dalmatians" "Peter Pan" "Bambi" "Pinocchio" &amp; "The Jungle Book". Disney Studio however took a chance in 1977 and made a movie musical when musicals were no longer popular the results were this charming film "Pete's Dragon". In this film "Pete" is an orphan who has just ran away from his adoptive home. He was basically a slave and not treated as a member of his family. He is also comes across as a likable child. What has saved "Pete" was a dragon named "Elliot" that served as his protector and his friend. Many people call this film slow but to me it is far from that. It is not a music video with 10 cuts a minute. It is an enjoyable film. A film that calls for a family viewing experience. Now I saw this film originally in 1977. There is many different running times for this film. For the life of me I can not tell you what was eliminated from the film I saw in 1977. That version ran 131 Minutes. Today The Home video Runs 128 Minutes. What is missing I could not tell you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pete's Dragon - A Review To View, Before We See The New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunday,Feb. 21st, I took out an old copy of Pete's Dragon, that i have on VHS and decided to watch it. It had been a few years since I'd looked at it. I watched it in the company of my significant other, who being a few years younger, had not yet seen it. Well, not only did she like it but I was reminded why I liked it in the first place. For a few of my so called 'grown up years, I'd dismissed it a great deal as 'not Disney's best work'. I also didn't have a nice word for Sean Marshall's (Pete's) singing voice. (I'd roll my eyes during the 'I Love You Too' song.Now this past Sunday also, was the Disneyland 60th anniversary show on ABC, in which a preview trailer of the NEW 'Pete's Dragon was shown. I had no idea that a 'new' version of this childhood favorite was coming out soon or was even being made. What I can tell anyone who is thinking of going to see the new version is, as I always say about remakes, see the original version first. Sure, it was made in 1977 and the special effects aren't the same as what we're used to today....but that's what they had to work with then and what movie goers were used to then as well. Yes, that includes 'green-screen'effects. More importantly, what makes Pete's Dragon engaging is that it 'is' so very simple and child-like in most of it's telling. There's a few things said &amp; done by adults in the film that are not up to today's Politically Correct do's &amp; don't's, where kids films are concerned. They're a product of the time it was made and by a different generation, so it's best to just consider the era they're from.The film over the years has been called things from kiddie-fair, to overly sentimental to emotionally disturbing. None of which are fair labels, nor are they grounded in anything but certain scenes taken out of context. I would say that maybe, since it's a movie with a dragon, people then possibly expected Elliot to do more fantastic things than he actually did. He's a funny character with a funny way of talking and uses 'some' of his magic. I'm sure it was expected he'd use that magic on a greater scale. Anyhow,the story is this. Pete's an orphaned boy between 10 &amp; 12 who is 'purchased' by the despicable 'Gogan' family, who are dirty, filthy and lazy and use Pete as child slave labor back home. They even have a 'bill of sale'. Pete's been befriended by Elliot, a usually invisible but sometimes seen, green Dragon (with little wings) that's helped him escape from the Gogans. He and Pete have come upon the quiet seaside town of Passamaquoddy, Maine. (Circa 1910s) Where in no time at all, Elliot makes the possibility of Pete living (and hiding out) there almost impossible. Enter Nora (Singer Helen Reddy) and 'Lampie' (Mickey Rooney), who operate the local lighthouse. (It's never made clear if they're co-workers or Father &amp; daughter).Lampie is a drinker &amp; former sailor, who actually sees Elliot and is frightened like crazy. Nora (and the boys at the bar) doubt him completely. Soon, because of Elliot's antics, it seems the town (except for Nora) is against Pete. Nora takes him in and thinks that Elliot is just something Pete made up. As the story goes on, there's other baddies to worry about besides the Gogans. Doc Terminus a snake-oil (fake medicine) salesman and his shill Hoagie arrive also. not just to take money from the townspeople but, when finding out about Elliot, want to get hold of him to use his parts in the things they sell. How will all of this turn out? Watch and see. In the meantime, I can tell you the songs here are pretty good. Reddy's 'Candle On The Water' is a great number, so much so it w released as a single for radio in1978. All of her numbers are good, as before this she'd had many top selling records. "Brazzle Dazle Day' is also an unforgettable &amp; very catchy number sung by her, Roony &amp; Marshall, as the paint the lighthouse.The Gogan's "Bill Of Sale' song is as grungy as they are. not note perfect but they're not perfect either, so it's fitting. Other songs by other characters are sung , 'in character'. To be fair to Pete, Marshall is actually a good singer but is singing as a regular boy like Pete could only be able too. So, I feel it was meant to happen that I ended up watching the original the same day as that special. Meaning, I may just go see the new version but it's still good to know that the original's always there. Not just to give an idea of what the new version may be like or how it'll be different ..but also, if someone may just like something from a time that was simpler and more easy going. 9 out of 10 from me, only one off for,again, some questionable dialog and actions from the grown ups in the film.

		<shortDescription>Bland Disney fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own.The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems.Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rewatched this for the first time in almost 2 decades, and found it still holds up in many ways despite some technical glitches and weak jokes. I credit the film's watchabl-ness to the following; 1) Leisurely pace. The narrative is pulled off onto tangents by the wealth of talented actors in supporting roles. The director seems happy to allow them to do this, and it benefits the film. 30-40 minutes could easily be cut, and 3 minute scenes could easily be reduced to a single line of dialog - but where's the fun in that? Viewer's who commit the time will get to see pretty much every actor interact, whether the scene is necessary or not (Buttons and Rooney, Dale and Reddy, etc.) 2) Catchy Songs. With a few exceptions, the songs in Pete's Dragon mostly reflect the quasi-lounge feel of Burt Bacharach numbers. Each number is mounted as a "showstopper," with dance and dialog breakdowns that contribute to the running time. However, unlike most modern musicals, the songs are integral to the plot.3)Solid Ham in supporting roles. The veteran performers chew scenery like James Bond villains without ever failing to take the proceedings seriously. Winters especially gave me the creeps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strenuously magical...and what happened to Elliott?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musical opus from director Don Chaffey and the Disney Studios mixes animation with live-action in the possible hope of creating another "Mary Poppins". Plot concerns turn-of-the-century orphan (Sean Marshall, who is both too old and too modern) escaping from villains with help from a lighthouse keeper, his daughter, and a goofy 50-foot dragon (who mostly stays invisible!). Harmless family film isn't especially inventive or witty, opening with a big production number featuring Shelley Winters dressed as a singing hag. The infrequent animated dragon may lure youngsters, but the picture seldom comes together and is woefully overlong. Another piece of heavy-handed whimsy from mid-'70s Disney. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon was my favorite Disney movie when I was growing up, but I hadn't watched it since I was little. Recently, I've revisited many films I loved as a child only to be disappointed by them. So naturally, I was afraid the same was going to happen to the one I loved the most.The film is about a boy, Pete, who has escaped with his dragon, Elliot, from his abusive foster family. The two of them come to the town of Passamaquoddy, where they meet a lighthouse owner, Nora (Helen Reddy) and her father, played by Mickey Rooney.As far as the music goes, the songs are some of Disney's best. It's hard to point out highlights, since all of them are so memorable. My favorite might be the film's first song, "The Happiest Home in These Hills," which is as memorable of an opening as could be. They say that in most films, the part you remember the least is the beginning. But in Pete's Dragon, it's one of the best scenes. The choreography and the creepiness of Pete's orphan family chasing him through the swampy forest is still ingrained in my head all these years later and sets the tone for the rest of the film.But the dark tone shifts a lot throughout and we end up getting more of a campy musical feel the rest of the way out. But at least that's what it wants to be.Elliot, the dragon, is as adorable as any Disney character. He brightens up the screen whenever he's on it. In fact, the biggest problem is probably the fact that he only gets 22 minutes of total screen time in a movie that's 134 minutes.It's still better than the original plan, which was to have him absent in the movie altogether. Instead, remaining in Pete's imagination only. What we get is better than nothing.Most films back then aren't without their issues, and neither is Pete's Dragon. It has its fair share of plot holes. It doesn't make much sense why Pete waits almost the entire movie to show Elliot to Nora. He has no reason to hide him from her. But if you throw in nostalgia, these things don't really matter as much.It's a fun movie. Kids will enjoy it, and it's completely tolerable for adults.Twizard Rating: 92</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another delightfully enjoyable Disney split-animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During its original cinematic release, I recall kids in the audience dancing along with the colorful songs, and hooting over Elliot the dragon. The adults just loved Doc Terminus and bumbling Hoagie, not to mention the near scene-stealing Gogan clan. The entire film is just plain enjoyable and quite entertaining.Now some have mocked this film as dull, silly animation, with a laughable "dragon". However they forget that, like Mary Poppins, Bedknobs, Gullivers Travels, etc - this is partial animation - not the sophisticated modern CGI, the younger audiences are more familiar with. For its time, partial animation was a brilliant film-making invention incorporation. It spawned the Who Framed Roger Rabbitt? franchise into movie credits history.The entire cast here is perfectly delightful in their roles, and very entertaining. And how better fitting for Helen Reddy to portray a liberated lighthouse keeper, following the 1970's Women's Liberation movement, and her respective contemporary music hits, "I am woman", and "No way to treat a lady".Of course, fans will argue that Elliot the dragon is the ultimate scene stealer. Decent job, production delivered, with interacting Pete, realistically, with the animated Elliot. And Sean Marshall was gold as young Pete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Mary Poppins but a "Brazzle-Dazzle" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many people, I am in the process of upgrading my collection from VHS to DVD/Blu-Ray. This was on-sale at Amazon. What a surprise! Much better than I remember it. Great songs and cast with great performances by Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney. Shelly Winters plays a wonderfully-horrible villain with "blackout" teeth. A simple story about a dragon that only Pete can see (at first) and clever dragon mechanical effects: Pete riding Elliott, toasting apples, dragon footprints, his "outline" on the schoolhouse wall, thrashing around inside a whale-sized net. The dragon animation by Don Bluth is fanciful, which is good because this is a children's' movie. Some technical glitches, as the "yellowscreen" (sodium vapor) process renders Elliott the Dragon somewhat transparent and prone to color-shifts. But this is not something that kids care about anyway. Although "Candle on the Water" is the Oscar-wining song, I bet you start humming "Brazzle-Dazzle Day" as the movie ends!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has gotten its fair share of bad press, but you can't always believe everything you hear. Pete's Dragon is a cheerful and whimsical musical adventure for families who want to kick back and just be entertained, without having to worry about inappropriate content that seems to plague the family films of today.The plot is very simple, and so is the character depth, but the musical numbers are fantastic, with catchy tunes and clever little dance sequences. And veterans Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons, and Shelley Winters seem to be having the time of their lives playing their respective wacky characters (something the adults can enjoy watching when you think about the cinematic history of those three performers).Though it's not on the same rung as Mary Poppins on the tall Disney ladder, Pete's Dragon is still good, clean, innocent fun. Can't beat that, can you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney romp brings back some childhood memories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in a crowded theater at age four on a rainy Saturday afternoon. For some reason the theater sold more tickets than there were seats and some people had to sit on the floor to watch it! I think it was at Westroads Mall in Omaha if I recall....Anyway, Pete's Dragon is a Disney musical full of colorful characters and interesting moments. Is it a classic? Maybe not quite, but any viewer should savor the chance to see a children's film like this since they really aren't made this well any more. The story deals with a young boy on the run from an abusive hillbilly family who "bought" him for $50 and fifty cents in legal fees. The Gogans as they are called leave little to the imagination about how they wish to abuse young Pete, and he and his animated dragon named Elliot seek refuge in a near by fishing village known as Passamaquady. This dragon is mostly invisible, but he has a playful side. He damages all kinds of property in town, and Pete is blamed since few people actually see the dragon. After a while, a kindly lighthouse keeper and her father take the boy in whilst the dragon moves in to the caves beneath their lighthouse. After a while, the Gogans discover where Pete has gone and they come to collect him. Also complicating matters is the arrival of a "doctor" and his associate who plan to capture the dragon and sell him off piece by piece to the highest bidder. The charismatic Dr. Terminus is one of those old fashioned quacks who moves from town to town selling mysterious potions that supposedly cure just about anything. Keep in mind the film takes place around one hundred years ago. There are other subplots involving problems with local fishermen, the lighthouse keeper's lost love, and an abusive local school teacher. The problems are all more or less dealt with in one way or another.Overall, this is a very good film. Maybe the two plus hour length is too much for some children, though. There are a LOT of songs, even for a Disney musical. Luckily, many of them are memorable or at least good. The Dragon isn't seen all that much, but when we see him, he looks pretty neat. Donald Bluth &amp; Co did a pretty good job with him. Some plot points might be edgier than the PC world of today would allow. The abusive teacher really enjoys hitting Pete when he attends her class. And many of the men of this town appear to be raging alcoholics! Especially Mickey Rooney. The cast is generally likable, though. Sadly some of the main characters are no longer with us. I guess it's worth about eight stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

It was my favorite movie as a child, right now i've just had my 16th birthday so I guess I'm still entitled to my opinion of 10 years ago. I probably watched it more then any other Disney movie on my shelves and boy did I have a lot. The actors are good, they aren't the most well known but they are good for a children's movie...I know the actors weren't the thing I looked for right away at six years old. Oh well, you're all entitled to your own opinions, I just don't believe they're worth it to a pre-schooler. The movie is GREAT, try comparing this movie to any movie in 2005 by Disney, they are very far out as well, and they are all alike. They are meant to attract an audience of a certain age group and they do their jobs. The picture is all in the age of the film, the movie is over 35 years so I think it's looking mighty fine. The movie is attractive, the actors are attractive and so is the dragon, leave poor Elliot alone.</fullReview>

Mickey Rooney is pretty funny and is in the state you should be as you're watching this film unless you're under 12. This film reminds me of "Puff the Magic Dragon" in the way it is light-hearted and makes me light-headed. It's crazy and whack and I really don't think kids will enjoy this unless they understand what is going on. I rated is a ten based on my love for the film. Honestly, it doesn't take much to get a perfect ten from me. I simply am a movie addict and it all started in my early living with the Superman movies and Star Wars.So in conclusion, I believe if you should watch this film, you must want to watch it no matter what negative opinion may be concocting within your brain. Are we so expectant these days of explosions and vulgar words that we can't simply enjoy the moving pictures?</fullReview>

I was in the library a few days ago and I recommended this movie to a young girl, probably no older than five or six. When I coincidently saw her again, she said she loved the film and so did her mother. They loved Elliot the animated Dragon and thought that it was even better than Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although the actors are not up to the Disney standard (Helen Reddy wasn't that bad) Elliot was funny, cute and most of all, fun. No offense to anyone, especially Mickey Rooney, but Elliot was the best actor, as he stole the show. And I think that they knew that? but I'm not complaining. The movie is fun to watch even at 14! Notice how it holds my regards!To all who bash the film for what is could have been, what else is missing except for a little better acting? I love the music and I sometimes, even now blurt out some of the words whenever I'm feeling down. A DRAGON? A DRAGON! I SWEAR I SAW A DRAGON!With all the above in consideration, I am forced to close on a very positive note about this film, one that I hope will be in everyone's hearts for the rest of eternity!And I know that people who were born in the 70's like it because my teacher has a little sun catcher of Elliot!

		<shortDescription>Campy, Creepy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I loved this movie as a child, but I can't really understand why. Of course, it is meant to appeal to children, so perhaps it's only natural that it's lost its ability to charm me. On the other hand, there are plenty of kids' movies that are fun for the grown-ups in their lives. I think the main problem with this one is that it just seems awfully dated. And creepy. Now that's one thing about it that has never changed.For starters, there are the Gogans. I can watch Deliverance without breaking a sweat, but years after I first saw Pete's Dragon the Gogans still make me feel all icky. They are impossibly dirty hill-folk who want to enslave a young child. Their antics, I'm sure, are meant to have a cartoonish quality to them, but they fall short of that goal and land squarely in the realm of "unsettling." The same is true of the way-over-the-top medicine show duo of Dr. Terminus and Hoagie. For example, Dr. Terminus offers Pete a potion that will "bring on puberty two years early" if he turns over the dragon. That proposition is just loaded with ick factor, not to mention the fact that the word "puberty" is vile and should be used in a clinical or classroom setting ONLY.Finally, there's the abusive school teacher who humiliates and beats her pupils. I realize that a lot has changed in the field of education, but I don't think there was ever a time when that was considered funny.Actually, any of these plot elements could be funny, if handled correctly. Here they have too much of a inappropriate or nightmarish quality to pass as such. A person who is especially emotionally fragile would do well to steer clear of this one.It is fun to play "film school" with Pete's Dragon, trying to figure out what the director/producers were thinking and trying to figure out what it was about that era that led to the birth of such a bizarre bit of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon (1977): Dir: Don Chaffey / Cast: Helen Reddy, Mickey Rooney, Jim Dale, Red Buttons, Sean Marshall: Live animation musical about a boy named Pete whose friend is a dragon named Elliott. It is an intriguing family film about control and the overuse of the imagination. He spirits Pete away from nasty relatives. They enter a small town where Elliott is sighted by a drunken old man whose daughter provides shelter. Elliott can render himself invisible and when he walks through a school house he is targeted by con men seeking profit. Plot is complex in dealing with the need for adult role models as well as presenting an array of colorful musical numbers. Directed by Don Chaffey who previously made Jason and the Argonauts. Imaginative film with engaging performances by Helen Reddy as a young woman who begins with an energetic bar room dance segment then she locks into possible adoption of Pete before saving him from certain danger. Mickey Rooney plays her drunken father who goes hysterical upon seeing Elliott, then assists Reddy in dealing with Pete. Jim Dale, and Red Buttons play the scheming con men who attempt to capture Elliott at any cost . Sean Marshall plays Pete, the orphan running from abusive relatives, and could align with a brand new start. Message of friendship underlined with an engaging animated character.

I often wonder how people like the stars of this little gem deal with the fame. Imagine having perfect strangers running up to you ... wanting autographs, and to just touch you, as if whatever you've got may rub-off on them.Helen Reddy was excellent as Nora ... the entire cast was perfect casting.

		<fullReview>I have never forgotten this movie and some song lyrics where always on my mind for over 20 years. I didn't watch it again for a long time, assuming it is a kid movie, until lately, where I discovered that there is also the long 129 minutes version. Surprisingly, I found myself very entertained even as a an adult! Of course one has a different perspective and there where so many jokes and side remarks that I just didn't get as a kid - it was wonderful to "rediscover" this movie. The ocean scenery is beautiful and the songs - they are just great, sometimes funny, sometimes really touching.This movie is so heart warming, well done for its time and brings along many important messages about friendship, love, tolerance, enjoying life together, but also doing the right thing and stand up for what you believe - just like Nora, my favorite character. I found myself in a very good mood the rest of the day, remembering my childhood and humming "Brazzle Dazzle day" ;-) So what is the definition of a good movie ? A movie you can watch as kid or adult discovering different things, a movie with music &amp; lyrics you never forget and have to sing along, a movie that makes you think and appreciate your loved ones, family and friends but also lifts you up and makes you feel happy ? If that's not the definition of a good movie, then I don't know what is. I will watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent children's movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a number of times on HBO, but, Ironically enough, I can't remember too much about it. I remember when it was first advertised for the theatres, and shrugging my shoulders at it as a kids' film. A friend of mine really took to it, but I don't recall anything too extraordinary about it.The old "out of the ink well" animation formula is taken to the extreme when a young boy who comes across a sleepy coastside Hamlet discovers intrigue among the locals. His special medieval mythical fire-breathing (and flying) friend aids him in his search for a family and to right a wrong.To be honest, I never got the whole thing, but it was fun for what it was. Not a film I would own in my collection ... unless the wife and kids wanted it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine children's film, my tastes just lie elsewhere.Give it a whirl on the old DVD player, and watch it with the family.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST Disney movie next to Song Of The South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon has got to be one of my ALL TIME favorite Disney films. This movie is in a class all by itself.The music, first of all, is unlike any other Disney production. There are no trashy undertones to the lyrics, unlike most of the 90's and up productions.The cinematography is unforgettable, and the scenery almost makes you want to pack your bags and find the humble villa of Passamaquady, and stay.I was around 12 or 13 with I first saw this movie, and I remember going day after day to see it again and again (I had a relative that worked at the theater). I learned every song, and loved every moment I could spend with Pete, Nora, Lampie &amp; Hoagy. I came to love them as if they were part of my family. (I had a horrible childhood, and somewhat related to the abuse of Pete by the Gogans.)This movie gives hope to every child that watches. I helps you imagine that anything is possible, and there really are people out there that love you, and want to protect you from those who would rather harm you.A wonderful love story. The love of a child and his best friend. The love of a father for his daughter. The love of a wife for her long lost husband.Just remember:"Life is lollipops and raindrops with the one you love. Someone you can always be with; argue and agree with. Climb the highest tree with."Open your heart as you watch this beautiful story of hope. And then share it with a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been watching Pete's Dragon for as long as I can remember. There is just something about it that always brings a smile to my face. I can remember when I was a kid, I had a stuffed Elliot toy and my dad would always do the voice, perfectly i might add. But that is something i will never forget. Its a timeless movie! I am going to make sure that my kids see it and love it! Its a movie that just brings you back to being a child. A TRUE CLASSIC Disney FILM!!!!!! The music is fantastic! I still find myself humming the words to "Brazzle Dazzle Day" or "We got a bill of sale". I am almost 24 now and I will still claim Pete's Dragon and one of my top favorites. I will keep watching it forever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie sometime in the very early 1980s on TV, and I absolutely loved it. Then for all these decades I never saw it again until a week ago I requested it on DVD from our public library. I was allowed to keep it for a week (and sadly have to return it today). I watched it every single day of the week! This is one of the best movies ever made. It was filmed before the obsession of computer generated "realism" started. Instead of CGI, it relies on its performers, on music, on pure photography, and, for the dragon himself, on a cartoon. All of them were topnotch back then and still are topnotch today.The main character, Pete, is played by a multi-talented twelve-year old Sean Marshall who has to be one of the best twelve-year-old performers I have ever seen (and I have seen quite a few as I have lived in a number of very different countries in my more than half a century). This kid has an amazingly powerful voice. His facial expressions can show so many emotions. He can carry any tune in his singing. He has a wonderful sense of rhythm, whether in the way he sings and dances, or in the way he talks and walks. How any of the reviewers below can be critical of this talented young man (yes, really, at twelve he had the full talents of a grown-up man!) is beyond me.This movie is amazing. The only bad thing about it is that I have to return it back to the library already!</fullReview>

I love the music, the characters, and the use of animation and live action (which I found incredibly fascinating as a child). What I realize though, is that I grew up watching this movie, and a lot of others haven't. Perhaps this is just the kind of movie that people have to see growing up to enjoy. I don't know if I'd like it so much or not if I watched it the first time as an adult. Let your kids see it now and ask them if they still like it in 15 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great, entry in the Disney catalog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so a lot of people like PETE'S DRAGON. I do too. It is a fun film and a decent musical, at a time when family oriented musicals were virtually extinct. Still, it has some major faults. Mickey Rooney and Red Buttons are delightful to behold, but I think that, at this point in their careers, acting in a Disney film wouldn't have mattered either way. In fact, it didn't prevent Rooney from garnering acclaim a few years later for playing a mentally retarded man in the TV film BILL. As for Shelley Winters "ruining" her career with her appearance in this film . . . well, the person who thought that obviously hadn't seen Winters' wholesale scenery wrecking in films like WILD IN THE STREETS and WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN? PETE'S DRAGON could only be a step up, for her scenery chomping here was SUPPOSED to be funny! Sean Marshall was undistinguished, as either an actor or a singer. Helen Reddy was, as far as I can tell, cast soley to do justice to the theme song "Candle On The Water". She performs it well, but I don't personally like her singing style. Why was Olivia Newton-John not offered the role of Nora? She would have been a perfect alternative, for she would have performed the theme wonderfully AND fulfilled everyone's requirement for a pretty heroine! Her acting ability is up for grabs, but I think she could have pulled it off, seeing her performance in GREASE. Elliot is a decent animated effort, given the technology at the time, but audiences today are so spoiled on computer wizardry and animatronics that he looks shoddy by comparison. However, I have to strongly disagree that this is one of Disney's best. Efforts like MARY POPPINS and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS had the perfect combination of acting talent, music, and animation. PETE'S DRAGON falls short on some aspects, and it's not unwatchable, but its certainly not Disney's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was released 22 years ago and is still one of the Great Disney Classics. It tells the story of an orphan named Pete, who escapes the evil wrath of an abusive adoptive family, with the help of Elliot, his guardian dragon. Whenever I think about children in situations like that in the real world, I sometimes think about Elliot rescuing wards of the state department of human resources and services from these irresponsible, unfit "pretend parents" and deliver them to good, kindhearted parents who care! I just wish they had these guardian dragons like Elliot here in the real world to help the children!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's live action mixed with animation with a dragon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not Disney's first film to feature a mixture of live action and animation, but it was one of the few that I have seen. I enjoyed this movie a bit as a child, but mainly because I liked things like dragons and Godzilla movies. Granted this one features a rather friendly dragon, it still was fun for me to watch as a child. The songs though are a bit silly and not very good, the plot goes here and there a bit to much and it has one of those sad endings like a lot of Disney movies from this era seemed to have (though nothing compares to the ending of "Old Yeller"). The story has a boy who is befriended by a dragon and at the start of the film he is trying to escape his strange family. He is an orphan and I think he is basically a foster child as they have a bill of sale on him so it is almost a case of him being a slave. Well he ends up in a town where he is taken in by a local who happens to live in a lighthouse. Her husband I believe is out to sea at the moment and this sets up a plot point that occurs during the end of the film. Pete gets in all sorts of trouble thanks to his dragon at times, but the dragon also gets Pete out of trouble at times as well and really comes through in the end. There is also a plot point involving a sort of medicine man who actually sees the dragon at one point and wants to chop him up and use him in potions. The dragon is invisible for a lot of the film and this is why Pete gets in so much trouble because of him. It has its moments, but it is kind of lame and sappy at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the preview of Pete's Dragon, I had to comment on it, and place a review of my own.I have been watching Pete's Dragon since I was about four years old. Twenty-two years later, and that movie is still an all-time fave of mine.The songs in the movie, such as "I Love You, Too", "It's Not Easy", "Bill of Sale", and many more are very entertaining, and have catchy tunes. The story itself is adorable, and the antics of Elliot the dragon are very amusing, especially when he and Pete first get to Passamaquaddy.Honestly, I would not change one single thing about this movie, and I know that it'll always be a favorite of mine. The songs, story, characters, actors, everything are very entertaining to watch.A favorite scene of mine has always been when Lampie and Hoagy go down to the cave to look for Elliot. I love it when they talk about a ferocious monster, meaning Elliot, but Elliot doesn't realize they're talking about him, so he freaks out, thinking that there's something else down the cave. Once Lampie and Hoagy realize that Elliot's right there, they freak out and Hoagy begs Elliot to not roast him.Overall, my grade on this movie is: A+</fullReview>

It was my brother's and my favorite movie when we were probably between 5 and 10 years old. I used "Candle on the Water" to audition for a musical in high school. Solidly fun movie that won't drive parents nuts (i.e. Barney) even though the kid who played Pete is a little much at times.It does have some scary moments for young ones (In the opening scene the Gogans are chasing Pete in the woods). As an adult, I see more alcohol in it than I did as a child... there is some drunkeness, scenes at the saloon and the dragon drinks from a flask. But most kids don't see that.The guy who posted all the criticism should just relax and have a "brazzle dazzle day".</fullReview>

I couldn't believe it when I read some of the negative comments that had to be said about this movie, or about the performance of the actors. I thought it was ultimately a great movie. This movie has the ability to make anyone smile. I always watch this movie when I need to be cheered up. And this movie should never be underestimated because it didn't just come out of theaters. I even have a tendency not to want to watch movies made before i was born, but i have learned that lots of older movies are wonderful. Especially Pete's Dragon! I hope everyone watches this movie, it's an unforgettable movie. And I enjoy it more than most movies that I have recently seen. This movie may not of had all of the high-tech animation but the emotion that is clearly shown in this movie is enough to move anyone! I have and will continue to recommend this movie to everyone! It's a great movie to watch alone, or with a group. I love the movie Pete's Dragon and I hope you give this movie a chance, you won't regret it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enchanting tale that will continue throughout time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have noticed that there are some movies that require beautiful actors and lyrical voices so that the inadequately written story will not be a complete failure. The story of Pete and his dragon, however, does not fall into this category. It is true that all movies are helped by perfect acting, perfect people, and perfect voices, and of course this one is no exception. Even with the lack of this Hollywood perfection though, the story within Pete's Dragon is flawless. Who is it that decides who sings well and who doesn't? I know that by that person's standards Sean Marshall's (Pete) singing would fall right behind a dog's howling. But then again, by that person's standards how many children wouldn't? One of the greatest joys of life is hearing a child's pure, young voice sing simple lyrics that you know the child understands. Pete does this. His voice is only slightly better than that of my 10 year old nephew and it makes him seem real. Not out of reach. The lyrics he sings are simple, not above that of a ten year old's intellect. I will admit that his and the rest of character's poor acting will be hard to ever justify, but the movie doesn't require strong acting to carry the story. A good story doesn't need to be told well to be understood. It only needs to be told. Once you are able to realize this, it is amazing how easily you are able to suspend your disbelief and fall into this simple dream of having the perfect friend. Wouldn't it be great if you could have someone who knew exactly what to say when you need direction? Or someone who wouldn't turn away when you need protection? Wouldn't life be a brazzle dazzle time if you had someone who was there when you were going through the worst times of your life? I don't think anyone needs great singing or brilliant acting to recognize the real perfection within this timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Disney's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon.One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it.Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attempt to equal "Mary Poppins" fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Walt Disney's death in the late '60s, for the next 15 or so years the Disney studio had a real problem trying to come up with movies that were big at the box office. "Pete's Dragon" was an attempt to come up with something similar in some ways to "Mary Poppins", but it was only a moderate success at the box office. Seeing it, it quickly becomes clear why this was not the blockbuster Disney had hoped it would be. It's too long, for one thing, with a story that not only takes forever to get going, but moves very slowly once it gets going. Part of the reason why the story creeps along so slowly are the song numbers, which stop the movie dead in its tracks. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad if the songs were good, but they aren't - they will evaporate from your brain the minute they end. Most of the cast mug outrageously once the camera is on them, maybe in the belief that overacting is funny, but it's just embarrassing. As for the special effects, they often look like they are right out of a movie made ten years earlier, lacking polish and flash. Adults won't like this very much, and I suspect that even younger minds from this day and age will feel it's dated, among other problems.</fullReview>

For you folks who do not have kids, that means that the VHS tape will be worn out in a few weeks, after continuous viewing. After the thirtieth viewing, one wants to run from the house, screaming.Aside from that, there are a few, and I mean few reasons to enjoy this film. The bad guys, Jim Dale and Red Buttons are enjoyable, and Shelly Winters and her clan do provide a chuckle. The jury is out on Mickey Rooney, as he always seems to be over acting. And I find Pete, just plain annoying.Helen Reddy CAN sing, but like her TV show from the 70's, I find her acting very "stiff".It might work for the hard core "Disney-phile", but I'll pass.

		<fullReview>The 1970s saw a great many quality films get made, but they were not good years for Walt Disney Studios. "The Aristocats" and "Robin Hood" are familiar critical whipping boys, but perhaps the greatest flowering culmination of Disney's nouveau wretchedness is a movie that's only half-animated: 1977's "Pete's Dragon." It's marvelously inept entertainment ? one of the biggest and worst musicals you'll ever see. Sean Marshall's vocal performance is among the most limply sung and out-of-tune I've ever heard, the choreography and camera-work beats Robert Altman to the "Anti-Musical" by a good three years, and the songs can only be called models of awfulness. (The fact that they're also terribly hummable only aggravates the pain they cause - they're as catchy as smallpox.) Most of the adult actors seem to think they're competing in some kind of ham Olympics, with Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, and the actress playing the schoolteacher all reaching unbelievable heights of mugging, veritably tripping over themselves for the gold. In terms of artistic construction, the concept is frankly absurd, and the narrative structure is as lumpy as a garden planted with rocks (we've long since forgotten the Gogans by the time they arrive, etc.). The animation is unconvincing, the drinking scenes unfathomable from a modern perspective, and the 128-minute running time is simply unforgivable. The movie is truly hilarious, but even I've never been able to watch it all the way through. Yes, it's *that* long. So better break it up into fifteen-minute segments, punctuated by some extremely heavy drinking of your own. 2 out of 10. Everybody! And it's money, money, money by the ? money, money, money by the ? money, money, money by the ? money, money, money by the . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it has the words "Walt Disney's Classic" above the title on most of its video incarnations, this charming story of a boy and his pet dragon gets overlooked more often than not when lists are made about people's favorite Disney films. And though it's always on mine - I can understand why.A. It's too long and slow. At over two hours, the movie is paced like an elephant moving through a vat of mud. Long sections drag - 30 minutes could have been cut and no one would really notice.B. Technical merits are dire. Though everyone in it speaks English and the film is in English, it appears some post production work has been done as the voices and mouths don't always match up completely, and foley noise is overemphasized. Also, the mixture of live action and animation is pretty rough - though technically good for the time, one can see the strings and seams showing almost always, and there is no doubt the actors are reacting to air.C. Speaking of actors - the acting is terrible. The cast overacts with glee, and Sean Marshall, as young Pete, has the dubious distinction of being a poor actor AND singer. Not a good thing when he is given most of the major songs.But all this aside, I LOVE this movie. I remember when VHS was new and we used to rent this movie every weekend and I would watch it four or five times. The songs never fail to touch me or move me to sing along even today. "Candle on the Water," "Brazzle Dazzle Day" and the rest get me every time, and I will often slip this movie in as a pick me up.It's one of my most treasured DVDs. And in this high tech era of family filmmaking, if you haven't seen this film - rent it, and return to a time when "kids films" were about the story, the songs, and imagination.</fullReview>

Exactly why is unclear, as many other 70s (or older) films have held up quite well. One key reason may be just that the boy playing Pete was not very likable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This takes you back to the era of invisible friends, kids who talked to Martians through their lunch boxes, and pure imagination where we had to create our own games rather than turn on a switch or pick up a remote control. Yes, this is typical Disney silliness, but there's a lot to enjoy in it in spite of all that goody-goody happiness.Sean Marshall is Pete, the troublesome adolescent who is truly lonely and finds a friend in an animated dragon who sings, although not very well. He's run away from his foster family (Ma Shelley Winters has the bill of sale to prove it), and ends up living with the eccentric Mickey Rooney and his sweet daughter (Helen Reddy). One of the top singers of the 1970's, Reddy was a very charming actress, and her solo, "Candle on the Water", is one of the sweetest movie songs ever written. When Marshall, Rooney and Reddy break down and declare, "It's a Brazzle, Dazzle Day!", you're back in movie musical heaven, reminding you that Rooney was once the Sean Marshall of his era, singing and dancing with Judy Garland and conducting an orchestra where the members and their instruments were pieces of fruit or a huge slice of cake.Jim Dale takes over the villainy here as the carny man who wants to get his hands on Pete, and when he joins up with the over-the-top Winters and her brood, it's a mud-flying moment of fun with Elliott the Dragon being just as mischievous as Pete when confronting his new best friend's foes. Other professionals like Red Buttons and Jim Backus add to the fun here, with a musical score that threatens to top both "Mary Poppins" and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" in originality and some spot on choreography that may have you applauding.This was Disney's last live action/partially animated musical, a bit past their golden era, but showing that they were concerned about the state of film as America transfered from one turbulent era into another. Some critics might call it dated, and it even may be slightly similar in theme to "Finian's Rainbow" (a dragon instead of a leprechaun), but it's still a ton of fun and filled with magical entertainment that pretty much everybody can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A carefree, but long movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Brooksticks, this movie combines live action and animation, courtesy of the animated Pete's dragon friend called Elliott. Set in New England in the early 20th century, nine-year-old Pete escapes his abusive adoptive parents, the Gogans, with Elliott and journey to Passamaquoddy, Maine, where they indirectly cause of ruckus among the townspeople. Pete and Elliott are taken in by lighthouse keeper Nora (Helen Reddy) and her father, Lampie (Mickey Rooney), but Elliott is spotted by con artist Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale), who wants to use Elliott for fame.The interaction between Pete and Elliott were quite touching and the special effects for animation and live action were neat. The location of the story - in the ocean/harbor sides of Maine - gives you a carefree and lazy-day feel, making you want to relax and contemplate things you've done in your life. The acting is a little off-the-wall, which coincided with a long, drawn-out and excitement-lacking plot that made this movie more on the boring side.The song, "Candle on the Water," sung by Helen Reddy, is a breath of fresh air in the film - soothing and emotionally connecting that gives a strong message of treading on despite hard times.Overall, this film is far too long for its lack of intrigue, and more on the whimsical side that is best left for the little kids to watch.Grade C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pete's Dragon" features good adult acting, but a Disney film needs tighter songs and better animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A throwaway Disney film, "Pete's Dragon" is distinguished only by strong performances from its adult cast. Helen Reddy brings a sly intensity to her performance, elevating it above what is actually written. Shelley Winters and Jim Dale are entertaining in way over-the-top roles, and Mickey Rooney gives an enjoyable performance as a Disnified alcoholic. Unfortunately, not much good can be said for any other element of the movie. The songs are not only boring, but go on twice as long as they should, since almost all of them have interludes. Surprisingly few of them have anything to do with the matters at hand, and could easily have been rejects from other musicals. For example, the love song Pete sings to his dragon at the beginning manages to be both generic and awkward, sounding exactly like something that would appear in the middle of a musical romance. The animation was probably nothing to write home about even in 1977, and its integration into the live action is far less seamless than what had come before in "Mary Poppins" (1964, mind you!) and what would come again in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, for different reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon was one of my favorite movies as a child. It is only now, years later, that I realize just how bad, and good, this movie is.The movie is about Pete, a young boy, and Elliott, Pete's dragon, as they run away from Pete's abusive adoptive family to a small town, where they are not welcome with open arms. Now, with the help of Nora and Lampie, Pete and Elliott must try to live in a town that hates them, but things are further complicated when a fake doctor and Pete's adoptive family come to town.Let's face it, this is not a very good movie. It is very much overacted by everyone. Everybody wears big, stupid grins on their faces at all times. The songs are loud, cheery, and annoying--the kind guaranteed to get stuck in your head for days on end.But all these elements help to cover up what the characters are actually babbling on about. Child abuse, killing, lying, and drinking are a few issues that are presented throughout. And these aren't light issues at all. But children are so focused on the huge dance numbers and the big animated dragon that they hardly notice anything. At least I didn't.So even though Pete's Dragon is as bad as they come, it's also great. It handles these really intense issues so well that parents actually let their kids watch it. Surprising, especially after the Puff the Magic Dragon fiasco. Or, maybe Pete's Dragon has fooled parents as well.Of course, that would make it brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the BEST Disney film, trust me, i've seen the majoroty of them. Pete's dragon has eveything you'd want in a "family" film Funny jokes and gags, drama, rousing musical numbers, not to mention it contains all star cast.Jokes and Gags: everyone has a funny bit, even the villians. The gogans falling into the mud was a hoot. Dr. Terminous trying to pronounce Passamaquady(I think thats right). Hoagy being a coward in the funny sort of way, it's ok to be scared now and then. And then their the Lines, my favorite is When Dr. Terminous arives in town, and is selling his products to past custemers. Terminous "Even tuned away from Kingdom Hall" Townfolk "They probably thew you out!".Drama: not much, but there was when they capture Eliot, or when Nora is singing "Candle In The Water".Musical Numbers: Weather you prefer a hillarious song "A Dragon", "We Got A Bill Of Sell Right Here", or a dramatic song "There's room for everyone in this World",that song is about Cilvil Rights, This Shows Got it all. My favorite is "Money Money Money" in which Dr. Terminous and Hoaggy plan what their going to do with Eliot,l I thing it just gets funnier, and funnier as it goes along.All Star Cast: This is not an eliment for a good "family" film, but usualy makes a good one. Helen Reedy is terrific as Norah. Jim Dale is sinfully good as Dr. Terminous. Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney share their jokes as Hoagy And Lampie. As for Shelly Winters, too many words TO dicribe her as Ma Gogan.If you like those eliments, you'll love Pete's Dragon, and I highly Recomend it to you too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first time I saw Pete's Dragon when I was 3 years old, and I loved it sence. Beetween the Red buttons playing the dim-witted Hoaggy or Mickey Rooney playing the usualy drunk Lampie it had some good lines such as Hoagys "Half of these kids answer to the name of Pete, the other half don't answer" or Rooneys comment to the Dragon when drunk "You look terible" . Of corse the movie also stared Hellen Reedy as Nora, Jim Dale as Dr. Tremonus, Shelly WInters as Ma Gogan and Jim Bucus as Mr. of Passamaquaty, which also are preety riotis. and what movie would be complete without the 4 show stoping numbers "A Dragon" "Theres Room For Evryone" "Brazzle Dazzle Day" and of course the signature song " Candle On Te Water" which got the movie an Oscar nomination. when asked on a scle of 1 to 10 a give it the full 10, and say it ranked among such classics as Mary Poppins, Pollyanna, and The Love Bug.

		<fullReview>In many ways Pete's Dragon is the last hurrah of the old-style Disney musical; while it has plenty of enjoyable songs, the film lacks any real charm and, but for the presence of a giant cartoon dragon, bears few of the hallmarks of a Disney movie.Sean Marshall plays Pete, a runaway orphan from a hillbilly family led by Shelley Winters, who treat him like a slave. Pete is aided in his escape by the aforementioned dragon Elliott who, as well as being green and possessing the ability to turn invisible at will, sports a shock of pink hair and pink wings. Reaching the town of Passamaquoddy, Pete finds temporary sanctuary in the home of lighthouse keeper Nora (Helen Reddy) and her drunken father Lampie (Mickey Rooney), but it isn't long before the family track him down and Elliot comes under the covetous scrutiny of quack medicine man Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale).The mid-seventies weren't the best of times for Disney, and this musical is typical of much of the lacklustre material they were producing. Everyone involved in the technical side of the move seems to be simply going through the motions ? and, despite the subject matter, this creative torpor shows in the movie's failure to engage the audience or to arouse any real sympathy for Pete, who simply comes across as just another kid with a dragon. The animation looked pretty workmanlike back in '77 so, in this age of hyper-realistic computer animation, you can just imagine how outdated it seems now. The human actors never look like they're interacting with the cartoon dragon, and Elliott never displays the human characteristics that so often make Disney's animated creations lovable. Helen Reddy has a decent voice but she's no movie star, and we have to look to Jim Dale and Shelley Winters to add any zest to the proceedings ? it's a shame more screen-time wasn't given to her and her dusty, bickering clan as it is they who provide many of the film's highlights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love dragons! I think they're great, and I think it's all probably because of this fun-filled Disney movie. Now I'm not normally one to sing the praises of Disney films but this time I have to tip my cap to them. Why? Well, this film does exactly what it says on the box. It's about this boy called Pete who has an invisible dragon for a friend. Wonderful!Okay, so the dragon is invisible, but we do get to see him from time to time and he's quite a funny fellow too! But, there are a lot of other films out there who love to insinuate that there'll be a dragon somewhere in the movie; Red Dragon, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Enter the Dragon, The Last Dragon and the list goes on. But guess what? No dragons!When will Hollywood learn that they can't keep cheating the movie going public, with blatant misnaming of their films? Imagine if I'd taken my 8-year-old son to watch Red Dragon? Can you imagine how upset and traumatised he'd be, when by the end of the film there was no dragon? Come on Ridley Scott, if you want to see how to make a proper dragon movie, I suggest you watch Pete's Dragon and learn something about filmmaking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of my favorite films from my youth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: PETE'S DRAGON Rating: ***1/2 (out of 5)This is one of the favorite from my innoncent stage of being a child, along with some films like CLOAK &amp; DAGGER, FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR and, of course, THE GOONIES. Although MARY POPPINS is my all-time fav Disney movie, this film still has my merit. When I bought the film on DVD a couple of years ago (and it had been 6 or 7 years since I last saw it), I begin to see why it's been ranked as a disappointment and now totally ignored in the Disney canon. I'll begin with the performances. Singer Helen Reddy seems ideal in the title role, and her singing is absolutely wonderful...but in terms of her acting she is just OK. If anything, she certainly much better than most singers turned actresses (B. Spears is a perfect example). As Dr. Terminous, Jim Dale is a lot of fun---and seems to having fun---in his role, despite the criticism by many critics of his and his co-stars "tiresome mugging." However, he and Red Buttons are perfect on the level of as acting as turn-of-the century con artists (years later, Dale played The Duke in a version of Huck Finn for TV!). Then there is the always wonderful Mickey Rooney who, admittedly, mugs wayyyy too much, though at least he doesn't get annoying. Then there is Shelley Winters who, and I don't care what anyone says, is a genunine trip as Mrs. Gogan. Sure, she maybe doing little more than scenery-chewing, though she does do it well. Finally, last but not least is Sean Marshall as Pete. As for his character, he supposed to be the center of attention next to his pet dragon Elliott. My theory has always been is that it is too difficult to judge child actors, simply because they are young and experianced. If anything, he certainly looks the role, though it is true he cannot sing at all. Next, is the score and songs, which were both nominated for Oscars. I agree completely with an earlier reviewer, who said that they were good songs that were poorly staged. Most of the songs I actually love, and would sing to anyday. The music that opens up the film against a painted background of the setting is just wonderful. The first song, "The Happiest Home in these Hills" is great in introducing the Gogan family, and how much b.s. they are full of--lol, well, anyway, I love it...and the two dim-witted sons still make me laugh when they sing their dialogue. The song between Elliott and Pete is sweet on the surface, but it is the one I least like. I think the best song overall is Reddy's "Candle on the Water," which perfectly emphasizes how good of a singer she is. Then there are the three delightful numbers "Every Little Piece," "Brazzle Dazzle Day," and "Bill of Sale" (the funniest in my book). Also, one aspect of the film nobody has hinted on is the period detail, which I admit is minor, but for this film is impossible to ignore. The film is set in turn-of-the-century Maine, and everything down to the set to the costumes is absolutely first rate, and give the film a realistic atmosphere. The scene is the tavern, in particular, looks astonoshingly real. As for the animation, it wasn't anything new for the time (in comparison, this animation looks flawed next to MARY POPPINS and BEDKNOBS &amp; BROOMSTICKS). However, for the time at least, its still fine...in fact, its done by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, who later left Disney and did such wonderful films like SECRET OF NIMTH, LAND BEFORE TIME, and AN AMERICAN TAIL. Overall, I have to say that PETE'S DRAGON will always hold a special place in my heart along with all the earlier films I've mentioned (except for CROSSROADS, of course....my award for the worst film of all time, which I will always protest), despite its flaws. As for all the critics who panned then and now, all I'm saying is that if they watched this film as a child, I'm absolutely sure their opinions would be different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good music, flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young child, "Mary Poppins" was my absolute favorite movie. This film, as reported by many critics, was an attempt at capturing that same sort of live-action/animation fantasy. I would hardly call this movie anything but entertaining, however, I think trying to compare it to the earlier masterpiece that "Mary Poppins" is, would be unfair.One of the main problems with this film is the acting, it's way over-the-top, everyone seems to be mugging their way through the story, and the extreme close-ups of these goofy facial expressions do not help at all. Helen Reddy sings beautifully, and "Candle on the Water" is one of the loveliest songs to come from a Disney film, but her acting also falls into the "overdone" category. Mickey Rooney also overdoes it, but is fairly decent. The school teacher, however, is insufferable.Second problem with this film is the staging of the music numbers, they look like they were choreographed for a school pageant. The "Bill of Sale" number is a "good" candidate for this, and so is the "Room for Everyone" scene. They are enjoyable songs, they are just poorly staged.In essence, this is a decent "family" film, that will probably appeal to kids a lot more then adults. The music is good enough ("I love you too" and "It's not easy" come to mind), it just goes on a bit too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Mary Poppins, not Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and not much of anything worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having found success in earlier films such as Mary Poppins and Bedknobs And Broomsticks mixing live action with animation and musical numbers, Disney foisted this tale of a boy named Pete(Sean Marshall) and his Magic Dragon on us. They should have stopped with Mary Poppins. Pete is a young lad who's run away from the family that bought him(I think it may have been from an orphanage, details are sketchy)as their own personal slave. It seems Pete has taken up residence in a cave with the animated Dragon, Elliot(voice by Charlie Callas), who is also Pete's best and only friend. Only Pete can see the dragon because Elliott has this habit of making himself invisible whenever anyone but Pete is around. This also helped conveniently cut down on animation costs as well. I mention this because Pete's Dragon is also notable for the film that caused Don Bluth(animation director), who wasn't too pleased with the restraints of working on Pete's Dragon, to leave Disney and strike out on his own. Then again it could be Elliott just wants to hide from this mess of a film.Nora(Helen Reddy), owns and operates a nearby lighthouse with her father Lampie(Mickey Rooney). Her husband, you see, has been lost at sea, so owning and operating a lighthouse is a good occupation for her if he ever decides to journey home. The lighthouse also enables songwriters Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn to throw in a song, so when Nora sings "I'll be your candle on the water" we are aware of it's double meaning. Cute.Of course, Nora finds Pete, and takes him into her home. Since she can't see Elliott, we know that Nora will spend most of the film thinking Pete's invisible dragon is an imaginary playmate made up by Pete because he has no real family. Stir into all this the villainous Dr. Terminus(Jim Dale), who believes there is a dragon and wants to capture him for his own nefarious purposes. If that's not enough villainy for you, there's the Grogans headed by Lena Grogan(Shelley Winters) who "owns" Pete and comes looking for their lost property. Having made her big screen debut three years earlier in a silly role as a nun in Airport 75, Helen Reddy tries to extend her acting chops in this film. She doesn't extend them very well, and the less said about it the better. As for her vocal talents, Reddy managed some good pop hits with songs like I Am Woman, Delta Dawn and Angie Baby, but her range is limited, and the awful songs she is given here only emphasize that fact.The adults aren't the only offenders in this film. Sean Marshall as Pete demonstrates no acting ability, no singing ability, and isn't cute enough that we care to let those deficiencies slide by. In a duet called "Boobob bobbob bob (I love you too)" that he sings with Elliot, Elliot clearly overshadows him even though he's only required to sing the "Boobob bobbob bob" line.Jim Dale is wicked enough as "Dr. Terminus" I suppose, though he plays it way over the top which seems to be a prerequisite of being a villain in a Disney film. You'll find his shtick more than a little annoying after a few minutes of his screen time.There are a few good things in this film. The animated Elliot steals every scene he is in. When he is on the screen is about the only time the film comes alive. The film would have been a lot more fun and immensely more whimsical if they had done away with the invisibility bit and given the dragon more screen time. Since the film is called Pete's Dragon, one would have thought that would be a no brainer.Shelley Winters seems to be having a lot of fun as the villain Lena Grogan. Next to Elliot, she gives the best performance of anyone associated with this production. She also has the best musical number in the film with a little ditty called "Bill of Sale". I would have voted to can Dr. Terminus and just have the film center around Lena and the Grogans as being the villains. Mickey Rooney as Lampie isn't too awful, playing the kind of outlandish character Mickey Rooney can do well. Let's face it, if it were Mickey Rooney playing Mickey Rooney we wouldn't have minded because that would have been infinitely more fun than anything else going on in this debacle. Maybe Lampie should have told his daughter Nora to get out of the house and get a life before the film started. Red Buttons as Hoagy, plays the same Red Buttons character he plays in almost every film since Sayonara. Everybody else in this film is there for window dressing.As for the rest of the musical numbers, besides the ones I mentioned earlier, they are painful to listen to and sit through. How painful? They would make a Barney song sound like Beethoven. If you have a child watching this film, they'll be entertained during those few moments when Elliot is on the screen. When he is not, they may become restless and revolt. Come to think of it, that about sums it up for adult viewers too.My Grade D     </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pete's Dragon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the iconic image of the little ginger kid and the title character, I do remember at one time seeing a couple of clips as well, it was just a case of watching the actual early Disney animation and live action film, from director Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, One Million Years B.C.). Basically, set in early 20th century New England, nine year old orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) has escaped his abusive adoptive parents, the Gogans, led by the nasty mother Lena (Shelley Winters). His only true friend is the one who found him, a large green, purple haired and winged fire breathing cartoon dragon named Elliott (the grunts and roars voiced by Charlie Callas), who can become invisible. Pete and Elliot have travelled to Passamaquoddy, Maine, an ocean front harbour town, filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans and wary townsfolk, and they try to find somewhere to settle, the invisible dragon obviously causes some destruction and gets Pete into trouble. Eventually Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy), the daughter of drunken lighthouse operator Lampie (Mickey Rooney), he in fact is the only one to see Elliot, the little boy is allowed to live in the lighthouse, while the dragon hides in the beach cave nearby. The little boy's arrival causes a lot of rumours, rioting and gossip in the town, and this ignites the interest of visiting con artist Dr. Terminus (Carry On's Jim Dale), who believing the dragon superstition is keen to get his hands on it for profit. There comes the point when Elliot is indeed brought out in the open and exposed, even captured, while Pete's horrible adoptive parents the Gogans come back to snatch him. In the end the bad guys get what they deserve and are driven away, Elliot is no longer seen as a monster, Pete settles happily in his new home with Nora and Lampy, who did find out about the dragon, but Elliot has to fly away to find another child in need of help. Also starring Red Buttons as Hoagy, Jim Backus as The Mayor and Grease's Jeff Conaway as Willie. The performances are very cheesy, as is the story, and the mix of animation with live action, which was at the early stages, so looks dated, and the songs, though mildly catchy, are also lame, Elliot is certainly a lovable cartoon character, but overall the film sort of fails to bring any magic for the family, a fair but disappointing part-animated musical fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

		<shortDescription>Misspelled AGAIN!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER! It NEVER fails to cheer me up! EVERYONE should watch it AT LEAST once. I can't BEGIN to describe how much I love it- so let it suffice to say that I've completely burned out 2 VHS copies- with a third on the way out- due to repeated viewing over the years! (No, I'm not making this up AT ALL) Now, for my comment: Elliott the Dragon is my biggest hero, so I guess that's why this next thing bothers me so much: everyone seems to misspell his name! If you look at the beginning credits and most promotional material, t's spelled "ELLIOTT". But, a lot of people (kid's book authors, this site, and even Disney on occasion) spell it "ELLIOT"! This is my ONLY problem related to this otherwise awesome movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Folks, out of all the movies I've ever seen in all my years, "Pete's Dragon" has got to be the best. The character acting is superb, it has the best sound-track musically and lyrically that I've ever heard (Great job to Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn). The only thing that even possibly left something to be desired was the animation, but you must take into account the time the movie was made. Great entertainment for people of all ages! 10 stars, A+++++++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting may be completely hammy, and the songs not nearly as good as other Disney favourites, but I still reckon this is a great kids movie because it's got a giant cuddly green dragon in it. (yay!) The animation is great (from what I remember) and everybody seems to be having fun, so why carp? Youngsters will most likely be entranced by this, as I was when I was little. A family favourite, and one that I'm getting all nostalgic about and wishing I could watch as I type this... !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT MOVIE NO TALENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's a delightful plot, delightful score, and very cute, good for children of all ages... But...Helen Reddy could use a few lessons in acting. She over acted. She can sing...not act. Mickey Rooney, he was a redeeming part of the movie. Red Buttons...i can't stand him!...he is good in some parts he plays...but he was...eeergh!...Jim Backus...i wanted to strangle him!!...Shelly Winters...ruined her movie career...and Sean Marshal (little pete...) 1. barked his way through the songs...and no wonder we never heard of him again in any other movie...he couldn't act. It was family fun with no talent. Of course it was made when disney was at bankrupcy, but still a family classic. I would recommend seeing "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pete's DragonDecent Disney film made at the height of their corny, rapid film output of the mid-70s--when a lot of really bad "family films" were shipped out on to the market in an order to draw in mass amounts of cash. This story concerns the tale of an orpan who sees an invisible dragon that only reveals itself to the boy--until a wandering town drunkard (Mickey Rooney) catches a glimpse and sings about his sighting, too.Come to think of it, this movie is really, really bad. I own it and I used to watch it quite often as a kid--the songs are bad, the filming is bad, the villains are bad examples of poor acting (or is that good examples of poor acting?)...Still, enjoyable enough to recommend.***/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the worst film ever produced by the Disney studios.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My handicapped son, who is seven years old but has a cognitive age of approximately two years, has been asking to watch this movie every day for about the past two months, which is a good indication of the audience they reached, although I don't think they were aiming that low. The character of Pete is played by a boy who (a) is unattractive, (b) has no acting talent, and (c) has no singing talent. Helen Reddy can clearly sing, but her skills as an actress are minimal at best. The plot is thin and contrived. Jim Backus, Mickey Rooney, Shelley Winters and Red Buttons all probably did damage to their previously acclaimed careers by taking parts in this film. Jeff Conaway is probably ashamed of this early effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Poor Disney Offering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of THE CAT FROM OUTER SPACE I mentioned that that the Disney studio were chugging out a lot of rather poor family orientated movies in the mid to late 1970s and PETE'S DRAGON is another example What struck me is once again relatively poor production values . Watch 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA to see a Disney movie made by master craftsmen who love their art and compare it to this movie which feels like it was churned out in order to simply fill some Summer schedule .The film is too brightly lit for one thing and as for the cast .... well Mickey Rooney was a big name but that was when no one made movie in colour , equally Red Buttons had been appearing in not very good disaster movies while Jim Dale as a con man selling snake oil to gullible customers isn't exactly the most memorable villain seen in a Disney film . It should also be pointed out that a movie that has a friendly dragon seems doomed from failure from the start . Say what you like about REIGN OF FIRE but at least in that film we saw dragons do what dragons are supposed to do and that's burn people to death with their fiery breath . PETE'S DRAGON can't be described as being charming or innocent , it can only be described as naive and that's not a compliment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood memory!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well done film. It isn't quite as memorable as Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Bedknobs and Broomsticks, but it so deserves to be up there. The protagonist was very well portrayed by Sean Marshall,(despite the lack of singing ability) but my favourite was the animated dragon Elliot. The scene in the schoolroom was priceless. I absolutely loved Helen Reddy as Nora, the way she sang "Candle in the Water"(about her lover) was beautiful. Jim Dale was great and very funny as the quack Dr Terminus, but he has been better in the Carry on franchise. The most entertaining were Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney, and I mustn't forget the Gogans Shelley Winters must have had a ball making this film. The film has two minor drawbacks. It is a little too long, but also the songs while very pleasant to hear aren't as memorable as later Disney efforts, though Candle On the Water and There's Room for Everyone are classics. But I agree it is underrated. This film is an 8/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>
