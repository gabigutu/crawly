		<fullReview>A large part of Disney's triumph cannot be detected by the naked eye. His last animated film had been `Sleeping Beauty', which was the most extravagant and spectacular animated film of all time (excluding `Fantasia'). It wasn't a financial success. `101 Dalmatians', much less extravagant, was. In the two years between `Sleeping Beauty' and its successor there had been a revolution. The entire army of inkers who had carefully translated animators' pencil drawings into smooth, flowing lines were replaced by a machine that simply photocopied. This changed the character of animation so much that `Dalmatians' is almost the precise opposite of `Beauty'. Outlines are rough and black; the entire film looks decidedly drawn rather than painted, even the bits that are in fact painted; and the rich variety of colour of Disney's earlier films has been replaced with the stark white-with-black-spots coat of a dalmatian, with the occasional splash of startling red. The art directors were as determined to get the most out of the new technology as they had been to get the most out of the old technology. And it has its own quiet extravagance. A title promising over one hundred spotted dogs was (probably still is) the kind of thing liable to make animators feel faint. It couldn't have been done without the photocopier; and even so, getting spots to stay in the right place on a featureless white background is a huge headache. None of this leaps out an audience. We simply see a hundred adorable dogs.The story is simple, clean, civilised, and warm. It moves slowly but this doesn't matter. Preventing the film from becoming lethargic is Cruella de Vil. She can drive like a maniac through the snow, smoke a cigarette through a holder the length of a sword, wave her arms like a windmill ... yet she handles quiet determination and gritted teeth equally well. Character animation doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's any classic Disney movie that's less likely to be forgotten because of the modern Disney movies, this would be one of them. Part of the reason may be the live action version and its upcoming sequel. Skip those remakes and watch the real deal. The other part of the reason is because this movie is just so charming. Cruella De Vil is one of the more memorable Disney villains ever made. Romance abounds in this movie, and don't forget those adorable puppies. This may not have the animation or the big fancy songs of the moderns, but all that fanciness usually distracts from the story. Classic Disney always rocks, and this is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never have I loved any story like this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians is, no doubt, my all-time favourite story and also one of the greatest films I have ever seen. When I was small, I never got tired to listen to or to read the story, and because of thinking especially much about Cruella de Vil I very early noticed that in fact I like wicked characters. But, of course, the unforgettable dogs are best in the film. Because of this story I have loved real Dalmatians all my life and also thought that only the names of the film's dog figures are really suitable for Dalmatians. I have also read Dodie Smith's original story, and I was really glad that it's so much like the Disney film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most lovely films of all,1001 dalmatians is one of the classics from Disney that all people should watch. I was surprised to know that it was made in 1961,because I watched it for the first time in 1993 (I was 7) and it looked a modern cartoon for me,such as Lion King.Pongo and Perdita (a couple of dalmatians) and their owners Roger and Anita, are living happily and peacefully in their new home,until Perdita give birth to some puppies: Cruela,the evil friend of Anita, wants to do a new coat,using the little dalmatian's fur. She kidnaps them,and now Perdita and Pongo needs to save their puppies,before being too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved The Artwork!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film mainly for its drawings. It was a departure from previous Disney animated films in that it had harder-edged drawings instead of the soft pastels. I found the detailed sketches of the building to be fascinating. I could actually watch this film with the sound off and just enjoy the artwork.I actually saw this movie AFTER the 1996 live-action version with Glenn Close so I was familiar with the story. The only deviation was that there were more animals involved in the rescue of the puppies in the latter version.The narration was very good in the beginning and film is okay, nothing super. It lags in a few parts, which is the only complaint I would have. It certainly is a nice story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the movie that introduced me to dalmatians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 17th animated Disney classic is a less ambitious film comparing to earlier top Disney classics, but it is enjoyable enough anyway."Sleeping Beauty" nearly bankrupted the Disney studio. Perhaps because of this and also because other extremely expensive Disney classics were initially a failure, the Disney studio needed to make cheaper animated films in a try to recover financial costs. This one is cheaper and more simple in everything: story, designs, sceneries/backgrounds, colors, picture quality, characters, etc...It certainly doesn't have "that" magic and attention to detail which makes Disney so legendary, but it doesn't deserve to be judged too hardly. It isn't Disney at its worst, very far from that! The animation is great as usual on Disney and this one also has lots of fun, entertainment, danger, adventure, darkness, classic humor and even some touching and depressing moments. The happy ending is another sign that it follows the Disney tradition.Although the artwork is way cheaper-looking than in the most artistic Disney tales, is still in a good and acceptable level in many ways. It is basically the same artstyle we see in "The Sword in the Stone" and "The Jungle Book", for example. Simple and not extraordinary, but not as poor-looking as in "Oliver &amp; Company". Just for the record, I consider "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" a better movie than "Oliver &amp; Company", "The Jungle Book" and "The Sword in the Stone".However, there is one thing which the artwork of this movie is brilliant: a brief scene which we can see the sparkling stars at night, with an impressing resemblance to the fabulous artwork of the best Disney classic ever, "Pinocchio".The characters are very enjoyable in general. The most enjoyable are Roger, the Colonel, Sargent Tibs, Pongo, Perdita and those adorable 99 dalmatian puppies. All of the puppies are adorable.By the way, the first time I saw dalmatians was in this movie. I didn't know that dog breed before, but ever since then they became one of my favorite dog breeds. They're such cute spotty dogs! I love dalmatians since I was a kid.Returning to the conversation about the characters, Cruella DeVil isn't one of my favorite Disney villains and I personally don't consider her one of Disney's best villains, but she's one of the most eccentric and original. I like her red car, nevertheless. She's got a beautiful and fine automobile! Jasper and Horace are Cruella's sidekicks and they are funny in many moments. They are just as cruel and heartless as Cruella, but more comical. There are several hilarious moments with these two guys. It's so funny how the dalmatians (with the help of other animals) make their lives miserable, considering that they definitely deserve it. This only accents the comical effect.Pongo, Roger, the Colonel and Sargent Tibs are equally humorous characters. In fact, Sargent Tibs (the cat) has always been one of my favorite characters from this movie. He's funny, smart, clever, well-mannered and cool.This movie takes place in England. It takes us not only to London, but also to other places that must be not very far from London... or maybe they are. But wherever they are, those are all nice places, at least judging by the movie's perspective.About the soundtrack, it is generally great too. "Cruella DeVil" is a delightful song (a perfect song for Cruella DeVil, describing her in perfection). "Dalmatian Plantation" is a catchy one. "Kanine Kruchies Jingle" is a lovely and cute song."One Hundred and One Dalmatians" had a "remake" in 1996, but as a live-action version. The live-action version/remake has amazing similarities to the animated version, being very faithful to it. Although the live-action version is okay, I rather the animated version with its simple and old-fashioned charm.Overall, a charming Disney classic which might not be their best, but deserves its attention too. It also features the voice talents of many well-known Disney artists.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Hundred and One Dalmatians" is among my Mouse House's favorites.And Cruella is second only to Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent ,as far as the villains are concerned.Cruella's character is so vile that my wife gave that nickname to her wicked headmistress (who really looks the part)! Pongo,Perdita,their offspring and all the rest have a long way to go before tasting the quiet joys of home.Very good scene in the park when the two dogs fall in love and make their masters do the same.And during the long walk across the snow ,aren't they nice all these puppies? I did not like the remake (and its abominable follow-up) Cruella is a cartoon character and even a superior actress such Glenn Close was bound to fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>101 is the magic number</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Dodie Smith's friends once looked at the novelist's dalmatians and said: "Those dogs would make a lovely fur coat!" It's this single phrase that inspired Mrs. Smith and led her to write what was about to become her most popular and influential novel: "The Hundred and One Dalmatians". I don't know who was this friend and what was he/she doing for living and what was his/her name. But whoever this person is, he/she inadvertently changed popular culture forever. This shows at which point the simplest sentences can become monumental.Smith's novel was adapted by none other than Mr. Americana himself, Walt Disney. "101 Dalmatians" was Disney's first work of the '60s, the last decade of his life, but it doesn't mean that old age slowed him anyway.It is Disney's 17th animated-feature film and 7th focusing on furry animal characters. It's the story of Pongo and Perdita, a dalmatian couple, whose puppies have been kidnapped by Cruella De Vil, one of the most cruel and diabolical characters portrayed by Disney and his crew. Cruella collected every dalmatian she could, so she would be able to make a fur coat from them. But Cruella didn't plan that Pongo, Perdita and a whole network of animal companions would unite their efforts in order to win back the puppies and get home safely.As previously said, Cruella is by far the most interesting character of the lot. We never know how Perdita's mistress Anita became friend with Cruella, but we guess that Cruella's not interested in Anita: she only wants the dalmatian. Cruella has a scary look. She looks like an old witch. She doesn't respect anyone and she's only interested in her desires. That's what makes Cruella one of the creepiest and most interesting villains of Disney's universe.But my predilection goes to the puppies themselves, which are absolutely adorable and charming. My favorite scenes are those where Pongo, Perdita and their 15 puppies watch a western on TV.We don't get to know each one of the 15 puppies, but some are highlighted. There's Patch, who is probably the group rebel, with his black spot on his eyes and his love for hard words; there's Rolly, whose favorite phrase is: "I'm hungry" and there's Lucky who looks like the precursor of Generation X, because he always got the nose on the TV.The viewer is also introduced to the dogs' own communication system: the "twilight bark", which looks like a large-scale Chinese whispers game. This is wildly imaginative and it's one of the most fascinating aspects of the dogs' own world.Outside of the dalmatians, my favorite animal characters are the "military shed": a horse called Captain, a sheepdog called Colonel and, last but not least, Sgt. Tibbs, a courageous cat who is assigned to save the puppies from their countryside prison.Cruella is sided by two stupid and running-gag henchmen, Jasper and Horace. These two foolish guys provide most of the film's laughs and they're not too overshadowed by their horrible boss.Animation, even if it doesn't break any ground, is excellent, but not perfect. Victorian houses of London are well pictured, but it's not exceptional. It's the animals who are the best drawn. The dalmatians weren't easy to draw, because they don't have a uniform fur. Artists had to draw them white and then adding the black spots over and over, during 70 minutes of screen time. It must have been a monumental task.Every classical Disney aspect is here: drama (the main plot), comedy (Horace &amp; Jasper and some secondary/tertiary events), fearsome elements (Cruella), suspense (Sgt. Tibbs' puppies rescue) and action (the climatic car chase). And let's not forget some potentially symbolic images, such as the dalmatians' long walk in the blizzard and the puppies watching TV.Also a thumbs-up for the music, and especially for the Cruella's title song. The soundtrack is mainly made from jazzy parts and it's very adequate.Another feature, another classic. Walt Disney never deceives us. After this film, we became more familiar with two elements, both from the title. First, the number 101, when heard, is almost instinctively associated with this movie, and so is the dalmatian dog itself. It's another success that both parents and children will like for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lion King has always been my favorite Disney movie. But One Hundred and One Dalmations is on my top 5. The movie is filled with so many laughs, you have to love it. Pongo is a lonely pup with his lonely musical master, Roger. When he spots two lovely women(one being a dog of course), he sets Roger up to meet the woman. They hit it off immediatly as well does Pongo with his new mate, Perdita. When Perdita has puppies, Perdita's(her master) old friend, Cruella DeVille wants to buy them from her. But only to make the puppies into a new fur coat. When Roger refuses, Cruella kidnaps the puppies. Pongo and Perdita go out to save the puppies. And the rest is left for you to see for yourself.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hundred and One Dalmatians is a classic Disney film from the company's brilliant late 50's and early 60's period. The film has a number of Disney high points including fantastic supporting characters, great suspense and a heavy atmosphere. The film can be considered another excellent feature for the legendary company.The story sees Dalmatian Pongo and his 'pet' Roger find love with two of their kind in Perdita and Anita. When Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies the cruel Cruella De Vil wishes to buy them but is turned away. With the help of her bumbling henchmen she kidnaps the puppies in order to make fur coats of them. Its then up to Pongo and Perdita, with the help of a collection of animals, to find the puppies and return to London. The story is simplistic but wonderfully executed. It has so many great elements that make it such an engaging movie, from the way dogs view their owners to the many escape attempts. The characters are superb. Rod Taylor is perfect as the very likable Pongo who we see as brave and caring as the film goes on. The relationship between him and Perdita is better than most as they do care for each other. Cruella is one of Disney's stronger villains, it's the way she is so crazed and manic but always trying to be stylish that makes her so entertaining. Jasper and Horace are brilliant henchmen, supplying lots of fun comic relief. Their so inept and clumsy that there's never a dull moment with them. The team of the Colonel, Tibbs and the Captain are brilliant. The Colonel is lovingly silly and Tibbs is so likable due to his never say die attitude. Roger and Anita are good as they are presented as a normal pleasant couple. The other dogs that help out like Danny the Great Dane and Towser are nice, solid supporting characters.Though the rougher animation isn't to everyone's taste it does fit in really well here. The way it looks fits in with the gritty darkness of London and the wilds of the countryside, it's a nice change from the angular style of the films preceding it. When you consider the amount of puppies they had to animate it's an impressive feat. It is certainly one of the Disney's most suspense filled and exciting films. It's not very often that a Disney climax has a car chase and it's an outstanding sequence. The whole search for the puppies has a brilliantly tense feel and watching Cruella search for them has some really well made strong moments. This leads on to another highlight which is the atmosphere the film has. The whole 'twilight bark' is a great piece and the scenes where Tibbs and the Colonel investigate the matter have a really effective dark feel. These are underlined by the superb visuals of a gloomy London and the demonic looking 'hell hall'. The music is also very memorable as it contains the usual solid score Disney does, as well as the fantastic songs ''Cruella De Vil'' and ''Dalmatian Plantation''. The other effective scenes include a humorous look at how dog owners are similar to their pets and the what's my crime TV show that's funny. This is one of Disney's most entertaining movies filled with many great elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians feels heavy and dark for an early Disney film. I am not sure whether it was trying to raise a message on animal cruelty or were they just trying a good tale and just using it as a backdrop, but either one it's still something that is worth seeing.This story is based on a children's story by Dodie Smith and written for the screen by Bill Peet. The film's premise is that there is this scary lady who wants to steal Pongo and Perdita's children and turn them into coats. Peet has done four films with Disney and those are Cinderella, Sword In The Stone, 101 Dalmatians and Peter Pan. Out of all of these films, I felt that his best was Peter Pan but his darkest is 101 Dalmatians. This film gets into a dark place once Cruella De Vil is introduced and some children may find her frightening, when her eyes went red it was one of the most frightening things Disney has ever done. Once the stealing of puppies begins, I started to see the themes of genocide and imprisonment. After when they escape it becomes like a survivalist film. It feels similar to world war 2 films like Schindler's List and Defiance which I admired. The beginning of the film feels a little misleading, as it feels positive like something from Lady and the Tramp but then that adds to that shock you would feel when this woman comes in with evil intentions and a horrible personality. It was pretty funny though when the film starts and thinking that the narration is from the human's perspective but rather from the dog and we find out through calling of the human from Pongo, a "Pet".This film is directed by Clyde Geronimi and Hamilton Luske. These guys have directed some well known Disney classics, in particular Lady and the Tramp, and so there is some expectations with this film. I think with their experience from Lady and the Tramp, it was easier to animate and needing not to do a lot of research in animating it. The third director for this film is Wolfgang Reitherman. This is his first feature length film for Disney and I bet he was the reason that this film had that edge to it, whether it's the music or the animation. This is the guy who used Jazz and R&amp;B for his future Disney flicks. I feel that they did a decent job. I can't say that this film will be the most remembered but with a memorable villain and edgy feel to it, it is deserving of its status as a Disney classic.The animation of this film is a start of a string of films that uses a dirty look. The animation is not as clean as compared to Cinderella or Lady and the Tramp but it is effective as it captures urban London so well that it won't be so much of a distraction. The dalmatians are drawn very well but can get rather repetitive, then they did half to draw 99 dalmatian puppies. The animators have improved from their last Disney efforts, Sleeping Beauty, as there is more personality in the characters, especially the people. They drew Cruella very menacingly and so uniquely in the film. She stands out when she is in the scene, especially near the beginning when standing next to Roger and Anita.The music of this film has a mix of both orchestral and jazz. It feels like a bridge between their orchestral dominated film, Sleeping Beauty, and the film soon to follow, The Jungle Book. I enjoyed the songs that Roger plays as it feels catchy and edgy. I like that the film did not decide to become too melodramatic with its score and dis something a little more simple.This film is not Disney's top classic but it is fun and something different from the films that Disney usually puts out, aside from Alice In Wonderland. I suggest let your child be a little bit more mature or have seen at least a decent amount of Disney animations before watch this. I recommend it to anyone but don't get your hopes too much on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both less AND more impressive than my nostalgic childhood memories of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, next to mythical, archetypal blockbusters like "Bambi" and "Snow White", "Dalmations" comes off as a something of a lightweight. Seeing it for the first time in 30 years, I was startled by how much looser and rougher the animation was than my childhood memories; I was also somewhat disappointed to discover that only 4 or 5 of the legion of Dalmation puppies had any personality or even any speaking parts. And a few of the plot elements seem kind of "squirelly" to my adult sensibilities - (the young couple can barely make ends meet but they have a live-in cook and maid? Roger makes it big with a song that opens him for the biggest no-contest defamation suit in the history of England?)But I don't really care. The movie won my adult heart all over again with its charm, its sense of intimacy, and a thousand little atmospheric touches, like the "Twilight Bark" and the "What's My Crime?" TV show and the way Cruella De Vil slammed her car down the lanes and around corners like a woman possessed. The directors and animators were obviously forced to take shortcuts and economy measures (due in part to the sheer number of puppies on the screen at some points) with both the artistic process and with the plot in order to meet the budgetary guidelines of the "new era" of animation. Even so, you can tell they labored mightily to create a mood, an atmosphere, of a world seen from a canine point of view, even down to camera angles, sound design and character design. (Cruella, for instance is too physically ugly to actually exist, even as a cartoon character, unless you take Pongo's and Pertita's fear and loathing for her into account.)My conclusion: this may be a smaller, less lush and less epic Disney animation project, but it still reflects the utmost care and dedication of some very talented people, and it still holds up very well indeed to my grown up sensibilities. It was a great pleasure to see it again. "Bambi" is still my all time reigning champ of animated movies, but "Dalmations" in this context, could easily be thought of as Mickey Mantle to "Bambi's" Babe Ruth. It's a classic whose likes we are not likely to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruella is what makes this film so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always thought that the animation and story of "101 Dalmatians" were actually a bit weak. After all, a crazy lady who wants to steal puppies to make them into a coat ISN'T especially deep. And, the xerox process they used in this film did make the movie look a lot cheaper than the exquisitely animated films of the 1950s. But what makes it very good and well worth watching is the character Cruella De Vil. Her voice work by Betty Lou Gerson was just fabulous--and very obviously inspired by Tallulah Bankhead. Her mannerisms, style and voice were Ms. Bankhead all the way--but with a wonderful insane quality that made a horrific act (slaughtering puppies) so ridiculously comical that it was watchable and fun. Otherwise, this film would have been seen as cruel and just awful. Plus the "Cruella" song was a hoot--with great lyrics and a perfect accompaniment to this horrid character.The bottom line is that I nearly scored this one a 9--it's awfully good. But having the sub-standard animation brought it down a point. Enjoyably sick and funny--even for adult audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers*"One Hundred and One Dalmatians" is one of my favorite Disney films. I first saw it when it was brought back to theaters in 1991 when I was four years old. It was the first movie I ever saw in theaters and I loved it. In fact I became obsessed with this movie and dalmatians for a few years after I saw it. My favorite dalmatian puppy is Lucky. He is adorable. I also like Patch and Rolly. My favorite part of the movie is when the puppies are trying to escape from Cruella De Vil's house. That part is great! I also like the part when the puppies are rolling in the ashes trying to disguise themselves.I suggest all Disney fans to see this movie because it really is a great movie.

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmations is my number one most loved Walt Disney movie of all time. I remember watching it for the first time with my sister and my dad and we thought it was very special. The scene where the puppies just kept getting born with more and more of them all over the kitchen and house was so exciting to us we couldn't believe how many puppies had been born. The dog characters were all great and we loved the couple who owned the dogs and the maid. Cruella de Ville is the best Disney villain of all time in my opinion too she is so evil and insane and gets a great come upping in the end. Her henchman are pretty funny and scary at the same time too. Any kid would love watching this Disney movie it is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most hilarious animal movies I have seen from the old school of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmations (the animated one NOT the 1996 version with Glen Close)was Disney's 17th Animated Classic and tells the tale of two people who meet in a park by Roger's dog who fell in love with Anita's dog and the two owners get married. Later Pongo's female companion has babies but when Anita's former mate Cruella De Vil wants them for herself she refuses and Cruella hires two dimwitted men to steal them while Anita and Roger aren't there.From here on it there's laughter in almost every scene. From that wide- eyed cat who helps them escape,to the part where Cruella looks rather wacky looking(if you watch it near the end there's a scene that will scare the crap out of yeah)and the dimwitted robbers getting kicked by a horse was hilarious.The animation is really good yet not as good as lets say Aladdin as its done in pencil drawing and you can clearly see the circles on the charcther design. Also Anita and Roger remind me of the new characters from the upcoming movie Frozen but still is 101 Dalmatians my all time favourite NO but was it good YES.Im giving it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

A wide range of urban and rural British accents is featured, and not for nothing: the story begins in a posh part of London and then moves into the English countryside. As the voices change, so does the art. The spotted motif of the title sequence feels appropriately modern (in the 1960s sense of the word), while London's parks and art deco flats are reminiscent of the interwar period, and scenes of foggy downs and farms are pleasantly rustic. The story itself, hinging as it does on a plot to murder and skin puppies, is rather sick, but that sort of darkness was once typical of great children's stories. The lead canine roles here are weak, especially the overly-demure wife and mother Perdita, but this allows the supporting players in the underground military organization known as the "Twilight Bark" to steal the show. Members of the Twilight Bark seem somehow familiar, as if we have seen or heard them in half- remembered war films. For example, the movie's lone cat, Sergeant Tibbs, is reminiscent of many screen portrayals of stoic, sensible middle- echelon British soldiers. It is an indication of the film's intelligence that Tibbs is not villainized just because he happens to belong to a different species than the chief protagonists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is GREAT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"101 Dalmatians" is a great movie from Disney. I read the original book by Dodie Smith and its sequel, "The Starlight Barking", I watched the animated series, watched the animated sequel "101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure", and watched the live-action films with Glenn Close as Cruella. The story of "101 Dalmatians" is Pongo and Perdita meet up in a park along with their owners, Roger and Anita, the two couples fall in love and eventually they get married. Later, Perdita is expecting puppies. The only person to hear of this is Anita's old schoolmate, Cruella De Vil. On a dark and stormy night, the puppies get born, totalling up to 15 Dalmatian puppies. Cruella shows up in time and wants to buy the puppies from them, but Roger turns her down. Cruella then vows to get even on them. When the puppies are older, Cruella hires two incompetent crooks, Horace and Jasper Baddun, to steal the puppies. They succeed in doing that. All the humans fail to find the puppies, but luck comes when Pongo gives out the "Twilight Bark" to every dog in London for information on their missing puppies. It finally reaches the Colonel, a sheepdog, and his companion, Sergeant Tibbs, a cat. Pongo and Perdita then set off to find their children. Then, we learn that Cruella stole the 15 puppies, along with 84 others, with the motivation to turn them into fur coats. Now, Pongo and Perdita have to get the puppies to safety before it is too late. I love this film 100-percent. I'm waiting for the Platinum Edition DVD to come out. It comes out on March 3rd next year. My favourite characters are Pongo, Perdita and Cruella. I like Pongo and Perdita because this story is about them saving their children from death. And I like Cruella because, thanks to this film, she has become one of the most popular and also one of the most iconic villains of all time. And I am very interested in this story because it's all about good vs. evil as the pups try to outsmart Cruella. It's a real lovely film from Disney, and I'm giving it 10/10. And this is enough talk for me. I enjoyed it and I can't wait for the DVD to come out. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's greatest classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that this film is 46 years old now - it's better than most of the stuff we get nowadays. The animation is great for its time - people won't be poking fun at its quality - EVER. It is full of fun characters - the dogs themselves are actually an adorable bunch who you actually care about rather than a faceless mass that you just watch blankly without any real cares. The adventure is fun to follow along with, and even though the town of London seems a little unreal in this film, it's only the dogs we care about after all. But the best thing about this film is the villains. Cruella DeVil is one of animation's greatest villains - as testified to by her evil looking house and her nasty looking car. The two thick henchmen (I've forgotten their names) are amusing to watch when they're clumsily pursuing the dogs - there is nothing about this film that could have been done better. It manages to touch, amuse, captivate and make the audience care about it - it should be at least an 8.0 rating on IMDb. Although I guess some films just don't receive the credit they deserve, this film being one. And though I did have trouble trying to figure out if the film was set in the Victorian era or the 60s, it's still an amusing watch, and the dogs have such a good story to tell that you won't care anyway. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy Cruella, Disney just Excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is perhaps ironic-or hardly-that 'One Hundred and One Dalamtians' was made during the year I was born. It certainly had a profound influence on my childhood. Almost 'living' in the cinema with other films, I don't think I saw repeated showings as much as this. I once went to a matinée of it with a friend and his family. I sneaked behind under a seat while it was still dark in the cinema to see it through again. Needless to say, when leaving, the family wondered where I'd got to. Such antics can only be attributed to one character, Cruella De Ville. Disney's talents, and those who were the voices, just oozed with the villains, (and esses). Eleanor Audley's voice is fantastic as the wicked Maleficent in the 'Sleeping Beauty,' but nothing quite matches the combined animated effects with the voice of Betty Lou Gerson. I guess it was this that held a peculiar obsession and fascination, and I suppose, addiction. I love the scenes which portray Cruella's crazed outbursts and demented frustrations. Her reaction when Roger refuses to sell the puppies: 'you wait, you'll be sorry. You fools! You idiots!' And her crazed frustration when finding Jasper and Horace haven't done the dirty work; grabbing the liquor from Jasper and flinging the bottle and its contents in the fire, and blasting the door shut after clenching her hands with, 'I'll...l'll call the police. DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!'causing the plaster to crack, are some of the most memorable. 'You know, I think she means it Jasper.' Not to mention the crazy car chase at the end. The colonel's muddling, 'Puddles' and 'Pingo,' is always quite hilarious. Apart from the English diction in these voices which isn't emulated any more, the film will always be a timeless classic and first rate for any student learning British English. I couldn't agree more with the commentator who said that Cruella's character animation 'doesn't come better than this.'Disney was getting better and better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in my mind there are only 2 versions of this movie, the good one (1961) and the bad one (1996 ? ) this is a great classic when I was a younger i would watch it and then rewind it, all day! it is great. the main characters are Pogo Perdita and their 15 pups which grows to 100 pups!and of course there is their humans, "pets" according to Pogo, Anita and roger. there is a newer version that isn't animated, but it ruins the movie, b/c Pogo is supposed to be able to talk and the animals all work together to save the pups but when they use real dogs and humans it takes away part of the fiction, glamor, and fun of the movie. i grew up in the 90s and didn't realize until today that it was made in the 60s. its not made w/ "todays" kind of animation meaning it is all done w/ a computer and tries to look like real life, in my opinion it is better than any new animated movie. also boys and girls alike enjoy this classic. there are some movie that you watched in your childhood and go back and watch them and think they are not that good, but no matter how old or young you are its a guarantee you will like this movie. its wholesome, speaks of family, loving, and taking care of each other and it has a few good songs, that are lots of fun to sing along to, and even when you haven't seen the movie in a while you will remember the words and hum the tune, a song you just cant forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a small town in London, music composer Roger lives with his pet dalmatian Pongo. They later meet Anita and her dalmatian Perdita. Roger and Anita fall in love and eventually get married. They later discover that Perdita is to give birth to 15 puppies. This is good news to Anita's school-mate Cruella DeVil, who wants to make them into a fur coat. When the puppies are stolen by Cruella's henchmen, Pongo and Perdita must set off on a journey to rescue the puppies before it is too late.This is a smart and entertaining film based on the excellent children's novel by Dodie Smith. When first released in 1961, it was a huge box-office success. And today, 45 years after it was released, it still entertains audiences. The characters make the film likable, from Pongo, Perdita and the puppies to the flamboyant Cruella DeVil. Listen for excellent performances from the voice cast, with Rod Taylor playing Pongo, Betty Lou Gerson playing Cruella, and many more. Even though there are not a lot of songs, they are still entertaining, such as "Cruella DeVil" from "Dalmatian Plantation". Overall, this is a must-see for Disney buffs, or animation buffs.Recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS, in my opinion, is a pure Disney classic. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Pongo (voice of Rod Taylor) and Perdita (voice of Cate Bauer) set out on their mission. If you ask me, Cruella (voice of Betty Lou Gerson), Horace (voice of Frederick Worlock), and Jasper (voice of J. Pat O'Malley) were truly devious. If I were Pongo or Perdita, I'd probably do the same thing they did. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has done it again. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney classic to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Disney Fare Anyone Will Be Sure to Spot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Our story beings in London, England in a small two-room flat lived Dalmatian dog Pongo and his "pet" Roger Radcliff. Roger was a musician, always thinking up new songs and then trying to play them on his piano. He didn't seem to mind bachelor life but Pongo was desperately lonely. He looked for a mate for he and his pet. He finally found the perfect match: an attractive woman and an even more attractive Dalmatian dog so Pongo got Roger to walk him to the park where this couple had gone. The girl Dalmatian was named Perdita, Perdie for short, and the woman was Anita. Roger and Anita didn't hit it off right away, Pongo caused them to fall into the river, but soon they were laughing and getting friendly with one another, so were Pongo and Perdie. They were soon all married and move into a bigger place. One afternoon, Cruella De Vil, an old schoolmate of Anita's, pays them a visit. She was expecting the Dalmatians to have a litter of puppies and since they weren't born yet, she would return. She wanted the puppies for her own evil purposes. See, she was in to fur coats. Especially coats made from dog fur! This year's design was spots! The puppies soon arrived. There was a total of 15! Well, 14, one almost died on them, but Roger revived it. They named that one Lucky. Cruella returned and tried to buy the puppies but Roger stated they were not for sale and put his foot down. Cruella was furious and vowed revenge. Life was going along fine for a while, then one night while Pongo, Perdita and their pets went for a walk, leaving the puppies alone with Nanny, two bumbling crooks Jasper and Horace Badun (on Cruella's pay roll), broke into the house and snatched all the puppies. The humans did everything to try and find them, but Pongo and Perdita contacted all the dogs around London to get news. The word reached The Colonel, a sheepdog at a farm, and his assistant, a cat named Sgt. Tibs. Tibs finds the puppies at an old mansion where Jasper and Horace awaited Cruella. They were told to bump off the puppies then skin them, but Tibs and Colonel acted quickly to let them escape. Pongo and Perdita were reunited with their puppies just as winter hit! Jasper, Horace and Cruella were hot on their trails...even though Pongo tried to cover them up. They met a Labrador and Pongo got the idea for them all to roll in soot to travel incognito as Labradors, and it worked...Until snow dropped on them, revealing their spots. They quickly boarded a moving truck bound for London. Jasper, Horace and Cruella follow it on separate roads, crash into one another and roll off a cliff, leaving Cruella furious that she had been foiled. Pongo, Perdita and the puppies returned home to Roger and Anita with a big surprise: they had rescued 84 additional puppies from the Baduns bringing the total to 101 Dalmatians! Roger declared they would move to a Dalmatian Plantation! What a sensation! A pretty good Disney film. It's always been one of my favorites! There was a live action version in 1996 with Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil and Jeff Daniels as Roger. It was O.K., not perfect. I hear they're making a sequel to the animated movie: 101 Dalmatians 2: Lucky's London Adventure. What is with Disney and this onslaught of sequels? It's getting ridiculous! But anyway, I strongly suggest you stick with the originals. 101 Dalmatians sparked a new form of animation used in many future Disney movies like The Jungle Book, Robin Hood, The Rescuers, The Aristocats and more. But anyway, I recommend 101 Dalmatians! Be on the look out for dogs from Lady and The Tramp in this movie too!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it falls flat at some points, 101 Dalmatians has always been a favourite of mine. Maybe it is the scratchy style of the artwork that does it, maybe the delightful personalities of the characters, or maybe the entertaining villains. Who knows? Based on the brilliant book by Dodie Smith, it's the familiar tale of the cute little dalmatian puppies escape across the wild and snowy countryside, in a desperate race against time.Full of imagination, humour, and just plain charm, this is a must see for all Disney fans. No, it's not Walt's most thought-provoking effort, but it's way better than what modern Disney can think of nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My two-year old is obsessed by this movie. He can't get enough of the unsanitized, unpasteurized fare that Disney used to put out before political correctness drained all the fun out of their movies in an effort to make them suitable for McDonald's action figure tie-ins.Watching "101 Dalmatians" is like entering a time machine to the days when all the men drank Miller High Life and all the women fetched the men their beers. The animation is so rough it's good; more than a few times you see shots where not everything was colored in. And that's freaking cool. Fast, cheap and out of control.I mean, what other Disney flick has criminals drinking beers, everyone smoking, gunplay, violence and the lead human character living a quote-unquote "bachelor lifestyle" when everyone knew that "bachelor lifestyle" in 1961 was code for "alternative lifestyle"? Yet Pongo-Boy finds his "pet" a woman, and the ensuing childless marriage is blessed not by the pitter-patter of little infant's feet, but the stench of wet dog smell.This has to be the funniest Disney movie I've seen: Kanine Krunchies and the little dog watching the Western TV show and trying to peer around the corner's of the screen to see where the bad guy is hiding is worth the price alone.Even with all its merits, the movie must go back "into the vault" for 28 years. By then, my two-year old will be able to appreciate it in all its perverse glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic story about two young people who meet while walking their dogs and marry. Instead of having a baby they are gifted with these lovable dogs who have to escape the clutches of an evil fashion designer Cruella Dvil before she can turn them into coats. The style isn't perfect, looking like a picture book illustration, in most scenes. Jasper and Horace hardly change face positions and even have continuation errors when it's attempts. Cruella is a fabulous eccentric hippy who has her uptight personality you love to hate.While the plot feels rehashed a bit, it was a first of it's kind to show parents concerned about their kids, greed and raise awareness about the fur industry. Add in the suspenseful ride and it's an edge of your seat thriller on if they can survive the odds and make it home before the crooks or the weather gets to them.Not my favorite Disney film or the best they have to offer, but it was entertaining for the most part. Get it for the kids to enjoy with cute puppies that talk.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really underrated film that should be held up to the standards of Beauty and The Beast or Pinocchio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book so I can't compare it to that though, frankly, that makes it easier to review and possibly more entertaining. But enough of this introduction, let's get on with the review!I want to start off by expressing the great ideas this film comes up with. I love that they have the dogs consider the humans as their pets. And the way they go about explaining it is really good. If it were to be made now they'd probably just have a dog saying "Hi I'm a dog! You may think that this human I'm with is my owner but no! He's actually my pet!". I actually cringed typing that. My point is that they treat you with respect and don't ever talk about it as if we were supposed to think they were pets. That's good writing. However the two main characters, Roger and Anita are only brought together because Roger's dog sees them and thinks that they should get together. Despite this they don't lack any good chemistry and are one of Disney's best couples.Now the animation! I've already said that I really like this modern sketchy style, it gives the movie it's own feel and almost even some grit to it. Doug Walker said something along the lines of that he personally doesn't like it and that it doesn't look like the final product, I disagree though understand where he's coming from. Though I also feel it helps with some of the character designs, the dog called colonel looks really cool, due to the sketchy style but I think you can tell that I'm just building up to talking about Cruella De Vil.This bony little old woman under a massive fur coat is really unique idea is one of, if not the best Disney villain designs. She's one of the best Disney villains and has such an iconic presence and voice. Her entrance is amazing. She bursts in the door, with her own theme tune playing from up stairs. The opera length cigarette holder, that puffs out green smoke is also a really noticeable element about the character.As I mentioned before Cruella has her own theme tune and unlike other Disney movies where people just break into song for no apparent reason, here it makes sense. Roger is a songwriter and is working on a melody, once Cruella shows up at the house he applies lyrics to do with her to the song. They even add to this idea more when we hear is song being played on the radio and his wife refers to it as "his first big hit". This, sadly, is the only song in the movie.Now onto the pups. The puppies are the most important part of the movie, if they didn't exist this movie really wouldn't have it's plot. So how do they turn out? The puppies are probably the worst part about the movie because since there's so many of them, the writers couldn't have gave them all distinct personalities. Thankfully they never come across as annoying or stereotypical and that's good enough. It would probably take too much time to flesh all of them out anyway.Something surprising about this movie is it's vast amount of suspense. Through a lot of it I was very worried for these characters and as critics would say "on the edge of my seat". The characters go through so much that when you do get to the final happy ending, you've worked for it and in this movie that's done better than in any other film I've seen, in my opinion. However once you do get to that happy ending you kind of feel underwhelmed, or at least I did. I feel they could have went that bit more happy but what I got I'm happy with. This film is definitely worth giving a watch and, despite what some critics lead you to believe, has a lot of harsh elements. If I had to pick something that disappointed me, that I haven't already mentioned, is that it was too short and I didn't get enough. Though I suppose that's more of a compliment.Thank you for reading and goodbye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely fabulous movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past 20 years, whenever someone asks my favorite Disney movie, I have always said Peter Pan. And I still do. But every time I watch this movie I love it even more. The animation is different than any of Disney's other movies, making it very intriguing. I love the story, the characters and the humor. The TV that the dogs watch is hysterical and there are so many other fantastic lines and jokes. I have always loved this movie. I even have a stuffed dog named after Pongo. And though I will always have a special place in my heart for Peter Pan, I wonder if, as I get older, this movie will replace it as my favorite. While other Disney movies (such as, at times, Peter Pan) are entertaining for nostalgia's sake or when you're in the mood to feel like a kid, this movie is entertainment for all ages. Smartly written, cleverly animated and all around entertaining, 101 Dalmatians is a movie you will love in every stage of your life. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hundred and One Ways to Amuse Me? Probably not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hundred and One Dalmatians is another Disney film that I don't get the rating for. A 7.2 is fine, but I have no idea how 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes could give this a Fresh review. I was slightly engaged at some parts, such as Perdita and Pongo acting aggressive towards Horace and Jasper, but the majority of the film is bland and nearly repulsive to my tastes, having adult humor that doesn't work (I was almost cringing when Roger called Pongo an "old rascal", as it was much too swift for Disney to have gone in that direction when it wouldn't be developed until the next 11 years), action that, if I was just seeing it like a TV show, would not keep my attention to the screen, a below average use of cuteness to convey something else (it's just present on its own), and songs that are above average but still forgettable. If you like the Dalmatian breed, then you can disregard parts of this review (I am more of a Bichon-Poodle fan), but this is otherwise a movie that you should give lots of thoughts about before seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great fun and absolute blast to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's any classic Disney movie that's less likely to be forgotten because of the modern Disney movies, this would be one of them. Part of the reason may be the live action version and its upcoming sequel. Skip those remakes and watch the real deal. The other part of the reason is because this movie is just so charming. Cruella De Vil is one of the more memorable Disney villains ever made. Romance abounds in this movie, and don't forget those adorable puppies. This may not have the animation or the big fancy songs of the moderns, but all that fanciness usually distracts from the story. Classic Disney always rocks, and this is no exception. I liked this film mainly for its drawings. It was a departure from previous Disney animated films in that it had harder-edged drawings instead of the soft pastels. I found the detailed sketches of the building to be fascinating. I could actually watch this film with the sound off and just enjoy the artwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, Laid-Back &amp; Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Disney film I first saw as a kid and I liked it. Several years later, I watched it again and I still like it. It's a charming film with a laid-back quality and more contemporary look and feel than any of the Disney movies that came before it.The animation certainly doesn't compare to the animation in the Disney films that came before it such as Sleeping Beauty and Lady &amp; The Tramp, but it works well enough on its own. The characters (both human and animal) are drawn with more of a sharp and angular look and the backgrounds are drawn with that same kind of style as well.The opening credits sequence is fun to watch even though it mostly consists of using Dalmatian spots as a series of visual puns, but the sequence does help to get you to look forward to the rest of the film.The songs are a nice delight to listen to, despite that this movie isn't really a musical like most Disney films, but the two songs (Cruella De VIl &amp; Dalmatian Plantation) are catchy and kind of memorable. The rest of the music works fine with the movie. My favourite part is during the opening credits sequence.Cruella De Vil is a really fun villain and a lot of that comes from the way she's drawn, animated and voiced. She is probably the best character in the movie. The rest of the human characters are fine, but nothing outstanding. The main Dalmatian characters are fun to watch (especially during the scene where they're watching TV or when they have to disguise themselves as Labradors to get past Cruella's evil clutches) and most of the other animal characters have some fun moments as well. The plot is a bit out-there, but it works fine for a family film.Overall, 101 Dalmatians is a charming, laid-back and entertaining movie that has been enjoyed by kids and adults in the past and should continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straitforward Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians is a straightforward animated classic whose brilliance is in its details. The plot is an uncomplicated kids story--a young couple own two dogs that have dalmatian puppies, but an evil friend of the couple wants the puppies for an unclear purpose. It turns out that she wants to kill them and use their coats for a fashion experiment, and after the couple decides not to sell her the puppies, she sends a couple of hired goons to kidnap them. The goons do their job, but the puppies escape and the chase is on.101 Dalmatians sounds like a kids' movie, and it is a kids' movie, but like all good Disney movies, this film resonates with adults as well. The key aspect is the villain, Cruella de Vil, who is one of those people that you occasionally run across and wish you hadn't. Cruella is quite simply an evil person, someone so self-involved that she really does not care about others at all. What makes her effective is that we know people like this, but sometimes we want to believe that they do not really exist. The film makes us confront them, makes us deal directly with a person evil enough to kill 99 helpless puppies for a simple fashion conceit. The effect is creepy enough to really make me feel for this family of dogs whose objective is only to live happily, and whose handicap is simple human greed and conceit. It is really very powerful.And what about child viewers? Oddly enough, they will not be traumatized by this movie as much as they might be. The reason is that the battle between good and evil is treated with real gentleness, and the good characters have great moments in the film. A scene where it appears that one of Pongo's puppies is born dead is treated with tremendous sensitivity. Another scene where Pongo and Perdita agree to take along another 84 orphan dalmatians rather than leave them behind for Cruella also is one that makes us cheer. Also, much of the conflict is treated with a comic flair that puts us at ease with some actually quite disturbing situations, and seems to deflate Cruella's menace. The result is that this is a great movie for kids. Evil Cruella is not sugar-coated but is put in proper perspective, a really impressive feat for a movie like this. At the same time, the movie is a thriller, a love story, a critique of the social class system, and an adventure film. It is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior spiritual successor to Lady and the Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What really bothers me about this film is the fact we had just gotten a much better film about animated dogs from Disney. It was called Lady and the Tramp, and it was amazing. As such, a tale about even more dogs, this time without the warmth and the charm of the previous ones, just didn't feel as successful.Problem number one, Pongo and Perdita. I just don't get these two. They're supposed to be the main couple, the heroic parents who save their children, but I don't get anything from them. Their owners, Roger and Anita, are a great couple, one of the best of the so called beta couples Disney has ever done. But the main couple. Nope, don't work.The second problem, the copying. A lot of this movie's plot lines and scenes have been copied from previous Disney movies. Mainly from Lady and the Tramp. It's not really all that noticeable if you don't watch them back to back, but if you do, it's kind of blatant. Plus the animation style utilizes a lot of copying because of the new Xerox method of animation that allowed them to animate all those individual dalmatian puppies without going stark raving mad. Which I give them props for. This movie looks noticeably rougher when compared to the ones before it, but it is a very impressive technical achievement anyway.The first good side, the villain. Cruella De Vil has since achieved almost legendary status as a Disney villain, and for a reason. She's petty, nauseatingly glamorous without any of the grace that usually goes with it, just one push away from cuckoo land and absolutely mad about fur even when not pushed. In a word she's memorable, even though her actual plan is really not that ambitious when compared to her brethren. She just wants a coat.The second good side, the music. This film has some great tunes, from the classic Cruella De Vil to the opening scene with its early 20th century London suburbia.As a whole this movie is something of an uneven package. It has definite upsides, but also equally as definite downsides. It is a very good film, don't get me wrong, great even, but only when not compared to other Disney films too vigorously. Still, definitely a classic children's film by any meaning of the term.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Classic from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hundred and One Dalmations (1961) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Delightful Disney classic has the evil Cruella De Vil trying to steal ninety-nine Dalmatian pups so that she can turn them into a lavish fur coat.It's funny but ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS is a film that I never really cared too much for as a kid but seeing it for the first time in probably fifteen years certainly made a world of difference because I never realized how fun and how extremely dark the film was. As far as characters there's no question that the film offers some of the most memorable in any Disney movie. This includes the two Dalmatian dogs and their fifteen pups as well as the two humans and of course there's the wonderful villain. All of these characters are given their own delightful personalities and it's rather amazing to see how much character they actually have.Another major plus is of course the animation, which is excellent as you'd expect. Add in a good tune and there are all sorts of wonderful elements here. Heck, I mentioned how great the main characters were but even the supporting characters are extremely entertaining. Another thing that the film has going for it is how dark it actually is. I mean, the plot involves cute little puppies being killed and skinned. You can't get much darker than that.ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS has wonderful characters and plenty of nice laughs making it a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a really fun film from Disney's Silver Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I like animated films like 101 Dalmatians is because they don't take themselves too seriously. Two other Disney films like this one, The Aristocats and Jungle Book, are, not so coincidentally, made by the same director and (mostly) the same writing staff. I'm unaware if other Disney films were also made by them, but this trio of films represents the most fun I've gotten out of Disney.101 Dalmatians opens with Pongo, bored to death, looking out the window, while his owner Roger, his 'pet', is composing at the piano. Longing for a mate for both him and his 'pet', he arranges for Roger to meet a woman called Anita and her Dalmatian Perdita. In typical Disney fashion, they get married before you can say Bob's your uncle. Perdita eventually gives birth to fifteen puppies. That's when Cruella De Vil pops her head around the corner and decides she wants the puppies' skins for a new fur coat. When Roger and Anita obviously refuse, she hires Horace and Jasper to 'dognap' them. Roger, Anita and the police are unable to find the lost puppies and so it is up to Pongo and Perdita to track them down with help from the rest of the animal kingdom.If there's one thing that pops to mind when critiquing 101 Dalmatians, it's the quality of the animation. I'm not too sure of the history, but it looks like it was financially impossible to pump too much money in the animation department. Backgrounds are sometimes monotone and lack depth. Several types of animations also repeat throughout the film, such as Pongo running (to the right) which is not only repeated once or twice, but sometimes even obviously mirrored (with Pongo running to the left). But these technical details are easy to forgive, because of the humor which is quite often of the adult kind. No kid watching this will ever see the horse and the dog from the barn as military satire.Also amusing is the subtext of humans being more like dogs than one might think. This is not necessarily new. In fact, it's about as old as Darwinism, but it's pleasant that we're not hit over the head with this message. There's no grand monologue on how humans must realize they are more animal-like than they'd like to think. Instead, it subtly reoccurs through imagery and dialogue. Pongo refers to Roger as his 'pet' multiple times. Also cute is when De Vil accidentally sprays Roger with ink, making him visually similar to a Dalmatian.101 Dalmatians and similar films like The Aristocats and Jungle Book represent Disney at its most humorous. Gone are the overtly grand moral statements ('when you wish upon a star'), something which 101 Dalmatians is not interested in. Instead, watching it feels more about having a good time. Consequently, this might not make it one of Disney's best, but the humor and its not-too-serious nature more than make up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heroic animals, funny villain, boring story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Walt Disney's 17th full-length animated feature film, a story where a litter of puppies, belonging to Dalmatians Pongo and Perdita, are abducted by the minions of Cruella De Vil, who plans on making fur coats out of the pups. As a result, Pongo and Perdita go on a mission to rescue their children.The actors did a nice job in voicing the characters and the animation, although not very vibrant and appeared washed-up, had a somewhat nice, jazzy feel to it. The characters were given their own personality and charm and I thought the banding together of the various animals and dogs to help Pongo and Perdita rescue their pups was a great act of heroism. However, the plot and story take a very long time to gain any steam and, aside from the rescue mission scenes, a large part of the movie was actually pretty boring. I thought the main human character, Roger, had the personality of wallpaper and the romance subplot was a little too sappy.The villains, though, were the highlight of the film. Cruella was crafty, sly and hilariously captivating, and is one of the few most interesting elements of the movie. The two minions, Horace and Jasper, were also funny.Overall, kids would probably like this movie more than adults, but I thought this animated version is a tad better than the live action version with Jeff Daniels.Grade C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"101 Dalmatians" is a perfect example of classic Walt Disney animation and storytelling. It has an air of elegance thanks to its English setting and characters. The unforgettable villainy and look of Cruella de Vil will forever be imprinted in the minds of children and their parents alike. It's a tale of family loyalty that cautions us to always be wary of other people's motives and greed. And of course kids will find the puppies cute as well.Dalmatian Pongo is tired of his bachelor-dog life. He spies lovely Perdita and maneuvers his master, Roger, into meeting Perdita's owner, Anita. The owners fall in love and marry, keeping Pongo and Perdita together too. After Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies, Anita's old school friend Cruella De Vil wants to buy them all. Roger declines her offer, so Cruella hires the criminal Badun brothers to steal them -- so she can have a fur coat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the financial disaster of "Sleeping Beauty", Walt Disney needed to save a few pennies on his next outing. Indeed, he even considered shutting down the animation studios altogether before he was rescued by the unlikeliest of machines - a photocopier. Armed with this new technology, Walt could rapidly reproduce animation cels at a fraction of the cost. There was, sadly, a trade-off as the quality of reproductions wasn't that great and left everything with a grainy black outline. This is why the original "101 Dalmatians" looks the way it does but it is a shock to the system considering the beautiful fluidity the earlier films contained. Combining this with the fact that the story and characters aren't especially memorable and it's perhaps not surprising that the film's one true lasting legacy is in the shape of the movie's legendary baddie.Lonely Pongo (voiced by the late Rod Taylor) yearns for some company for both himself and his owner, struggling song writer Roger (Ben Wright). After spotting fellow Dalmatian Perdita (Cate Bauer) in the park, Pongo contrives to get Roger to meet her owner Anita (Lisa Davis). After Roger and Anita marry, it isn't long before puppies are on the way and Pongo and Perdita become proud parents to fifteen puppies. But their happy home life is shattered by Anita's old school friend Cruella De Vil (Betty Lou Gerson) who has plans for the helpless puppies and together with bumbling crooks Horace (Frederick Worlock) and Jasper (J. Pat O'Malley), conspires to steal them. After the police turn up empty-handed, Pongo and Perdita realise that it's up to them to get their litter of puppies back.It isn't just the story which is barking in "101 Dalmatians". None of the characters really make much of an impact, meaning that the already-weak story hasn't much impetus to it and my attention often wandered during the film. The one exception is the delightfully devilish Cruella, who has become an iconic creation thanks to the wonderful performance by Gerson. The animation also helps - her cigarette's billowing green smoke and her grayish skin make her stand out from the others on screen. Looking at it, it would appear that most animators concentrated on the characters instead of the backgrounds. Some scenes use that horrible technique of simply colouring in sections of the background, giving the film a weirdly stark and indistinct feel. There just isn't as much colour or magic as there is in Disney's earlier films and it makes "101 Dalmatians" a difficult film to love.I realise that I might be in the minority but I prefer the live-action remake from 1996. Glenn Close can't quite match the manic madness of Gerson's Cruella (though she's still excellent) but in every other respect, that movie trumps this one. Real dogs will always be cuter than animated ones and Horace &amp; Jasper's bickering sideshow is also more entertaining. But this earlier film still has its merits and its fans - understandable if you've grown up with it. I just wished that it didn't look and feel as cheap as it does because with more effort and energy, this might have been one of Disney's classics. But it simply isn't on a par with the likes of "Dumbo", "Pinocchio" or the animated sequence from "Mary Poppins" and typifies the occasional laziness of the Disney studio. Even the most ardent of Disney fans will acknowledge that they have a long list of half-hearted films on their CV along with the classics and for me, "101 Dalmatians" is somewhere in between. I can understand why old man Walt wasn't too happy with this film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pongo was a carefree bachelor in London and then he decided that his pet Roger Radcliffe needed a mate. Pongo is a dalmatian. Then he spots Perdita walking with her human Anita. Anita's fur-loving friend Cruella takes a fancy to the 15 dalmatian pups. When Roger refuses to sell the puppies, Cruella hires thugs Jasper and Horace to kidnap the pups. They overpower Nanny and then hold up in a crumbling mansion with other dalmatian puppies. There are 99 puppies in total.Let's face it. Cruella De Vil is one of the more outlandish Disney villains. She isn't scary as much as silly. The movie opens with a fun rom-com story. I like the narration by Pongo. The movie stalls a little in the middle after the puppies have been stolen while the dogs haven't started on their search. It's a pretty short movie which is a good thing because it doesn't overstay its welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's 101 Dalmations is fine for kids. Whether it really holds up for adults I'm not sure - I actually haven't seen the whole film in quite a while. But it holds up, for what it's worth, in my mind as a fun spectacle for kids. There are so many Dalmatians, naturally, not all of them can get personalities. Most of them don't, really. The real focal point though is the villain - Cruella DeVille - and of course with villains like her, who needs strong heroes? She, and the actress voicing her, Betty Lou Gerson, are eating up scenery with the large fur coats and wild,crazy eyes. Even her design is creative and just a bit warped in that villainous way to hold up well; I still remember her driving in the climax and that being as memorable a set piece as any in the classic Walt Disney animation era (that is, before his death).And it's enough that the Dalmatians can get around with some direction - and some help of furry friends (the shaggy dog Colonel and the cat Segreant Tibbs, are very entertaining and funny supporting characters) - to get through the narrative. So that even if they aren't always as great as the villain, they have enough to keep things moving. The animation itself is not as 'polished' as the widescreen epic that came before it, Sleeping Beauty, but that's fine.More than fine; this is a cartoon, and it has some of the rough contours of the animation studio trying to find their way, and, usually, getting there. Apparently Xerox was also used to make copies of all the dogs, and there's kind of a hypnotic quality to the shots of them all running in unison, one after another after another. It's scratchy, and this would continue for a number of movies (Aristocats for one), but I liked the look - it's taking a chance on a different style, and it connects in the way to the high-velocity adventure style of the story.So, for the kids? Sure. For adults? Well, there's always Cruella.</fullReview>

The opening background and set up are wonderful. After that, however, the movie does feel like it loses some of its charm and substance as it then becomes a bit of a caper. Becomes more of a kid's movie the longer it goes on.Doesn't overstay its welcome though. Is just the right length.Animation is okay, for the time. Some of it feels a bit basic, but that might just be compared to the animation of today.Good voice work.

I personally like the art in this film - it has a dark or mysterious look and feel to it - so it's perfect for the story.The only thing I felt was missing from this movie was some catchy songs like most of Disney's film animations. This movie needed some jazz to spice it up just a bit (IMO).Want to make it a double feature?

		<fullReview>Due to the under performance of Sleeping Beauty, many changes were made in the studio, and they had to lower the budgets of their films, thus the Xerography process. Two years after Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians was the first film to be made in Xerography, and is considered the start of the Dark Ages to many people.The story is about a dog couple named Pongo and Perdita, who give birth to 15 puppies. An old friend of their owner Anita named Cruella DeVil comes by to attempt to buy the puppies, but when Anita's husband Roger refuses, she storms off and sends two men to kidnap them. They end up with 84 more puppies, and Pongo and Perdita has to rescue them before the 99 Dalmatians are skinned for fur coat.The characters in the movie are alright. Roger and Anita are your modern, quirky couple, Pogo and Perdita are your everyday dogs, and the Dalmatians are... Dalmatians. The breakthrough and the most memorable character in this movie is the infamous Cruella DeVil. She is so classy yet trashy at the same time, and is so rambunctious. Her sidekicks are the enjoyable bumbling fools.There is only one song in this movie called "Cruella DeVil". It has a sophisticated jazzy sound to it, and the score is decent.The animation is a HUGE change from all of its predecessors. The xerography process gives the film this trashy, lazy look that makes the film look cheap, so it is not as good as the other films. This is one of the few films where the xerography process looks good, but it is still not up to par with the earlier films.This film has your attention, even though the plot is not necessarily strong and the characters are not the most endearing. It is an entertaining, fun film which the family will like, even though it is not as good as the other films.</fullReview>

The design is very artistic and beautiful. 4.You got likable characters such as Pongo, Perdita, Roger, Anita, and of course, the 99 Dalmation puppies.5. The villains. Cruella De Vil and her two henchmen, Horace and Jasper, are inspirations of Katrina Stoneheart in the Pound Puppies TV Series and Flack and Tubbs in the 1985 Pound Puppies TV Special.6. The scores. The music is beautifully done.7. The chase. I'll admit, that was a very awesome chase scene and I wet myself when fear when I saw Cruella's menacing look on her face.8. The scene where Pongo and Perdita fight Horace and Jasper. Yeah! Give'em hell, Pongo and Perdita!! 9. The song, "Cruella De Vill". I learned how to sing that song after watching the movie.and finally 10. The 99 puppies. Could I help it if I found the 99 Dalmatian puppies adorable? Bottom Line: 101 Dalmations is one of the greatest Disney movies I have ever seen(Unlike the sequel and the live-action version of this movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'101 Dalmatians' (1961)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'101 Dalmatians' has all of the conventions to stand the test of time and rightfully claims it's place among the rest of the Disney classics. To me, it will always be one of my favorites, it is fast-paced, well-written and adapted from a book that I have never seen nor read. The characters are all colorful personalities that almost stand out as Charles Dickens-esque creations, and being that the story takes place in and around the city of London and it's neighboring countryside, it seems only fitting.The animation is nicely done, and the static backgrounds at times remind me of other 1960's animated cartoons, specifically 'Jonny Quest' or 'Birdman' which I also happened to love when I was a kid. And the opening sequence is definitely something to brag about, trippy as hell, and was probably inspirational to acid freaks and sober minds alike who were lucky enough to see '101 Dalmatians' when it was released in 1961.Disney villains are always something to be talked about, and '101 Dalmatians' is no exception: Cruella De Vil, voiced by Betty Lou Gerson, is one of the most memorable of all Disney villains, as are Jasper and Horace. The ending sequence is a suspenseful chase scene down a snowy mountainous road that still holds me in it's grasp today. Definitely stands the test of time, and definitely still worth watching.101 DALMATIANS -----9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Animated Disney Movie of Walt's Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, Disney's animated 101 Dalmatians was my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely loved it and watched my VHS copy of it so much that I could quote the movie from beginning to end. A couple of months ago I decided to re-watch the film, and I wasn't disappointed.Sure it no longer is my favorite movie, nor my favorite animated movie, or even my favorite movie in the Disney Animated Canon. But man this movie brought back a great nostalgic feel. There are many reasons why this film works. One is the villain, she is so horrible that you just want the dogs to rip her face off. The two hero's, Pongo and Perdita are also really good, as shown by the lengths they will go to save their children. The puppies are cute. And even the humans have enough charm for me to like them. And all the side characters are great too.The animation is really cool, for a movie made in 1961 it really looks like it was made no earlier than 1988. There are some really good jokes, the action scenes are fun, but the main reason this movie works is it's characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute and heartwarming puppy masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by Dodie Smith, 101 Dalmatians takes place in London where Pongo, a male dalmatian, is living in London with his master, Roger, a bachelor songwriter who has yet to sell his first tune. Bored with their single existence, Pongo arranges for Roger to meet Anita, a pretty young woman who just happens to have a female Dalmatian named Perdita. It is not long before love blossoms all around and a double wedding takes place. A few months later, Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies, much to the delight of Cruella De Vil, a wealthy, wicked former schoolmate of Anita's whose burning passion is to own a coat made of Dalmatian pelts. When she is unable to purchase the puppies, she has them "dognapped" and brought to her crumbling estate in the country, where 84 other Dalmatians are also being held captive. All attempts by the police to find the missing pups fail, and the desperate Pongo and Perdita appeal to the dogs of London, via the "twilight bark." Led by The Colonel, an indomitable shaggy dog and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs, all other dogs comes to the rescue and, aided by geese, cows, and horses, tracks down the missing puppies.Is 101 Dalmatians on par with earlier Disney classics a few decades later? You bet it is! The animation is extremely beautiful with cute character animation. The songs are catchy and well-executed I could hum "Cruella De Vil" for nearly five minutes. The voice acting is pretty good and the story is unbelievably touching that could bring tears to their eyes and mixes courage, humor, suspense, and bravery extremely well with very amazing chase scenes. 101 Dalmatians is Disney's masterpiece of the classic 60s and would recommended as one of the greatest works ever made. Happy 50th Anniversary, 101 Dalmatians!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>101 dogs' lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just last year, our family took on a pet dog for the first time so my perception of this Disney classic is obviously now biased. Seriously though, I'd have enjoyed it anyway. It's old fashioned family entertainment, easy to watch, but highly sentimental, of course. The animation was to my inexpert eyes, very good, particularly the tricky job of imparting personality to so any Dalmatian pups. Pongo and Hattie, the pups' parents could be Lady and the Tramp a bit further down the road while Cruella De Ville follows the models of preceding Disney female baddies, only with even more flounce and extravagance. Apart from the "Cruella De Ville" song, there's a distinct lack of musical interludes, which serves the purposes of the one-long-chase plot-line reasonably well. There's gentle humour as you'd expect and a tolerable running gag with the little pup that's forever hungry. I thought the best sequence though was right at the start when Pongo persuaded his owner to cosy up to Mattie's in the park, but the narrative manages to engage all the way through with the "human" characters also achieving sufficient degrees of personality to embellish the tale before the obligatory happy ending. You'd have to be pretty hard-hearted not to enjoy this delightful animation which I took pleasure in doing today for the very first time.</fullReview>

The live action 1996 version was good but no where near as good as this. The animation is wonderful and the characters are great I love Jasper and Horace they were wonderful and funny to watch I love their Truck I think this has to be one of the most forgotten classics and getting ruined by a sequel which Sucked.

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all Disney's post-Golden Age work, One Hundred and One Dalmations is my favorite, though it oddly features many of the things which bug me about Disney's other post-sixties work. The production methods are cheaper, the structure more focused on various side characters than its protagonists, and clean-up methods are noticeably sloppier. These problems were due in tandem to the financial failure of Sleeping Beauty and to Walt Disney's waning interest in the animated feature department as he delved more into his theme park (anyone who thinks Disney's input into the animated features is oversold because he didn't draw anything for it need only compare Disney's early work with that toward and after the end of his life to see how vital he was to the process).What makes it work regardless is its style. Disney brought in the input and influence of the great cartoonist Ronald Searle, and combined this with Ken Anderson's UPA esquire art direction (which had previously been explored in shorts like Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom). I'll also defend the xeroxing methods as having been an initially positive development, which allowed the animation to appear much more organic and handdrawn. Granted, it hinders believability at first, but it brings out a pleasing gutsiness and exciting individuality that I wish hadn't been wasted after The Jungle Book. For once, the human characters work as much as the animals, as the animators just the right balance between caricature and realism.Everyone is on their A-Game here, from John Lounsbery's comic animation on Horace and Jasper (an obvious influence on Sylvain Chomet) to Milt Kahl's consummate professionalism on Pongo and Roger (which isn't his most theatrical stuff, but does its job perfectly). As always, though, it's the villain who gets to have the most fun, and Marc Davis delivers his masterpiece with Cruella de Vil. Years later, Milt Kahl would respond to this marvelously bombastic work, which makes a brilliantly imposing use of her fur coat, with Medusa in The Rescuers. For a master like that, who considered himself (with good reason) to be the finest of Disney's animators, to attempt to one up a colleague is saying something. Not that this makes the animation better or worse, but I'll also point out that there was a single animator who worked for two years and the accuracy of the dots on the damn dags. The climax also remains one of the finest action scenes in American animation, a school of animation that I usually find far too conservative in terms of action.Rather than splinter the narrative with its many characters, I think they work with the design to make this film's world one of the most fun to watch in any Disney film. To me, it seems heavily influenced by Hitchcock, making this the only Disney movie of this period to feel a bit like a thriller (only instead of being framed, Pongo and Perdita simply lack the speech functions to go to the useless men who are only good for burning down Bambi's forest anyway). The ensemble nature prevents it from being truly Hitchcockian, but the cast of characters met along the way do recall films like The 39 Steps or Saboteur. Nearly every one of the characters are enjoyable and add to the narrative without intruding too much upon it (aside from the collie, who doesn't leave much of an impression other than his poorly animated fur). Captain and Sgt. Tibbs are especially ludicrous and delightful, in how they represent the most ragtag military unit imaginable. Even the entirely irrelevant television sections are great satiric fun.My one big complaint is that Roger and Anita wind up disappearing through the entire second and most of the third act, but it's not too big an issue in the long run, this being an animal story after all. Other problems are minor matters of animation. While I'll continue to insist that the Xerox methods had serious virtues, the reused animation is jarring (though in the case of this film, it's much more skillfully used than in later works that abused it).For these reasons, I love One Hundred and One Dalmations. It's witty, fun to look at, and highly entertaining. Alas, it also marks a final triumph before a steep decline, which didn't hurt the sixties work too much but crippled Disney in the seventies, and even the next few Disney films had their problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good piece of Walt Disney-produced animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1961 animated feature is one of the films that Walt Disney produced during the last decade of his life, and one of the Disney films I remember seeing in my childhood. I was born nearly twenty years after Walt's death, but saw many Disney movies as a kid, some of which were produced by him and others made by the company after he died. "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" was one of them, even though I didn't see this one as many times as I saw certain other Disney features during the 90's, and couldn't remember it as clearly. I watched it for the first time in probably over a decade in 2007, and again nearly three years later. I can usually expect these films to still impress me after all these years, including this one.A Dalmatian dog named Pongo lives in a London flat with his single owner (or "pet," as he is referred to), Roger, who plays the piano and writes songs. Bored with single life, the dog sees a female Dalmatian named Perdita with her female owner, Anita, walking by the window, and thinks this is a perfect opportunity to get himself a mate and Roger a wife. He gets his owner to take him for a walk in the park so they can meet the pair, and as Pongo planned, they both find romance. Roger and Anita soon get married, as do Pongo and Perdita, and with the four of them now living together, it isn't too long before Perdita gives birth to a litter of puppies, fifteen in total. Cruella De Vil, an evil former schoolmate of Anita's, wants to buy all the puppies and make a coat out of them! After she is denied permission to buy any of them, she hires two men, Jasper and Horace, to kidnap the litter! After the police fail to find the kidnapped puppies, Pongo and Perdita must call upon other animals to help them try and find their missing young before it's too late! The animation in this film is a little different from that of the previous Disney efforts. It was the first Disney flick to use the photocopying technique. This worked out well, as the animation here is very good, especially with the backgrounds, showing an animated version of London and memorable images of winter countryside. "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" also has basically everything that usually makes Disney animations entertaining for all ages. It's often funny, with scenes such as Pongo and Colonel (an old sheepdog) struggling to communicate via barks, and many gags involving Jasper and Horace and sometimes the way Cruella treats these two. Also, the characters are well crafted and the adventure gets very exciting at times. There are some weaker spots in the film, such as the overlong piano playing near the beginning and the rushed scene showing Nanny the housekeeper's reaction when she finds the puppies are gone, but there's no need to dwell on these petty flaws when the film as a whole is so entertaining. Overall, it's another good piece of animation for the whole family to watch.</fullReview>

It's dark plot is covered by it's sweetness, but that isn't a bad thing.All those little puppies are cute, especially Patch and Lucky. I like how the accents matched the location, which is London, England. A lot of films don't cut that these days.Anyway, even though it was sort of predictable, it's a really good movie that Disney fans should see. It's sweet, funny, and a woman(Cruella De Vil) who wants to make coat out of puppy skins, wow, one of the darkest plots I've seen. But don't worry, like I said the sweetness and cuteness cover that up. So yeah, Great cute film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bubblegum Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And yet another dog film brought to us by Disney. When it comes to animation, Dalmatians started a trend in Disney I don't really care for. Strapped budgets required some money-saving scheme, so in walked Xerox and with it the very scratchy-outliney style that lasted through The Rescuers. There's just something about that style that bugs me- perhaps it suggests a lack of refinement and finishing. Anywho, it is what it is, and despite my predisposition, I did love the elegance of the dogs- they always felt wonderfully sleek and fluid. Surprisingly, there are very few songs. In fact, there is only the infamous Cruella De Vil and a short blurb at the ending. I guess the extreme popularity of Cruella more than made up for the lack of other songs.When reviewing this film, I feel I must draw at least some upon comparisons to Lady and the Tramp. They were made so close together, yet appear so radically different. You can see the radical changes in Disney really start to break through around 1960 (it happens again at the end of the 80s). Once again, we are dealing with a dog's point of view, but for some reason it does not feel as entirely faithful to that point as in its predecessor. There is just a little too much focus on the human characters- the dogs begin to run into danger of stepping the boundary of cartoon-animals-that-talk land, instead of being purely animated characters (that trend only gets worse from here).What keeps this film from getting a higher score is it's not as easy to get plugged into as some stories. Being more of an adventure film than a love story, Dalmations just doesn't leave that much impact on me. It was suspenseful and well-crafted, but it never gripped me with meaningful relationships or outstanding characters or charged lines. Not to say that adventure films are inherently bad, but outside of spectacular sequences or plots, they are harder to invest in. And Dalmatians simply didn't offer me anything investable.So in the end, Dalmatians is kind of like a piece of bubble gum. I never really crave it, but it's fun to get as a novelty once in a blue moon. And after 10 minutes of unsuppressed bubbles, I spit it out and it doesn't cross my mind again. It's good for a pleasurable throw-away afternoon, but has little use beyond that.Quote of the Film:-I live for furs. I worship furs! After all, is there a woman in all this wretched world who doesn't?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holds Up To Repeated Viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always considered this one of Disney's lesser efforts, with Cruella DeVil being it's saving grace. One of the great movie villains of all time, she seemed to be the life of this story. However, after my two year old daughter became obsessed with several scenes, I found that I was able, after watching it over and over, to appreciate many of the little details.101 Dalmatians is the story of a family of puppies who are kidnapped by an evil fur-loving heiress who wants to make them into a coat. It's a fairly simple story, and not everything about it is entirely novel. The climactic car chase, for example, doesn't really have much to it when you break it down. Most of the characters are pretty bland, in contrast to the outrageous Cruella.Yet, I find myself appreciating these attributes, having grown tired of every children's movie since Aladdin showcasing at least one smart-alec, pop-culture referencing sidekick to plant the story firmly in the age of irony. It is refreshing to return to a time when we didn't have Eddie Murphy or Nathan Lane doing hyperactive voice-overs filled with in-jokes meant for the adults.In addition, I like the visual style, which other reviewers noted came about through a process meant to finish the film more cheaply, and which would be used for nearly twenty years of Disney movies. I especially enjoy the detail in the London street scenes, but I also like to watch the way the characters move, at times almost breaking out of the two-dimensional plane. Watch as Anita tries to walk around Roger while he is singing about Cruella. He jumps to the side to block her, and you feel the depth of the room better than you expect you could. There are also some great facial expressions (my favorite being the exasperated Anita as Roger descends the staircase at the reprise of "Cruella DeVil"). Throw in a couple hidden references (some characters from Lady and The Tramp and some older Disney cartoons), along with a score that's fun to whistle, and I find that I don't really mind watching this one over and over. The animated sequel, 101 Dalmatians part 2, offers some laughs for fans of the original by bringing back some of the little details, such as showing Cruella's reconstructed car, and employing Thunderbolt and Kanine Krunchies as plot devices. However, comparing the new movie with the original, you can see how much has changed in the expectations for family entertainment. I get the idea that as long as movies are animated and don't contain anything outright offense, there will be people who praise it as decent children's viewing. Disney deserved his success because of the care he put into his movies--not just the look, but the story, the feel, the characters, what audiences would take from it. (For a jaw-dropping example of just how much thought went into a story, listen to one of the extras on the Bambi DVD where you "listen in" on some of the planning sessions Disney had with his creative teams). Pixar seems to be the only ones doing anything that comes close to this today. That's why they deserve their success, too.</fullReview>

My favourite character is cruella devil and no artist ever drew her better than the brilliant Marc Davis. The voice was provided Betty Lou gerson who did a much better job at it than Susanne blakeslee and April Winchell , i think Betty Lou gerson was so amazing that she literally made cruella steal the film!!!!!

		<fullReview>This film is beautiful, and superior to the 1996 live action version. The animation is just beautiful, and I delighted in seeing those puppies's tails wagging. Those puppies were very cute, and a lack of any voice overs in the 1996 version was sorely missed. The scenes like the Twilight Bark added a sense of poignancy to the well-written story.I also want to say, I absolutely love the book by Dodie Smith, and I am 16. Another high point was the villain Cruella DeVil(voiced to perfection by Betty Lou Gerson), who was truly diabolical in every sense. The dogs, Pongo and Perdy were very lovable, and their scenes with the puppies were often very touching. Supporting characters like Tibbs, Captain, Colonel, and of course Jasper and Horace were very well done. The songs, were not as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but at least they were tuneful. In conclusion, a beautiful and entertaining animated film, that is underrated in my opinion. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: An irresistible Disney classic. It's probably a bit strange to say this 1961 Disney animated movie as one of their best animate films in the Golden Age of the studio. Still, I ask no apologies. 101 DALMATIANS is a sweet, clever and splendidly entertaining animated adventure and, in my opinion, one of the very best films in their classic era. But lets face it! Although I took a fonding of Disney's classic animated films, some of them (PETER PAN comes to mind) are extremely overrated. So far as I've seen, only FANTASIA lives up to the term "classic", but then again, I haven't seen them all. But even if I did, I'll always have a space in my list of favorites for 101 DALMATIANS. Not only do I find it one of the very best Disney films, it's also on of the very best talking animal fables ever to hit your theaters.One of the aspects of the film is its villain. With the exception the Evil Stepmother and Maleficent, DALMATIANS' Cruella DeVille (voiced by Betty Lou Gerson) is an outrageous and colorfully written villain, and yes, the mention of her name brings in wonderful memories. But, although Cruella is one of the finest aspects of the film, there are other pleasures to behold. Mainly, the clever portrayal of its talking animals. With clever voice acting but mostly due to much more clever writing, the animal characters here don't just talk for our fondness, they talk with precise and clever speeches. The animal characters are far more intelligent and colorful than its human counterparts, but I guess that's what they meant to do. In fact, sometimes throughout the film, I can almost see a sort of human personality among all of the animals, be it cats, dogs or the dalmatians, one and all.The animation has its flaws, and the energy level drops at a rather low point midway, but the film never failed to cheer me up. Colorful characters, beloved animation and no lack of energy help make this little Disney film a big delight. Now, if your still looking for an apology when I say 101 DALMATIANS is one of the best Disney movies ever, your probably better of not reading this review in the first place. I make no apologies about it, 101 DALMATIANS is terrific, if not flawless, entertainment. Bundle up the kids! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Disney's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get the spoilers over with then! As most people will know, this movie is based on the book by Dodie Smith. And a lot of changes were made from the book, but I'll come to that later. Anyway, basically the story goes that a male dalmatian, Pongo, finds both himself and his 'pet', Roger, a wife/the equivalent in dog-world. Anyway, he spots Anita and her dalmatian, Perdita-and of course they both get the girl (or dog?). Perdita soon gives birth to fifteen puppies-but Anita's old friend, Cruella DeVil has her eye on their beautiful spotted coats, and hires two men to kidnap them. Pongo and Perdita then set out to find the puppies and save them from being made into a coat-but Cruella has also got her hands on other puppies too, making 99 in total. And the parents have to get all 99 back to London, while being chased by Cruella and her henchmen...To be honest, I adore the original book. And, as much as I do like this movie, it doesn't really compare. For example, in the book the mother of the puppies is Missus-Perdita is another dog found by Anita to help Missus feed all her puppies. When Pongo and Missus go to find their puppies, Perdita stays in London to comfort their 'pets'. The relationship between Pongo and Missus is the focus of the story (apart from the main plot) which is not really explored in this movie. And there were only 97 puppies, another dog (Captain?) who (if I recall correctly) is Perdita's long-lost love, is also adopted by the 'pets' at the end of the book, making 101.Of course, I'm not going to lower the rating of this movie just because it isn't faithful to the book. My "problem" with this movie is that it doesn't feel like the other Disney classics. To put it bluntly, it feels rushed and, at times, forced.There are only three songs, unlike most other Disney movies, which I feel were only put in because it's a Disney tradition. In my opinion, this movie would have worked fine without any songs at all. I don't mind the songs really-they just feel like an afterthought in the context of the movie. "Cruella DeVil" is very catchy, while the "Kanine Krucnhies Jingle" and "Dalmation Plantation" are easy to pass over and forget.The animation, as with most Disney classics, is excellent. I have no problems from that angle.The human characters didn't seem to have any real thought put into them, with the exception of the villains. Roger had some promise at the beginning (writing songs about romance hen he apparently had no experience, being so awkward with Anita, decidingly not liking Cruella from the start), but was quickly shoved into the background. with the exception of him standing up to Cruella over selling the puppies. Anita was just utterly bland (she meets Roger, gets married, then spends the rest of the movie whining about Cruella, the puppies and Perdita), Nanny was hardly on screen and when she was, it seemed as though we should sympathise with her (when Jasper and Horace break in, when she's crying about thinking she can hear the dogs barking)-but she had just appeared after Roger and Anita's wedding, with no introduction or anything. In my opinion, the relationships between the human characters should have been properly explored.Cruella DeVil steals the show easily. She comes across as being somewhat psychotic, and you immediately agree with Perdita-she is a threat to the dogs in the movie. The continuity with this character, at least, Way brilliant-she is over the top and eccentric, before (literally) going over the edge. Jasper and Horace provide a lot of the comic relief, but are also interesting-Horace appears to be more clever then he thinks, but Jasper (the self appointed brains of the duo) constantly puts him down for his thinking.As it's late at night, I think I shall now conclude my review of this movie. Although I did enjoy it, I did find that it was lacking-the relationships between characters were not fully explored and I was not particularly happy with many of the characters. But overall, although it does not stand up beside classics such as Snow White, Bambi or even The Lion King, 101 Dalmations is a very entertaining movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>charming Disney although lacking songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians is classic Disney in every sense of the word, giving each little puppy a characterisation and making us involved in the plight of Pongo and Perdita and their search for their stolen family.Cruella de Vil is evil personified, a smoke-breathing, wild-eyed monster looking for new ways to make fur coats. No animal is safe around her! Dodie Smith's book comes to life after a long journey in production and is well worth the effort. Despite most of the songs written for the film being junked before release, this film manages to enthral both children and adults alike, and is still better than the two live-action versions which were released in the 1990s.Funny, charming, beautifully animated ... and timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Disney Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmations is perhaps the Best Disney film ever made. The story, characters, animation, detail, colour and music was spot on. I mean who doesn't love this movie? Cruella De Vil is definitely one of the best Disney Villains of all time. She's wonderfully evil and cruel. Skinning puppies is quite a ruthless plan which can scare audiences. We can easily see that the animators have out a lot of work into this film. The voice talents were cast perfectly. Betty Lou Gerson nailed it as Cruella.101 Dalmations is a film which should be remembered and treasured forever.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got through watching the new 101 Dalmations DVD. I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, watching it at the movie theater. It's a very cute movie but i'm confused about something. It wasn't what I remembered it to be. For some reason, I had pictured all these Dalmations inside a fire station. I could see all the red fire hats and all the dogs riding the fire engine. Obviously I must have this movie mixed up with something else. Does anybody out there remember the movie I'm describing? I could have sworn it was 101 Dalmations but there was nothing even remotely close to a fire station. What movie am I confusing this with?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie as a kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Disney's last animated film made when "Uncle Walt" was still alive and in good health. First off, I love the way the story actually tried to stay true to the source material, unlike, unfortunately, many later Disney films.Just a side note here and a pet peeve. If you have a child that loves this movie, get them the original book by Dodie Smith, NOT the books Disney makes. If it's one thing Disney does that I cannot stand, it's taking real works of literature and making not only an animated version, but their own "book version". Ick.As for the artistic style... some people on this board are way too young to remember, but the cartoon style of the late 1950's early 1960's took a sharp turn toward the abstract, and realism was frowned upon for years. It's no wonder 101 Dalmations looks different from most other "old school" Disney films. Honestly, they got away with as much realism as was accepted at the time in the graphic design and art community.This film is very well paced, with lots of wit and style and well written characters. Cruella is one of the great villains, and the puppies are adorable. I loved this as a kid, but even as an adult I can see that it works on many different levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The superior version, but Glenn Close's Cruella was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pongo is a bachelor living in a London apartment whose pet Roger needs a woman. He searches for just the right mate for Roger, and after several tries discovers a woman with a Dalmatian like Pongo. Did I mention that Pongo is a dog? Pongo schemes to bring Roger and Anita together and eventually finds success. When the two humans get married, it appears the dogs do too. Several months later, Anita's old friend Cruella De Vil, a nasty rich woman with strange hair, comes to visit because she has heard Pongo's mate Perdita is having puppies. It is not yet time, but Cruella insists on being informed when the time comes. She shows off her beautiful fur coat and comments on how beautiful the dogs are. Several weeks pass and, at last, the big moment arrives. Nanny the quirky housekeeper comes out to announce to Roger that the puppies have arrived. He asks how many and she replies eight. That's a lot, but Nanny keeps coming out to announce there are more puppies. The eventual total: fifteen. How can this family keep so many dogs? They'll find a way. Cruella comes just in time, offering money for the puppies, figuring the couple cannot afford to care for them all, but it is too soon to take them from their mother. Anyway, Roger does not feel at all comfortable about making any promises to this woman. When the puppies are older, two strange men come to the door insisting the law requires them to inspect the house's wiring. When they leave, the puppies are gone. We later find out Cruella knew these men, and when human attempts to find the puppies fail, Pongo and Perdita communicate with the other dogs in the city. While all of London must put up with the excessive barking (some of which cbmes from dogs we saw earlier when Pongo rejected their owners) the message finally reaches the countryside, where a horse, a duck, and a cat join in the search. The cat remembers hearing puppies at Cruella's rundown old mansion in the country (the name of which sounded very un-Disneylike) and goes there to investigate. The men are there, along with 99 puppies. The question now is how to rescue the puppies before they become fur coats?Overall, this movie was better than the live-action version, but not by that much. I recall the villains being more cartoonish and not as well-acted. On the other hand, I thought Glenn Close's deliciously over-the-top performance was the better one of Cruella, partly because she made Cruella more human and less of a cartoon. I also liked the physical comedy in this version but recall there being more of it in the other movie. All of the acting performances in this version were good, and it sounded like children doing the puppy voices, which was very effective. Naturally, this version focused more on the animals. The animation was quite good but maybe not as detailed as in some early Disney films. I felt like the degree of detail came up short in at least one outdoor scene where we saw the dogs from a distance. Pongo talked most of the time, but it sure sounded like Lassie when he barked (not a problem really; Lassie was a very good actor). Possible concerns for parents: I'm not sure what word I heard one of the puppies say, but the mother chastised such language, and Pongo looked ashamed when Perdita wondered where the puppy could have heard such a word. I mentioned Cruella's old mansion. And a possible SPOILER: as in life, one of the puppies didn't make it, and Nanny had the sad task of bringing in that puppy to Roger. Or DID that puppy make it?Overall, a wonderful job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Childhood Favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't set the plot of "101 Dalmatians" out in any detail, as it is already well-known from this film, the nineties remake and Dodie Smith's original book (a great childhood favourite of mine). Briefly, however, it deals with the theft of a litter of Dalmatian puppies by a woman named Cruella De Vil (an obvious pun on "cruel devil") who wants to turn them into fur coats. The human authorities are baffled, so it falls to the kidnapped puppies' parents, Pongo and Perdita, to track them down and rescue them- along with a lot more Dalmatian puppies acquired by Cruella for the same nefarious purpose. The film is rather different in look from a lot of earlier Disney cartoons, which were characterised by bright, even garish, colours. Here, by contrast, the colour scheme is surprisingly restrained for a film aimed at children. Much of the action takes place either at night or in the depths of a snowy English winter, and the palette reflects this. Black and white are much in evidence (as one might expect in a film about black-and-white dogs), and the other predominant colours are blues, greys and purples. Unusually for a Disney cartoon, the action takes place in a modern-day Britain, and this restrained look may also reflect American ideas of the British as a nation of quiet, restrained, phlegmatic people, qualities exemplified by the human protagonists, Roger and Anita Radcliffe. (In Smith's novel their surname was Dearly, and Roger was an economist or financier by profession, not a musician as he is here). Actually, these qualities are also exemplified by the animal protagonists as well; Pongo and Perdita are essentially Roger and Anita transmuted into canine form, and the various animals they meet in the course of their adventures generally represent recognisable British "types", such as The Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog with a distinctly military bearing. (His friends, or should I say subordinates, are a horse named Captain and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs). One person, however, who is neither quiet nor restrained is the villainess Cruella de Vil. She is perhaps Disney's most memorable villain, a monstrously hyperactive woman with an obsession with fur; she is always seen wearing a fur coat. (In the novel her husband was a furrier, but he does not appear in the film). Her main distinguishing feature is her hair, half-black and half-white. The subsidiary villains are the comically incompetent Badun brothers, Jasper and Horace, whom she employs to steal the puppies.This was one of my favourite films as a child. I was a great animal- lover and generally found that Disney cartoons involving animals, like this one and "The Jungle Book", were a lot funnier and less sentimental than all those boring girly fairy-tales like "Snow White" and "The Sleeping Beauty". I also liked the fact that the action took place not in some fantastic never-never land but in the real England in which I was growing up. My one complaint was that the music (in comparison with something like "The Jungle Book") was a bit forgettable; even though Roger is a songwriter there are only three songs. I recently saw it again for the first time in many years, and I can say that the animals- especially the spotty dogs themselves- are just as endearing, and their adventures just as amusing- as they were in my childhood. Some goofs. Although the Disney organisation seem to have gone to some lengths to make the film as British as possible, one or two errors have crept in. British television programmes were not directly sponsored in the early sixties. A "creek" in British English means a saltwater inlet, not a freshwater stream. The Suffolk landscape is not as hilly as it is depicted here. I will, however, let them off over that girder bridge- they are not common in Britain, but not completely unknown. I will also let them off over the name "Perdita"- strictly speaking, Latin grammar demands that it be stressed on the first syllable, but the actual pronunciation in Britain tends to vary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a while, I enjoyed this movie, but I didn't like the part where Patch was chewing on the carpet. I know that all puppies and dogs do that at certain times, but I didn't like the way his mother got slightly mad at him. I do like the rest of the movie though. I was wondering where Cruella got all those other dalmatian puppies. All those dalmatian puppies were just so adorable. Go ahead and watch this movie if you want, but I like the 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure sequel better. At least in that film, Patch got to be the star and he wasn't as annoying. A dalmatian is the kind of dog I would prefer, but I already have a dog. Overall, this movie deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians is my favorite Disney movie for many reasons.First it's got the mean Cruella DeVil and her henchman Horace and Jasper.Second , it has the two heroic dogs Pongo and Perdita. When Cruella steals their puppies it's to Pongo and Perdita to get them back before she turns them into fur coats.When they arrive to get them it turns out she has 101 of them there. So now , Pongo and Perdita must get all 101 dalmatians out of there before they become fur coats.This movie is filled with suspense , humor , and action.It also has some good songs including "Cruella DeVil" and "Dalmatian Plantation" I'm sure you will find it to be a great movie you'll want to watch over and over again. A perfect 10/10 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hundred and One Dalmatians/101 Dalmatians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was young I used to love this cartoon, a lot more than the live action version with Glenn Close (although that was good too). Two lonely bachelors lived in London, a dog and a man. The dalmatian dog, Pongo, is the centre of attention. One day they both meet girlfriends and get married. Later the female dog, Perdita, has fifteen dalmatian puppies. A horrible woman named Cruella De Vil has terrorised the family and now kidnapped the puppies, with the help of Horace and Jasper, to make a puppy coat for her fur collection. A very good Walt Disney Pictures animated cartoon with some action, some laughs, and some cute puppies. I didn't actually know that Rod Taylor from The Birds did the voice of Pongo! It won the BAFTA Film Award for Best Animated Film. Cruella De Vil was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 66 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film for kids and the whole family...Beautifully directed and beautiful colors with a great cast of vocal talents.. Cruella De vil is one of the creepiest, most hated cartoon characters I have ever seen..A dog and his pet Roger, falls for another dalmatian and her pet Anita. Anita works for the fashion industry and her boss Cruella wants her puppies to make a coat of a new style, a spotted dalmatian one. Of course Roger and Anita wont give the dogs up, so Cruella has two crazy men do her work for her and steal them, along with many more a total of 99 puppies.The dogs send out a barking alert and the barking spreads from London all the way to De vil's house in the woods and then the dogs go out and try to find their pups..I loved a lot of things about this cute little toon. I loved Cruella and her evilness as a villain. I love how they portrayed the dogs as a family and the humans were secondary. I loved the twilight bark that helped them spread the messages to other dogs. I loved the cat that helped out with the rescue, he gave me some good laughs. The color and animation was beautiful. The movie speeds by really fast and didn't get boring...I liked it and give 5 stars out of 10 which is a lot for me to give a cartoon, esp. a Disney one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I personally prefer the book by Dodie Smith!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Genre: Cartoon, dogs, adventure, based on Dodie Smith's book.What happens: So the film is about two Dalmatians meeting with each other. Their owners and the dogs fall in love with each other and the dogs give birth to 15 puppies! However, someone called Cruella DeVil has her eye on the pups?My thoughts: This is a good film, but why did the Disney company have to make this? They could have just left the idea alone and based their next film on their imagination. However, no, they decided to make a film based on Dodie Smith's lovely book.I prefer the book to the film, as I have told you before. The film is good, but it would be much better if it had the following things added or changed: One: In the book, the mother of the pups was called Missis and Perdita was a liver Dalmatian Anita found on the road. I would like the film to have this. Two: The film has less of Pongo and Perdita and more of the pups. In the book, more than half of the story concentrates on the grown-ups. This change in the film annoys me a little. Three: In the book, Lucky is not a sickly puppy. Instead of Lucky being the sickly one, there's a sickly puppy called Cadpig and he isn't in the film!! Why couldn't the Disney company have included Cadpig!?I prefer the book, folks! I rate it 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you would expect from Disney during this time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"101 Dalmations" is probably, in my opinion, one of the weaker films of the golden era of animated Disney films. The colors are drab and look as if hardly any thought was put into them. It also wasn't nearly as enchanting as, let's say "Sleeping Beauty". But all that aside, it really was a good film, much better than any sequel being put out today. The regular theme of good vs. evil is well-used. The characters are something else. Dogs can usually capture an audience right off the bat and this film is no exception. The dog's personalities are wonderful and they are engaging from beginning to end. Cruella de Ville, although the villain, adds wackiness to the film, making it even more fun to watch. The only characters I could have done without were Roger and Anita, simply because not enough was done with their characters to make them absolutely necessary to the film. It seems as though the story could have gotten along just fine without them. All in all, an ok film by story standards, but not quite what you'd expect from Disney during this era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never my favorite Disney animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the series of Disney's animated films. I remember I saw 101 Dalmatians when I was very little and I watched it with my father again and again and he loved it a lot. I was just never really that much into it. I love the original story by Dodie Smith, but the film just lacks something essential. It contains a lot of happy childhood memories for me but I haven't yet figured out the missing piece.The story is familiar to most of us. When Anita and Roger get married, they both have a dalmatian. Anita has Perdita and Roger has Pongo. Soon Perdita starts expecting puppies. Anita's old friend Cruella De Vil pops in and wants to buy the pups to make a fur coat for herself, but fails. She then hires two dumb criminals to do the job for her, but the dogs are smarter than she thought.101 Dalmatians is a real classic but the missing feel's just always there. The best thing in the film are probably the dumb criminals, who are mostly responsible for the funny scenes in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will the fans ever learn to spell "Dalmatian" ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's more than 30 years later, and "dalmations" are still the order of the day. The turn of the century brought us several sequels, both animated and live action, but none are as good as the original or even have the right "feel." Now, this film is not perfect, as the first half is pure gold, but it gets tedious beyond that. The animation is classic and fluid with nicely stylized dogs, even if it's a sketchy in places, and at times you can see the same puppy with the same spots running across the screen over and over. It's also a clashy film in that it has childlike themes (cute puppies, lots of slapstick with the barnyard animals) alongside mature themes (animal slaughter, marital relations, a truly evil villain), so it lacks a certain consistency. The first half is all wonderfully written and sure to please any adult or child: Pongo trying to find a mate for Roger, the cruelty of Cruella, the birth of the puppies, and especially the charming family scenes like when the dalmatians are watching TV. ("Why Patch, where did you ever hear such talk? Certainly not from your mother...") As long as Pongo and Perdita are around, the story stays nicely grounded, and it is lovely entertainment of a type we seldom see anymore. This isn't the modern "Joke Every 2 Minutes" animated film; it's pure storytelling with all sorts of clever detail that never gets old. But then we get to the antics of the animals in the barn, the madcap car chases and the constant scenes of puppies running away, and it loses most of its appeal. Scattered in there are a few good moments (like when the puppies are slipping on the ice), but it's mostly downhill because that adult feel from the beginning is gone. I give this a 6/10 because it's great fun up until the puppies are kidnapped. The design of the dogs is so cute, as is the way they interact and fall in love without being "too human." It's also good to see a villain with some grit; this is from a time when family entertainment was much broader and could appeal to anyone, unlike the dumbed-down fare of today. Overall, a must see just for the experience, but subsequent viewings need only the first half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a monkey lover (not like that you dirty boy! Lol!) I have trouble watching films about animals which don't feature monkeys. After overcoming this initial disappointment, I sat down to watch this Walter Dizzy classic. The story is about a family who have a hundred Dalmation dogs (the ones which look like zebras) and are entering the American version of Crufts- 'The Abe Lincoln Sponsored Stars And Stripes Canine Appreciation Gala Contest Bonanza For Dog Breeders Featuring Exciting Races, Daring Obstacles, Grooming Awards, And Stalwart Obedience Show!' or better known as TALSSASCAGCBFDBFERDOGAASOS! The family hear about a loophole that if someone has 101 dogs of the same breed they automatically win the top prize- the Woofey, and a million one dollar bits. Their dogs are mongrels you see- stupid, ugly, and disobedient. The first part of the show is taken up with the family trying to train their dogs to sit, sleep, run, eat, dance, and sing- this leads to some wonderful hits such as 'Spot The Wrong'un!', 'Who Let The Dogs Out', 'Barken', 'Oh What A Lovely Bone' and 'Get Off My Nice Clean Carpet You Dirty Bitch'. Realising their dogs are useless they try to exploit the loop. Most of the film is taken up by the owners and their lovely children trying to get their puppies to mate so that they reach the target of 101- this led to some questionable scenes which young audiences were not prepared for and the eventual 'disappearances of many of the staff. 40 years later a mass burial site was exhumed where a number of bodies of the staff were found- some with bones inserted in the wrong spot (pardon the puns). Bette Davis spices things up a tad with her portrayal of Cruel Fella D'Evil- a local mobster who went mental when her husband was murdered by the Godfather, Don Niro De Pachinko. She hates the sound of dogs, but loves the taste, and has heard an ancient myth which speaks of 'the flysh of the one hundred and first born pup shall give eternal life to he who shalt feast of it'. She tries to kidnap number 101 (Ploppy) and eat it, but the other dogs set traps up for her around the house, such as messes under the windows, messes on the hallways, and worst of all, messes on the door handles. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it ends by the plot coming to and end and the credits rolling. Although this was filmed about a hundred (and one!) years ago, the graphics and camera-work are very enticing. Disney were the only studio rich enough back then to make their films in colour, which is why this looks so could compared to other rubbish like Castle Blanka. Unfortunately the unsavoury nature of the plot combined with the toilet humour, and the fact that it was basically a remake of the Nazi propaganda film 'Eine hundert und eine Rettungen' or 101 Salvations mean that it makes for inappropriate viewing. Best Scene: Fred Willard's humorous commentary throughout the various stages of the dog trials- it was one of his first appearances, at the age of 42.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the ?worst' film I've seen from Disney's animated department</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hundred and one Dalmatians may be a ?classic' animated film, according to the package it comes in, but I personally felt that there were too many things missing to even call this memorable. First of all the animation was not good (especially if you compare it to Snow White which dates back from 1937) and second of all the story was not that compelling. It was not very thrilling and it was neither as charming nor as funny as I am used of most Walt Disney's animated features. It could certainly be me, but I wasn't moved or charmed by all that puppies at all. I mean they had no real depth and I did not get any chance to grow to like them, before or during their captivity. Despite that this is not total rubbish though. The pacing is adequate and it does not get boring. The thing is, that this is just not up to Walt Disney's standards. I liked Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs much better and therefore recommend you watch that film instead if you want to see a Disney classic. But hey I am a grown up and if you want to start your kids on Disney animation, I guess this is one you can start with. If you just want to see the story of those cute little dogs I suggest you watch 101 Dalmatians or 102 Dalmatians (both live action). I enjoyed both of these films more than this animated ?classic'. Still?6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic dog tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hundred and One Dalmatians is another one of Disney's great cartoon dog stories, complete with an evil villain. Although it is a cute story, I felt that a lot of the middle of the film went a little bit slow and took away from the plot, hence my average rating. However, it's still a classic! Children and dog fanciers will enjoy this film, but it is probably one of those that the average adult would maintain an interest in, unlike Disney's other dog tale, Lady and the Tramp. However, despite the slowness of the plot and the dullness of some of the characters, I would recommend this to children and dog fanciers...and for those of us who share a nostalgic value from watching this film during one of its re-releases when younger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does Disney hate consumers so much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, now we have a new "platinum" (yeah...) 2-DVD edition of "101 Dalmatians". This is a classic Disney film and one of their better efforts. Complaints about the animation style arise from failure to appreciate that it IS a style. It's wonderful for its clarity and lack of clutter and arises from a cartooning style popular during the late '50s and early '60s.It must be admitted that the "good side" characters are a little bland, especially the parent dogs' owners. The Disney people should probably have employed some better voice talent for these people and given them a few interesting crochets ? assuming this wouldn't be too great distortion of the original book.However, Cruella De Vil and her nincompoop sidekicks more than make up for this deficiency. In the 1996 live-action version, the brilliant Glenn Close is even nastier and funnier. However, Betty Lou Gerson, the voice actress here, gives her Cruella plenty of bite and venom. Also making up for so many pallid characters are the "Cruella De Vil" song and Cruella's own number about pelts.On the whole, the film is a good romp. Young children may be apt to take Cruella's threat to the puppies seriously ? although Cruella is painted in such broad strokes that a moderately intelligent 5-year-old will probably realize that she's all smoke and mirrors. Teen-agers and adults will relax and enjoy the fun without worrying.The extras included in this set are on occasion interesting, even meaty. They are some inducement to buy the new edition even if you have one of the old ones. Also an inducement is the restoration work on the film itself, which makes it look as fresh as it did in the theaters. Well, almost (see below).You may at this point wonder at my rating for this offering, since my verbiage seems to be working toward a tepid mid-range score. No such luck. This edition of 101 lies at the bottom of the barrel. I don't know why anyone would want to buy it, much less rent the thing. The reason is its disastrously mutilated visual aspect.The Disney people have had a vile and pernicious prejudice against widescreen aspects from the get-go. The only reason they even make widescreen films for theaters is that's what audiences expect. But they know there are a lot of Luddite fools out there who want films to "fit" their oh-so-1960s little-screen TV sets. And this plays right into their hatred of the widescreen medium. Getting them to put out a DVD with a film showing its original dimensions sometimes amounts to pulling their teeth with rusty pliers. This latest travesty really takes the cake."101 Dalmatians" was filmed at an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. Every single VHS and DVD edition of it that I know of has mutilated the original down to a disgusting 1.33:1 ? with a coy little note that it's been mutilated to "fit your television screen". WELL, IT DOESN'T FIT MINE. Welcome to the 21st Century, stupid stupid Disney people. Yes, people still buy antiquated little screens ? save those pennies, guys! But half the programs on many channels are already in widescreen, and it doesn't fit YOUR screen, ha-ha-ha. It fits mine. Most widescreen films are produced on DVD only in widescreen, and it's about time.If Disney wants to wallow in the last Century, that's their business. However, I don't see why we should enable them by buying their old-fashioned, creakily antiquated products. Once they produce a widescreen DVD of 101, I'll buy it. Used ? that way they don't get my money. Until then, I'll just keep my VHS tape. Yes, Disney, I can still be even more-antiquated-than-thou. As to this issue of the film: what a rip-off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incorrect grammar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A vile creep-ette kidnaps a bunch of little dogs and the parents go out to look for them. Yeah, we know. I liked it when "The Simpsons" did a semi-spoof of "One Hundred and One Dalmatians", with Mr. Burns trying to turn Santa's Little Helper's children into clothing.Speaking of the title, I should identify that the title is incorrect grammar. It should be "One Hundred One", as "One Hundred and One" means 100.1.Speaking of dalmatians, here's something that I learned from the movie "State and Main": they were named after the island of Dalmatia, near Croatia, almost 2,000 years ago. The ancient Romans were also considering naming them after Sardinia. Had they gone with the latter, this movie would be called "101 Sardines"! Anyway, I just like poking fun at big, pompous Disney movies (my reviews of "Snow White", "Cinderella" and "Sleeping Beauty" were even loonier). This movie is cute, but what else really?</fullReview>
